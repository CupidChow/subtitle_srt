1
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,887
(Sangamsan-ro)

2
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:35,418
(The first shoot in the New Year in Seoul)

3
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,258
We're in Seoul.

4
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,227
- Gosh.
- Yes.

5
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,327
- We're in Seoul.
- Isn't the energy different?

6
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:42,848
It's nice to start the shoot in Seoul.

7
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:45,097
It was my first time leaving home in the morning.

8
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:46,197
I left home for the first time in the morning.

9
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,467
- You know what?
- I always left before dawn.

10
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,268
For someone, it's not good to shoot in Seoul.

11
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:50,706
- Who?
- He's from outside of Seoul.

12
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:51,707
That's right.

13
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,406
I left Daejeon at 3am.

14
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:54,636
- At 3am?
- It's the opposite for him.

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,108
- We always left home then.
- That's when we left.

16
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,177
- I feel tired.
- Your eyes look tired.

17
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:00,898
- Yes, I'm tired.
- You also have training.

18
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,177
With whom will you travel...

19
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:04,617
- in Seoul today?
- Right.

20
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:06,117
Please come out.

21
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,917
Who is it?

22
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,528
He's as tall as I am.

23
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:13,928
(Who's the guest with a build like Sang Uk's?)

24
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,928
- Sang Hyeok!
- It's him.

25
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,197
Hello.

26
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:20,697
It's Woo Sang Hyeok.

27
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:22,697
Hello.

28
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,313
I can't believe that I'm seeing you here.

29
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,437
Hello, I'm a national athlete specializing in the high jump,

30
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:27,638
Woo Sang Hyeok.

31
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,448
(I can do it.)

32
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:32,547
(I will go up.)

33
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,777
(During 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo, )

34
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,647
(he jumped 2.35m outdoors.)

35
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,218
(He announced Jumper Woo Sang Hyeok's start.)

36
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,456
(A handsome jumper who overcame the impossible)

37
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,558
(Woo Sang Hyeok)

38
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:50,997
Did he join us today because he knows Sang Uk?

39
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:52,397
What brought you here?

40
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,937
- He asked me...
- I was right.

41
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,066
To come to the show.

42
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,566
I see him often at the training center.

43
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,506
- We're the same age.
- How are you two close?

44
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,808
We're both from Daejeon.

45
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,536
He lived in the neighborhood next to mine.

46
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,277
He was at school in the nearby neighborhood.

47
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:05,278
- They're right next to each other.
- You've known him since then?

48
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,577
- Yes.
- They're in walking distance.

49
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:08,747
I heard about him being good at fencing...

50
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:09,816
and being tall.

51
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,337
I heard about him being tall and being good at track and field.

52
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:15,618
(Two Daejeon boys who are tall and love sports)

53
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:17,756
(Soon, they went beyond Daejeon...)

54
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,058
(and made Korea proud.)

55
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:22,256
We both won scholarships.

56
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,498
- Scholarships?
- Yes.

57
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,828
We have two national athletes.

58
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,467
He was a national athlete.

59
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,197
No, it isn't official.

60
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:31,606
I took the Korean flag,

61
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:33,567
but no one recognized it.

62
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,307
- You just took it?
- Yes.

63
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:38,047
- Korean people recognized you.
- Right.

64
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:39,876
We're with three national athletes...

65
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:40,976
- on the show.
- This will be cruel.

66
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,117
You'll pick your chance card first.

67
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,047
Then Woo Sang Hyeok will choose...

68
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:46,417
two people and form Team Handsome.

69
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,188
Let's play rock-paper-scissors...

70
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,058
and have the loser take the worst card.

71
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:52,656
By playing rock-paper-scissors?

72
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:54,217
- That sounds good.
- That sounds okay.

73
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,398
- Only one person...
- Only one.

74
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:58,566
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Yi Kyung is...

75
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,567
creating variables.

76
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,697
How about this? There are six of us.

77
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:05,767
One person in the minority will go out.

78
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,937
If you play something different, you'll be out?

79
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:07,976
- Okay.
- Is he the loser?

80
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:08,977
- Okay.
- He will be the loser.

81
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,076
- Yes.
- There will be only one.

82
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,797
- When there's one, he's the loser.
- Okay.

83
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:13,207
- Ready or not, - Ready or not,

84
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,118
- rock-paper-scissors.
- rock-paper-scissors.

85
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:17,787
(All 6 of them play paper.)

86
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:19,887
What?

87
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,117
Wait a minute.

88
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,187
(This had a probability of 0.137 percent.)

89
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,226
What happened?

90
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:27,326
- What?
- What's going on?

91
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:28,327
(Is this possible?)

92
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,597
- Did you plan...
- I feel hot.

93
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,768
Did you plan this?

94
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,268
Our teamwork...

95
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:34,868
- All six of us.
- That startled me.

96
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:37,438
I was so surprised by what happened.

97
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:38,847
- Shall we play again?
- Again?

98
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:39,907
This is unbelievable.

99
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:41,207
How did we all play paper?

100
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,407
Is this a good sign?

101
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,278
Let's do it again.

102
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,976
- Go?
- In this case...

103
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,376
(Their eyes are moving secretly.)

104
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:49,417
All right.

105
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,017
Ready or not,

106
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,188
- rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

107
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,857
(A lonely rock among paper)

108
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:00,656
(Sang Hyeok gets the worst card.)

109
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,427
This is...

110
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:03,557
Did you plan this?

111
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:04,626
(What's going on?)

112
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:06,627
Did you plan this? Did they?

113
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,767
- You know what, Dong Hyun?
- That's amazing.

114
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,536
Sang Hyeok planned it with them.

115
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,567
From the start? Did you plan it in the beginning?

116
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,977
Am I the only one who was excluded?

117
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,876
- You were excluded.
- Only me?

118
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,047
When did you plan it?

119
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,177
Before you arrived,

120
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:20,647
the five of us planned it.

121
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:22,077
- Then you played paper.
- Really?

122
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,017
We didn't talk about the second round.

123
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,217
We read the room...

124
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,588
and did it again.

125
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,756
Goodness.

126
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,156
Dong Hyun is unbelievable.

127
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:30,727
I can't believe he dodged it.

128
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,298
This is unfortunate.

129
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,927
I'm sorry for giving the guest a bad card.

130
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,244
(The worst card goes to Sang Hyeok.)

131
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,896
- I know.
- Goodness.

132
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,766
What's the worst card?

133
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,808
- Can he show us?
- Show us the worst card.

134
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,967
- What is it?
- What?

135
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:47,506
- "Wishing happy new year card." - What?

136
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:49,276
"Happy New Year with Handsome Guys..."

137
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:50,776
"in the Year of the Snake."

138
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:51,946
"By taking photos..."

139
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,977
"of any of the members with the characters,"

140
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,716
"complete the phrase."

141
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,617
- What?
- While walking on the streets,

142
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,016
when you see "happy,"

143
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,146
take a selfie with "happy."

144
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,467
- Per character?
- Per character?

145
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,687
How many characters are there?

146
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,657
"Happy New Year with Handsome Guys..."

147
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,696
"in the Year of the Snake."

148
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:08,797
There are 20.

149
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,227
So we have to take 20 photos?

150
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,526
- Twenty selfies.
- By the way,

151
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:14,447
- It won't be easy.
- "some" would be difficult.

152
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,098
How about "the?"

153
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,367
Can't you find...

154
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,807
"Happy New Year" everywhere these days?

155
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:20,836
You can finish in one go.

156
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,076
- In one go? It doesn't matter.
- We can finish it at once.

157
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,077
That's not bad.

158
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,206
I thought it was for each character.

159
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,946
You can also find...

160
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,006
- "Year of the Snake." - It's everywhere.

161
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,117
It's Year of the Snake.

162
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,347
The fact that you can analyze it means that you're smart.

163
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:31,988
- Right.
- This isn't bad.

164
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:34,087
"Handsome Guys."

165
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,918
"Year of the Snake."

166
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,187
Starting with Sang Uk?

167
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,326
(The members pick their chance card.)

168
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,988
Let's pick a good one this time.

169
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:41,597
I won't think hard.

170
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:42,857
I'll switch with Dong Hyun anyway.

171
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:43,928
I won't.

172
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,126
- Why not?
- It's better to keep mine.

173
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,267
(They all picked their cards.)

174
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,506
(Full of meaning)

175
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,537
If I pick you,

176
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:52,607
- would you join me?
- Right.

177
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,178
- Yes.
- Then...

178
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,178
Tae Hyun?

179
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,006
(Always picked first)

180
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,376
Me? Okay.

181
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,816
(Tae Hyun is drafted first.)

182
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:02,817
One.

183
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,417
- The three of us...
- He didn't pick an athlete.

184
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:05,747
I thought that he would.

185
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,017
Are you going to pick Sang Uk?

186
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:09,957
Who would you like?

187
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,456
If you pick Dong Hyun,

188
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,657
we'll get a reattempt card.

189
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:15,897
(Is a reattempt card guaranteed with Dong Hyun?)

190
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:22,196
(Team Handsome won last week by completing the bingo.)

191
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:23,197
(Seosan: Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

192
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:27,007
(As a privilege of winning the bingo, )

193
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:33,207
(they split a reattempt card.)

194
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:35,347
- I have another one.
- The two of us have one.

195
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:36,847
Tae Hyun, it will be amazing.

196
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,248
But there's a downside.

197
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:39,787
Is it slightly hard?

198
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,816
- It's not just slightly hard.
- It's very hard?

199
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,717
It might affect you during the next match.

200
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,727
He'll break your mentality.

201
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,626
I will try to overcome it.

202
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,797
- Will you overcome it?
- Yes.

203
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:51,826
- You want to play with him?
- Yes.

204
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,597
- He likes challenges.
- Okay, it's you.

205
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:54,767
Let's do it together.

206
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,737
- It's you.
- Let's do it together.

207
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,266
- Me?
- Okay.

208
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,707
With me? Okay.

209
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:01,807
(Team Handsome: Dong Hyun, Sang Hyeok, Tae Hyun)

210
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,136
- We will win.
- Come here.

211
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:04,776
Did you abandon your friend?

212
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,407
We were a team last week.

213
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:07,417
What was our motto?

214
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:09,348
- It was no stress.
- Remember?

215
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,016
- That's right.
- No stress.

216
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,217
That's right.

217
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,016
Weren't they a team last time?

218
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,017
Right.

219
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,057
- They were a team last week.
- Right.

220
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:18,027
- We can take revenge on them.
- You're right.

221
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,357
- What?
- Let's go.

222
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,158
- Which card do you have?
- I have a bad one.

223
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,798
- We got it.
- I have a bad one.

224
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,727
Please reveal your cards.

225
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,026
- Okay.
- Show us.

226
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,167
I have a reattempt card.

227
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,566
(Team Handsome, wishing happy new year card)

228
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,667
It's a reattempt card.

229
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,137
And a 30-minute nap card.

230
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,337
A reattempt card.

231
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,277
- Wait a minute.
- Yes.

232
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:39,107
(The reattempt card unites.)

233
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,677
- Okay.
- We have two.

234
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,817
Okay!

235
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,217
- Do they have 2?
- They have 2.

236
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,548
- This is great.
- We work well as a team.

237
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,716
Having two is really good.

238
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:50,928
You picked a good one.

239
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,287
We also have a reattempt card.

240
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:54,526
- I know.
- We're supposed...

241
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:55,927
to have one of them.

242
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:57,966
You'll get to sing karaoke.

243
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,196
Isn't this exciting?

244
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:00,997
- This one is new.
- Mine is really new.

245
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:02,037
- What is it?
- Verifying the truth.

246
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,766
- Verifying the truth card.
- What is it?

247
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,266
"You can ask one question to the other team."

248
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:08,337
"The other team can only tell the truth."

249
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,946
- Is it about the game?
- For example...

250
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:13,048
I may ask about the game.

251
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,376
Or about your family...

252
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,377
We may ask something personal.

253
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:16,517
Will you ask if we're happy?

254
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,187
Is that hard to answer?

255
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,188
(Attacking)

256
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,987
That's not hard to answer.

257
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,588
- Why are your eyes quivering?
- It's a verifying the truth card.

258
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:27,158
Dong Hyun, what's the password...

259
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,396
for your Bitcoin account?

260
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,597
(What's the password for Dong Hyun's Bitcoin account?)

261
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:30,667
It's a verifying the truth card.

262
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:34,038
I'm sorry, but it requires facial recognition.

263
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,168
We have a new verifying the truth card.

264
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,368
A reattempt card.

265
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,977
In Seoul, what's the theme...

266
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,206
for today's race?

267
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,077
This is our first shoot in 2025.

268
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,077
Today's theme is...

269
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,117
people born in the Year of the Snake.

270
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,118
(Handsome people born in the Year of the Snake)

271
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:55,316
You'll meet celebrities or athletes born in the Year of the Snake...

272
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,427
and wish them Happy New Year.

273
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:00,086
Wishing them well will be...

274
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,226
today's Handsome Heritage.

275
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,267
(Find a star born in the year...)

276
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,898
(and wish them Happy New Year.)

277
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,836
Do we have to search for them?

278
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:11,737
Yes, you'll do the search.

279
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,566
(They will ask around.)

280
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,154
How will we find someone born in this year?

281
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,538
You didn't invite them already?

282
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,507
We didn't invite anyone.

283
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,007
(They found an easy way out.)

284
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,346
- If...
- Tae Hyun, don't look it up now.

285
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:25,216
- Don't look it up now.
- We need to...

286
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:28,486
I should know who was born in 1941.

287
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,058
We're doing this for real?

288
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:31,758
This is...

289
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,287
Let's be honest.

290
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,627
How can we contact them when we don't know them?

291
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:36,697
We can message them.

292
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,566
- "Message?" - He's an MZer.

293
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,937
He's an MZer. To someone born in 1941...

294
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,366
We can message them?

295
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,037
They will check the message next year.

296
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,637
I might get a response.

297
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,377
Tae Hyun, you know many people.

298
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,606
- He knows so many people.
- This is good.

299
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:49,907
I knew it.

300
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:50,976
You know many people too.

301
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:53,277
Yes, but Tae Hyun has worked much longer.

302
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,518
He's worked for about 50 years.

303
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,487
I haven't lived 50 years yet.

304
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:01,457
We need to decide the criteria.

305
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,498
People whose names come up when you search on the portal site.

306
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:05,927
There should be information about them.

307
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,496
Sang Hyeok,

308
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:08,996
- you picked a good team.
- Actually,

309
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,667
finding someone born in 2013 will be difficult.

310
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:12,668
- Born in 2013?
- A celebrity?

311
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,637
On the portal site...

312
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,267
(I know someone at home born in 2013.)

313
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,106
Doesn't it count as long as "Cha Su Jin" comes up?

314
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,607
- Or her friend.
- It has to be a celebrity.

315
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:23,507
- A celebrity.
- She was on "2 Days 1 Night" twice.

316
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:24,508
(Cha Su Jin, born in 2013)

317
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,508
Then anyone...

318
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,647
- from "Korea Sings" would count.
- Exactly.

319
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,517
- Let's go to your house.
- This is why...

320
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:30,717
we need criteria.

321
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:32,387
- Turn it on.
- It's not coming up.

322
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,567
There's information about an actress.

323
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,816
It's likely that it's someone you know.

324
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,927
- Inviting them on the show is hard.
- This is hard.

325
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:39,987
When do we have to finish?

326
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,097
You have until 8pm.

327
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,427
Again this week,

328
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,226
the losing team will do an activity in Seoul.

329
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,267
(Today's penalty)

330
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:48,668
For the new year, you'll go...

331
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,137
on a morning hike.

332
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,138
(A hike to see the sunrise)

333
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,077
Climb the mountain early in the morning and watch the sunrise.

334
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:56,237
This is good.

335
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:57,847
Losing will be good, too.

336
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,246
Sang Hyeok just said, "Losing will be good, too."

337
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,316
We'll get to exercise in the morning.

338
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:04,287
Sang Hyeok, on a variety show,

339
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,616
lose that kind of attitude.

340
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,518
(Lose the attitude of wanting to lose.)

341
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,586
Also, for those who wish,

342
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,986
they can get a chance to get their fortune read...

343
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,927
for the new year.

344
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,326
(We'll provide fortune-telling service.)

345
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,966
If we bring that up, they might agree.

346
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,566
- To get their fortune read.
- Yes, it'll be a pretext.

347
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,066
We'll persuade them with fortune-telling.

348
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,236
(We provide a reason to meet.)

349
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,437
Before you leave,

350
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:25,807
let's meet the fortune-tellers.

351
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,008
Fortune-tellers?

352
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,138
Please come out.

353
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,207
Hello.

354
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:33,607
- Hello.
- Hello.

355
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,048
- What?
- Hello.

356
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,647
- Hello.
- Hello.

357
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,846
- Goodness.
- Hello.

358
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,346
- Hello.
- Hello.

359
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,057
- It's been a while.
- We've met before.

360
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,086
- It's been so long.
- Do you know both of them?

361
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,687
Yes, I know them both.

362
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,456
How?

363
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,996
- She's very famous.
- Really?

364
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:52,167
Nice to meet you. I'm Tarot Master Song Yi Ji.

365
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,327
Nice to meet you.

366
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:57,268
(Accurate Tarot Master, Song Yi Ji)

367
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,907
- I told you that your drama...
- Right.

368
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,736
Will be successful with your new role.

369
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,106
It was before "Marry My Husband" got aired.

370
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,627
"Will my new drama become successful?"

371
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,207
She told me yes.

372
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,518
Soon, this drama became a huge hit.

373
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,616
- After it got aired.
- Really?

374
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,287
Hello.

375
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:16,457
I'm a fortune-teller on YouTube named Dohwadore.

376
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:20,128
(An idol in fortune-telling, Dohwadore)

377
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,997
It's Dohwadore.

378
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,627
Dohwadore is also an amazing fortune-teller...

379
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,837
and an interpreter of yin and yang, and five elements of the universe.

380
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,966
Where do you work?

381
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,537
I don't meet people in private.

382
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:33,566
No?

383
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,607
(Disappointed)

384
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,048
You don't do it privately?

385
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,147
Ask him to read your fortune here.

386
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:43,377
I'll give a chance to Song Yi Ji to pick her team.

387
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,387
Which team would you like to join today?

388
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,418
- Team Guys.
- Us?

389
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,258
- Okay.
- We've met before.

390
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,687
Thank you.

391
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,226
Dohwadore will join the other team.

392
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:55,257
You must be happy. Look at him.

393
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,196
Please tell me a lot of things in the car.

394
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,898
Wait a minute.

395
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:00,397
Are we all in one car?

396
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,437
- We should.
- No, you'll travel separately.

397
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,538
That's a relief.

398
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:04,668
We won't be sharing the car?

399
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:05,837
- No.
- Look at Dong Hyun.

400
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,407
(The fortune-teller fan is disappointed.)

401
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,248
- He should ride with us.
- Look at Dong Hyun.

402
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:10,438
How about this?

403
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:13,476
Since it's brought up, if anyone wants...

404
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:16,877
(I'll go.)

405
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,716
I'm sure all of you know.

406
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:22,187
Please look at it as a personal manual...

407
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,687
for this year.

408
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,227
I have blind faith in fortune-telling.

409
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:32,466
I live according to the fortune they tell me.

410
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,866
(I live according to my fortune.)

411
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:34,897
I have blind faith.

412
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,137
Things might work out better that way.

413
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,767
Dong Hyun really does that.

414
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:38,808
I believe in it.

415
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,206
Dohwadore, please tell us...

416
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:44,877
Dong Hyun's fortune...

417
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,907
for the new year.

418
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,946
Actually, I read everyone's fortune before coming here.

419
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:53,317
One of them will get very lucky...

420
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,757
with money this year.

421
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,317
No way.

422
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,027
It's Dong Hyun.

423
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:02,427
(Dong Hyun has a lot of monetary fortune.)

424
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:04,128
You'd better be good to me.

425
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,837
- That's amazing.
- Really?

426
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,537
For 3 years from 2025 to 2027,

427
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:12,336
you'll be lucky with money.

428
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:15,278
You'll get so much money that I don't know if you can handle it.

429
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:17,476
So much that he can't handle it?

430
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,106
- Really? That much?
- He's in trouble.

431
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,476
I'll ask for your PIN number with our verifying the truth card.

432
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:23,477
(Asking his PIN number with the verifying the truth card)

433
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:26,086
- Gosh.
- He'll play carelessly today.

434
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,057
- Goodness.
- That much?

435
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:30,187
- Dong Hyun...
- I've never heard of it.

436
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,687
Personally, I'd say that you'd be luckier...

437
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,086
- with investment than business.
- Investment?

438
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,897
For three years starting this year,

439
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,127
I see a lot of positivity.

440
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,827
I don't think I'm fit for business.

441
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,967
I started many businesses, but they all failed.

442
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,638
I ran a coin karaoke, but it failed.

443
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,137
- Wasn't it in Daejeon?
- Yes.

444
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,076
- In front of that BBQ restaurant?
- Yes.

445
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,378
The one from Daejeon knows.

446
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,476
I ran a coin karaoke, but it failed.

447
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,777
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

448
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,387
- He's been there.
- I was looking for you.

449
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,746
- Over there...
- I heard that you cleaned there.

450
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:01,918
That's where he was.

451
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:04,316
I failed many times, so I gave up on business.

452
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:05,628
All right.

453
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,057
There's no bad fortune.

454
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,826
- Please give me your business card.
- Sure.

455
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,457
- Who's next?
- Okay.

456
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:11,826
Sang Hyeok?

457
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,596
- He's never done it before.
- I've never done it before.

458
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:14,966
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

459
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,706
He told me that he had never gotten his fortune read.

460
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,408
He says that he creates his own luck.

461
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:20,707
He doesn't believe in it.

462
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,576
When you're an athlete, you follow many routines.

463
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:25,908
He trains himself without routines.

464
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,147
- Isn't that impressive?
- That's amazing.

465
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:33,616
Actually, I don't see anything in particular for you this year.

466
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:34,617
However,

467
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,558
in 2028,

468
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,857
there's a bullet point.

469
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:41,427
The year 2028 will be important.

470
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,226
- That's the most important.
- Why?

471
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,566
Right, the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.

472
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,767
- The 2028 Summer Games.
- The 2028 Summer Games.

473
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:46,866
(2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles)

474
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,197
It will be my last chance.

475
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,638
- Really?
- Yes.

476
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:52,736
It will be my third and last Summer Olympics.

477
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:53,867
- Really?
- Yes.

478
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,037
There's a bullet point for that year?

479
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,277
- Yes.
- I got goosebumps.

480
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,377
There will be...

481
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,216
many people around you.

482
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:03,816
There will be many cameras pointing at you.

483
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,687
There's a bullet point,

484
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,716
which shows that you'll dominate the media for a while.

485
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,657
It will be the most beautiful moment of your life.

486
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:11,887
- The year 2028?
- Yes.

487
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,226
It will be my last dance.

488
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:14,496
- Is that so?
- Yes.

489
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:16,897
I have plans all the way up to 2028.

490
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:18,097
Until 2028.

491
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,297
If he gets...

492
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:22,866
an outstanding result in 2028,

493
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,937
their meeting and this clip will...

494
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:27,168
become sacred.

495
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,677
- I must win...
- Yes.

496
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,407
- for Korean track and field.
- That's great.

497
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,378
- I bet you will.
- Sang Hyeok is in blind faith.

498
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:36,417
- Suddenly?
- He refused the fortune-telling.

499
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:37,446
He refused at first.

500
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:38,887
- Isn't fortune-telling accurate?
- Pardon?

501
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,128
Isn't fortune-telling accurate?

502
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,864
- I'm more interested in it now.
- Do you want...

503
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:44,987
Dohwadore to join us in the car?

504
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,997
We can take our time and ask him questions.

505
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,856
Go ahead, Sang Uk.

506
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,696
Please read what you saw.

507
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:53,798
Okay.

508
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,168
- If it's terrible...
- I hope that it'd be bad fortune.

509
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,867
It makes athletes become more competitive.

510
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,207
(Surprised)

511
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,878
I thought that your fortune was unusual.

512
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:08,278
You have a lot of dohwasal.

513
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,377
- Here's what I mean.
- I have a lot of what?

514
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,086
- Dohwasal.
- What's dohwasal?

515
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:15,856
Dohwasal is interpreted as something...

516
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,187
that attracts the opposite sex.

517
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,387
These days, we say that it attracts attention from people in general.

518
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,956
It's also called celebrity fortune.

519
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,504
(Dohwasal is known as a celebrity fortune.)

520
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,696
There are four types of dohwasal,

521
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:27,697
and you have all of them.

522
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:29,938
(The youngest has all types of dohwasal.)

523
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:32,507
(The celebrities are jealous of him.)

524
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,368
Should I change my career?

525
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,506
- No.
- No?

526
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:38,446
- You have to do this.
- You're right.

527
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,507
Goodness.

528
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,476
I almost lost my mind.

529
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,477
(Losing his mind to fame)

530
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,317
I thought you didn't believe in it.

531
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:45,878
Now, you're willing to change your job.

532
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:49,486
It all sounds good. Thank you.

533
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:51,985
Dohwadore read our fortunes.

534
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,457
Next is tarot.

535
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,726
- She's really amazing.
- The tarot reader?

536
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,295
Right away?

537
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:00,026
- For the tarot...
- Come on.

538
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:01,835
- Come back here.
- Stop it.

539
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,236
I didn't get my tarot cards read.

540
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,256
- I haven't done it yet.
- What's wrong with you?

541
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,766
How is this done?

542
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,177
When reading tarot cards,

543
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,545
it's divided into parts.

544
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,776
Family, work, or success of a drama.

545
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,377
Shall I try the TV show?

546
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,515
We're curious about that.

547
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,686
- Isn't it better...
- Still...

548
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,985
- to ask about the show?
- Please ask.

549
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,417
Would you like to represent the show...

550
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,926
- That's a good idea.
- and ask?

551
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,356
I'd like to ask about Handsome Guys.

552
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,495
- The overall fortune this year?
- Yes.

553
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,065
- Will it survive...
- The overall picture?

554
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,627
Until the end of 2025?

555
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,565
- What do I do next?
- Put energy with the left hand.

556
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:38,906
You're representing everyone.

557
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:40,906
- Should I think about the show?
- Yes.

558
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,235
Make eye contact with the director.

559
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:45,377
- While only thinking about it.
- Please focus.

560
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:46,575
Think only about this.

561
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:48,516
- Look at the members too.
- This is good.

562
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,075
Please look at the members.

563
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,245
Tae Hyun, look at us.

564
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,646
(Desperate members)

565
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,086
Goodness.

566
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:55,285
I'll take a look.

567
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,617
Why didn't you look at me?

568
00:18:57,857 --> 00:18:59,755
- He skipped me.
- Did he?

569
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,026
He'd do well without this show.

570
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:04,896
- With your left hand, - My left hand?

571
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:07,127
Please pick three cards.

572
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,496
- Pick them carefully.
- They should be in bright colors.

573
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:13,805
And the final keyword card.

574
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:15,835
- Keyword?
- Pick one more.

575
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,376
(He also picks the final keyword card.)

576
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:18,607
Okay.

577
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,516
- Please.
- Let's take a look at them.

578
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,946
- Please.
- I have a good feeling about this.

579
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:27,947
(With everyone's wishes...)

580
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,226
You got it.

581
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:35,495
- How so?
- Why?

582
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,456
- You got it.
- How so?

583
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:40,095
(They don't know what it is, but they got it.)

584
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,295
Did you see it?

585
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,697
(Clapping of relief)

586
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,735
Don't worry.

587
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:47,367
- It looks very good.
- What?

588
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,535
- These ace cards.
- What?

589
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,406
- There are 4 among 78 cards.
- He picked 2.

590
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,377
He picked two of them. Let me explain.

591
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,745
He picked two lucky cards from the above.

592
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,045
- "Lucky?" - Lucky.

593
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:00,745
- It will be a success.
- There's a lot of potential.

594
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,616
- Really?
- Yes.

595
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,926
It's in the beginning stage.

596
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,226
Page refers to...

597
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:09,096
the young boy who just got started.

598
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,667
It only started recently.

599
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:13,726
In the middle of the year,

600
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,796
new energy comes in.

601
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,995
It's energy from the above.

602
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:21,107
- It means a lot of potential.
- Let's hang in there until midyear.

603
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,036
While being successful, by the second half of the year,

604
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,306
it will find its position.

605
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,177
It might seem like a pilot for now.

606
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:34,216
In the end, it will be one of the main variety shows.

607
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,386
(It'll become one of the main shows on tvN.)

608
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,326
- In the second half?
- Please!

609
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:41,085
Let me explain the keyword.

610
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:43,526
- This doesn't look good.
- Here's what it is.

611
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:48,595
(The back looks quite depressed.)

612
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:50,735
You have to keep failing.

613
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:52,637
(You have to keep failing.)

614
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:56,075
For the TV show...

615
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:58,446
- Director, let me tell you.
- As soon as he heard failure...

616
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:00,567
If it's not working, abandon it without looking back.

617
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:03,876
You need to change things without being attached.

618
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:06,245
- Do you mean the structure?
- The structure of the show?

619
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,856
- It could be the showtime.
- Right.

620
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,585
One of us could be kicked out.

621
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,187
- Changing members is possible.
- Right.

622
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,886
It can mean the change of the organization.

623
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,325
Then who is this?

624
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:16,956
In my opinion,

625
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,766
only two of them will survive.

626
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:20,765
Three of them will be kicked out.

627
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:23,295
- As you can see, the cups are down.
- Three will be out.

628
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,906
Only two of them will survive.

629
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:28,806
It's about survival. Even the members of the show...

630
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:30,735
- Survival?
- can't be regular.

631
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,546
- Is this "Squid Game" too?
- They can't be regular members.

632
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:34,876
Just take two main members.

633
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,845
What's fascinating is...

634
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,515
that I also felt something...

635
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:40,222
- from the second half of the year.
- Don't you feel the energy?

636
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:41,693
- I knew it.
- I was going to tell you.

637
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,016
From midyear to the second half.

638
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,256
Don't forget to tell the directors.

639
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:48,085
We must continue...

640
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,555
- during the first half.
- This should be good.

641
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,026
- Let's hang in there.
- Yes.

642
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,926
- Thank you for the fortune-telling.
- Thank you.

643
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:55,065
Thank you.

644
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,335
Let's work hard this year.

645
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,236
- We can do it.
- Let's go.

646
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,336
The center square...

647
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,476
It's impossible to find someone born in 1941.

648
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:06,607
- Tae Hyun will find someone.
- This one...

649
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:09,075
How will we find someone born in 1953?

650
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,316
The Year of the Snake?

651
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,986
By the way, born in 1941...

652
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:15,686
Kang Bu Ja? This is impossible.

653
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,756
(They also feel lost.)

654
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:21,286
It will be very hard to set out to the first location.

655
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:23,196
Shall I look it up?

656
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:25,697
Gu Bon Gil was born in 1989.

657
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:28,026
Can you call him right now?

658
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,296
Of course.

659
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:30,795
(He calls him right away.)

660
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:31,936
Gosh.

661
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:33,606
(He calls him right away.)

662
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:37,006
(Calling Gu Bon Gil)

663
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,306
Hello?

664
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:40,177
Are you busy?

665
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,515
Where are you?

666
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,516
- I'm in Busan.
- You're in Busan?

667
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,246
(I see...)

668
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,887
- Are they calling people already?
- Yes.

669
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,627
That's incredible.

670
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:55,196
For the Year of the Snake,

671
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:59,066
we have to meet a celebrity born in the Year of the Snake.

672
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:02,736
I called you because you're a celebrity.

673
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,272
- What time will you get back?
- Tonight...

674
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,566
I'll be back before the evening.

675
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,406
Can you call me when you're back?

676
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,607
- Sure.
- Are you going to the sports club?

677
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:14,146
- Yes, that's where I'm going.
- Okay.

678
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,746
- Bye.
- Bye.

679
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:18,746
- We might be able to see him.
- What time is he coming back?

680
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:20,085
Before the evening.

681
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:22,515
Then we'll contact him.

682
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:23,585
(Team Guys continues to call people.)

683
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,157
Everyone is at a shoot.

684
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,857
They're calling people...

685
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,927
right in front of us.

686
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:32,397
Jin Sun Kyu would've been perfect.

687
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:36,366
- Let's call in the car.
- Let's go.

688
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,666
Or we'll overlap. Let's go.

689
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,637
- Is it starting now?
- Let's hurry up.

690
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,305
We need to decide first.

691
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:42,906
Why are they over there?

692
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:45,345
- You can't set out now.
- Really?

693
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:46,545
I said it for fun.

694
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,046
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness!

695
00:23:48,776 --> 00:23:50,116
I almost got tricked again.

696
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:51,477
Happy New Year.

697
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,216
We almost got tricked.

698
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,617
They aren't picking up the phone.

699
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:56,786
Why isn't Yoon Gy picking up?

700
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,986
- He should pick up right now.
- Why...

701
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:03,756
- It's pointless.
- They aren't picking up.

702
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:06,096
No one is picking up.

703
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:08,967
(Jun Hyo Seong?)

704
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,095
Hyo Seong.

705
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:11,707
Were you born in 1989?

706
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:12,937
Yes.

707
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:14,735
- Can you...
- Why?

708
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,736
Appear on a show today?

709
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:20,446
From when to when? I have an appointment tonight.

710
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,916
It's not in the evening.

711
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,197
We're thinking about coming now.

712
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,186
(He feels embarrassed to say it.)

713
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:27,646
We'll stop by and leave.

714
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:28,856
We'll stop by shortly.

715
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:29,985
- Stop by shortly?
- Let me explain...

716
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,486
what we're doing now.

717
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,585
It's the new year.

718
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,095
Happy New Year.

719
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:36,795
I already wished you Happy New Year.

720
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:40,025
There's someone very famous...

721
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:43,835
in the world for tarot. She will be with us.

722
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:45,666
- Really?
- We'll exchange greetings...

723
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,265
with a celebrity born in the Year of the Snake.

724
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,735
If you have any concerns this year,

725
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:51,137
she'll read your fortune.

726
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,976
That sounds amazing.

727
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:54,275
Right? But we would need...

728
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,676
- a space to shoot.
- Right.

729
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,147
Shall we come to your house?

730
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,716
(Going a little far)

731
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,146
We will only shoot...

732
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:04,485
- Is that so?
- enough space to film you.

733
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,026
Shall we come to your house?

734
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:08,456
Can you compensate me for any damages to my house?

735
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,595
Of course. We have some legal tender.

736
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,967
You have some legal tender?

737
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,596
Goodness.

738
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:16,065
Can I be at ease?

739
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,637
Of course.

740
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,766
Please send me your address.

741
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:21,335
(Team Guys' first destination)

742
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,735
Is this where we're going? I can't believe it.

743
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,775
(Team Guys)

744
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,275
(Team Guys)

745
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,545
(Their first destination is confirmed.)

746
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:34,046
Let's go with the one we can...

747
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,716
Inviting someone on the show won't be easy.

748
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:39,626
Shall we call people who are available?

749
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:41,426
I found one.

750
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:43,927
- Did you find it? Call.
- Okay.

751
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:45,995
- Ask if we can go there now.
- Hello?

752
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,226
Hello?

753
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:48,867
- Dong Hyun.
- Hello.

754
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:51,336
Happy New Year.

755
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:53,266
- Happy New Year.
- Yes.

756
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,036
- Happy New Year.
- Hello, Yu Ri.

757
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,707
Hello, Yu Ri.

758
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:00,206
- This is Tae Hyun.
- Tae Hyun.

759
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,167
(Team Handsome calls Yu Ri of Girls' Generation.)

760
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:03,515
We're shooting...

761
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:06,916
- Handsome Guys now.
- Right.

762
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:10,786
We have to meet celebrities born in the Year of the Snake.

763
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,555
We can get your fortune read, too.

764
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:14,786
Don't you like that?

765
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,256
I'd love that.

766
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:18,397
Yu Ri, where are you?

767
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,366
You want to meet up now?

768
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,096
- Yes.
- We have to meet you today.

769
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,565
We have to meet you today.

770
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:24,967
- That's unfortunate.
- Why?

771
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,806
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

772
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,606
- She lives on Jeju Island.
- She's in Jeju?

773
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:29,775
(Yu Ri lives on Jeju Island.)

774
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:32,906
Yu Ri, is there anyone...

775
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:36,216
born in the Year of the Snake among Girls' Generation members?

776
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:39,245
All members except two were born in the Year of the Snake.

777
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,686
- Gosh.
- Really?

778
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:43,256
Is there anyone who loves getting her fortune read?

779
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,226
I'm sure most of them like it.

780
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:47,356
- All of them like it.
- Really?

781
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,326
Is there anyone we can call and meet up right now?

782
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,466
- Tiffany.
- Tiffany?

783
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,765
Is she in Korea?

784
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:56,336
- Do you know her?
- Of course not.

785
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:00,413
- It sounded like you knew.
- I don't know any of them.

786
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:02,036
I'll call you again.

787
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:04,735
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

788
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:06,976
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

789
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:09,575
- We'll call Tiffany.
- My birthday is December 5.

790
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:12,785
- What?
- I was born on December 5.

791
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:13,786
Okay.

792
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:15,186
- Bye.
- Bye.

793
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,187
Happy New Year.

794
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,356
- Bye.
- Thank you.

795
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:18,357
Bye.

796
00:27:18,857 --> 00:27:20,387
I should call him.

797
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:23,495
- Hey.
- Hello, Tae Hyun.

798
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,565
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

799
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:26,667
Right away?

800
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:28,396
- Woo Bin.
- Yes?

801
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,397
What are you doing today?

802
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,966
I have a brief shoot in the afternoon.

803
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,666
- You have a shoot?
- Yes.

804
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,735
- It's just that...
- What...

805
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,637
we're shooting a show.

806
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,476
- We have to meet...
- Okay.

807
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:41,207
People born in the Year of the Snake...

808
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,515
and wish them Happy New Year.

809
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:44,647
Right now?

810
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,387
- I...
- Yes?

811
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,816
Starting at 2pm in Sinsa-dong...

812
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,956
- Starting at 2pm in Sinsa-dong?
- Yes.

813
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:54,756
We'll come and disturb as little as possible.

814
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,596
We won't bring many cameras.

815
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,396
(He laughs first.)

816
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:02,137
- Okay.
- Before we get there,

817
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,437
let's say that someone asks you...

818
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:09,506
to join them on a show.

819
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:12,746
Tell them that you're on Jeju Island.

820
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,717
- Okay.
- Thank you.

821
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,276
Did we find a man born in 1989?

822
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,446
Wait, we should look at the board.

823
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:23,085
Right. If we get a man born in 1989,

824
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:25,216
we'll need someone born in 1977 and 1953.

825
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:26,956
Born in 1953?

826
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,397
Wouldn't it be hard to ask someone born in 1953?

827
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,397
Who was born in 1977?

828
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:33,525
There are Hong Jin Kyeong,

829
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:35,295
Jun Hyun Moo, and Park Hae Il.

830
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,466
- There are many, - Oh Jung Se.

831
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,167
But I don't know any of them.

832
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,266
Do you know Jin Sun Kyu?

833
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:42,907
I know him,

834
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:45,297
but I don't feel comfortable contacting him for this.

835
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:46,776
Just call him.

836
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:48,976
(Just because it isn't his business...)

837
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,276
- Hey.
- Tae Hyun.

838
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,575
You can't be selfish right now.

839
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:54,845
I've never called him before.

840
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,785
Then give me his number.

841
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:59,127
- I'll call him. That's better.
- Goodness.

842
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,857
I can't believe I'm calling him for this.

843
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,295
I feel really bad.

844
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,667
(Feeling terrible)

845
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,096
Early in the morning.

846
00:29:08,697 --> 00:29:09,897
It's 10:30am.

847
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,595
Hello.

848
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,066
Sun Kyu, this is Dong Hyun, Kim Dong Hyun.

849
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,407
- Dong Hyun.
- Hello.

850
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:18,575
- I'm calling so early...
- What's going on?

851
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:22,775
I'm so sorry for calling you out of the blue.

852
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:24,976
- Hello, Sun Kyu.
- Hello.

853
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:26,986
Hello, this is Cha Tae Hyun.

854
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:29,387
Tae Hyun? Oh, hello.

855
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,515
I've only met you...

856
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:33,627
in passing.

857
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:34,756
Right.

858
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:36,556
I'm a huge fan of yours.

859
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:38,727
- You're an actor...
- What?

860
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:40,496
You haven't left yet either.

861
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:42,565
What are you doing?

862
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:43,666
- What?
- No.

863
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:44,795
Goodness.

864
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:45,866
You startled me.

865
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,535
Strange people are here.

866
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,876
- Who is it?
- Go away!

867
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:49,877
Who is it?

868
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,235
- How could you open the door?
- Please don't hang up.

869
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:52,345
- Please don't hang up.
- Who is it?

870
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:53,575
Go away.

871
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,545
- Hello, this is Lee Yi Kyung.
- Go away.

872
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,646
- Who is this?
- Go away.

873
00:29:57,647 --> 00:30:00,416
- Tell me who...
- Please don't hang up.

874
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,186
Close the door now.

875
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:03,555
I thought that they left.

876
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:04,857
Close the door.

877
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:06,485
Please don't hang up.

878
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:07,486
(Screaming)

879
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,156
(Tae Hyun, it's me!)

880
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:12,127
I'll call you back later.

881
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:13,726
- I'm sorry.
- Aren't you close?

882
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:14,795
Darn it.

883
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:16,796
It's my first time talking to him today.

884
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:18,735
- This is very embarrassing.
- I called him for the first time.

885
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,335
This is very embarrassing.

886
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:21,436
Just tell us who it was.

887
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:22,976
- No way.
- Hey.

888
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,075
This is very embarrassing for us.

889
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:26,147
We have to ask people around, so go away.

890
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:28,345
- Stop disturbing us.
- Why aren't you leaving?

891
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:30,515
- Goodness.
- Getting in the car isn't cheating.

892
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:31,677
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

893
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,046
- Get out.
- Okay.

894
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,485
- You have...
- Get out.

895
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:36,585
A place to go.

896
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,085
We don't have a place to go right now.

897
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,926
We don't. We still need 30 minutes.

898
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,055
- I'm jealous of you.
- Get out.

899
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,656
We can get out for now.

900
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,926
I'll tell you outside.

901
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,196
- All right.
- I'm leaving...

902
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:48,595
with Tae Hyun's mobile phone.

903
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,595
(I'm leaving with Tae Hyun's mobile phone.)

904
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:51,966
- Oh, come on.
- No.

905
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,636
Give me back my mobile phone.

906
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:54,805
- You should go.
- Give it back.

907
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:55,835
- Tae Hyun.
- You should go.

908
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:57,035
- What are you doing?
- The mobile phone...

909
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,075
We're kidding.

910
00:30:58,076 --> 00:30:59,775
- I don't have my mobile phone.
- It's in the front.

911
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,676
Tae Hyun, this is mine.

912
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:03,146
Then give me this.

913
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,376
I don't have anyone to call. All right.

914
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,917
- Bye.
- Give it back.

915
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,316
My phone is missing.

916
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,086
Take back your phone now.

917
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,586
Give me back my mobile phone.

918
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:14,755
(It's fun to tease Tae Hyun.)

919
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,026
What's wrong with you?

920
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:17,995
Goodness.

921
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,565
Let's not break the rules.

922
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,697
What's wrong with them?

923
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,967
Lock the doors now.

924
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,535
Call him back.

925
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,136
- I have to apologize.
- Goodness.

926
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,505
(While feeling apologetic, )

927
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,146
(they call Jin Sun Kyu for the 2nd time.)

928
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:31,805
Dong Hyun.

929
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,076
- Sun Kyu, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

930
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:37,216
(A sudden situation where he can't help but laugh)

931
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:38,416
I'm so sorry.

932
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,446
We have to meet celebrities born in the Year of the Snake...

933
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:44,986
and have their fortunes read.

934
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:46,256
I see.

935
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:48,585
Dong Hyun had your phone number,

936
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,956
so I told him to call you right away.

937
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:52,266
I apologize, Sun Kyu.

938
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,627
It's okay, Dong Hyun.

939
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,466
When I heard about you,

940
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,467
I told him to call you right away.

941
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,065
- I'm a huge fan.
- Right.

942
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,805
It's nice to get to talk to you like this.

943
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:02,806
Of course.

944
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,036
By the way, are you home?

945
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:10,617
I'm getting ready now. I have a meeting today.

946
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,186
I'm leaving home soon.

947
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:15,815
Could you spend 15 minutes with us?

948
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,086
(How about just 15 minutes?)

949
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,826
We have time until 8pm tonight.

950
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:21,755
I'm meeting with a director.

951
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:22,956
(In a difficult situation)

952
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,197
That's why.

953
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:26,626
I have a meeting with a director at 12pm.

954
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:28,526
Then you shouldn't be late.

955
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,636
- Right.
- That's unfortunate.

956
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:32,035
(They also fail to invite him.)

957
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,906
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

958
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,937
Thank you, Sun Kyu.

959
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:37,775
Thank you for calling me.

960
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:40,005
Of course. Thank you, and I'm sorry.

961
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:41,746
Thank you.

962
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,617
Their schedules overlap.

963
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,386
I'll keep searching.

964
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:51,187
(Team Guys started to move.)

965
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:54,585
This is very difficult to find.

966
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:55,996
(They keep calling many people.)

967
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:57,796
Many of them aren't...

968
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:00,467
picking up their phone.

969
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:04,036
Can you tell me celebrities born in 2001?

970
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:05,496
Maybe I know one.

971
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,607
Should I download ChatGPT?

972
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,476
It will give you a list of everyone.

973
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,846
(Sang Uk AI instead of ChatGPT)

974
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:15,005
There are so many. Be careful.

975
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,346
I'll try.

976
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:19,286
Singer Lee Dae Hwi.

977
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,816
Singer Jeon So Mi.

978
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,516
Actress Lee Soo Min.

979
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,056
Actress Chu Ye Jin.

980
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,756
Athlete Cha Jun Hwan. Cha Jun Hwan?

981
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,356
Don't you know all the athletes...

982
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,697
or at least their friends?

983
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:31,826
Yoon Gy needs to pick up...

984
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,397
to contact people on ice.

985
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,337
- On ice?
- Keep reading the list.

986
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:38,266
Lee Dae Hwi from "Produce 101."

987
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,067
How many times did you say his name?

988
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:43,535
I mentioned Actress Lee Soo Min earlier.

989
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:44,675
Actress Lee Soo Min.

990
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:48,476
He keeps repeating the names.

991
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:49,716
Are you a detective agency?

992
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,776
"Names of celebrities."

993
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:53,547
I'll play the YouTube video.

994
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:56,987
It will tell you the names.

995
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,285
Starting with women, Jeon So Mi.

996
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,555
(She appears again.)

997
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,256
- Isn't he repeating himself?
- No.

998
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,325
This is the first one. Lee Soo Min.

999
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,066
He's still repeating.

1000
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,195
Actress Lee Soo Min.

1001
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:11,036
He'll repeat their names for 30 minutes today.

1002
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,766
Singer Chaeryeong of ITZY.

1003
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,366
Chaeryeong?

1004
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,977
Tell her that I'm her fan.

1005
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:19,175
Singer Ryujin of ITZY.

1006
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:20,506
I love ITZY.

1007
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,917
We don't know any of their numbers.

1008
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:25,917
- Singer Remi of Cherry Bullet.
- Sang Uk.

1009
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,015
- Why don't you...
- Singer...

1010
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:29,456
send a message to all of them?

1011
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:31,556
"Hello, this is Fencer Oh Sang Uk."

1012
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:33,757
- Act insane and do it.
- Singer Yoon Kyung.

1013
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,926
You have a lot of dohwasal.

1014
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:38,966
Today, you'll attract people's attention.

1015
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,695
Shall I use my dohwasal?

1016
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:43,836
Send a message to all of them from your account.

1017
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,096
That's our solution.

1018
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,635
- "Hello." - Dohwasal?

1019
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:49,106
"I'm number one fencer in the world."

1020
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:51,035
"I'm the king of fencing, Oh Sang Uk."

1021
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,207
"For 2025, the Year of the Snake,"

1022
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:54,905
"I send my greetings,"

1023
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,715
"and I have a lot of dohwasal."

1024
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,147
"We can read your tarot cards."

1025
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,885
(I'm going to block you.)

1026
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:02,186
Seriously...

1027
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,256
(The video is over without any result.)

1028
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:06,527
Are we searching people born in 1977?

1029
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:07,957
Yes, in 1977.

1030
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,856
- Didn't you say you know Rhymer?
- I know him.

1031
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:12,595
- Call him right now.
- Rhymer.

1032
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:14,127
- Was he born in 1977?
- Yes.

1033
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,166
- I know him.
- Rhymer...

1034
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,167
The number you dialed doesn't exist.

1035
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:19,606
Wait a minute.

1036
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:21,606
(Goodness, my head...)

1037
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:22,707
Hey.

1038
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,476
- Hey.
- Why didn't he contact me?

1039
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:25,976
Aren't you close to HANHAE?

1040
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,245
Yes, I can call him.

1041
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:28,745
Call him and ask for Rhymer's number.

1042
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:29,817
Okay.

1043
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,745
Why don't I have his number?

1044
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:33,515
I saw him two days ago.

1045
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:35,015
He must have changed it.

1046
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,215
(HANHAE should pick up.)

1047
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,986
- Hello?
- Hello, HANHAE.

1048
00:35:37,987 --> 00:35:39,587
What are you doing?

1049
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,086
Dong Hyun.

1050
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,926
It sounds obvious that you're on a show.

1051
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:45,595
(He got caught.)

1052
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,627
- You're awful.
- That's exactly right.

1053
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,797
You would never call me personally.

1054
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,236
I'm so sorry.

1055
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,337
Hello, HANHAE.

1056
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,575
I'm with Cha Tae Hyun.

1057
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,106
- HANHAE.
- We're on the same team.

1058
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:01,246
Did Rhymer's number change?

1059
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:04,345
Yes, his number changed recently.

1060
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,546
- Really?
- Recently?

1061
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,286
Can you send us...

1062
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,886
Rhymer's number?

1063
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:10,487
I'll send it in a text message.

1064
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:12,257
Okay. I'm sorry.

1065
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,325
Dong Hyun, when you call me from now on,

1066
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:15,896
please sound more natural.

1067
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,396
I apologize.

1068
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:18,756
- I got it.
- Thank you.

1069
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:19,995
Thank you.

1070
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:21,397
- Bye.
- Bye.

1071
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,366
(Sighing)

1072
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:24,466
This is difficult.

1073
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:26,366
I'll call him.

1074
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,107
(Sang Hyeok leaves to buy some coffee.)

1075
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:30,376
Let's see.

1076
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,635
(Calling Rhymer...)

1077
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:32,945
(with the number received from HANHAE)

1078
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:34,552
- Will he pick up an unknown number?
- Okay.

1079
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:36,377
- Hello?
- Dong Hyun.

1080
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,216
Do you have my number?

1081
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:39,786
Yes.

1082
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,746
Hello, Rhymer.

1083
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,087
This is Cha Tae Hyun.

1084
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,285
Hello.

1085
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,586
(Saying hello politely)

1086
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:49,595
Rhymer and I went to the same high school.

1087
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:51,055
(Rhymer is Tae Hyun's junior.)

1088
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:52,576
Do you like getting your fortune read?

1089
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:55,866
I'm a Christian.

1090
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:59,306
- I'm not a huge fan.
- I see.

1091
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,336
Getting your fortune read isn't important.

1092
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:02,365
Right.

1093
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:04,675
By the way,

1094
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:08,206
we have to meet you in person.

1095
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,615
When? Right now?

1096
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:11,016
- Yes, right now.
- Well...

1097
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:15,086
I was just about to head to the office.

1098
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,655
- The office?
- What should we do then?

1099
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:17,956
Can we go see you?

1100
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:19,156
Can we visit you?

1101
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:21,056
If it's okay with you...

1102
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,095
Sure thing, then.

1103
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:24,356
Really?

1104
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:25,495
(They finally have a place to go!)

1105
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,126
- Thanks!
- No way.

1106
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,265
We'll go see you...

1107
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:30,965
- and wish a happy new year.
- Then,

1108
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,905
Rhymer, hold on.

1109
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:35,876
- You know the artist Lee Dae Hwi.
- Sure.

1110
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:37,635
He's signed with your agency.

1111
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:40,046
That's right. He's a member of AB6IX.

1112
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,817
He was born in 2001.

1113
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:45,046
Was he also born in the year of the snake?

1114
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:46,647
- Yes.
- Yes. Would it be possible...

1115
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:51,116
- Yes?
- I hate to ask Dae Hwi this,

1116
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:55,857
but could you call him out for us?

1117
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:57,897
I'm sorry!

1118
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,965
It'd be great to meet Dae Hwi as well.

1119
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:02,995
(Killing two birds with one stone)

1120
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,865
I'll try calling him then.

1121
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,635
It's okay if he isn't free,

1122
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:08,837
but we'll be right over there.

1123
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,576
- Sure thing.
- Thanks again.

1124
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:12,277
Thanks.

1125
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:13,876
No way.

1126
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,516
We have good chemistry, don't we?

1127
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:18,277
Hey.

1128
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:20,086
(Sang Hyeok just got back with the beverages.)

1129
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,785
- Sang Hyeok!
- Are we good?

1130
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,655
- We're good!
- Really?

1131
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,385
- We're good!
- We got through to Rhymer.

1132
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,055
- Really?
- Let's go to Yeoksam-dong.

1133
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,456
We asked him to be on the show,

1134
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:32,296
and then we got one of his artists...

1135
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:34,365
Lee Dae Hwi who is signed with his agency...

1136
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:35,526
- was born in 2001.
- Really?

1137
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:36,695
We asked to meet Dae Hwi too.

1138
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:37,696
(Aiming one entertainment agency leaves us in awe!)

1139
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:38,766
Then first...

1140
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:40,406
Let's head to Yeoksam-dong.

1141
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:41,966
Let's go.

1142
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:44,736
Tae Hyun and I seem to get along.

1143
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:45,737
(They're running behind, but they move out with excitement!)

1144
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:48,446
We're off to meet a woman born in 1989.

1145
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:50,246
How about Woo Bin for the guy?

1146
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:53,187
He's one of the famous actors born in 1989.

1147
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:54,715
- Hello?
- Kim Woo Bin.

1148
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:56,817
When I got into the other car earlier,

1149
00:38:57,556 --> 00:38:58,917
I saw something.

1150
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:00,956
They had names written down.

1151
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:03,126
(Seung Ho got a good look.)

1152
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:04,825
- Tae Hyun...
- Let's hijack him.

1153
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:05,897
Tae Hyun...

1154
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,595
Should we hijack him?

1155
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,696
Let's hijack him.

1156
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:11,765
He's a good friend,

1157
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,635
but I'm sure he'll lean towards his senior.

1158
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:16,076
(I don't think I can beat Tae Hyun.)

1159
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:18,036
Did they all agree not to take my calls today?

1160
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:20,377
Was a warning issued?

1161
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:21,876
Why isn't anyone picking up?

1162
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:22,877
(Emergency Alert: Lee Yi Kyung is calling those...)

1163
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:23,922
(born in the year of the snake, so we advise you not to pick up.)

1164
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,845
(Nervous)

1165
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,986
(Anxious)

1166
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:31,056
(Worried)

1167
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:32,116
(He picked up.)

1168
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:33,986
- Woo Bin.
- Hey, Yi Kyung.

1169
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:35,687
I'm working at the moment.

1170
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:37,555
- Sure.
- Right.

1171
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:41,296
I'm only asking just in case.

1172
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,596
Did Tae Hyun call you?

1173
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,297
- Tae Hyun?
- Yes.

1174
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:47,136
No. Why?

1175
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:49,437
Then...

1176
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:50,805
(He plays dumb for now.)

1177
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,376
Do you know Handsome Guys,

1178
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:55,777
a variety show starring me and your favorite actor Tae Hyun?

1179
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,276
Of course I know it.

1180
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:58,446
Really?

1181
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,987
What do you say to me...

1182
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:03,286
reading your fortune for 2025?

1183
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,417
What?

1184
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:06,986
(Chuckling)

1185
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,187
My fortune for 2025?

1186
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:09,596
Yes. Well,

1187
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:13,127
I can read your fortune for some fun and stuff.

1188
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,095
I bet you agreed to be on the show already.

1189
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:16,296
(He leads Woo Bin on once more.)

1190
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,237
No, but today,

1191
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:22,135
I'm on Jeju Island, Yi Kyung.

1192
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:23,405
(He says the line that was given to him.)

1193
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:24,437
Won't you be back today?

1194
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:27,675
I'm afraid I'm here on business.

1195
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,916
(The three fall for his masterful acting.)

1196
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,076
I'm here for a shoot.

1197
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:33,116
- Really?
- Yes.

1198
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:35,916
- Could you be...
- What now?

1199
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,786
Lying to me because they asked you to?

1200
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:42,187
(Laughing)

1201
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:44,227
Of course not.

1202
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,567
Of course. Woo Bin wouldn't lie to me.

1203
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,526
(Woo Bin, come on.)

1204
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:50,667
There's something off about your laugh though.

1205
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:53,365
(He's not a good liar.)

1206
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:55,305
Tell me this, then.

1207
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:57,977
You said you were on Jeju Island.

1208
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:00,176
Can you swear that...

1209
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:02,746
on your own name and reputation?

1210
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,416
Is that absolutely necessary?

1211
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:07,486
Just tell me that. I won't question it...

1212
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:08,945
even if you tell me otherwise.

1213
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:11,615
Can you swear on your own name that you're on Jeju Island?

1214
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,126
(Before they know it, they show doubt.)

1215
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:14,726
Is this what you're asking...

1216
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,487
after calling me for the first time in 2025?

1217
00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:18,326
It's upsetting.

1218
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:22,226
- We...
- You're making me swear as well.

1219
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:24,796
Just tell me if you're on Jeju Island.

1220
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:25,965
- Jeju Island...
- It's upsetting.

1221
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,266
You're not there, are you?

1222
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:30,376
- I'm on Jeju Island.
- But?

1223
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:32,976
(Utter silence)

1224
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,906
I'm busy and must hang up.

1225
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:40,846
Sure thing. We'll interpret that to the best of our ability.

1226
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:42,546
(His laughter says it all.)

1227
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,817
I get the gist of it.

1228
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:48,227
- We'll talk soon.
- Sure.

1229
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,526
Got it.

1230
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,526
(They quickly end the call.)

1231
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,397
He might not be on Jeju Island.

1232
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,666
He's not there. I saw what they had written down.

1233
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,667
He lied to me because he felt guilty.

1234
00:41:58,337 --> 00:41:59,337
We...

1235
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,175
Why don't we give up and eat something delicious?

1236
00:42:04,176 --> 00:42:06,007
Why are you so quick to give up these days?

1237
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:08,977
We could win the bingo game.

1238
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:11,377
This is too challenging.

1239
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:14,987
Anyway, I'm at Hyo Seong's.

1240
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:18,457
There's a great sumac chicken place in Oksu-dong.

1241
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:23,156
(Having lost some of their vigor)

1242
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:26,695
(Oksu Station)

1243
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,126
(They arrive to meet the first handsome celebrity...)

1244
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:29,566
(who was born in the year of the snake.)

1245
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,937
(Knocking)

1246
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:33,937
Hi, Hyo Seong.

1247
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:35,265
I had to urgently do my makeup.

1248
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,106
It looks great. I thought you had been to a salon.

1249
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:39,546
I can't believe you invited us to your home.

1250
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:40,877
It's like a film set.

1251
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:43,317
- I know. This is incredible.
- No way.

1252
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:45,215
Behind you.

1253
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:47,386
(The real owner of the house came out to greet them.)

1254
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:50,216
- Hi.
- It's a dog-like cat.

1255
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,986
(It wins over the guests with its cuteness.)

1256
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,987
It's adorable.

1257
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:57,857
How can it look at the camera and don't mind other people?

1258
00:42:58,457 --> 00:42:59,696
It's so cute.

1259
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,237
Here.

1260
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:04,666
How can a cat be this way?

1261
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:05,736
(Gratefully, the homeowner isn't scared at all.)

1262
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:07,107
It's a dog-like cat for sure.

1263
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:09,336
- Is it a dog-like cat?
- It is.

1264
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,506
- How can it be like this?
- It must come out...

1265
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,675
and check everything.

1266
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:12,905
- What's its name?
- Bling.

1267
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:14,345
- Bling? Is it your only cat?
- Bling.

1268
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:15,845
I have three, but they hid somewhere.

1269
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,147
- You have three?
- Yes.

1270
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:20,946
Hyo Seong isn't one to allow things like this.

1271
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:23,715
But she runs a YouTube channel,

1272
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,285
and I helped her out once.

1273
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:26,726
That's right. He helped me out.

1274
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,926
I'm sure that's why she couldn't turn me down today.

1275
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,526
I didn't film that YouTube video to use as leverage someday,

1276
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,425
- but...
- Right, I get it now.

1277
00:43:33,426 --> 00:43:34,995
- Anyway, I'm grateful.
- That's one of the reasons.

1278
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:36,167
I'm happy to be on the show.

1279
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,236
Right. Well, I'm truly grateful.

1280
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:39,266
Don't be like that.

1281
00:43:39,507 --> 00:43:41,237
You helped me out too, remember?

1282
00:43:41,707 --> 00:43:45,507
(The group with masterpieces that had us waving our arms around)

1283
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:48,107
(The leader and main dancer of Secret)

1284
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:51,877
(She also released masterpieces such as "Goodnight Kiss" and "Find Me.")

1285
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:54,987
(Soloist Jun Hyo Seong)

1286
00:43:57,056 --> 00:44:00,687
(By playing various characters, she even made it as an actress.)

1287
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:04,195
(Singer and actor Jun Hyo Seong)

1288
00:44:04,196 --> 00:44:06,425
- First, I'm grateful.
- Don't say that.

1289
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,066
Thanks for this. Right now, the two...

1290
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:09,396
- are extremely awkward.
- I know. Oh, dear.

1291
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,557
What's your MBTI personality?

1292
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,035
(There's no better icebreaker than talking about personalities.)

1293
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:13,736
- I'm a true introvert.
- Same here.

1294
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,436
- What about the rest?
- I'm an ISTP.

1295
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:17,076
- You're an ISTP?
- That's right.

1296
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:20,345
- I'm an INFP.
- An INFP?

1297
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:23,015
She's a true believer of MBTI personalities.

1298
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:24,016
What about you?

1299
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:25,147
I'm an INFJ.

1300
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:26,656
And among them is me, the extrovert.

1301
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:30,715
Here, I have gathered a group of introverts.

1302
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:32,115
Why don't you go ahead...

1303
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:33,555
and greet the viewers since it's a new year?

1304
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:34,626
What's the main camera?

1305
00:44:34,627 --> 00:44:35,857
- Over here.
- Right.

1306
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:39,666
Hello, I'm greeting you in the Year of the Blue Snake.

1307
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,067
It's Jun Hyo Seong.

1308
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,897
There you go. By the way, your house...

1309
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,635
- Isn't it pretty?
- To the point that...

1310
00:44:47,636 --> 00:44:50,606
Was it decorated to fit a particular concept?

1311
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,737
I wanted it to be colorful.

1312
00:44:51,977 --> 00:44:54,876
Back in the day, I loved everything to be white.

1313
00:44:54,877 --> 00:44:57,176
But then I wanted more color in my life.

1314
00:44:57,576 --> 00:45:00,345
I decided to fill every inch with a color,

1315
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:01,546
so I got it done myself.

1316
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:03,087
- The land too?
- Yes.

1317
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:04,586
We usually call it a floor or tiles.

1318
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:05,587
- These are decorative tiles.
- I see.

1319
00:45:05,587 --> 00:45:06,587
These days,

1320
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:07,726
they sell tiles with sticky backs.

1321
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:09,286
- Were they stuck on?
- Yes.

1322
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:14,027
I wanted to decorate my house with colors, so...

1323
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:18,995
(She decorated every inch of the house.)

1324
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,465
(Let me help you.)

1325
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:24,636
(A house filled with all her favorites)

1326
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:29,246
(The aesthetically-pleasing Hyo Seong's house)

1327
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,515
(The three barged into the house decorated with love.)

1328
00:45:31,516 --> 00:45:34,445
- Just so you know, this is awkward.
- I know.

1329
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:36,486
I know this is hard to believe, but you're older than me.

1330
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:37,987
- I see.
- You're older than me.

1331
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:40,825
- Why would that be hard to believe?
- When Yi Kyung...

1332
00:45:40,826 --> 00:45:42,426
first called you,

1333
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:44,995
I thought you'd say we couldn't come over to the house.

1334
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:46,765
- Is that what you thought?
- That's what I thought.

1335
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,196
That's how people usually are.

1336
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:51,596
I'm wondering why I'm in Jun Hyo Seong's living room.

1337
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,436
That's going through my mind.

1338
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:55,117
It was never on your list of things to do.

1339
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:58,036
Anyway, I'm trying to stay alert and awake.

1340
00:45:58,377 --> 00:46:00,207
Sir, are you usually this quiet?

1341
00:46:00,446 --> 00:46:01,675
- Me?
- Sir?

1342
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,276
I'm not "sir" to you.

1343
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:05,745
- Why would you...
- How old do they seem?

1344
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:07,546
Try and guess their age.

1345
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:08,885
(A quiz show that could be her ruin)

1346
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:11,086
Just call it as you see it.

1347
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,126
We should be ready for some heartache.

1348
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:14,626
- Was he born in 1988?
- In 1988?

1349
00:46:14,627 --> 00:46:15,627
What about him?

1350
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:17,425
(He's already hurt from what she guessed.)

1351
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:18,426
(He's ready for the heartache.)

1352
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:20,066
- In 1990.
- In 1988 and 1990?

1353
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:22,797
- He said he was younger than you.
- Right.

1354
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:25,595
You know I was born in 1988, right?

1355
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:26,606
- Yes.
- You were born in 1989.

1356
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:28,805
- You think he's my age.
- Yes.

1357
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:29,977
Tell her yourself.

1358
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:31,877
It's better that way.

1359
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,977
I was born in 1996.

1360
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:36,945
Oh, no. Gosh, I'm sorry.

1361
00:46:36,946 --> 00:46:38,046
It's because he's tall.

1362
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,916
- Yes, it's because of your height.
- It's okay.

1363
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,316
- If that's the case, I'm grateful.
- I mean it.

1364
00:46:42,317 --> 00:46:43,456
Next, you thought...

1365
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:44,777
- he was born in 1990.
- In 1996?

1366
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:45,916
- Goodness.
- Yes, in 1996.

1367
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:47,127
Tell her when you were born.

1368
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,127
I was born in 1995.

1369
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:50,656
What...

1370
00:46:51,056 --> 00:46:52,426
These days, why is everyone...

1371
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,925
There's something wrong about us.

1372
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:57,066
- Gosh, no.
- It must be because you're tall.

1373
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,765
- Yes, their height.
- So people like them...

1374
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,707
I hate to call you "people like them,"

1375
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,836
but even after a few years,

1376
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:05,336
these kind of people still look the same.

1377
00:47:05,337 --> 00:47:06,606
- Exactly.
- Right.

1378
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:08,877
- They become the ultimate winners.
- Right.

1379
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:11,776
It's because we're tall.

1380
00:47:11,777 --> 00:47:13,115
(It's going nowhere.)

1381
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:14,946
- This is nothing.
- Really?

1382
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:18,385
Anyway, we... Right.

1383
00:47:18,386 --> 00:47:20,187
- You're running a YouTube channel.
- Yes.

1384
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:21,956
But many people haven't seen you.

1385
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,256
Tell them what you've been up to.

1386
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,195
I've been preparing for a while.

1387
00:47:25,196 --> 00:47:27,465
Since this business is having a hard time,

1388
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,426
my work kept getting postponed.

1389
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,047
So, I've been preparing all this time.

1390
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:33,336
I'm trying...

1391
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:36,006
to release an album this year.

1392
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:39,236
How did you two first get to know each other?

1393
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:40,745
We did "I Am Solo" together.

1394
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:41,846
We were the hosts.

1395
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:43,146
"I Am Solo."

1396
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:46,146
Now, Hae Na has taken Hyo Seong's place.

1397
00:47:46,147 --> 00:47:48,146
We got close, so I went on her channel too.

1398
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:50,116
I didn't know she'd be available today.

1399
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:51,756
She is always in touch,

1400
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:53,555
though she replies to the texts slowly.

1401
00:47:53,556 --> 00:47:55,925
You're the one who is slow. I respond quickly.

1402
00:47:55,926 --> 00:47:57,966
Right. She replies quickly and wakes up real early.

1403
00:47:58,727 --> 00:47:59,825
She is an early bird.

1404
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:01,472
What's your daily routine like these days?

1405
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:02,765
You wake up early.

1406
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:03,965
- Yes.
- Like when?

1407
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:05,736
- Around 6am?
- Exactly, right?

1408
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:07,306
Yes. I wake up when the sun is up.

1409
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,067
I feed the cats.

1410
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:10,506
I have breakfast.

1411
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:12,277
I go out and work out.

1412
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:14,306
I come back home and wash.

1413
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:16,716
I clean and do the dishes.

1414
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:18,446
Then I lie down.

1415
00:48:18,516 --> 00:48:20,187
I wake up early and go to bed early.

1416
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:21,516
- That's...
- When do you sleep?

1417
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:22,716
I sleep when the sun sets.

1418
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,457
I'm in my bed by 8pm.

1419
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,825
When I turn the lights off,

1420
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:28,886
I fall asleep around 9pm or 10pm.

1421
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:30,626
Your daily routine...

1422
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:32,556
- is the same as Oh Jae Soon's, - Okay.

1423
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:34,365
- a person I know.
- Really?

1424
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:35,595
She's my grandmother.

1425
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:36,766
(She's my grandmother.)

1426
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:38,936
She's 94 years old.

1427
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:41,066
- She wakes up and ladles rice.
- I'm going to live long.

1428
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,666
She sleeps when the sun goes down.

1429
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,036
She wakes up when the sun rises.

1430
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:47,445
I've been keeping myself busy today.

1431
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:48,706
In fact, without work,

1432
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:50,115
a celebrity is jobless.

1433
00:48:50,116 --> 00:48:51,576
- We're jobless.
- Yes.

1434
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:56,146
So, the year 2024 is over, and it's 2025, the Year of Snake.

1435
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:58,457
It's your year, the Year of Blue Snake.

1436
00:48:58,516 --> 00:49:00,527
Do you have a goal for this year?

1437
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,526
I always have health issues, so...

1438
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:04,656
Bling.

1439
00:49:05,156 --> 00:49:07,527
- You want to go up.
- Many people are here.

1440
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,896
- You're a star cat, aren't you?
- Amazing.

1441
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:13,536
You want to be on camera, don't you?

1442
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:15,437
Did you take a look?

1443
00:49:15,937 --> 00:49:18,336
- Okay. Come here.
- She's here.

1444
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:20,052
Does she bump her head when you put your head close?

1445
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:21,106
(He doesn't know about cats at all.)

1446
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:22,476
You have to be gentle.

1447
00:49:22,477 --> 00:49:24,715
- She likes her head patted.
- She's an active kind,

1448
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:26,277
- right?
- Yes, right.

1449
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,286
Get your hair closer.

1450
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:33,187
She loves it.

1451
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:35,686
- She's so pretty.
- As you all may know,

1452
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:37,027
this is an eight-hand thing.

1453
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:38,957
Eight hands are patting her right now.

1454
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,496
Gosh. She loves it.

1455
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:44,236
Gosh. She likes people. She's like a person.

1456
00:49:44,237 --> 00:49:45,937
You liked it, didn't you?

1457
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:50,135
- What were we talking about?
- Right. Let's get back to it.

1458
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:52,737
- Yes. Right.
- In 2024...

1459
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,175
Were you talking to me?

1460
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:56,746
Yes. That is right.

1461
00:49:56,846 --> 00:49:58,476
- You had a good year in 2024.
- Right. In 2025,

1462
00:49:58,477 --> 00:50:00,615
- my goal is...
- What is your goal?

1463
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:03,957
To get more fit since I always have health issues.

1464
00:50:04,187 --> 00:50:05,563
And to do something I've never done before.

1465
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:08,487
Those are my New Year's resolutions.

1466
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:10,756
When the tarot reader is here,

1467
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,825
- you can ask that person.
- You can ask about it.

1468
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:16,166
Ask the tarot reader what this year will be like for you.

1469
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,535
The more specific your question is, the better.

1470
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:21,766
(Time for Tarot Reading)

1471
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,066
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1472
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:24,406
- Hello.
- Our tarot reader.

1473
00:50:24,937 --> 00:50:26,905
I think I've seen you on YouTube.

1474
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:29,445
She's famous in show business.

1475
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:30,822
(She's a celebrity in show business.)

1476
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,715
Have you done tarot reading before?

1477
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:33,885
- I love it.
- I see.

1478
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:35,147
(I love it.)

1479
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:38,856
What should I read into first?

1480
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:41,885
- First, I'm thinking...
- Yes.

1481
00:50:41,886 --> 00:50:44,656
About releasing an album this year.

1482
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:48,396
- When is a good time to do it?
- I see.

1483
00:50:48,397 --> 00:50:50,695
With your left hand, put some energy into the card...

1484
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:52,495
- about what you said.
- Think about the album.

1485
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:54,067
- Yes.
- Think about the album.

1486
00:50:54,707 --> 00:50:56,506
(Serious)

1487
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:58,477
- Yes. We'll take a look.
- Okay.

1488
00:50:59,207 --> 00:51:02,245
Now, we'll divide the year into three, early, mid, and late.

1489
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:05,046
- Should we divide it into quarters?
- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarter.

1490
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:06,692
- Spring, summer, fall, and winter.
- Yes.

1491
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:10,087
- You know about the periods well.
- Yes.

1492
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,816
- You know the basics.
- I'm a Type J.

1493
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:14,486
You know how this works.

1494
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:16,486
She believes the MBTI test and tarot cards blindly.

1495
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:19,227
(She is an aficionado of non-scientific stuff.)

1496
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:21,196
- Let's read the cards now.
- Yes.

1497
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:23,126
(This is a non-scientific method, )

1498
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,566
(and the reading is from a personal opinion.)

1499
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,636
Spring, summer, fall, winter.

1500
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:31,036
(Stirred up)

1501
00:51:31,076 --> 00:51:32,305
- First, - That card doesn't appear often.

1502
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,606
- Is everything looking good?
- Yes.

1503
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,345
They have the bright, gold energy.

1504
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:36,675
So does the keyword card.

1505
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,396
(Even the keyword card has a golden light.)

1506
00:51:38,477 --> 00:51:40,147
You should release an album this year.

1507
00:51:40,587 --> 00:51:41,816
- Really?
- It'll be a plus for you...

1508
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:43,047
when you do it this year.

1509
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:45,356
- Now, let's see which season.
- Yes.

1510
00:51:45,357 --> 00:51:47,386
The best season is summer.

1511
00:51:48,227 --> 00:51:50,055
Summer fits you the best.

1512
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:51,726
- This time.
- Why are you startled?

1513
00:51:51,727 --> 00:51:53,407
- You had that season in mind, yes?
- Yes.

1514
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,296
In summer... This means you hit the peak.

1515
00:51:56,297 --> 00:51:58,437
This is a pentacle, which symbolizes money.

1516
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,636
You can earn fame and money at the same time.

1517
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:04,976
If it delays a little,

1518
00:52:04,977 --> 00:52:06,805
- winter will be good.
- Delay it further.

1519
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:08,106
Yes. As for this card,

1520
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:09,845
it means victory.

1521
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:12,216
It represents a completion or a result.

1522
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:15,285
So, do it either in summer or in winter.

1523
00:52:15,286 --> 00:52:16,686
(She recommends summer or winter.)

1524
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:18,885
I really was thinking about doing it in the summer.

1525
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,786
So, I thought of preparing for it without rushing.

1526
00:52:21,857 --> 00:52:23,495
And you say summer is the best.

1527
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:24,896
- Yes.
- I wondered what I'd say...

1528
00:52:24,897 --> 00:52:26,765
- if the result is bad.
- Me too.

1529
00:52:26,766 --> 00:52:28,196
- Can we try another one?
- Yes.

1530
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:30,396
- I don't plan on dating someone.
- Okay.

1531
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,495
I recently had my fortune told,

1532
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:34,837
and I was told I can't work when I'm seeing someone.

1533
00:52:35,507 --> 00:52:37,006
- I see.
- So...

1534
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:39,035
- Should we check your dating life?
- Yes.

1535
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,846
Yes. We'll see how it will go.

1536
00:52:41,147 --> 00:52:42,377
Pick the cards.

1537
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:46,377
She's serious this time.

1538
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:48,285
- You got me.
- You said you don't want to date.

1539
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:50,486
- You got me.
- Of course she does.

1540
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:52,285
- You never know.
- Right.

1541
00:52:52,286 --> 00:52:53,686
- Let's see how it will go.
- Gosh.

1542
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,456
(The first card looks ominous already.)

1543
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:58,156
Gosh.

1544
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:00,595
- That person's dead.
- We see a tragedy right away.

1545
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:03,536
There's nothing at all. Also,

1546
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:06,095
you don't have the will to do it either.

1547
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:07,736
- You're just lying down.
- How did you know?

1548
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:09,906
- You're lying at home.
- You're right.

1549
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:12,576
This is more than a blind faith now.

1550
00:53:13,406 --> 00:53:15,575
Now, it's even deeper than faith.

1551
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:17,546
She knows about me so well...

1552
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:20,047
- when she speaks.
- Right.

1553
00:53:20,446 --> 00:53:23,317
- You can look outside Korea...
- Get out of it a little.

1554
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,156
Come back to reality.

1555
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:28,686
- Well, the tarot reading is...
- Right. I got it.

1556
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:31,026
- It's just a reference.
- You're too excited.

1557
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:32,555
I'm so excited.

1558
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:34,995
- Dopamine overload.
- Except for dating life...

1559
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:38,035
You should focus more on work this year.

1560
00:53:38,036 --> 00:53:39,737
- Okay.
- Let's focus.

1561
00:53:40,337 --> 00:53:41,805
- Ma'am, thank you again.
- Right.

1562
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:43,805
- You save another soul again.
- Yes.

1563
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:44,905
(You saved her.)

1564
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:46,336
- Get some good energy.
- Thank you.

1565
00:53:46,337 --> 00:53:48,546
- Ma'am, thank you so much.
- Yes. I'll root for you.

1566
00:53:48,547 --> 00:53:51,175
- You're the best.
- Right.

1567
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:53,486
- I should get a fee from her.
- Exactly.

1568
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:55,245
Yes. I want to give her something.

1569
00:53:55,246 --> 00:53:58,416
- Give her my bank account.
- Wire 300 dollars to her.

1570
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:00,925
I want to give her something. Is there anything you want?

1571
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:02,086
(Escaping the overheat)

1572
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,926
- We'll solve a quiz together now.
- A quiz?

1573
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,166
What kind of quiz is it?

1574
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:09,407
- It's impossible to predict.
- It's on various matters.

1575
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:12,166
- It's like "You Quiz on the Block?" - "You Quiz on the Block" is...

1576
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,437
That is a noble one.

1577
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:17,035
- That's a very sophisticated one.
- Right.

1578
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:19,035
Here, we can't predict anything.

1579
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:20,976
- It's unpredictable.
- Is it? I want to get it right.

1580
00:54:20,977 --> 00:54:22,745
Seung Ho...

1581
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:25,046
Since we don't know what the quiz is about, he wrote what we said.

1582
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:26,575
"Hyo Seong believes the tarot reading blindly."

1583
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:28,086
(Seung Ho's keypoint notes)

1584
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:29,486
"Summer album recommended."

1585
00:54:29,487 --> 00:54:31,016
"No dating at all."

1586
00:54:31,987 --> 00:54:33,727
- Seriously.
- Yes.

1587
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:35,532
I'm sorry, but before you take the quiz...

1588
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:37,856
- Yes.
- The other team used the nap card.

1589
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,056
What is that?

1590
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:41,596
If they are ones born in 1977 or 1989...

1591
00:54:41,826 --> 00:54:44,337
Gosh. They know a lot of people too.

1592
00:54:44,437 --> 00:54:45,667
Should we make them sleep?

1593
00:54:45,996 --> 00:54:47,707
Tae Hyun, make them sleep.

1594
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,306
We have to make them have a nap early on.

1595
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:53,176
- No matter what.
- We'll use the nap card.

1596
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,175
They're not feeling sleepy and they haven't eaten either.

1597
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:57,046
(They make them sleep as they might go for the same bingo squares.)

1598
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,316
Gosh. It's crazy.

1599
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,086
You'll get in the car and sleep for 30 minutes.

1600
00:55:01,087 --> 00:55:02,715
- We'll meet up later.
- Yes.

1601
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,785
Thank you again.

1602
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:04,816
- Let's meet for the quiz.
- Seriously.

1603
00:55:04,817 --> 00:55:06,515
I know it's out of the blue,

1604
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:08,256
- but we'll go and take a nap.
- Okay.

1605
00:55:08,257 --> 00:55:10,026
- Sleep tight.
- We'll have a nap.

1606
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:12,026
- I'll see you later.
- We have to hurry to get going.

1607
00:55:12,027 --> 00:55:13,326
You're right. Goodness.

1608
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:18,066
(The nap time starts.)

1609
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,187
- We have to look further.
- What? What's this sound?

1610
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:21,837
It's here.

1611
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,736
Sorry. Only I can tilt back the seat.

1612
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:26,237
(He gets ready to get a proper nap.)

1613
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,846
I'm sorry.

1614
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:29,575
I'm sorry about lots of things.

1615
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,745
(Cozy)

1616
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:32,116
Gosh. What's with the song?

1617
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:36,417
When the nap card is used against me,

1618
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:38,917
it's very demotivating.

1619
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:42,227
- It's for 30 minutes.
- It's sagging.

1620
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,396
They need to change the song.

1621
00:55:45,397 --> 00:55:47,567
(Have a good nap.)

1622
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:51,636
Gosh. It feels like everything is going well.

1623
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:55,107
We're off to a good start with Rhymer.

1624
00:55:55,466 --> 00:55:57,436
Now, we've arrived...

1625
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,976
- at Brand New Music.
- It's my first time here.

1626
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:01,106
We've secured a person...

1627
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,806
- born in 1977!
- Yes.

1628
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:04,916
They'll know that we're here...

1629
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:06,316
- to meet him.
- Yes?

1630
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:07,846
- Really?
- Where is the CEO's room?

1631
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:09,587
CEO.

1632
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:10,887
Right. It's on the fifth floor.

1633
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:14,127
It's cool. I want something like this.

1634
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:16,925
You can. You'll be good with money this year.

1635
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:19,496
- That's my dream.
- You'll make a lot of money.

1636
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:22,966
- What happens if we don't use this?
- What?

1637
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,035
We have to use it. We have to take a photo of it.

1638
00:56:25,036 --> 00:56:26,297
Let me write it down.

1639
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:28,436
- Right. We had that.
- This...

1640
00:56:28,437 --> 00:56:30,413
"In the Year of Blue Snake, with Handsome Guys..."

1641
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:34,277
Is there a poster of Handsome Guys?

1642
00:56:35,346 --> 00:56:36,805
It says it here.

1643
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,945
Where is the poster of Handsome Guys?

1644
00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:40,746
The "together" here. Is the letter too small?

1645
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:42,187
It doesn't matter.

1646
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:43,916
It says, "Together."

1647
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,656
- Together.
- Together.

1648
00:56:45,786 --> 00:56:48,856
For 160 years, this elevator was together...

1649
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:50,833
It's been 160 years since they've been together with us.

1650
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,617
- Did you take it well?
- We can magnify it.

1651
00:56:53,227 --> 00:56:54,397
We took it.

1652
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,066
- There are many "together." - Dong Hyun, you found it well.

1653
00:56:57,067 --> 00:56:58,596
We'll find many "together."

1654
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,195
We're done with "together."

1655
00:57:00,196 --> 00:57:02,067
Is there "Some" somewhere?

1656
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:05,836
- "Some" for "Handsome." - We need "Some."

1657
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:07,076
It's so hard to find it.

1658
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,647
Is he here?

1659
00:57:09,477 --> 00:57:11,576
He's here.

1660
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,785
(As soon as they enter the CEO's room, they see...)

1661
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:16,786
Hello.

1662
00:57:17,156 --> 00:57:18,385
Gosh. You're really here.

1663
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:20,015
- Happy New Year.
- Hello.

1664
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:21,456
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you.

1665
00:57:21,457 --> 00:57:23,756
I'm sorry for contacting you out of the blue.

1666
00:57:23,757 --> 00:57:24,796
- Hello.
- Sorry.

1667
00:57:24,797 --> 00:57:26,325
He's the high jumper.

1668
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:27,466
- Hello.
- Right. Gosh.

1669
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,267
- Happy New Year.
- You've come to my humble place.

1670
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:32,396
It's not humble. It's so nice.

1671
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:34,366
The company looks awesome.

1672
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:40,746
(Korea's 1st-generation rapper and producer)

1673
00:57:41,647 --> 00:57:43,945
(From a big daddy of Korean hip-hop...)

1674
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:46,777
(filled with testosterone...)

1675
00:57:47,946 --> 00:57:49,445
(to a CEO of a company...)

1676
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:51,285
(who raises young artists like a big brother)

1677
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:52,515
(The master of low body is here.)

1678
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:53,757
(He's coming.)

1679
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:57,457
(1977, Male)

1680
00:57:57,797 --> 00:58:00,695
(Handsome Snake 2: Head of hip-hop, Rhymer)

1681
00:58:00,696 --> 00:58:03,066
If Dong Hyun came alone, it'd be nothing.

1682
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,536
But Tae Hyun is here too.

1683
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:07,905
A person a year older than you is the scariest.

1684
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:08,906
- Right.
- Seriously.

1685
00:58:08,907 --> 00:58:10,676
I'm so glad we're on the same team.

1686
00:58:11,176 --> 00:58:12,776
Who would have we called without you?

1687
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:14,445
- We picked the right guy.
- Yes. True.

1688
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:16,006
How long have you run the company?

1689
00:58:16,007 --> 00:58:17,007
It's been so long.

1690
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:19,946
It's my 22nd year this year.

1691
00:58:20,946 --> 00:58:22,087
That's amazing.

1692
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:23,986
It's been so long.

1693
00:58:23,987 --> 00:58:27,256
In fact, besides the three major companies,

1694
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,825
- Right.
- barely any company...

1695
00:58:28,826 --> 00:58:31,026
- has a long history like us.
- Gosh.

1696
00:58:31,027 --> 00:58:32,427
- It's been so long.
- That's true.

1697
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,495
I just did it for a long time.

1698
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:35,726
- No.
- Don't say it.

1699
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,796
Steadiness is the best.

1700
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:40,166
I've been holding out steadily.

1701
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,765
You have what it takes to hold out.

1702
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:42,805
- Of course.
- Right.

1703
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:43,837
I'm just lying down.

1704
00:58:44,306 --> 00:58:47,207
In the beginning, right out here...

1705
00:58:47,576 --> 00:58:50,207
By coincidence,

1706
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:54,346
I started my company in the basement there.

1707
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:57,356
I stayed there while paying 800 dollars for rent.

1708
00:58:57,357 --> 00:58:59,756
- And it has become this big.
- After a while,

1709
00:58:59,757 --> 00:59:03,385
I get to buy this building for the company.

1710
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:05,356
- Gosh.
- On my own,

1711
00:59:05,357 --> 00:59:08,126
I've been making humble achievements.

1712
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,195
- They're huge achievements.
- It's a big success.

1713
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:11,495
- It's a huge building too.
- In your life,

1714
00:59:11,496 --> 00:59:14,837
was there a most memorable year?

1715
00:59:15,107 --> 00:59:18,106
In the end of last year,

1716
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,877
I thought a lot.

1717
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:23,305
- The year 2013...
- The year 2013?

1718
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:26,147
Was especially good when I thought about it.

1719
00:59:26,516 --> 00:59:29,147
When we released songs from our company,

1720
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,316
the songs topped the chart all the time.

1721
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,215
That was a matter of course back then.

1722
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:35,226
- That happens.
- "We'll top the chart again."

1723
00:59:35,227 --> 00:59:36,655
Our artist took first place...

1724
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,055
by beating another artist from our company.

1725
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:40,296
It was when hip-hop was big here.

1726
00:59:40,297 --> 00:59:42,965
Right. It was the time when hip-hop...

1727
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:45,265
was beloved by many people in Korea.

1728
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:46,495
It was when "Show Me the Money" was popular.

1729
00:59:46,496 --> 00:59:49,035
Our company was at the heart of it.

1730
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:52,036
So, the year 2013 was special to me.

1731
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:55,006
If I can go back to that year,

1732
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,906
I would have done even better.

1733
00:59:57,076 --> 00:59:59,445
You don't know what will happen in 2025.
