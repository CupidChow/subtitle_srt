00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:31,226
(Is it pork neck...)

2
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,887
(or pork shoulder?)

3
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,926
(Noodles...)

4
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,726
(or rice?)

5
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,527
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:42,296
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:43,936
(and regret)

8
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:45,937
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,807
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,877

(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:59,947
(It starts again today.)

13
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,456
(Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

14
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:05,226
(Seoul's Current Temperature at 38℃)

15
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:07,187
(Marking the Highest Temperature in Early July)

16
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:08,927
The view is to die for...

17
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:10,657
as well as the weather.

18
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,937
Today's weather is unbelievable.

19
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:18,437
My watch currently reads...

20
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,007
(Grunting)

21
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:24,336
- He's angry.
- Yes, he's angry.

22
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,506
Today's weather is incredible.

23
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,647
(The rascal is excited by the sweltering heat.)

24
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:30,076
Right. Sang Uk, our youngest, got the penalty today.

25
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:32,347
I think this will be our last penalty.

26
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,747
It's very intense.

27
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:38,027
(How does Sang Uk look?)

28
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,226
- He's from "Cats." - I'm sorry.

29
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:41,326
(- It's a cat. - I'm sorry!)

30
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:42,327
It's very intense.

31
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,327
(Meow)

32
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,356
I'm late.

33
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:45,366
(He transformed into a cute cat.)

34
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:46,596
I was at a musical rehearsal.

35
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,597
(He turned into a cute cat in a musical.)

36
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:49,036
- I'm sorry for being late.
- I mean...

37
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:51,066
(It matches him perfectly.)

38
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,566
The musical "Cats?"

39
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:53,637
- Yes.
- It's...

40
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,106
It's not easy to get cast in that musical.

41
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,107
- Right.
- Congratulations.

42
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:57,176
It's an international musical.

43
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:58,776
- I play Tree Number 1.
- Tree Number 1?

44
00:01:58,777 --> 00:01:59,876
You play a tree instead of a cat?

45
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,177
- A cat that's attached to a tree.
- A cat that's attached to a tree?

46
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,447
Isn't it your face time wearing stage makeup?

47
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:05,817
It's definitely my first time.

48
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,616
How does it feel?

49
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,616
It doesn't feel bad.

50
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:10,657
However...

51
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:12,486
(However?)

52
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:13,826
I'm looking forward to seeing...

53
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:15,727
- the makeup next week.
- There might not be next time.

54
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:16,896
What?

55
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,167
(What?)

56
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,127
I have a feeling that this is the last time.

57
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:21,496
What?

58
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:22,497
(What did you say?)

59
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,537
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,307
He doesn't care about what the viewers think.

61
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,807
This is just the beginning.

62
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,336
Only the one who got the penalty can say that.

63
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:31,447
"This is just the beginning."

64
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:33,276
Shall we hurry...

65
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,876
- and invite the guest now?
- The weather is hot.

66
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:37,277
Our guest might turn around and leave on their way up.

67
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,717
Because of the hot weather?

68
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:40,687
The wind feels warm.

69
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,616
(Safely)

70
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,587
(The guest appears with a large fan.)

71
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,627
(The appearance of today's guest makes them laugh.)

72
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:51,896
- Today's guest is Lee Su Ji.
- Hello.

73
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:53,027
I'm your fan.

(Lee Su Ji with 1,000 faces)

81
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,656
Here is Su Ji.

82
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,216
- Did you take down a ventilator?
- Hello.

83
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:18,286
- I brought this.
- Okay.

84
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,627
I'll hold it for you.

85
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,256
Su Ji, please introduce yourself.

86
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:24,726
Yes, I'm Lee Su Ji.

87
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,196
It's nice to meet you.

88
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,396
(Yes, I'm Lee Su Ji.)

89
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,766
- I did it like in a music video.
- I'm your huge fan.

90
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,837
- I'm your fan too.
- I'm a big fan of yours.

91
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,336
- I've been wanting to meet you.
- Me too.

92
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,436
(Welcome, Su Ji.)

93
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,876
You're the first female guest...

94
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:36,976
- to appear alone.
- The first one to appear alone.

95
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,346
- I'm the first to appear alone?
- Yes.

96
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:39,806
Since this is Handsome Guys,

97
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,576
I'll act like a guy.

98
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:43,077
- Your face also changed.
- Exactly.

99
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,687
I should act like a guy.

100
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,386
- A guy?
- Yes, I'll be like a guy.

101
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,116
(The thousand faces change depending on the situation.)

102
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,587
Think of me as your little brother.

103
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,986
Are you acquainted with any of our members?

104
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:54,327
No, I'm not acquainted with them.

105
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,226
I can only look this way...

106
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,827
- during the shoot.
- Why?

107
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,966
He was my first love.

108
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,966
- Me?
- Yes, I'm serious.

109
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,006
- How so?
- When?

110
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,436
When people ask me about the best movie of my life,

111
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,536
- I always say...
- "My Sassy Girl?"

112
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:08,707
Yes, "My Sassy Girl."

113
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,376
The best tteokbokki of my life is...

114
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,577
also Yupki Tteokbokki.

115
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:15,446
This movie helped me go through my teenage years.

116
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:16,716
- Goodness.
- It developed my sensitivity.

117
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,816
It really touched my heart.

118
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:19,817
- We're guys.
- Tae Hyun.

119
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,517
- We're guys.
- It really softened...

120
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,017
my heart.

121
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,127
- My goodness.
- It's all thanks to him.

122
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,457
You look like someone from "The Wild Days."

123
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:32,866
(Suddenly turning into Su Ji of Wild Days)

124
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,126
Don't move so much,

125
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,396
or you'll sweat.

126
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,766
She's hotter than today's weather.

127
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,766
My first love is drying under my arm.

128
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,466
- This feels different.
- Doesn't it?

129
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,806
Yes, it's embarrassing.

130
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,336
(Su Ji goes back to being a young girl.)

131
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:45,346
By the way, have you watched our show?

132
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,346
I saw a lot of your YouTube Shorts.

133
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:48,916
- I'll explain why he asked.
- Okay.

134
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,076
We do quizzes or play games...

135
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:52,686
- to decide who pays.
- It's us who pay.

136
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,617
I'm making money these days.

137
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:56,457
So it's okay...

138
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,256
This is how our rascal is.

139
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,886
- What is he doing?
- Our rascal...

140
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:01,926
- Is he photosynthesizing?
- Yes.

141
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,057
Really?

142
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:06,096
(The rascal is broken due to the scorching heat.)

143
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,467
By the way,

144
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:08,536
where are we going?

145
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:09,596
Let me explain.

146
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,897
You're the real estate agent.

147
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,266
Today, we're...

148
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:14,306
in Haebangchon.

149
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,707
- Haebangchon?
- Yes.

150
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,506
- We're looking down at it.
- Yes.

151
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,146
It's located at the foot of Mount Nam.

152
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,246
(Today's Menu Recommendation Area: Sinheung Market in Haebangchon)

153
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,377
(Haebangchon)

154
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,446
After the liberation,

155
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,646
refugees from North Korea...

156
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:29,016
and compatriots returning from overseas settled here.

157
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:31,017
That's why this place is called Haebangchon.

158
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:34,026
(The hillside village at the foot of Mount Nam...)

159
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:37,297
(where displaced people settled, Haebangchon)

160
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:42,336
(There's an old market that the residents loved.)

161
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,766
About ten years ago, the buildings and the streets...

162
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,467
in the market were renovated.

163
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,936
It became what it looks like today.

164
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,576
(This space was reborn and received international acclaim.)

165
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,946
Some say that because it looks like a back alley in Europe,

166
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:55,516
it became a popular spot among the zoomers.

167
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:56,776
It's known for its sudden rise...

168
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,246
- of popularity.
- That's great.

169
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,486
It's one of the hippest places.

170
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:03,886
(Now it's the hottest global culinary destination in Seoul.)

171
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,926
(Sinheung Market)

172
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,786
What are we eating today?

173
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:08,896
Today, we'll be going...

174
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:11,227
to Sinheung Market in Haebangchon.

175
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,096
That's where we're going.

176
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,366
(Su Ji keeps sweating in the scorching heat.)

177
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,297
Who wants to introduce the restaurants today?

178
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:17,797
- Today...
- I will.

179
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,806
(He takes some tissue indifferently...)

180
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,106
(and wipes off Su Ji's sweat.)

181
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,476
Where are we going today?

182
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:26,877
(He wipes off Su Ji's sweat.)

183
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:32,887
(My first love?)

184
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:38,626
I believe

185
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,327
(Too absorbed)

186
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,197
(Laughing)

187
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,056
- What's on the menu?
- He's wiping off her sweat.

188
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:45,066
(Although you aren't here)

189
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,467
She might put out the fire with her sweat.

190
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:48,937
(Watching a famous scene in the 1st row)

191
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,367
- Gosh.
- I believe

192
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:52,866
Where are we going today?

193
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,337
Today? All right.

194
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:56,806
I'm sure none of you heard of it.

195
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,076
It's Spanish honey cod.

196
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,006
- What?
- "Honey cod?"

197
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,576
Do you understand? Can you imagine it?

198
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:04,417
It's the codfish that we know.

199
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,516
- It must include honey or syrup.
- Something like that.

200
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:08,957
Since it's called honey.

201
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,316
It must be Spanish-style.

202
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:12,386
Spanish-style?

203
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:13,557
Senorita.

204
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:15,227
Margarita.

205
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:17,996
Exactly. That's one of the restaurants.

206
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,766
(The first LMR, Spanish honey cod)

207
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,096
- What else?
- The other one is...

208
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,666
a Chinese restaurant in the US.

209
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,036
- Yes?
- It's American-style Chinese food.

210
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,037
It's one of my favorite restaurants.

211
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,906
Yes, I like it.

212
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,336
This is Jamie's Mom.

213
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,607
- Yes.
- Yes.

214
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,976
- American Chinese?
- Yes.

215
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,877
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

216
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:38,076
(Made with a mix of Chinese cuisine and America)

217
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:41,117
(American-style Chinese food)

218
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,956
(Spanish honey cod versus American-style Chinese food)

219
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,727
Why don't you pick first, Su Ji?

220
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:48,456
Where are you going?

221
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,657
(Where are you going?)

222
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,397
- Okay.
- Like that?

223
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,867
Which one sounds better?

224
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,797
- I can eat anything.
- How?

225
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,496
The important thing is...

226
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,066
that I'm sweating so much.

227
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,207
I have to eat high-calorie food so I don't pass out.

228
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:02,376
So you want Chinese food?

229
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:04,176
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

230
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:05,506
Let's do this.

231
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,546
The three of us...

232
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,946
will go together.

233
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,946
The three of you go together.

234
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,716
I'd like to feed Tae Hyun while I eat.

235
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,186
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

236
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,256
In a short period of time,

237
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,916
how many characters did you play?

238
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:17,956
It's because there are...

239
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,586
- many foreigners in Haebangchon.
- My gosh.

240
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,826
We met about four people.

241
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:23,197
- This is nice.
- Including "The Wild Days."

242
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,396
I want to see that character the most.

243
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:25,696
- Which one?
- The one...

244
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,196
who lives in Gangnam.

245
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:28,667
- I'd like to see her.
- "Don't do that."

246
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,397
"Don't do that. You shouldn't beg."

247
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,236
(Satisfied)

248
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,306
As soon as she's asked...

249
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,506
She's faster than a vending machine.

250
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:36,776
Please appear often.

251
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:37,906
- She will.
- First of all...

252
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,306
For the American-style Chinese food,

253
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:40,976
it'll be the three on the right including Su Ji.

254
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,046
For the Spanish honey cod,

255
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,146
- Good.
- the three of us will go.

256
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,047
- Which are we going first?
- I'll tell you fast.

257
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:46,846
We'll have Spanish honey cod first.

258
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,316
Finally.

259
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,086
This is great.

260
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,186
How many weeks has it been, Seung Ho?

261
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,426
- It's okay.
- He's okay with it.

262
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,486
- Let's go and have honey cod.
- Go.

263
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:54,656
- Let's go.
- Go.

264
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:55,996
I'll take that now.

265
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,457
It's so hot. Let's get going.

266
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,397
I've wanted to do this.

267
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,397
"Gyeon Woo."

268
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,497
"I'm sorry."

269
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:07,167
(Pleased)

270
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,637
(Moaning)

271
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,047
(They set off to the first LMR location for real.)

272
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:13,507
Is this the place?

273
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,076
This is the entrance of Sinheung Market.

274
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:16,577
I've never seen this before.

275
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,816
How is this possible?

276
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:19,946
Is this a store...

277
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:21,117
or a real traditional market?

278
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,187
- This is Sinheung Market.
- It's a real market?

279
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,527
- It doesn't look like a market.
- Take a look.

280
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:26,727
It's hot.

281
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,157
- What's this place?
- It looks amazing.

282
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,096
- Oh, my.
- It looks amazing.

283
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:31,966
(There's an exotic vibe inside the market.)

284
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,497
Isn't this our favorite?

285
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,827
As you can see...

286
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,237
Coco-Cola and Sinheung Market...

287
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,807
- collaborated.
- "Collaborated?"

288
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,307
While maintaining the original vibe at the market,

289
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:44,906
they worked together...

290
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,607
to make subtle changes.

291
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,107
They collaborated on this.

292
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:50,316
This place looks incredible.

293
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,347
(Logos expressed in various styles reflecting the restaurant's concept)

294
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,746
(There's also a photo zone.)

295
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,356
These days,

296
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,456
this place is very hip.

297
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:58,786
- It's hip.
- You can get...

298
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:00,827
a new, fresh vibe by taking photos here.

299
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,496
Shall we take a photo...

300
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:06,066
like we're at a photo spot?

301
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,396
Do you want to take a photo with your first love?

302
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,596
- Over here...
- With her first love?

303
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:09,636
I'll take a photo of you.

304
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:10,767
Yes, but...

305
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,707
In front of the entrance.

306
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,676
- Where?
- She's playing a new character now.

307
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:18,176
- It should look hip.
- How?

308
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,406
Do you know ALLDAY PROJECT?

309
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,006
- Yes.
- I'll pose like this.

310
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:22,216
- How shall I pose?
- Could you put...

311
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:23,346
your hand on my shoulder?

312
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:24,816
Then pose like this.

313
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,086
- Like this? Is this right?
- That's perfect.

314
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:27,087
I'm sorry, but don't cover up my face.

315
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,216
- Is this right?
- Yes.

316
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,287
- "Don't cover up my face?" - One, two, three.

317
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:31,956
(Clicking)

318
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,086
You look good.

319
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,357
- How do we look?
- Yes.

320
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,857
- You look like a coed group.
- Okay.

321
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,226
- Do we look nice?
- That's incredible.

322
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,297
Chuli and Miae.

323
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,526
"Chuli and Miae?"

324
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:41,226
- "Chuli and Miae?" - Thank you.

(Chuli and Miae's reboot in 2025)

326
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,467
This place is amazing.

327
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:46,837
Is this it?

328
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,336
- Let's go in.
- Hello.

329
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,736
- Hello.
- Welcome.

330
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:50,806
There's something here.

331
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,377
It's another amazing place.

332

(A place where you can eat fusion food made with love)

333
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,087
(A popular restaurant at Sinheung Market where you have to wait)

334
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,096
On Instagram,

335
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:11,126
I searched for popular restaurants in Haebangchon and found this.

336
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,966
Cod and garlic are mixed well together.

337
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,437
It's very delicious.

338
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:17,897

339
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:21,837
(LMR 1, Spanish honey cod)

340
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,806
Sir, what's Spanish honey cod?

341
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,276
Spanish honey cod is...

342
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:27,307
- like a cod steak.
- Steak?

343
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:30,117
I stayed in Spain for a short time.

344
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,416
It left a strong impression on me.

345
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,717
So I wanted to bring the food to Korea.

346
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,517
I changed it in my own way.

347
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,026
That's what I make.

348
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:41,386
There must have been many commercial districts to choose from.

349
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:43,356
Why did you pick Sinheung Market?

350
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:44,426
This place has the vibe...

351
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,566
of a back alley in Spain.

352
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,196
- It was the only place in Seoul.
- Right.

353
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:50,896
- I agree with you.
- It has the European vibe.

354
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,436
Yes, it does.

355
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,467
Without thinking much longer,

356
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,336
we'll get one sous vide steak.

357
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,806
And 1 sous vide pork neck steak, so that's 2.

358
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:00,406
We'll get two pasta dishes...

359
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:01,477
and one honey cod.

360
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,376
For the set of four people, please change it to Coke.

361
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,976
- It's coming right up.
- Okay.

362
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,287
(The order)

363
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:07,847
I'm really curious.

364
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,856
I didn't know that there were steaks.

365
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:10,886
If I had known,

366
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,426
I'd have chosen this place.

367
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,856
(Regretting)

368
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:16,096
(Laughing)

369
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:17,226
I'm sorry,

370
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:18,467
but can I change my choice?

371
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:20,867
Can I join the cod team instead of the Chinese food team?

372
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,536
- This is possible.
- You want to change teams?

373
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:24,636
If you pay for the meal here,

374
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:25,937
you can switch teams.

375
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,406
- Okay.
- Okay?

376
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,506
If I pay at both restaurants,

377
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,636
- can I eat both?
- Yes.

378
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:32,877
- Of course.
- Of course.

379
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,906
Jamie's Mom?

380
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:36,316
Okay, wait a minute.

381
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,546
- Yes.
- Last time, that crook told me...

382
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,046
to invest while saying "of course."

383
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,086
("Lee Su Ji in Real Estate Scam and Lost 400,000 Dollars")

384
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,416
It feels like...

385
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,386
- I bit the bait.
- Exactly.

386
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:45,557
I will not do it.

387
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,257
I won't be tricked twice.

388
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:48,387
You almost fell for it.

389
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:50,057
You almost fell for it.

390
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:52,096
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

391
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,097
It's bread before the meal.

392
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,166
- It just happens to be six pieces.
- Right.

393
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,237
Would you like some?

394
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:57,536
Look at this.

395
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,606
(Tempting her to invest)

396
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,766
You're getting hooked, aren't you?

397
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:00,807
(She doesn't fall for it.)

398
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,376
(A change of character)

399
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,036
(A fortune teller came for a visit.)

400
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,777
Until you create a character,

401
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:07,577
how much research do you do?

402
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,116
I don't do a lot of research.

403
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,616
While I'm in a conversation,

404
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:13,746
I find characters that people can relate to these days.

405
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:15,916
That's the starting point.

406
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,917
- I brainstorm ideas with others.
- With others?

407
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:19,786
Has the company of the brand contacted you?

408
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,126
With the company,

409
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,926
we handled it amicably and reached a settlement.

410
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,456
(We handled it amicably and reached a settlement.)

411
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,266
- Really?
- They contacted you...

412
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,296
- to reach a settlement?
- Seriously.

413
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,696
I met up with the company's director.

414
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:30,836
I got down to my knees.

415
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:31,866
I heard about that.

416
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,966
Actually, the company was planning...

417
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,036
to invite me to run an event.

418
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:36,376
That M brand?

419
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:38,106
- Yes.
- It had the opposite effect.

420
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:40,577
Whenever I'm at a department store,

421
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,417
many store owners tell me not to use their products.

422
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,686
(Is it that bad?)

423
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,216
When I ask for an item,

424
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,347
the store owner brings it out with hesitation.

425
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,557
"Don't use our products."

426
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,486
It shows that everyone...

427
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,756
- in the country loves her.
- Right.

428
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:56,027
Everyone has seen you.

429
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:57,097
Excuse me.

430
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:58,626
Here's your ragu pasta first.

431
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,096
- The portion is generous.
- Gosh.

432
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,236
- White ragu pasta with Korean beef.
- That's right.

433
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:03,697
- Here's your basil pesto pasta.
- What's this?

434
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,166
This is it.

435
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,806
- This looks amazing.
- Please mix them well.

436
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,236
Are they the same?

437
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,736
This is spinach basil pesto pasta.

438
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:10,876
- Spinach?
- Yes.

439
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,606
I've never seen...

440
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,277
such pasta before.

441
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,429
(The first pasta to taste)

442
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,258
(White ragu pasta bursting with meat flavor and spiciness)

443
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,668
This is pickled chili.

444
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,528
It could be spicy, so please mix them well.

445
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,568
- Okay.
- Okay.

446
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,099
- Shall we attack this first?
- Yes.

447
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:32,568
It smells appetizing.

448
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:33,868
- Serve yourself some of this.
- The smell...

449
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,038
It could be spicy, so add a little.

450
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,109
Mix them well.

451
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,678
- It has to taste delicious.
- My mouth is watering now.

452
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,749
(Dong Hyun takes a bit of pickled chili.)

453
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,479
(Taking all in one bite)

454
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:49,619
(Sang Uk also enjoys it.)

455
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,718
(Humming)

456
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,328
(Humming)

457
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,658
Gosh, it's savory.

458
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,029
(It's insanely savory.)

459
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,468
How does it taste like hamburger?

460
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:02,269
(Staring piercingly)

461
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,339
It tastes like an excellent handmade burger.

462
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,709
The pickled chili.

463
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,168
- Also...
- It tastes amazing.

464
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,908
It has small pieces of various ingredients...

465
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,149
including the meat.

466
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,378
It has a very rich flavor.

467
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,519
I know.

468
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,348
(Empty)

469
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,249
It's almost gone after each of them had a bite.

470
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,088
- It disappears quickly.
- Right.

471
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,289
(Sold out before they can freeload)

472
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,058
(Another pasta dish to taste)

473
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,359
It looks amazing. I should move the water.

474
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,959
It looks delicious.

475
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,729
It looks incredibly good.

476
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,429
(Including special basil pesto that's full of basil and pine nuts)

477
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:37,968
There are four whole shrimp.

478
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,669
One, two, three, four?

479
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,209
(When plated deliciously)

480
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,249
(Spinach basil pesto pasta full of basil and creamy texture)

481
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,079
(He's going to check now.)

482
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,219
(Eating)

483
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,329
It's something that you like.

484
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:02,659
It's really delicious.

485
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,668
(The seafood lover also eats shrimp.)

486
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,268
(I really want some.)

487
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,369
This is insane.

488
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,009
How could basil taste so good?

489
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,508
Dong Hyun, which one do you prefer? This one or the ragu?

490
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,849
Which one do you prefer?

491
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:21,308
I prefer the first one.

492
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,479
This one is good too, but...

493
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:23,879
- This is much better.
- This one?

494
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,619
- The basil flavor is very strong.
- This one?

495
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,548
I know what Dong Hyun means.

496
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,989
I also understand what Sang Uk is saying.

497
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:33,128
- The heavy meat sauce is...
- Right.

498
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,558
- exactly what Dong Hyun likes.
- Totally.

499
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,259
The dish that Sang Uk likes has...

500
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,098
a strong seafood flavor from the shrimp.

501
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,168
At the same time, there's basil swimming inside.

502
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,269
- Right.
- They didn't even offer a bite.

503
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:45,938
They won't offer a bite.

504
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,208
- I see.
- Is this the next dish?

505
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,238
- Yes, it's the sous vide steak.
- Steak?

506
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,878
The cut is pork shoulder.

507
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,678
(Sous vide pork shoulder steak)

508
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,079
- What's that?
- What's that?

509
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,879
- Sous vide?
- Yes, it's the sous vide steak.

510
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,188
- We should do it.
- We should.

511
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,919
- Start with this one.
- Why are you leaving it alone?

512
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,488
- This is pork neck.
- Let's go, pork neck.

513
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,559
They're simply different beef cuts.

514
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,889
- It looks so beautiful.
- I'm a huge fan of pork neck.

515
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,028
I made the wrong choice.

516
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,698
- What do we do?
- I definitely did.

517
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,929
- Me too. What do I do?
- Here's the sauce.

518
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,099
(With everyone envying them, they taste the steak.)

519
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,008
We should pour the sauce on it.

520
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,608
- Start with this one.
- Why are you leaving it alone?

521
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,139
(Pouring the sauce)

522
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,878
- Take some of this.
- Okay.

523
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,678
(Put delicious garnishes together.)

524
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,679
(Enjoy it with the steak.)

525
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,448
Finally, we...

526
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,949
(It makes you clap automatically.)

527
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,119
Look at this.

528
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,589
(Eye widening)

529
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:42,598
(This is it.)

530
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,259
How do I describe this taste?

531
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,298
(It must be very delicious.)

532
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,468
- I got it.
- Sweet, salty...

533
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,469
(Sighing)

534
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,239
It's very well-balanced.

535
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,509
I shared it with my family because the restaurant looks good.

536
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,808
I can tell that the restaurant is extraordinary.

537
00:17:58,809 --> 00:17:59,908
(He shares it again with his family.)

538
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,978
- I'll try some pork neck.
- I love pork neck.

539
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,419
I'll try two pieces of pork neck this time.

540
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,589
The pork neck is amazing.

541
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,089
The pork neck is amazing.

542
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,459
- The pork neck tastes much better.
- Oh, my.

543
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,798
Are you allowed to do that?

544
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,498
We're allowed to smell. Would you like to smell it?

545
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,929
Can you put a little on my nose?

546
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,939
I'll try my best to...

547
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,699
My goodness.

548
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:26,769
My goodness.

549
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:29,808
Gosh, you're such a fool.

550
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,938
What's going on?

551
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:31,978
(Giggling)

552
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,409
She really put her nose in it.

553
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,479
How will you eat it?

554
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,748
(Like this)

555
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:39,988
Your tongue can't reach it.

556
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:41,219
It should've been closer to the philtrum.

557
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,488
(Surprised)

558
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,928
(It's impossible.)

559
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,629
- Try it a little harder.
- I can't.

560
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,229
(Wiping)

561
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,629
(Suddenly, she coughs.)

562
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,939
It's delicious.

563
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,269
- Is it good?
- It's good.

564
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,369
Excuse me. This is your honey cod.

565
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,878
What is this?

566
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,009
- It should be one cod per person.
- Right.

567
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,978
(Sweet honey...)

568
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:12,749
(and sour tomato sauce are poured on a plate.)

569
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,659
(Place crispy codfish on top of it.)

570
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,529
(Put a lot of aioli sauce over it.)

571
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,159
(Lastly, when it's lightly flavored with smoke)

572
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,169
(LMR 1 highlight, Spanish honey cod)

573
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,568
(The cod gets cut easily.)

574
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:32,869
With some sauce...

575
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,069
That's right. Like this.

576
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:37,208
With some sauce like this.

577
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,478
- Exactly. In one bite.
- Like this.

578
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,479
That's right.

579
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,419
(How does the unfamiliar food pairing taste?)

580
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,019
- Doesn't it just melt?
- Gosh.

581
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,119
What is it?

582
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,858
You know a warm piece of cod with a lot of juice?

583
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,619
There's also a garlic flavor.

584
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,659
The flavor of butter and garlic.

585
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,359
Also, there's tomato sauce,

586
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,128
so it doesn't taste heavy.

587
00:19:58,129 --> 00:19:59,328
I've never tasted anything like it.

588
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:02,228
(The honey cod's sweet and sour combination seems refreshing.)

589
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:03,498
- I've never tasted it before.
- The meat inside is amazing.

590
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,768
The layers look beautiful, don't they?

591
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:06,809
They look pretty.

592
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,008
It's really good. Try it.

593
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,109
Is this the best dish here?

594
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,849
This is...

595
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,779
The sweet flavor and the taste...

596
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,188
- We ordered it.
- I'll bring it.

597
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,359
I didn't know that garlic could taste sweet.

598
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,058
Did we order one?

599
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,688
- Would you like to order 1 more?
- We'll have 1 more.

600
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,059
- Let's hurry and play a game.
- Okay.

601
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,128
- Let's play.
- Let's play a game now.

602
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,598
- Su Ji wants to play a game.
- Okay.

603
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,658
- Start.
- In that case,

604
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:32,868
which game should they play?

605
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,629
(What's the game for the freeloaders?)

606
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,339
- Su Ji, you'll have the upper hand.
- Okay.

607
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,039
Holding your laughter.

608
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,469
If you laugh, you'll be out.

609
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,408
I laugh really easily.

610
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,208
- You can make the others laugh.
- You can make them laugh.

611
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,338
We have to make each other laugh?

612
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:46,678
Do we have to make each other laugh?

613
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,478
I can't make Tae Hyun laugh.

614
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,249
I only want to look pretty in front of him.

615
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,548
All right, who wants to eat?

616
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,188
The winner gets two pieces of pork neck and some honey cod.

617
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,789
- Pork neck and honey cod?
- Yes.

618
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,288
- Is that worth playing?
- Yes.

619
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,129
- A piece of honey cod?
- Only the winner gets to eat.

620
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:03,799
- Just one winner?
- Yes.

621
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:05,529
- I'll go.
- You have to look at her.

622
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,038
Mimicking someone's face by parting my hair.

623
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,769
- By parting your hair?
- Just by changing my hair part.

624
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:12,638
You're changing your face by parting your hair differently.

625
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,509
- What? Give it a try.
- How does it go?

626
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:15,669
We have to look at her.

627
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:16,979
Seung Ho, you have to look at her.

628
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,109
(He's nervous for some reason.)

629
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:24,078
(She parts her hair in the middle.)

630
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,219
Actress Kim Hae Sook.

631
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,588
(They look quite similar.)

632
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,728
(This is easy.)

633
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,098
Seung Ho is in a crisis.

634
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,099
(It's funny.)

635
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,799
(This time, she divides it 9 to 1.)

636
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,599
You have to look at her. She parted her hair differently.

637
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,299
(Flapping)

638
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:46,668
(That is...)

639
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,268
- It's PSY.
- Gosh.

640
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:49,609
(Laughing)

641
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,778
(Cha Tae Hyun is eliminated.)

642
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,979
Tae Hyun is out.

643
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,548
They look alike.

644
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,479
(They look so similar that they could be siblings.)

645
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,749
Tae Hyun is out.

646
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,788
(Seung Ho barely survives.)

647
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,219
- Is there more?
- Wait, when were you born?

648
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,559
I...

649
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,618
(Flinching)

650
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,889
I was born in 1995.

651
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,458
- You might not know.
- He's ten years younger than you.

652
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:09,999
- He might not know.
- What else is there?

653
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,628
I was surprised when she mimicked Kim Hae Sook.

654
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:13,629
(She pulls her bangs back.)

655
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,799
- Who is it?
- I know who it is already.

656
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,239
- Who is it?
- I know who it is already.

657
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,468
It's Lee Jae Po.

658
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,668
(Detecting danger)

659
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:20,808
It's Lee Jae Po.

660
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,039
(They look exactly the same.)

661
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,678
(Frightened)

662
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,478
(Laughing)

663
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,549
She looks exactly like Lee Jae Po.

664
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,878
- It's the last one.
- He got away with it...

665
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:33,388
because he didn't know Lee Jae Po.

666
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:34,748
I know Lee Jae Po very well.

667
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:35,989
You do? My gosh.

668
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,559
He was sitting next to me a moment ago.

669
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,459
I don't care anymore.

670
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,088
(He's resisting better than expected.)

671
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,628
(Tapping)

672
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,799
I love you.

673
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:50,799
(Making her ultimate move)

674
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,069
I love you.

675
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:56,679
It's from "Goblin."

676
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,608
- Can I eat now?
- Seung Ho is out.

677
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,008
- Yes.
- Lee Su Ji wins.

678
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:01,749
- Yes.
- "Goblin."

679
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:05,049
(I give her credit.)

680
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,748
Is it up to me to share what I won?

681
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,388
However, one of them can't eat at all.

682
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,928
- Really?
- One of them can't.

683
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,028
I'm sorry.

684
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,999
(Apologizing immediately)

685
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,158
I'm serious. I'm sorry.

686
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,599
(Her first love is her priority.)

687
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,599
I'm not on their team at all.

688
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,138
No, it's for you.

689
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,139
No.

690
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,039
(Oh, come on.)

691
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,209
Please eat first.

692
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,479
You have to eat first.

693
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,148
(No way.)

694
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:37,718
(How can I eat before you?)

695
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,979
Will you stop if I eat first?

696
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:40,418
Okay.

697
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,818
(In the end, Tae Hyun tastes it first.)

698
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:43,819
I'm sorry.

699
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,788
(I'm sorry...)

700
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,489
Let's play another game.

701
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,729
We can play another game.

702
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,798
Have a bite.

703
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,168
(Pit-a-pat)

704
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:54,829
It's against the rule, isn't it?

705
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,938
(Eating)

706
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,838
(A time of suffering for Seung Ho)

707
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,408
(Happy)

708
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm sorry.

709
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,848
Ma'am, here's your honey cod.

710
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,378
(Your honey cod remains.)

711
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:10,218
Can Jamie's Mom eat this?

712
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:11,279
Jamie's Mom?

713
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,048
Suddenly, why is she...

714
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,819
(The air about her changed suddenly.)

715
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,518
To be honest, I have a small mouth.

716
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,328
(Lee So Dam, Jamie's Mom)

717
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,459
Suddenly, she turned into another character.

718
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,198
It's very embarrassing that everyone is looking at me.

719
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,568
(Lee So Dam, Jamie's Mom)

720
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,068
Jamie's Mom is really here.

721
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,199
(Shall I try a bite of honey cod?)

722
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,639
(In a crisis)

723
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,039
(After calming down, she eats.)

724
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,708
- How is it?
- Two thumbs up.

725
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,578
(Lee So Dam, Jamie's Mom)

726
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,008
"Two thumbs up."

727
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:44,479
(Jamie's Mom gives credit to the honey cod.)

728
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,818
- Does it taste okay?
- It tastes amazing.

729
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,848
- Isn't it to die for?
- It's amazing.

730
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,118
- Can you taste everything we said?
- It's very good.

731
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,119
(Her satisfying tasting is over.)

732
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,558
- Now...
- Let's go.

733
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,558
The honey cod meal is around 160 dollars.

734
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,729
We must answer correctly.

735
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:56,999
Shall we start?

736
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,029
- Here's your question.
- Okay.

737
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:02,598
In Spain, a small amount of food...

738
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,769
that accompanies alcohol is called tapas.

739
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,109
Tapas?

740
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,839
The word originates from a thin piece of bread...

741
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,538
placed on top of the glass.

742
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:12,849
It was to prevent bugs from going into the drink.

743
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,649
In Spanish, tapas refers to this.

744
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,679
What is this?

745
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,118
The bread covered...

746
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,549
- the glass like this.
- I see.

747
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,059
Bread on a glass.

748
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:25,119
This is easy.

749
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,388
We have to guess something that's on a glass or a bottle.

750
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:29,629
(This is what they have to guess.)

751
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,059
Ready, set, go.

752
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,528
(The human timer starts.)

753
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,968
I'd say that it's a bottle cap.

754
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,068
(Tapas means a bottle cap?)

755
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,199
A bottle cap.

756
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:40,709
Is it a wrap?

757
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,509
Something that wraps. Is it wrong?

758
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,979
Just go with this.

759
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,079
- Cork?
- Cork? It's a good idea.

760
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,678
I think the answer is cork.

761
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,949
Either a cap or a cork.

762
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:53,449
- Small plates of food.
- It sounds right.

763
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,189
After opening a wine bottle, you always put it nearby.

764
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,618
Maybe they expressed it as a small amount of food.

765
00:25:58,619 --> 00:25:59,659
Okay.

766
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,929
(Checking the answer)

767
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,799
It's a very easy question.

768
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,229
Give them another question.

769
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,939
Okay.

770
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,439
"Give them another question?"

771
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:15,909
Did you just say, "Give them another question?"

772
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,209
Why would she say that?

773
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,709
Is there the answer among what we said?

774
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:21,979
- Su Ji.
- There's bread on the glass.

775
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,779
- Cap?
- I don't know anything.

776
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:28,119
- Cork?
- I don't know anything.

777
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,489
- It must be cork.
- I don't know anything.

778
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,418
- It must be cork.
- We'll go with that.

779
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:33,489
We'll go with that.

780
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,959
(Flinching)

781
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,099
(It must be correct.)

782
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,728
She can't answer.

783
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:41,129
Su Ji, will you shout out the answer?

784
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,628
Can you do the guy's face?

785
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:43,898
(She's got it.)

786
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,939
Cork?

787
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,668
That's the funniest.

788
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:48,708
(Tae Hyun is fully satisfied.)

789
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,108
- Your answer is cork.
- Cork.

790
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,209
I bet it's correct.

791
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,678
We don't know yet. It could be a mistake.

792
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,679
(Answer: Cork)

793
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,778
Cork?

794
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:58,848
(Answer: Cork)

795
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,349
The answer is incorrect.

796
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,059
- It's over.
- No.

797
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,319
It's not easy.

798
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,689
- We must have said it.
- I knew it. You're an actress.

799
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,789
(Su Ji duped the other team completely.)

800
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,098
Yes.

801
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,228
(They skip paying thanks to Su Ji's performance.)

802
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,028
For the individual game, play a round of rock-paper-scissors.

803
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,198
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

804
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,669
Rock-paper-scissors.

805
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,968
(He gets to go last.)

806
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,269
The cat is in trouble.

807
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,269
- It's difficult.
- I should go with this first.

808
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,578
- The answer is lid.
- Lid? Correct.

809
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:24,678
(Answer: Lid)

810
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,108
The answer was lid.

811
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:28,109
The lid was mentioned in the question.

812
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,978
- That was our number one choice.
- Right.

813
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:30,979
Exactly.

814
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,118
I'm sorry about that.

815
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,148
Okay.

816
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,149
We knew about it.

817
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,788
I feel bad for Sang Uk.

818
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,489
Now I have a much better chance of winning.

819
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,629
- I have a better chance.
- Because of your opponent.

820
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:41,888
- I feel confident.
- I got competitive.

821
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,098
I feel confident.

822
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,558
Here's the question.

823
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,559
- Okay.
- Okay.

824
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,399
In the Middle Ages...

825
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,139
Time-out.

826
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,468
Isn't the host biased?

827
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,909
He's very good with questions related to the Middle Ages.

828
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,678
The Middle Ages? It's too hard.

829
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:57,808
(The Middle Ages is going too far.)

830
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,079
He's very good with questions related to the Middle Ages.

831
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,948
He's an expert on the Middle Ages.

832
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,518
I like the Middle Ages very much.

833
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,719
Strangely, he's good at it.

834
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,088
- I'll get rid of the jinx.
- Okay.

835
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,089
Here we go.

836
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:11,559
In medieval Europe, after getting married,

837
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,689
the bride would stay home for a month...

838
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,199
and made alcohol with honey.

839
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:18,928
Then she would give it to her husband...

840
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:20,699
in hopes of conceiving a child.

841
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,499
The period of drinking this alcohol made with honey was...

842
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,709
- called this.
- I got it.

843
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:28,969
Honeymoon?

844
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:30,809
Honeymoon.

845
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,638
So that's why it's honey.

846
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,178
(Answer: Honeymoon)

847
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,248
- That's right.
- Correct.

848
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:38,748
(Answer: Honeymoon)

849
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:41,119
- The medieval master.
- My goodness.

850
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,088
- He got it.
- The medieval master.

851
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,119
This is nice.

852
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,159
Well done.

853
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,358
- Gosh.
- The medieval master.

854
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,458
Thank you, Dong Hyun.

855
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,358
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

856
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,028
(Thank you for the food, Dong Hyun.)

857
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,628
(Total: 166.82 dollars)

858
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,269
- The food was great.
- Thank you.

859
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:58,798
That was a good meal.

860
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,639
- Thank you, Dong Hyun.
- It was delicious.

861
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,069
Thank you for the food.

862
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:10,818
(Today's second LMR)

863
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,349
This place is...

864
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,919
It's so fascinating.

865
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,659
- It has a nice vibe.
- The interior design and...

866
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,218
- It looks like...
- I like the design.

867
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,228
A food tent.

868
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,099
It reminds me of that movie.

869
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,599
Which movie?

870
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:26,768
- "In the Mood for Love." - You're right.

871
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,298
- "In the Mood for Love?" - Yes.

872
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,538
- It has that vibe.
- Right.

873
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,068
- It has the Hong Kong vibe.
- Yes.

874
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,709
(It has the Hong Kong vibe from the 90s.)

875
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:53,029
I like the vibe of the restaurant that's a mix of China and the US.

876
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:54,828
Their Sichuan eggplant is excellent.

877
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,729
Make sure to try it when you're here.

878
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:03,339
(Serving the best American staple food with the smoky flavor)

879
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:11,378
(LMR 2, American-style Chinese food)

880
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,479
This place is very good.

881
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:14,609
- Gosh.
- Hello.

882
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,209
Are you a fighter?

883
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,619
(The restaurant owner who looks like a fighter appears.)

884
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,919
Hello.

885
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,919
(Owner of H Restaurant, Hong Seok Gu)

886
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,429
How is American-style Chinese food different?

887
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:28,588
Chinese food...

888
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:31,158
including the sauces tend to be heavy.

889
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,669
American-style Chinese food is lighter than that.

890
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,428
We don't use any spices,

891
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,769
so anyone can eat it easily.

892
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,609
- That's the American-style.
- Is it sweeter than normal?

893
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,538
Yes, it's sweeter than normal.

894
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,508
In American dramas, people eat noodles out of boxes.

895
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,808
- Like fried rice?
- Yes.

896
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,278
- Like fried rice?
- Yes.

897
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,509
(Boxed noodles that you see often in American dramas)

898
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:51,719
What is it like compared to Chinese food in Hong Kong?

899
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,288
It's very similar to food in Hong Kong.

900
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,488
Food in Hong Kong is like American-style Chinese food.

901
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,759
- That's correct.
- I see.

902
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,819
Among many places,

903
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,189
is there why you opened your restaurant in Sinheung Market?

904
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:07,469
My grandfather is the first one to start this market.

905
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,699
He was the first-generation leader of the market.

906
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,869
- Was that in the 50s?
- Yes.

907
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,309
- Are you his grandchild?
- Yes.

908
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,308
That's fascinating.

909
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,008
That's right. The three generations...

910
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,009
of my family have stayed in this building.

911
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,178
What did your grandfather do?

912
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,078
- Back then.
- It wasn't a restaurant then.

913
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,718
It was a real traditional market.

914
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,918
A market where...

915
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,418
- goods were sold?
- Right.

916
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,618
That's interesting.

917
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,158
(Sinheung Market was an actual market in the 1950s.)

918
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,888
What did your grandfather do...

919
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,859
- at the market?
- He sold shoes.

920
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:38,098
- He was in a different field.
- A real seller?

921
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,529
Three generations of your family have worked here?

922
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,498
- That's correct.
- You established a base here.

923
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,638
His grandfather...

924
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,299
There are photos.

925
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,039
- There's a lot.
- Take a look.

926
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:51,479
What dishes do you recommend?

927
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,678
Our fried rice and eggplant dish are popular.

928
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,279
- We included the eggplant.
- Okay.

929
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,679
Is there anything else you want?

930
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,019
I'm a light eater.

931
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:02,489
Wait a minute.

932
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:03,489
(Laughing)

933
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,289
Which one do you want, chili shrimp or cream shrimp?

934
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,928
Shall we pick in the count of three?

935
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,758
- One, two, three. Chili - One, two, three. Chili.

936
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,899
- Let's go with that.
- Chili?

937
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,359
- Chili?
- You're one beat behind.

938
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,868
- That's all.
- Okay.

939
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,068
I'll take your order.

940
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,939
- Thank you.
- I'll bring it soon.

941
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,099
Excuse me for saying this.

942
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,538
While you two are on a date, there's no place for Seung Ho.

943
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,839
I'm here as her guard today.

944
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,109
He needs a place.

945
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,348
They're lovers,

946
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,519
and I keep eyeing the madam.

947
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,748
- Right.
- That's the vibe.

948
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,449
- With an earpiece.
- Is it a love triangle?

949
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,219
It's practically a drama.

950
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:37,188
"Wait outside."

951
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,689
(Madam: Wait outside.)

952
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,289
"It's too crowded with so many people."

953
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,629
(The madam is extremely hard to get.)

954
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,598
(Soon, cool Coke is served.)

955
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,869
Thank you.

956
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:49,528
(Putting the Coke on her neck)

957
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,699
- I knew you'd do it right away.
- It looks like a commercial.

958
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:54,009
Like this.

959
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:56,209
Put it on the back of your neck.

960
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,209
Coke is good.

961
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,249
(This is it.)

962
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:03,278
(A necessary motion on a hot summer day)

963
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,178
When the back of your neck is cool,

964
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,118
it brings down a lot of heat.

965
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,149
And close your scalp like this.

966
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,158
(The temperature of the scalp)

967
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,129
(The temperature of the scalp goes down.)

968
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:15,859
It feels so refreshing.

969
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:19,158
Among Handsome Guys,

970
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:20,768
is there someone...

971
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,428
you can imitate?

972
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:23,668
Look at that.

973
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:24,798
(Guess who.)

974
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,868
Can you do it once?

975
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:27,168
I hold this expression a lot.

976
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,339
That's so cool.

977
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,178
No way.

978
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,778
(Copy and paste)

979
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:36,779
I mean,

980
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,548
I can't do it no matter how hard I try.

981
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,649
Really?

982
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,189
- That expression of his.
- You can't make those eyebrows.

983
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:44,118
I heard it wasn't good for you.

984
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,858
The muscle up here will thicken.

985
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,128
In my case,

986
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:48,129
it's already protruding.

987
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,428
It can be remedied...

988
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,959
with some Botox injections.

989
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,198
(Turning into a consultant at a beauty clinic)

990
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,769
I've been waiting for this!

991
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:58,039
We'll offer a celebrity discount.

992
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,268
(Her true fan absolutely adores her act.)

993
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:02,309
Since you came all this way.

994
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,208
Shurink and InMode treatment...

995
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,509
will also provide solutions for you.

996
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:08,079
How can she position her eyebrows like that?

997
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,818
(The anticipated first dish is served.)

998
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,078
All right.

999
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,848
- Here we go.
- Hello, welcome.

1000
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,649
This is Sichuan eggplant.

1001
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,389
(Sichuan eggplant)

1002
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,158
- This is Mongolian beef.
- Mongolian beef.

1003
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,159
That looks so good.

1004
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,729
(Mongolian beef)

1005
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,369
(Thick pieces of beef are fried...)

1006
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:32,039
(and stir-fried with vegetables on high heat.)

1007
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,878
Is that Mongolian beef?

1008
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,579
(Is that Mongolian beef?)

1009
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,479
We can't see anything from here.

1010
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,178
Excuse me.

1011
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,478
I can't smell anything either.

1012
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,318
(How does the Mongolian beef taste?)

1013
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,319
Doesn't this smell like dakgangjeong?

1014
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,619
Dakgangjeong.

1015
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,729
Is it tasty?

1016
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:55,859
Is it good?

1017
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,629
(That's what I'm talking about!)

1018
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,539
That's a tasty dish.

1019
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,469
Doesn't this smell like dakgangjeong?

1020
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,178
Is it tasty?

1021
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,208
(Yummy)

1022
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,309
Is it good?

1023
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,278
To be honest...

1024
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,478
(To be honest!)

1025
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,878
(You can't skip my review.)

1026
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,178
Beef...

1027
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:21,719
can be quite rubbery at times.

1028
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:24,318
However, this is incredibly tender,

1029
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,588
and it melts in your mouth.

1030
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:27,729
You need to call and place your order.

1031
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:29,659
We're almost sold out.

1032
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:32,328
(Laughing)

1033
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,428
This is amazing.

1034
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,298
- Isn't it good?
- The meat is so tender.

1035
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,698
- The sauce is also as good.
- Right.

1036
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,039
(They approve of the sauce as well.)

1037
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,138
There's a chain restaurant I like.

1038
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,379
- P Express.
- P for Panda.

1039
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,109
I know the place.

1040
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,349
This feels like the best version...

1041
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,419
of all the dishes they serve.

1042
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,019
- The best version?
- Yes.

1043
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,248
We'll try the eggplant next.

1044
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:54,749
- Let's have the eggplants.
- The eggplant should be next.

1045
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,388
The eggplant should be next.

1046
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,459
That's the best dish there is.

1047
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:03,189
(Tae Hyun tries one first.)

1048
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:05,559
The eggplant is hot.

1049
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,529
The eggplant is hot.

1050
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,768
It's so hot.

1051
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,038
You said it like Dong Hyun would.

1052
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,169
- It's even better when hot.
- Exactly.

1053
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,368
It must be delicious if it's piping hot.

1054
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:17,509
(The piping hot but tasty Sichuan eggplant)

1055
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,778
(A sweet and spicy fish-fragrant sauce...)

1056
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,379
(made with chili oil and doubanjiang)

1057
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,379
(After frying the eggplant once, )

1058
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:32,389
(it's tossed in the sauce on high heat.)

1059
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,499
(Sichuan eggplant)

1060
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,068
Can eggplant be this good?

1061
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,238
That's their secret.

1062
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,738
They deep-fry the eggplant...

1063
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,639
- to keep it moist inside.
- Totally.

1064
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,308
I can't tolerate spice that well.

1065
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,379
I mean...

1066
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:56,649
(Seung Ho also tries a piece.)

1067
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,989
(The taste of this hot but addictive dish)

1068
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,289
- I'll say it as it is.
- Sure.

1069
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,028
The deep-fried eggplant.

1070
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:12,759
When I was young, around eight...

1071
00:37:13,729 --> 00:37:15,668
It's slightly spicier...

1072
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:18,038
than the sauce on the rice cake skewers.

1073
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,009
But the base is similar to the sauce on rice cake skewers...

1074
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:22,268
which is why I remember it.

1075
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:23,269
- Did you...
- This brings back memories.

1076
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,908
Where did you live when you were young?

1077
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,949
- I'm from California.
- Are you from California?

1078
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:28,378
Which area?

1079
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,549
What are you talking about?

1080
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,148
What do you mean, which area?

1081
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,388
- The district.
- Southern California.

1082
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,989
- Southern California?
- Yes.

1083
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,758
Do they call it Southern California?

1084
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,318
("Please don't ask more" by Felony Jennie)

1085
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:41,889
I can't tolerate spice that well.

1086
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:44,899
This is a bit spicy for me.

1087
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,458
That's why they gave us rice.

1088
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:47,599
Rice should be next.

1089
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,899
Okay, I got it.

1090
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,798
With the stir-fried rice,

1091
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:54,138
we recommend this chili crisp we make at the restaurant.

1092
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,538
It's not salty at all.

1093
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,208
- Just spicy and nutty.
- I see.

1094
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,938
Try the rice by itself first...

1095
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:00,848
and then with the chili crisp...

1096
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,309
on the side.

1097
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,578
Try the rice by itself first...

1098
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:06,888
I'm having it as is.

1099
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:09,389
(They try the stir-fried rice as is first.)

1100
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,258
(Goodness)

1101
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:12,559
You get what I mean, right?

1102
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:13,758
The stir-fried rice.

1103
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,089
- Is it good?
- Totally.

1104
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,899
(Seung Ho quickly tries a bite of it as well.)

1105
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,998
(The truth is in the frown.)

1106
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,138
I'd love to try some of that stir-fried rice.

1107
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,599
That's to die for.

1108
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,369
(No way)

1109
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,279
- Su Ji, go ahead and try some.
- Okay.

1110
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,379
- It's really spicy but...
- Really?

1111
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:38,979
(Savoring...)

1112
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,148
The stir-fried rice must be good.

1113
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:41,949
The stir-fried rice must be really good.

1114
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:45,088
I'd love to get this recipe...

1115
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,128
and make it for my son.

1116
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:48,628
I mean that.

1117
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,358
To make this,

1118
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,498
- you'll have to master the stove.
- Exactly.

1119
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,269
- It needs high heat.
- Big flames.

1120
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:57,738
The chili crisp is super spicy.

1121
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,099
It's really spicy but...

1122
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:02,138
There's no way that oil isn't tasty.

1123
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,238
- Try the egg drop soup too.
- The egg drop soup...

1124
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,609
It's cooked in chili oil.

1125
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,548
Try the stir-fried rice...

1126
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,249
with the chili crisp, Su Ji.

1127
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,449
It'll be spicy.

1128
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,449
(With a little of the chili crisp)

1129
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,919
Don't worry.

1130
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:14,589
- It's okay.
- Yes.

1131
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,319
(Laughing)

1132
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:21,029
You seem to like Chinese food.

1133
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,289
Right?

1134
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,558
(The spicy chili crisp adds depth.)

1135
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,468
You can taste it through your nose.

1136
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,339
(The spicy chili crisp adds depth.)

1137
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,599
She's like someone from California.

1138
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,838
Gosh, that's spicy.

1139
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,938
(Laughing)

1140
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,038
I mean it.

1141
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,939
All right, let's calm down.

1142
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:42,778
(Unpredictable)

1143
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:44,279
No way.

1144
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:48,318
(The rest of the food is served.)

1145
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,448
That's the lemon chicken.

1146
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:50,488
You ordered much more.

1147
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,688
Lemon chicken!

1148
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,718
(Lemon chicken)

1149
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,829
There's a lot.

1150
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,729
- That looks good.
- That looks so good.

1151
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,129
- This is like...
- Here's your seafood chow fun.

1152
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:04,038
(Seafood chow fun)

1153
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,539
Gosh, that noodle dish.

1154
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,469
- That looks really good.
- I'd love some of that.

1155
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,038
- Next...
- This is chili shrimp.

1156
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,378
Chili shrimp!

1157
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:11,978
The vegetable served underneath...

1158
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,948
is tatsoi, which you can enjoy with the shrimp.

1159
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:15,409
No way.

1160
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,748
The chef knows what he's doing.

1161
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,278
- Check out those noodles.
- I have to ask.

1162
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:21,748
Is this different from the Chinese food we usually eat?

1163
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:24,058
- They're completely different.
- You see,

1164
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,858
the Chinese food we usually eat...

1165
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,359
(The Chinese food we usually eat...)

1166
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,828
- Are you Lin Zhao Ming this time?
- It's Lin Zhao Ming.

1167
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,659
- She's here.
- Enlighten us.

1168
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,798
The Chinese food commonly eaten in Korea...

1169
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,629
is made with a variety of spices.

1170
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,538
Some people love those spices,

1171
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,508
- while others don't.
- Right.

1172
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,308
Meanwhile, the dishes here...

1173
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,939
are made to appeal to everyone.

1174
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,949
Hey, Lin Zhaou.

1175
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,678
(Speaking Chinese)

1176
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,748
(Pure bliss)

1177
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,849
(What?)

1178
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,689
That was gibberish.

1179
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,548
She was complimenting the chef.

1180
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:57,958
"Good job" or "well-seasoned."

1181
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,158
So the food is different.

1182
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,329
(Lin Zhao Ming's Chinese class is over.)

1183
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,529
You know it's good when Tae Hyun eats like this.

1184
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,328
The food must be different from what they serve in China.

1185
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,728
You know it's good when Tae Hyun eats like this.

1186
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:08,828
I enjoy that too.

1187
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,269
- Those noodles look so good.
- Exactly.

1188
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,268
Because the flavors aren't so strong,

1189
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,538
you can keep on eating.

1190
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,879
Also, you can have it with...

1191
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:18,008
Is it called a chili crisp?

1192
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,109
That's a magic sauce, if you ask me.

1193
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,878
That's the best thing about the food here.

1194
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:22,908
The flavors aren't too strong.

1195
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:23,948
It's not heavily seasoned.

1196
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,048
Not heavily seasoned, man.

1197
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,449
- Not heavily seasoned, man.
- Not heavily seasoned.

1198
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:27,948
It seems like...

1199
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,519
Is it bland? No way.

1200
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:34,989
I don't know how to explain it in Korean.

1201
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,158
It's amazing that I can understand every word.

1202
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,458
(Oddly enough, everyone can understand Su Ji's English.)

1203
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:38,528
I hear every word.

1204
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,499
Having that chili shrimp when it's hot?

1205
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,928
That's got to be good.

1206
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,268
- The chili shrimp.
- That looks good.

1207
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,469
(The last dish they'll try is the chili shrimp.)

1208
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,938
I'd love the three of you to try this.

1209
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:51,808
We should play for the chili shrimp.

1210
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,938
For one piece of the chili shrimp.

1211
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:54,008
Would you like to play a simple game?

1212
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:55,479
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

1213
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:57,618
The three of you...

1214
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,919
will send a text to someone at the same time.

1215
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:02,349
Whoever gets the fastest reply wins.

1216
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,559
- In what form?
- A call.

1217
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,859
Someone has to call us?

1218
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,429
Type, "Hey, I miss you."

1219
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:08,658
Don't send it just yet.

1220
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,028
- I haven't.
- Hold on.

1221
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,098
Send it at the same time.

1222
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,728
- Choose and send on three.
- Can it be anyone?

1223
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,268
- Yes, it can be anyone.
- Anyone?

1224
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,529
A call just has to connect.

1225
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:16,868
Who do I text?

1226
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,169
(Find someone who'll call the fastest.)

1227
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,009
Could he be working out?

1228
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:24,878
My wife doesn't check her phone often.

1229
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,409
I chose my big sister.

1230
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,948
I'm texting my wife.

1231
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:29,009
Nice.

1232
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,848
I'll text my friend.

1233
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,249
We'll send it at the same time.

1234
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:35,188
One,

1235
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,549
two, three.

1236
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,389
Done.

1237
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,689
Will no one get to eat if nobody calls?

1238
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:43,998
- I mean...
- We get five minutes?

1239
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,029
Five minutes?

1240
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,699
Shouldn't it be possible to...

1241
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,999
- I got an email.
- It was an email.

1242
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:51,198
He got an email.

1243
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,238
Gosh, that startled me.

1244
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,838
- For a second, I...
- You got an email.

1245
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,069
It's possible.

1246
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,208
I'm sure she'll call soon.

1247
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,409
The lemon chicken is delicious.

1248
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:03,609
(Peaceful amid war)

1249
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:05,178
We'll wait some more. Are you all good?

1250
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:06,849
- Wait a little longer.
- Just a little longer.

1251
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,518
(Hey!)

1252
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,249
- Are you kidding me?
- What is it?

1253
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,259
- Who is it?
- No way!

1254
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,389
Who called?

1255
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,759
- Hello?
- Hey.

1256
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,359
- Where are you?
- It's Tae Hyun!

1257
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:18,929
Why aren't you talking?

1258
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,258
- Hello?
- Hey.

1259
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:22,228
Tae Hyun, thanks for calling.

1260
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,598
There won't be any chili shrimp left soon,

1261
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,599
so hurry over here.

1262
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,268
- Okay. I'll be there soon.
- Yes. Hurry.

1263
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:28,669
- That surprised me.
- Okay, Tae Hyun.

1264
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:30,878
(Disappointed)

1265
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:32,179
- Come on.
- I was really surprised.

1266
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,208
She must be taking care of her daughters around this time.

1267
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:36,408
- You're right.
- Yes.

1268
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:38,149
- I'll be lucky if she sees it.
- The kids must be back at home.

1269
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:39,919
- What? I got a call.
- What?

1270
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,118
(Yi Kyung's phone starts ringing right away.)

1271
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,149
I passed it.

1272
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:44,489
Hello?

1273
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:46,059
- Yes. Why?
- Sister.

1274
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:47,189
Yes.

1275
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,289
- Thank you.
- For what?

1276
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,558
- Is she your real sister?
- Yes.

1277
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,928
There's a reason I thank you.

1278
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,199
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

1279
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,399
Hello. This is Gangnam-gu Office.

1280
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,298
(Laughing)

1281
00:43:58,299 --> 00:43:59,698
- Yes.
- Your brother notified us...

1282
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,138
that he has moved.

1283
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,809
When you send 30,000 dollars, we will register him right away.

1284
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:07,309
Hello?

1285
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:08,978
- Yes?
- Yes.

1286
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,748
Your brother is with me right now.

1287
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:14,249
I'll register his move-in as soon as you send 30,000 dollars to us.

1288
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,548
If you don't transfer the money,

1289
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:20,559
we can't accept his moving-in notification.

1290
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:23,059
Okay. He doesn't need it.

1291
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,158
Wouldn't it be better for him?

1292
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,469
He'll take care of it as it's his life. Don't do it.

1293
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,539
Thank you. I'm Comedian Lee Su Ji.

1294
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:35,468
- Goodness. Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1295
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,379
Your brother gets to have chili shrimp now.

1296
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,508
Okay. I'm a fan of yours. I root for you.

1297
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:41,878
Yes, I'm your fan too.

1298
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,219
(Ending the call with warm encouragement)

1299
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:47,588
Sister, I'm shooting Handsome Guys right now.

1300
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:48,788
- Yes.
- You'll know it when you watch it.

1301
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:49,918
You were the fastest one.

1302
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,288
- Yes. Sisters are awesome.
- Okay.

1303
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,359
Thank you. I'll enjoy the chili shrimp.

1304
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:55,959
- Okay.
- Yes.

1305
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:58,099
He's so close to his sister.

1306
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,059
Thank you.

1307
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,069
- I still don't hear from...
- Come on.

1308
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,209
My wife.

1309
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,168
She doesn't have time to check her phone.

1310
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:10,238
She doesn't even know where her phone is.

1311
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,239
(Amazed)

1312
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,249
How is it?

1313
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:18,279
Of all the chili shrimp I've ever had,

1314
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,489
this one has the best seasoning.

1315
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,088
- Is it spicy?
- It's not spicy at all.

1316
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,118
No?

1317
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,519
You can devour it in an instant.

1318
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,259
How much is it?

1319
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:27,629
Yes. I'm curious.

1320
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,789
It's 134 dollars.

1321
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,158
- After eating all those dishes?
- They ate a lot.

1322
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,798
- Okay.
- Give us the quiz now.

1323
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,729
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1324
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,338
Of the famous Chinese restaurants in the US,

1325
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:42,708
there is a restaurant that used this for the first time in the world.

1326
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:43,909
That's so hard.

1327
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,478
The owner of the restaurant, a former computer scientist,

1328
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,248
developed this...

1329
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:53,678
by using his expertise in 1974.

1330
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:55,549
Then he introduced it to his restaurant.

1331
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:58,658
What is this that is used often...

1332
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,118
in the restaurants these days?

1333
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,159
- That's easy.
- That's not bad.

1334
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:02,988
- That's not bad.
- A calculator.

1335
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:05,628
- That's good.
- Was that the first thing ever?

1336
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,269
- He majored in computer science.
- Yes.

1337
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,068
Would he have used a calculator when he studied computer science?

1338
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:11,468
Well, I...

1339
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,739
Think of the POS system and a card reader as one.

1340
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,139
Besides the POS system,

1341
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:21,048
what would require...

1342
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,179
his computer science background?

1343
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,449
Besides the POS system.

1344
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:25,079
In 1974.

1345
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,649
Ding-dong. The bell.

1346
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,919
- No. They don't have it in the US.
- Okay.

1347
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,759
- I know about the US too.
- Right.

1348
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:35,488
(Jennie from southern LA is a bit disturbed.)

1349
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:36,989
- I used to live there.
- Jamie's Mom.

1350
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,258
A microwave? Did they have microwaves?

1351
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,359
Micro...

1352
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,199
Do they use microwaves at restaurants?

1353
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:46,138
Listen. As for the microwave,

1354
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,368
it is a bit distant...

1355
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,538
from computer science or computers.

1356
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:53,808
A microwave works by heating the water.

1357
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,049
By heating the molecules. Yes.

1358
00:46:56,009 --> 00:46:57,419
I'm sorry, but why are you so smart?

1359
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,118
Did you look down on me?

1360
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,518
- Just a little.
- I see.

1361
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,189
- But I totally understand.
- Well.

1362
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,818
I think it's the POS system.

1363
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:09,388
- Yes.
- The whole thing is the POS.

1364
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:10,698
- The cashier.
- Yes.

1365
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,698
- Yes.
- You push the button...

1366
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,899
and the money comes out. That system.

1367
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:18,298
Since we're at a Chinese restaurant, will you say it as Lin Zhao Ming?

1368
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:19,469
- Yes.
- Good.

1369
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:21,909
The answer is the POS system.

1370
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:25,009
(Answer: The POS system)

1371
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,409
She's so good.

1372
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,349
The answer sounded funny.

1373
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,778
The POS system.

1374
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:32,179
(So?)

1375
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:33,988
Correct.

1376
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:37,459
(Answer: The POS system)

1377
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,289
- Who is this? Lee Su Ji?
- Yes!

1378
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:42,858
She loves it.

1379
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,859
(Thanks to Ace Seung Ho, they got the answer.)

1380
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,959
She loves it.

1381
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:47,528
(They are exempt from paying.)

1382
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:49,168
- Take your credit cards out.
- Yes, Seung Ho.

1383
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,298
You're a Mensa member.

1384
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:51,399
I'm on fire today.

1385
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,199
Seung Ho is doing great.

1386
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:54,809
Seung Ho is...

1387
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:56,538
Seung Ho is really smart.

1388
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,979
(The team that didn't eat will pay.)

1389
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,208
- Now...
- We have the bill.

1390
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:02,648
For the three who didn't eat,

1391
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:04,578
- I'll give a multiple-choice quiz.
- A multiple-choice.

1392
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:05,978
- It's rock-paper-scissors time.
- Let's go.

1393
00:48:05,979 --> 00:48:07,179
We have to play rock-paper-scissors.

1394
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,648
Rock-paper-scissors.

1395
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:09,788
(He's the 3rd.)

1396
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:12,058
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

1397
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,329
- I had to win it.
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

1398
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,858
I just need to choose between the two.

1399
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,498
The rock-paper-scissors was crucial.

1400
00:48:17,499 --> 00:48:19,198
Of the choices, 1 is easy, and 2 are hard.

1401
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,869
Well, I don't get to choose.

1402
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:22,198
- Here's the quiz.
- Okay.

1403
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,269
Go.

1404
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:27,469
Of the following, what are the correct table manners in China?

1405
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,909
This is hard.

1406
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:33,609
Number One, not flipping the fish.

1407
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:39,278
Number Two, ordering an even number of dishes.

1408
00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:42,888
Number Three, eating the warm food first.

1409
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:43,949
I think it's Number Two.

1410
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:45,819
Number Two.

1411
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,229
No. Not flipping the fish.

1412
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,828
So Number One.

1413
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,858
Why do you confuse me?

1414
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,298
Come on.

1415
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:55,228
- Are you sure about it?
- He's totally confused.

1416
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:56,428
Do you know about it?

1417
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:57,538
- I'm totally sure.
- Really?

1418
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,268
- Yes.
- You had me a few times.

1419
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,408
- I'm serious.
- Is it Chinese table manners...

1420
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,109
to eat the warm food first?

1421
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:05,039
Why would they eat the warm food first?

1422
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,809
Why? They can eat the cold one first.

1423
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:10,079
Then choose Number Two.

1424
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:12,078
Okay. I'll choose Number Two. Ordering an even number of dishes.

1425
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,179
They love the number eight.

1426
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:15,349
What happens when there are three people?

1427
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:16,888
Is it their etiquette to order...

1428
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,189
an even number of dishes when there are three people?

1429
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,618
- Does it have to be an even number?
- No matter what.

1430
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:22,029
Order 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 dishes.

1431
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:23,758
Is my answer Number Two, then?

1432
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:25,598
Hold on. What's correct? Wait.

1433
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,869
Eating the warm food first.

1434
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:32,039
Gosh. But...

1435
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,668
I think it's weird...

1436
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:35,638
that it's their manners to order an even number of dishes.

1437
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,678
Do they have to order 2 dishes for 1 person?

1438
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:38,709
That doesn't make sense.

1439
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,578
- You're right.
- Warm food makes more sense.

1440
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:41,708
I'll choose Number Three.

1441
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:42,709
(3. Eating the warm food first)

1442
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:43,709
I've changed my answer.

1443
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,218
When you think you're eating alone, that makes sense.

1444
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,318
What will they do when they're alone?

1445
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,589
(Interesting)

1446
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:49,249
Then I'll pick Number Two.

1447
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,459
- Okay.
- That's the only choice left.

1448
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,458
You chose Number 1, 2, and 3.

1449
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,559
- Yes.
- Yes.

1450
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:58,258
- Number One, not flipping the fish.
- Yes.

1451
00:49:58,259 --> 00:49:59,958
- That's correct.
- It's correct.

1452
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,069
It's correct.

1453
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:02,869
I should have won...

1454
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,469
- the rock-paper-scissors.
- Well done, Sang Uk.

1455
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,208
(The real game starts now.)

1456
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,238
Who will it be?

1457
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,138
Ordering an even number of dishes.

1458
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:14,708
(Yi Kyung: Ordering an even number of dishes)

1459
00:50:14,709 --> 00:50:17,308
(Dong Hyun: Eating the warm food first)

1460
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:18,978
- Why?
- Correct.

1461
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,449
(Dong Hyun: Eating the warm food first)

1462
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:22,918
- Is it correct?
- It is!

1463
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,858
(Yi Kyung is exempt from paying.)

1464
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,818
- What if you come alone?
- The incorrect answer is Three,

1465
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,658
eating the warm food first.

1466
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,059
- It's crazy.
- Dong Hyun will pay.

1467
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:33,599
What do you do when you're eating alone?

1468
00:50:34,629 --> 00:50:37,398
In Chinese culture, people prefer even numbers.

1469
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:39,469
So, it's a courtesy to order an even number.

1470
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:42,569
Gosh. Seriously.

1471
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,809
It's good.

1472
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:50,179
- This is a 130-dollar fried rice.
- Gosh.

1473
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,548
I was nervous because I was the first to pay.

1474
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:55,219
I was lucky to lose the rock-paper-scissors.

1475
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,019
What? It's your wife.

1476
00:50:58,689 --> 00:50:59,718
(She is calling now, of all times.)

1477
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:01,858
- Tell her it's all right.
- Now.

1478
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,588
- Hello.
- Honey.

1479
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:06,198
- Yes. Honey.
- Yes.

1480
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,468
- Gosh. "Honey." - Honey.

1481
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,669
- She's cute.
- Gosh. I can't believe it.

1482
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,739
I'm so jealous.

1483
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:15,108
- Because you called late, - Yes.

1484
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:18,678
I paid for the 2nd restaurant after paying for the 1st.

1485
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,339
- Really?
- Yes.

1486
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:23,508
- It wasn't because you called late.
- Okay.

1487
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:25,219
I just couldn't get the quiz right.

1488
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,278
(Laughing)

1489
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:30,448
He could have tried a dish if you called him faster,

1490
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:32,189
- but you called now.
- Really?

1491
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,458
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

1492
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:35,889
- Also...
- She's adorable.

1493
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:40,898
Also, they are suspicious of us...

1494
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:42,228
- Yes.
- as a family.

1495
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:43,428
(His friends doubt about romantic Dong Hyun.)

1496
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:45,568
- Tae Hyun and others say, - How come?

1497
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,538
"Dong Hyun is being fake."

1498
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:48,708
- What?
- Hold on.

1499
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:49,768
What's fake?

1500
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,838
- Hello, this is Tae Hyun.
- Hello.

1501
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,638
- Hello.
- Dong Hyun...

1502
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:55,879
goes shooting overseas so many times.

1503
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:58,218
- I said he set up the schedule...
- Yes.

1504
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:01,119
- deliberately not to go home.
- I see.

1505
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,358
But he feels sorry about it,

1506
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:07,188
and takes the kids for a trip when he's back.

1507
00:52:07,189 --> 00:52:08,459
- So it's all right.
- I see.

1508
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:10,389
She is so kind.

1509
00:52:10,999 --> 00:52:14,158
- Okay. See you later.
- Okay.

1510
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:15,368
Okay.

1511
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,838
- Okay.
- Okay.

1512
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,798
- Please be easy on him.
- Okay.

1513
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,008
- She has such a nice voice.
- Seriously.

1514
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:24,208
Based on this call,

1515
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,678
- you're cleared of suspicions.
- The desire to doubt is gone.

1516
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,708
Yes. She's so cheery, cute,

1517
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:30,148
and loving.

1518
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:32,278
- Okay. Thanks for the food.
- That was good.

1519
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:33,879
- That was good.
- Thank you.

1520
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:36,318
- How much was the fried rice?
- It was 134 dollars.

1521
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,259
The fried rice was 134 dollars. Gosh.

1522
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,258
- I have a bad feeling today.
- That was amazing.

1523
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,389
I have to reverse the mood.

1524
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,128
- Did you like the food?
- For 134 dollars. Pardon?

1525
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,099
- Did you enjoy the food?
- I didn't get to eat.

1526
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:49,768
But the fried rice was so good.

1527
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:50,799
Thank you.

1528
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,899
- Thank you for the food.
- Bye.

1529
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:57,108
(When they finished eating lunch, )

1530
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,109
(a shower suddenly starts pouring.)

1531
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,708
(Thanks to that, it has cooled down the Sinheung Market's evening.)

1532
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:03,848
- At here, - Suddenly...

1533
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,448
even if it rains suddenly,

1534
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,848
there's something covering us from the above.

1535
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:08,919
- You're right.
- There is.

1536
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,658
- What's going on suddenly?
- It has cooled down.

1537
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:12,818
It's pouring hard outside.

1538
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:13,819
It's less hot, isn't it?

1539
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,888
- Yes.
- I know.

1540
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:16,659
This is it.

1541
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:18,958
Gosh. What is this place?

1542
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:19,998
- Gosh.
- Hello.

1543
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,069
(They've arrived at a dessert cafe.)

1544
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,269
(The outside is modern and sophisticated...)

1545
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:27,538
(while the inside is filled with a warm vibe.)

1546
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,339
- Hello.
- Gosh. This place...

1547
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:30,508
Hello.

1548
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:32,439
- Hello.
- It smells sweet.

1549
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:34,549
- Gosh. Goheung's citron.
- It's a skein.

1550
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,449
- Gosh. Look.
- Amazing.

1551
00:53:36,709 --> 00:53:38,148
How did they make it?

1552
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,079
- Gosh. How did they knit it?
- How?

1553
00:53:41,149 --> 00:53:42,919
(A knitted sweater)

1554
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,789
(Seizing your attention with unique shapes)

1555
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,958
(Cute yarn-like cakes)

1556
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,628
- Do you feel the Sinheung Market...
- Yes.

1557
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:52,898
Has become hotter...

1558
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:55,098
with the renovation and all?

1559
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,368
Of course. It has collaborated with a global brand,

1560
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:00,538
- so it has become trendier.
- You're right.

1561
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,208
- I saw many foreigners outside.
- The global brand.

1562
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,879
Hey. We have to think wisely.

1563
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,339
We'll eat more later.

1564
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:07,808
- I see.
- I beg you.

1565
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:08,848
Order moderately?

1566
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,478
Please choose one each.

1567
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:12,319
I'll choose one bonfire, then.

1568
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:14,448
(She chooses 1 whole cake as they're ordering 1 each.)

1569
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:15,518
The bonfire is so pretty.

1570
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,519
I'll choose the chocolate.

1571
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,588
- The chocolate looks good.
- Yes. The chocolate.

1572
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,559
I'll get one Goheung citron.

1573
00:54:21,729 --> 00:54:23,589
I'll order the blueberry basket.

1574
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,558
I'll get one Earl Grey mousse.

1575
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:26,758
The Earl Grey.

1576
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:28,998
- Yes.
- That's it. And we'll pay later.

1577
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,068
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1578
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:31,338
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1579
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:32,899
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1580
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:36,809
(It's time to wait for the sweet desserts and coffee.)

1581
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,278
- I look clean and fresh, right?
- Yes.

1582
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,779
Please smell my skin.

1583
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:41,879
(Sniffing)

1584
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:43,248
I took a shower.

1585
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:44,348
- Really?
- Did you really?

1586
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,618
- Really.
- She does smell good.

1587
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:46,619
It's the smell of the soap.

1588
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,319
- Where?
- The bathhouse.

1589
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,918
- Did you go to a bathhouse?
- Yes.

1590
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,689
The clerk at the bathhouse said,

1591
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:53,819
"What? Why are you so skinny?"

1592
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:55,688
"Come on in." And she guided me in.

1593
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:56,788
Did you really go there?

1594
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:57,858
- Yes.
- Really?

1595
00:54:57,859 --> 00:54:59,528
- Because we sweat a lot.
- Exactly.

1596
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,929
I took a shower to be clean and fresh.

1597
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:03,168
- You took a shower.
- Yes.

1598
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:05,369
- Up to here?
- From here down.

1599
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,568
- I can't put on the makeup again.
- Right.

1600
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:08,608
Yes.

1601
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:09,638
- I did it.
- It must be refreshing.

1602
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,579
Yes. I feel so clean. I feel refreshed now.

1603
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,309
I used the restroom too.

1604
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:15,009
I can eat everything again.

1605
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:16,579
I'll eat everything.

1606
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,918
- She's in her best condition.
- I'm serious.

1607
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,018
Yes. I'm in my best condition.

1608
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:22,748
By the way, I heard Su Ji is releasing a new song.

1609
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:24,558
Right. It's out already.

1610
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,689
- It's out already.
- Yes. My new song is out.

1611
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,088
For this song, we can...

1612
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:32,398
Is there someone who can dance?

1613
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,769
- We'll do it if you teach us.
- Okay.

1614
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,198
- Didn't she do it before?
- Do we get up?

1615
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,228
- Yes.
- Do we get up?

1616
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:38,369
You can be seated too.

1617
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:42,108
(Yummy, yummy)

1618
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,668
(Yummy, yummy)

1619
00:55:43,669 --> 00:55:45,739
- That's easy.
- Repeat this three times.

1620
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,409
Sexy food

1621
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:49,509
(It's a hip-using dance.)

1622
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,379
- Sexy food - Why do you end up as PSY?

1623
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:52,849
No.

1624
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:54,378
That's a prejudice.

1625
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:55,848
- That's a bias and stereotype.
- Is it?

1626
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:57,148
I'm Hambuggy.

1627
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:58,718
Okay. You repeat the "Yummy" part three times.

1628
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,088
- Do "Yummy" 3 times.
- Do it 3 times.

1629
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,259
Then say, "Sexy food."

1630
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,459
- Like this. It's here.
- We'll play it.

1631
00:56:03,689 --> 00:56:07,028
("Sexy Food" by Hambuggy)

1632
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:08,169
It sounds completely different.

1633
00:56:08,629 --> 00:56:09,698
(Shush.)

1634
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,829
It's so fast.

1635
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:15,039
This part is hard. You don't have to do it.

1636
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,239
"Who made this" is hilarious.

1637
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:20,909
(Who made this?)

1638
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:23,949
That's how you do it.

1639
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,949
(They're captivated.)

1640
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,688
(The dance expresses the happiness after eating a tasty food.)

1641
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:31,959
@merge

1642
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,628
- You hand-pull noodles in between.
- Yes.

1643
00:56:35,629 --> 00:56:36,858
- You make noodles.
- Yes. And there's that.

1644
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,528
But let's skip all those because they're hard.

1645
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:39,798
- That's hard.
- Just do "Yummy."

1646
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:41,829
And do this part, and it's all good.

1647
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,768
I'll play the song, so let's do that.

1648
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,169
- Okay.
- I'll play it.

1649
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,569
Don't we need to be in the frame?

1650
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:49,208
Where are we supposed to be?

1651
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:50,408
Only I need to be in the frame.

1652
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,339
- It's her camera.
- It's mine.

1653
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:53,778
- I'll play the song.
- Yes.

1654
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:55,678
- Okay.
- This angle is hilarious.

1655
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,849
(This angle is hilarious.)

1656
00:56:57,249 --> 00:57:00,379
(Yummy, yummy)

1657
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,419
Who made this?

1658
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,589
Who made this?

1659
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:10,128
(Doing their best)

1660
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:11,228
Who made this?

1661
00:57:11,229 --> 00:57:13,099
(Try to do the dance, everyone.)

1662
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:15,299
Wow. Sexy food.

1663
00:57:18,899 --> 00:57:20,268
(Shocked)

1664
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:21,868
(Doing his best)

1665
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:23,369
(Shaking)

1666
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:24,679
(Sang Uk is embarrassed.)

1667
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:28,549
- That was hard.
- Yes.

1668
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,948
- Thank you.
- That was...

1669
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,678
(It's time to taste the real sexy food.)

1670
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:34,049
(Amazed)

1671
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:35,718
(The desserts and coffee arrive for the perfect timing.)

1672
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,648
- They look good.
- Those are...

1673
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:39,158
- sexy, no doubt.
- That's indeed the sexy food.

1674
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,419
- This one looks cool too.
- Thank you.

1675
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,758
- What is it?
- Gosh. They are so pretty.

1676
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,488
- Yes.
- The tray is so pretty.

1677
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:45,659
What did you order?

1678
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:47,399
They are nice and pretty.

1679
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,529
Gosh. It looks tasty.

1680
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:52,669
- I was curious about this one.
- Seriously.

1681
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,138
(Sticking, The cake is ruined.)

1682
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,239
- That's how it turns out.
- What happened?

1683
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:00,239
Gosh. If my son did that...

1684
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:01,709
(Embarrassed)

1685
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,678
- Mom.
- What would Jamie's Mom do?

1686
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:05,779
Jamie's Mom scolds her son in an elegant way.

1687
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,649
(Curious)

1688
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,589
We'll wait and eat together.

1689
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:11,919
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay.

1690
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,918
You don't touch the fork by yourself.

1691
00:58:13,919 --> 00:58:15,729
- Yes, Mommy.
- The grownups eat first.

1692
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:18,358
- Mommy, it's dripping.
- That's what she would do.

1693
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:19,999
- What would Su Ji do?
- That's cute.

1694
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:21,529
Do you want to try it?

1695
00:58:23,269 --> 00:58:24,269
(Slapping)

1696
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,939
(Crying)

1697
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,209
Dad eats first.

1698
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:31,578
- "First." - "First."

1699
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,138
My mom slapped me like that.

1700
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:34,848
It hurt my hand a lot.

1701
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:35,879
You're right.

1702
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,178
- Try it.
- Okay.

1703
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:40,448
The Goheung citron is good. I had the Goheung citron.

1704
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,018
- This is how it looks.
- I'm not touching it.

1705
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,488
It's rather refreshing than sweet.

1706
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:45,558
(Savoring)

1707
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:46,789
- I like a refreshing taste too.
- Gosh.

1708
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,828
- That yarn is tasty.
- The yarn is tasty.

1709
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,029
- It's the Earl Grey.
- I'll...

1710
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,659
- Gosh.
- Gosh. I like it.

1711
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:53,098
- Really? The Earl Grey?
- Yes.

1712
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,428
The yarn is really good.

1713
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:55,468
(It's really good.)

1714
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,068
- It's a mousse.
- Is it?

1715
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:58,339
(Savoring)

1716
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:00,199
- It cheers you up instantly.
- The Earl Grey.

1717
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:01,969
- I see. The yarn?
- Gosh.

1718
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,639
The aroma of the Earl Grey...

1719
00:59:04,469 --> 00:59:06,479
- How is it?
- This is the Earl Grey.

1720
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:08,978
- I'll take a bite of the chocolate.
- Nice.

1721
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,078
I'll cut it for you.

1722
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,449
(Seung Ho chooses the sweet chocolate cake.)

1723
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:15,389
(Savoring)

1724
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,718
- Okay.
- It's refreshing.

1725
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,788
(Dong Hyun tries the chocolate cake too.)

1726
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:19,689
- Gosh.
- You took the chocolate cake.

1727
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:21,529
Gosh. That yarn is tasty.

1728
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,928
(The sweetness of the chocolate spreads in the mouth right away.)

1729
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,359
I love the chocolate cake.

1730
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,429
- I'll try the one with cherries.
- Don't cut it.

1731
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,698
It tastes like chocolate.

1732
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:32,999
I'll eat it as is.

1733
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:37,738
(Trying the desserts the way each prefers it)

1734
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,178
I'm full of energy all of a sudden.

1735
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:41,509
(They recharged the sweetness with the desserts.)

1736
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:43,979
Su Ji, this is the true sexy food.

1737
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:45,418
Yes. Sexy food.

1738
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:46,879
(They're done eating the sexy desserts with Su Ji.)

1739
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,249
Su Ji, you have many characters.

1740
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,859
What is the character you feel most precious about?

1741
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,228
- The one that's so precious.
- I see.

1742
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:56,489
Rank your affection for them.

1743
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,498
Let me ask you first.

1744
00:59:58,499 --> 00:59:59,829
Which character did you like the most, Seung Ho?

1745
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,228
That's the character you play these days.

1746
01:00:02,229 --> 01:00:03,829
The consultant is here all of a sudden.

1747
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:06,098
I'm really curious...

1748
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:07,698
which character you like the most.

1749
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:08,739
(The consultant is curious.)

1750
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:11,638
All characters in the filmography...

1751
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,308
- are precious.
- Yes.

1752
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:18,049
But the character that many people were enraged about and loved...

1753
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:19,719
Hwang Jang Soo from "D.P."

1754
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:26,589
He picked his character.

1755
01:00:26,859 --> 01:00:28,328
He's individualistic.

1756
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,789
Didn't you ask me about my characters?

1757
01:00:30,229 --> 01:00:31,628
I asked which of my characters you like.

1758
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,129
But I loved "D.P."

1759
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,028
(Laughing)

1760
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:36,068
What was that?

1761
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:39,399
I thought she was talking about me.

1762
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,868
- He's funny.
- I assumed...

1763
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:42,069
she imitated that character.

1764
01:00:42,169 --> 01:00:45,139
I thought, "Was I in 'D.P.' as a cameo?"

1765
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,778
- That was what I thought.
- Exactly. I...

1766
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:48,948
- Su Ji.
- No one has ever...

1767
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,108
gotten me down like this.

1768
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:52,479
Both of them were talking only about themselves...

1769
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,719
while meeting the eyes.

1770
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:55,319
Both of them.

1771
01:00:56,189 --> 01:00:57,488
Which character do you like the most, Seung Ho?

1772
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:59,689
I like that influencer.

1773
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,688
- Shuvely Mom.
- Yes. Shuvely Mom.

1774
01:01:01,689 --> 01:01:02,958
- I see. Shuvely Mom.
- Shuvely Mom.

1775
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,159
- This one.
- Shuvely Mom. Yes.

1776
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:05,228
Thank you.

1777
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,328
You're the first to pick her as a favorite.

1778
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:08,569
Seriously. When I saw her,

1779
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,469
I was captivated instantly.

1780
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:14,238
Of the recent characters,

1781
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,568
the consultant at the dermatologist's...

1782
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:17,039
- is the most fun to do.
- Right.

1783
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,408
The character I adore the most...

1784
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,878
is the character that made me famous.

1785
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,748
- It's Lin Zhao Ming.
- Lin Zhao Ming.

1786
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,618
- I love her the most.
- Lin Zhao Ming is the funniest.

1787
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:27,679
- She was beloved by many.
- That's right.

1788
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:29,349
Since it's raining, I have something to say.

1789
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:31,919
Every year, who does the opening...

1790
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,418
- for PSY's Summer Swag concert...
- Of course.

1791
01:01:34,419 --> 01:01:36,459
Is the talk of the town.

1792
01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:39,058
(Su Ji appeared as a guest...)

1793
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:40,429
(for PSY's Summer Swag concert this year.)

1794
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:42,728
(With fantastic dance moves, )

1795
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:44,699
(she proved herself as the hottest celeb.)

1796
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:47,539
Did PSY contact you first about it?

1797
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,008
He called me.

1798
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,539
- Himself? On his phone?
- Yes.

1799
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,038
I missed his call at first.

1800
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:53,779
- I was busy taking care of my kid.
- I see.

1801
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:56,778
I said, "PSY, I was waiting for this call."

1802
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,448
"Sorry, I was busy looking after my kid."

1803
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:00,548
He asked the gender of my child, so I said it's a boy.

1804
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:02,918
He said, "If it's a boy, he must look like me."

1805
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,688
(With their DNAs, they can tell even without seeing it themselves.)

1806
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:06,719
I responded instantly.

1807
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,458
"You're right. It's so clear."

1808
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,459
After that...

1809
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,399
It's something one can't easily do even when they're asked to.

1810
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:14,228
- We can't do it.
- No.

1811
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:15,828
- Only you can pull it off.
- Really?

1812
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:16,829
It's fun.

1813
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:18,738
That's such a sweet thing to say.

1814
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,698
- I mean it. You're that good.
- Thank you.

1815
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,108
(Laughing)

1816
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,168
Even that looks like a character.

1817
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:25,208
- That was you, wasn't it?
- I'm sorry, but...

1818
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:26,779
- which one is real you?
- Exactly.

1819
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,348
- That was a little...
- Show yourself.

1820
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,349
That was because...

1821
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:32,619
I'm not entirely sure who I am anymore.

1822
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:35,449
When we're eating, it's Su Ji. But at other times,

1823
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:38,118
different people keep showing up.

1824
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:39,719
- She even got changed.
- Yes.

1825
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,928
There are so many characters. It's confusing now.

1826
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,389
(The real Su Ji is shy.)

1827
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:46,759
Right. We have to go eat dinner.

1828
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:48,868
Let's pay for the desserts first.

1829
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:50,329
- That's right.
- Can I have it?

1830
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:52,138
Right. We have to pay for the desserts.

1831
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:53,238
How do we pay...

1832
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,469
- for the desserts?
- That's right.

1833
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:55,869
It's over 90 dollars.

1834
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:57,439
This is a big bill.

1835
01:02:57,669 --> 01:02:59,479
- Should we take out our cards?
- Take out your cards.

1836
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,179
(Who'll Pay for Dessert? Time for Competition)

1837
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:04,708
Let's open the book and see who has the most people on the page.

1838
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:05,879
That one's good.

1839
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,949
Let me see. I can tell just by looking at it.

1840
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,589
The whole face has to show.

1841
01:03:10,149 --> 01:03:12,619
There are people in it. Gosh. There are so many.

1842
01:03:12,759 --> 01:03:13,988
There are various pages with and without people.

1843
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:16,229
- Let's count the people.
- Okay.

1844
01:03:16,289 --> 01:03:17,958
When no one is on the page,

1845
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:19,858
those who got the page can do a rematch.

1846
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:22,469
- Okay. Here are the rules.
- Okay.

1847
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:25,798
How much body does it have to show to be defined as a person?

1848
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,298
- How about just a hand?
- It doesn't count.

1849
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:28,468
- It doesn't count.
- The facial features.

1850
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:29,538
Do facial features need to be visible?

1851
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,239
- They need to be visible.
- Okay. That sounds good.

1852
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:32,478
Does one eye count?

1853
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,209
The face needs to be visible. Okay.

1854
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:35,779
How will we decide on the order?

1855
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:37,048
You can do what's convenient for you.

1856
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:38,778
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- We can go in the order of age.

1857
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:40,219
- Shall we go in the order of age?
- Okay.

1858
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,418
Tae Hyun, will you go first?

1859
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:42,689
Pick up the magazine.

1860
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,649
- One, two...
- All right.

1861
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:46,818
- In the middle...
- If the number is zero,

1862
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:48,389
you're out.

1863
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:50,489
It'll be a success if there's just one.

1864
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,358
Two eyes, one nose,

1865
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:53,558
- and one mouth must be visible.
- Okay.

1866
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:54,658
- This doesn't count.
- No.

1867
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:55,998
- No.
- The face must be visible.

1868
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,168
- Okay?
- Two eyes,

1869
01:03:57,169 --> 01:03:58,699
- one nose, and one mouth.
- Okay.

1870
01:03:58,899 --> 01:03:59,938
Okay.

1871
01:03:59,939 --> 01:04:01,099
I'll go back two pages.

1872
01:04:02,169 --> 01:04:04,268
What a delicate touch.

1873
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:05,508
How will this change affect the outcome?

1874
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,709
- Let there be only letters.
- One...

1875
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:09,708
One, two, three.

1876
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:11,049
(How will Tae Hyun do with his delicate touch?)

1877
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,579
Three.

1878
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,859
(Zero)

1879
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,958
Two, four, six...

1880
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:23,158
Seven? Seven and a half.

1881
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,289
- There are no people, right?
- Take a look.

1882
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,629
Seven and a half.

1883
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:29,398
For goodness' sake! I could've gotten three people.

1884
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,428
(The page he chose first had people.)

1885
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:31,698
Tae Hyun, stand by.

1886
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:33,598
Someone else will get zero people.

1887
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,438
- It's bound to happen.
- It's bound to happen.

1888
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:36,839
- All right.
- There he goes.

1889
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:39,309
You haven't lost yet.

1890
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,409
If he gets zero people,

1891
01:04:41,439 --> 01:04:42,779
his energy level will plummet like this.

1892
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:46,118
(Will Dong Hyun be able to keep his energy level up?)

1893
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,579
With the senses of my hands...

1894
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,118
Tell me when you're ready.

1895
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,888
- I'm always ready.
- Hold on.

1896
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,018
One,

1897
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,288
two,

1898
01:04:55,289 --> 01:04:56,489
- three.
- Ta-da!

1899
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,999
(Exclaiming)

1900
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,328
How many people are there?

1901
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:04,329
- He'll argue again.
- No.

1902
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,368
Why?

1903
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:07,069
- He'll argue again.
- There are no people.

1904
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,298
There are no facial features.

1905
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:09,668
- There are no people.
- What?

1906
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:11,538
- What? There are people here.
- They aren't visible.

1907
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:13,138
- No.
- Come on. Time out.

1908
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,578
- I'll take a look.
- They're people.

1909
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,108
- Seung Ho, take a look.
- Seung Ho, take a look.

1910
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:18,148
In this situation...

1911
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:19,818
They're people. There are 100 people.

1912
01:05:19,819 --> 01:05:21,178
They don't count.

1913
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,518
Anyone can see that they're people.

1914
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,848
How could you not count them?

1915
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:25,058
- Depending on the size...
- All right.

1916
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:26,689
Tae Hyun, cover your right eye.

1917
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,888
- I don't see anything.
- Really?

1918
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:29,988
Then there are no people.

1919
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:32,228
This is a gray area.

1920
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,099
Cover your left eye.

1921
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:35,528
- Totally...
- What do you see?

1922
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:36,928
- How many people do you see?
- I don't see anything.

1923
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:38,129
- Then they don't count.
- I see.

1924
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:39,169
I'm sorry.

1925
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,368
I should get another chance or something.

1926
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,738
- No.
- I'm sorry about this.

1927
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:43,108
- "I'm sorry about this." - Yes.

1928
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:44,608
- Now, - "I'm sorry about this."

1929
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:46,638
I'll get picky about the size of people. Seriously.

1930
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:47,678
Shall I go next?

1931
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:48,778
- Shall we go in this order?
- Okay.

1932
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:49,849
- Okay.
- Okay.

1933
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:51,209
- I'll do it right away.
- Okay.

1934
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:53,718
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1935
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,688
One, two, three.

1936
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:56,949
(How will Seung Ho do with his magazine?)

1937
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,388
(Anyone can see that there are 3 people.)

1938
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,389
- We can clearly see people.
- Three?

1939
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,389
- Two.
- They're clearly visible.

1940
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:02,389
- Three?
- It'll need to be three.

1941
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:03,888
- It'll need to be 3.
- Yes, there are 3 people.

1942
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,159
- It'll need to be three.
- Three.

1943
01:06:05,259 --> 01:06:06,658
That person is showing his back, but we can see the facial features.

1944
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:09,069
- There are three people.
- I did it. I'm exempt.

1945
01:06:09,429 --> 01:06:10,698
(Jealous)

1946
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:11,699
That's how visible people need to be.

1947
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,568
There were 100 people on my page.

1948
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,939
You added the rule about the facial features.

1949
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:17,838
- You added the rule.
- I should've said...

1950
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,978
that even a small part of a person will count.

1951
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:21,778
You added the rule about the facial features.

1952
01:06:21,779 --> 01:06:23,478
- Why did you do that?
- I always do that.

1953
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,048
They're like grandpas who fight at a go park.

1954
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:26,079
Seriously.

1955
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:29,389
Why did you fail? For goodness' sake.

1956
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:31,719
- What was that?
- I'll take my card.

1957
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,189
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1958
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,658
- One...
- No, this isn't the page.

1959
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:35,758
No?

1960
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:36,959
- This is it.
- One,

1961
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,428
two, three.

1962
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,128
That person is here.

1963
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,459
There are 100 people.

1964
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:46,239
One person.

1965
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:47,239
- There is a person.
- There is one person.

1966
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,139
- There is one person.
- My goodness.

1967
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,538
- My goodness.
- That's incredible.

1968
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,568
(Gosh!)

1969
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,879
I got Ms. Kim Jeong Suk.

1970
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:55,278
- There is 1 person.
- I thought there were 0 people.

1971
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,309
- I thought there were zero people.
- Same here.

1972
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:58,678
(Su Ji is exempt from paying.)

1973
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,219
- Ms. Kim, thank you.
- That was incredible.

1974
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:02,418
Yes!

1975
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:03,918
There was one person.

1976
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,718
(Sang Uk is next.)

1977
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:07,218
Four people remain.

1978
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:08,659
- This is fun.
- Four people.

1979
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:10,389
Are you ready?

1980
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,098
- Yes, I'm ready.
- Let's begin.

1981
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:14,399
One, two, three.

1982
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:16,899
(Sang Uk succeeds in it with 1 person!)

1983
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,968
- It's a success.
- It's totally a success.

1984
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:19,268
- It's totally a success.
- Take a look.

1985
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,369
One person.

1986
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:21,908
Thank you.

1987
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:23,508
- Say thank you to the CEO.
- One person.

1988
01:07:23,509 --> 01:07:25,608
- Mr. Chang Bae.
- Mr. Chang Bae.

1989
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:26,908
Gosh, Mr. Jung Chang Bae.

1990
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,848
This is becoming strange.

1991
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:30,648
Thank you, chef.

1992
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:31,978
I'll go right away. One, two, three.

1993
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:33,148
(Yi Kyung goes next!)

1994
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,549
- Gosh!
- There are zero people.

1995
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:38,389
(One person helped Yi Kyung become exempt from paying.)

1996
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,658
For goodness' sake.

1997
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:40,859
Mr. Ahn Dong Yun.

1998
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:42,758
Mr. Ahn Dong Yun, thank you.

1999
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,258
Everyone got one person.

2000
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,928
Why did everyone get one person except for us?

2001
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,658
Why does this always happen to us?

2002
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,828
You know, Dong Hyun has that energy...

2003
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:50,998
- right now.
- Seriously.

2004
01:07:50,999 --> 01:07:52,738
- He has that energy.
- So far,

2005
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,499
it's just like what happened last week.

2006
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,468
- Small people don't count.
- No.

2007
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:57,808
The facial features must be visible.

2008
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:58,979
The back doesn't count.

2009
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:00,539
One,

2010
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,638
- two...
- I hope you get so many letters.

2011
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:03,749
- One, two, three.
- A newspaper.

2012
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:06,719
- One, two, three.
- A newspaper.

2013
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:09,949
There is a person.

2014
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,489
Yes!

2015
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:13,718
Yes!

2016
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:14,888
(I'm ruined.)

2017
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:15,929
Yes!

2018
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:17,658
- Yes!
- This one doesn't have many people.

2019
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:19,658
- Who is it?
- Many pages don't have anyone.

2020
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:21,398
This one doesn't have many people.

2021
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,899
- Overcome it.
- No.

2022
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,338
I feel like I'll pay next time too if I pay this time.

2023
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:26,398
I must break the cycle now.

2024
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,438
This is fun.

2025
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,469
Here I go.

2026
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:30,569
About here.

2027
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,239
Are you ready?

2028
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:33,979
Did you grab both sides?

2029
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:36,248
A match would be preferable.

2030
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:37,249
One,

2031
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:38,408
- two, - Two.

2032
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:39,519
Three.

2033
01:08:40,447 --> 01:08:41,447
Are you ready?

2034
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:43,347
Did you grab both sides?

2035
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,216
A match would be preferable.

2036
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:46,417
One,

2037
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,656
- two, - Two.

2038
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:48,827
Three.

2039
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:51,527
(He opens the magazine!)

2040
01:08:52,597 --> 01:08:53,697
Three.

2041
01:08:55,827 --> 01:08:58,467
(Even at a glance, you can see that there are more than 1 person.)

2042
01:08:59,437 --> 01:09:02,767
(Tae Hyun becomes sad while Dong Hyun becomes happy.)

2043
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:05,407
- For goodness' sake.
- I got many people.

2044
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:08,806
(There is a total of 12 people in Dong Hyun's magazine!)

2045
01:09:08,807 --> 01:09:10,547
It looks like this man is teasing you.

2046
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,446
(Me?)

2047
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:15,216
Even at a glance, there are ten people.

2048
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,146
He's currently in first place.

2049
01:09:17,147 --> 01:09:18,556
(Dong Hyun is exempt from paying in a dramatic manner.)

2050
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:19,756
Let me try it.

2051
01:09:19,757 --> 01:09:22,026
Why does it come down to the two of us...

2052
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,686
- from time to time?
- What?

2053
01:09:23,687 --> 01:09:24,687
Tae Hyun, hold on.

2054
01:09:24,688 --> 01:09:26,156
Did my bad luck go to you?

2055
01:09:26,157 --> 01:09:28,927
- Maybe.
- This is annoying.

2056
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:30,567
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2057
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:32,636
Let's go to the last restaurant.

2058
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:33,666
- That sounds good.
- Let's go.

2059
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:36,007
- Tae Hyun, thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2060
01:09:36,137 --> 01:09:37,637
I broke the cycle.

2061
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:40,536
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

2062
01:09:40,537 --> 01:09:42,847
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2063
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:46,817
(Evening comes and the smell of tasty food fills the air.)

2064
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,986
- Let's go.
- Thank you for the food.

2065
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:50,046
- It stopped raining again.
- Okay.

2066
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:51,217
- It's nice.
- It's really nice.

2067
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:52,756
Everyone,

2068
01:09:52,757 --> 01:09:54,717
look at the sunset.

2069
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,787
Isn't it beautiful?

2070
01:09:57,157 --> 01:09:58,727
It's like our lives.

2071
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:01,696
- You always sound like a character.
- I mean it.

2072
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,196
- It's different in the evening.
- Yes.

2073
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:04,897
- It's more refreshing.
- Hello.

2074
01:10:05,197 --> 01:10:06,766
Su Ji, you must be happy...

2075
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:08,236
since you didn't pay once today.

2076
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,436
Come on. Why would I be happy about that?

2077
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:11,906
- You don't disappoint.
- I'm happy.

2078
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,037
(Laughing)

2079
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,447
- You have good energy.
- Yes.

2080
01:10:15,907 --> 01:10:17,246
- This is great.
- How pretty. In the evening,

2081
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:18,946
- the lighting does all the work.
- Isn't it really pretty?

2082
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,047
- Yes.
- Hello.

2083
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:21,516
There aren't just restaurants.

2084
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:22,786
You can enjoy shopping too.

2085
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:23,886
I know. This is a great place...

2086
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,457
- for couples to enjoy a date.
- That's right.

2087
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:30,257
(This is the perfect place for couples to enjoy a date!)

2088
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:31,896
- This is the place.
- This is the place.

2089
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:32,957
Okay.

2090
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:34,756
- It's...
- Can you help us?

2091
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:36,326
This one. A barbecue place.

2092
01:10:36,327 --> 01:10:37,727
Barbecue? No, I don't know.

2093
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,966
Maybe... I think you should go around here.

2094
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:41,496
- Around here, right?
- Yes, this is a very...

2095
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:42,636
- Barbecue. Yes.
- Okay.

2096
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:43,966
There are so many places here.

2097
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,006
- Okay.
- Barbecue.

2098
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,606
(Would you give us a recommendation?)

2099
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:48,007
- Okay.
- A recommendation.

2100
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:49,746
- Okay.
- A recommendation.

2101
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,746
- Pressure.
- Okay. So...

2102
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,177
Okay. Just wait.

2103
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:55,317
Let's see.

2104
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,787
I'm finding it.

2105
01:10:57,547 --> 01:10:58,816
What we had was tasty.

2106
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:00,517
(She's fascinated by the filming crew.)

2107
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:02,256
The restaurant is closed.

2108
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,156
(She snaps a photo while they look for a restaurant.)

2109
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:05,457
Myeonmaru.

2110
01:11:06,197 --> 01:11:07,826
- Myeonmaru.
- This place is very famous.

2111
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:09,126
It's a good choice. This place is very famous.

2112
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:10,196
This is the address.

2113
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:12,136
- The address. And that's...
- It's near. Go there.

2114
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:14,036
- Yes. Here.
- And in there...

2115
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,167
- Perfect.
- Barbecue.

2116
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:18,136
It's okay. Somebody in London sent us here.

2117
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:19,506
- London. Yes.
- Yes.

2118
01:11:19,507 --> 01:11:20,977
- They showed us...
- I'm from California.

2119
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:24,847
(The tourists leave with information on a good restaurant.)

2120
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:26,376
- My name is Jennie.
- Thank you.

2121
01:11:26,377 --> 01:11:27,677
- Jennie.
- Yes. Jennie.

2122
01:11:28,377 --> 01:11:29,416
Bye. Okay.

2123
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,546
Enjoy.

2124
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:31,957
Enjoy your trip.

2125
01:11:32,987 --> 01:11:34,887
It was a real DMR.

2126
01:11:35,187 --> 01:11:36,886
- Oh, yes.
- You did well.

2127
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:39,157
Just do what I tell you to do.

2128
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:41,557
She's from California.

2129
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:44,897
(Welcome.)

2130
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:47,966
(There are tables with a grill...)

2131
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,667
(and a meat fridge you can immediately see.)

2132
01:11:50,837 --> 01:11:52,677
(Sizzling)

2133
01:11:54,007 --> 01:11:57,106
(The food that gives appetizing sounds...)

2134
01:11:57,107 --> 01:11:59,577
(is aged pork.)

2135
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:07,117
(The joy of eating is abundant in this restaurant.)

2136
01:12:10,087 --> 01:12:11,996
It's aged meat,

2137
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:15,126
so it's savory and juicy.

2138
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:16,567
You keep reaching for more even when you're full.

2139
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,496
It's my first time seeing pork neck with skin.

2140
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:20,866
The attached skin...

2141
01:12:20,867 --> 01:12:23,267
makes it very tender and savory.

2142
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,637
(Aged meat, DMR at Sinheung Market)

2143
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:30,007
You can see the meat right away.

2144
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:32,277
- It's like a butcher shop.
- It's a nice view.

2145
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,576
You can see the meat.

2146
01:12:34,577 --> 01:12:36,816
- It gives you a sense of trust.
- It looks like...

2147
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:38,757
- a restaurant with a butcher shop.
- That's right.

2148
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:40,717
- Sir.
- Sir.

2149
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,027
Even the owner is hip.

2150
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,756
- Hello.
- Hello.

2151
01:12:46,757 --> 01:12:49,566
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I am.

2152
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:50,626
(The owner looks quite young.)

2153
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:52,936
- He has a certain vibe.
- You seem very young. Are you?

2154
01:12:52,937 --> 01:12:54,937
Yes, I am. I was born in 1992.

2155
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:56,166
(Startled)

2156
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,966
He opened a restaurant at a young age.

2157
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:59,606
For how long have you run this restaurant?

2158
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:01,736
I've run it here for about two years.

2159
01:13:01,737 --> 01:13:03,076
Did you run a restaurant before that?

2160
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:05,446
Before that, I lived in Yongsan...

2161
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,577
and ran a restaurant for ten years.

2162
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:09,446
There are many wine bars...

2163
01:13:09,447 --> 01:13:10,516
- and cafes here, right?
- Yes.

2164
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:13,616
I've always wanted to run a barbecue place in Haebangchon.

2165
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:16,756
I was a regular at an establishment that used to be here.

2166
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:18,326
As soon as I heard that the space was up for lease,

2167
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,896
I signed the contract.

2168
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:22,566
What kind of an establishment was it?

2169
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:23,866
- A spicy fish roe soup place.
- A spicy fish roe soup place.

2170
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,197
It was popular.

2171
01:13:25,637 --> 01:13:27,966
- It was a popular restaurant.
- Yes.

2172
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:29,306
But the owner moved to a different neighborhood.

2173
01:13:29,307 --> 01:13:30,936
I heard through a real estate office...

2174
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:32,236
that the elderly owners were closing the restaurant.

2175
01:13:32,237 --> 01:13:34,836
I once ran a restaurant in front of Dong Hyun's gym.

2176
01:13:34,837 --> 01:13:36,046
- It was right in front of the gym.
- What kind of a restaurant?

2177
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:38,047
Pork belly and kimchi. MMA fighters visited often.

2178
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:40,516
- That place.
- I ate there often,

2179
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,517
but it closed down.

2180
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:42,547
That's right.

2181
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:45,416
It was so tasty. I was sad when it closed down.

2182
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:47,216
- That's right.
- Did you run that restaurant?

2183
01:13:47,217 --> 01:13:49,056
- Where...
- You know,

2184
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,556
the interior design is unique.

2185
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:53,457
- Is this a grill?
- Yes.

2186
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,326
I've never seen a grill like this one.

2187
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:58,096
I studied the matter nonstop.

2188
01:13:58,097 --> 01:14:01,036
- You had it made.
- I cut the hotteok grill.

2189
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:02,706
This way, the meat will absorb the smoky aroma...

2190
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,137
and get cooked as if it was being fried.

2191
01:14:04,337 --> 01:14:06,037
This is common in California.

2192
01:14:06,537 --> 01:14:07,707
Really?

2193
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:09,406
She's from California.

2194
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,576
She says this grill is common in California.

2195
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:13,246
- Really?
- It might be uncommon in Korea.

2196
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:15,686
- But it exists abroad.
- I haven't been abroad.

2197
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:18,317
- Really?
- Yes, it's used commonly.

2198
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,217
I am Optimus Prime.

2199
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,656
That has nothing to do with the grill.

2200
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:26,456
- She fooled us.
- You fooled me. Seriously.

2201
01:14:26,457 --> 01:14:29,166
- How is this Optimus Prime?
- For goodness' sake.

2202
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:30,696
Is this "Prison Break?"

2203
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:32,896
We were talking about barbecue restaurants.

2204
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:34,036
- She startled me.
- Seriously.

2205
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:35,636
- I took it seriously.
- I'm sorry.

2206
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,107
(Laughing)

2207
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:38,466
I thought you were talking about barbecue restaurants.

2208
01:14:38,467 --> 01:14:40,636
- What should we...
- What should we order?

2209
01:14:40,637 --> 01:14:41,807
There are six of us.

2210
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:45,777
You could eat the pork shoulder, pork neck with skin, and pork butt.

2211
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:48,146
- That sounds good.
- We'll get started with those cuts.

2212
01:14:48,147 --> 01:14:49,216
Shall I divide them up for two grills?

2213
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:50,587
- Yes.
- Please do that.

2214
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,186
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2215
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,287
Thank you. My goodness.

2216
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,456
This grill is so fascinating.

2217
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,987
(The side dishes get set up as soon as they finish ordering.)

2218
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,456
This is some kind of salted seafood.

2219
01:15:00,457 --> 01:15:01,626
- Thank you.
- Everyone gets one.

2220
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,196
- Isn't it salted squid?
- Thank you.

2221
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:04,496
(Sang Uk smells it first.)

2222
01:15:04,497 --> 01:15:05,996
- What is it?
- Small octopus?

2223
01:15:05,997 --> 01:15:07,336
- Salted small octopus?
- Baby octopus.

2224
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,496
- Salted small octopus?
- Baby octopus.

2225
01:15:08,497 --> 01:15:10,336
- Salted baby octopus.
- Baby octopus.

2226
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:12,307
- Do we eat it with pork belly?
- Yes.

2227
01:15:12,637 --> 01:15:13,807
It's fascinating.

2228
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:15,706
Salted baby octopus is nice.

2229
01:15:15,707 --> 01:15:18,806
- There are whole baby octopuses.
- It's big.

2230
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,877
- It really is a baby octopus.
- Baby octopus.

2231
01:15:21,377 --> 01:15:22,416
A whole baby octopus.

2232
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,586
It's plump.

2233
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,847
I must eat one.

2234
01:15:25,117 --> 01:15:26,117
It's so big.

2235
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:32,157
It's tasty.

2236
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:35,997
(The meat is here.)

2237
01:15:36,627 --> 01:15:38,427
(Pork shoulder)

2238
01:15:40,297 --> 01:15:41,967
(Pork neck with skin)

2239
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:45,267
(The meat gets scored without slicing through the skin.)

2240
01:15:45,777 --> 01:15:47,877
(Pork butt)

2241
01:15:48,907 --> 01:15:50,907
(The meat gets cut into bite-sized pieces.)

2242
01:15:51,707 --> 01:15:53,247
(The meat gets piled up on the plate.)

2243
01:15:55,077 --> 01:15:57,517
(Then it's salted for the best taste.)

2244
01:15:57,547 --> 01:15:58,786
(King oyster mushroom...)

2245
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,117
(and shishito peppers)

2246
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:05,557
(It's a meat party.)

2247
01:16:06,927 --> 01:16:09,167
Do you have a tip on grilling the meat?

2248
01:16:09,367 --> 01:16:12,536
The order should be pork shoulder, pork neck with skin, and pork butt.

2249
01:16:12,537 --> 01:16:14,436
The order should be shoulder, neck, and butt.

2250
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:16,006
- Shoulder, neck, and butt.
- Yes.

2251
01:16:16,007 --> 01:16:17,437
- You can grill it right away.
- Okay.

2252
01:16:20,407 --> 01:16:23,777
(They start with pork shoulder as they've learned!)

2253
01:16:25,107 --> 01:16:27,017
The sound is amazing.

2254
01:16:28,147 --> 01:16:30,017
It's my first time seeing such a grill.

2255
01:16:30,547 --> 01:16:33,256
The meat should be flipped often.

2256
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:34,887
- Okay.
- Please flip it often.

2257
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:37,187
- Flip it often.
- I see why.

2258
01:16:37,287 --> 01:16:38,626
I see why. Flip it often.

2259
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,027
The heat is strong.

2260
01:16:40,327 --> 01:16:41,627
It's stronger than it looks.

2261
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:43,726
It gets cooked in no time.

2262
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:45,197
(The two tables are busy grilling meat.)

2263
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,837
I'm an expert when it comes to meat.

2264
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:49,036
You really seem like an expert.

2265
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,037
I really am an expert when it comes to meat.

2266
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:52,106
(Skilled flipping)

2267
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,536
- Meat should be grilled well.
- It looks delicious.

2268
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:56,047
The color is beautiful.

2269
01:16:56,377 --> 01:16:58,647
I can tell that this meat is high-quality.

2270
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:00,877
(Cutting)

2271
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,046
(The satisfying sound of cutting meat with scissors)

2272
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:04,217
I'll grill this piece.

2273
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:05,547
Seung Ho, cut it.

2274
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,356
- Is it hard?
- No.

2275
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:08,686
When you cut it...

2276
01:17:08,687 --> 01:17:10,256
- The texture?
- The texture of meat.

2277
01:17:10,257 --> 01:17:11,257
(The texture is nice when you cut it.)

2278
01:17:11,987 --> 01:17:13,126
(Cutting)

2279
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:14,227
Isn't it incredible?

2280
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:16,427
(Cutting)

2281
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:17,467
That's the sound.

2282
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:18,997
This piece...

2283
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:21,297
I'm sorry, but may I switch seats?

2284
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:22,736
Why?

2285
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:25,836
I feel like I'm losing my energy with them.

2286
01:17:25,837 --> 01:17:27,436
I'm becoming calm.

2287
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:29,076
- The atmosphere is very different.
- Really?

2288
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,906
- This table is a bit...
- Being here makes me feel down.

2289
01:17:30,907 --> 01:17:32,316
(She becomes solemn for some reason.)

2290
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:34,876
- This is a table for old people.
- Okay.

2291
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:36,947
- We don't talk when we eat.
- Okay.

2292
01:17:37,117 --> 01:17:38,786
May I mix these sliced green onions?

2293
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,116
- That's a good idea.
- Okay. I'll do that.

2294
01:17:41,117 --> 01:17:42,686
- We can do it!
- Okay.

2295
01:17:42,687 --> 01:17:44,527
- Old folks, let's go!
- Old folks, let's go!

2296
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,256
- Old folks.
- Old folks.

2297
01:17:47,257 --> 01:17:48,357
Yes.

2298
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,596
It looks delicious.

2299
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,066
(The meat is getting cooked nicely.)

2300
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:52,167
This is...

2301
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:54,496
This is insane. It's bound to be tasty.

2302
01:17:54,497 --> 01:17:56,067
It looks tasty. Seriously.

2303
01:17:56,507 --> 01:17:58,567
Even at a glance, it looks tasty.

2304
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:00,207
It's the tastiest cut.

2305
01:18:00,337 --> 01:18:02,877
Big brother, eat first.

2306
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:07,376
- Everyone.
- Can we eat it now?

2307
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,246
I want this piece.

2308
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:10,646
- Okay.
- Did you dip it in a sauce?

2309
01:18:10,647 --> 01:18:12,716
- At once.
- Try it as it is.

2310
01:18:12,717 --> 01:18:13,756
Without any sauce?

2311
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:15,287
Su Ji, please say something.

2312
01:18:16,557 --> 01:18:17,586
Handsome!

2313
01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:19,457
- Guys!
- Guys!

2314
01:18:21,427 --> 01:18:22,596
(Everyone tries a piece of meat.)

2315
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,027
(Oh, my!)

2316
01:18:27,797 --> 01:18:29,307
(Impressed)

2317
01:18:32,477 --> 01:18:34,837
(Happy)

2318
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:38,447
(The flavors of meat fill the mouth.)

2319
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:42,217
It's so tender.

2320
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:45,616
I didn't dip it in anything, but it's salty enough.

2321
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:47,887
You know, it tastes like milk.

2322
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:52,427
The savory taste of the meat juice...

2323
01:18:52,897 --> 01:18:55,097
The smoky aroma spreads in the mouth.

2324
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:56,727
Shall I dip it...

2325
01:18:56,867 --> 01:18:58,126
in salt this time?

2326
01:18:58,127 --> 01:18:59,367
I'll eat it with a baby octopus.

2327
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:03,037
(It's nice.)

2328
01:19:03,107 --> 01:19:04,707
I'll eat it with a baby octopus.

2329
01:19:05,877 --> 01:19:08,437
This must be the importance of aging meat.

2330
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,107
The meat is both tender and crunchy.

2331
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,276
The importance of aging meat.

2332
01:19:12,277 --> 01:19:13,347
(He takes a bite.)

2333
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,747
- Did you eat a whole one?
- Yes.

2334
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:25,757
(She closes her eyes and savors the taste slowly.)

2335
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,057
(Nodding)

2336
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,627
It's so tasty.

2337
01:19:30,997 --> 01:19:32,767
(This is the taste.)

2338
01:19:32,837 --> 01:19:34,567
May our youth...

2339
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:35,937
- last forever!
- Last forever!

2340
01:19:36,367 --> 01:19:37,467
(Oh, yes!)

2341
01:19:38,267 --> 01:19:39,807
(Let's do it together.)

2342
01:19:40,177 --> 01:19:41,907
(She urgently soaks up the youthful energy.)

2343
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:44,677
(Then she goes back to being solemn.)

2344
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:47,417
(Pork neck with skin)

2345
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:50,046
Which side should we grill first? The skin?

2346
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:51,086
- Yes.
- Okay.

2347
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:54,487
Cook the skin first.

2348
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:56,426
That way, the texture improves.

2349
01:19:56,427 --> 01:19:58,127
(Flip it and grill the other side to bring out the texture.)

2350
01:19:58,187 --> 01:19:59,427
It's so tasty.

2351
01:19:59,557 --> 01:20:00,926
My wife will love this place.

2352
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:03,066
- We'll need to come back here.
- Seriously.

2353
01:20:03,067 --> 01:20:04,797
My wife will love the food too.

2354
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,637
Your wife?

2355
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,097
Look at the cooked skin.

2356
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,807
Look at the cooked skin.

2357
01:20:13,107 --> 01:20:16,007
(Golden)

2358
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:19,177
It's bound to taste amazing.

2359
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,746
It'll be game over.

2360
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:23,417
- This is driving me crazy.
- It'll be game over.

2361
01:20:24,217 --> 01:20:25,317
The texture and...

2362
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:28,956
(Flip the meat frequently as if you were frying it.)

2363
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,187
I think I should cut it now.

2364
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:32,357
- It's pretty now, right?
- Yes.

2365
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:35,897
It's like a flower.

2366
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,267
This is nice.

2367
01:20:37,927 --> 01:20:39,067
The cutting sound is nice.

2368
01:20:39,297 --> 01:20:40,437
This is nice.

2369
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,136
I really want to come back here.

2370
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,406
It needs to be cooked thoroughly.

2371
01:20:43,407 --> 01:20:44,667
- That way, it'll be tasty.
- Pass it down.

2372
01:20:45,037 --> 01:20:46,806
- This place...
- Sir.

2373
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:49,846
Please eat slowly as you drink Coke.

2374
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:50,907
Thank you.

2375
01:20:51,577 --> 01:20:52,746
You need to speak loudly.

2376
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,816
- I was dying of thirst.
- Coke is here.

2377
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:56,487
- I'm not that old.
- Okay.

2378
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:58,887
- I can still hear well. I'm fine.
- Okay.

2379
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,057
- I'm fine.
- Let's clink our glasses.

2380
01:21:01,087 --> 01:21:03,427
- Okay.
- Let's drink.

2381
01:21:03,787 --> 01:21:04,787
When I say, "Old folks," say, "Let's go."

2382
01:21:04,788 --> 01:21:05,827
- Okay.
- All right.

2383
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:08,457
- Old folks, let's go.
- Old folks, let's go.

2384
01:21:08,757 --> 01:21:09,996
May our youth...

2385
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:11,797
(Cheering)

2386
01:21:13,097 --> 01:21:15,396
You keep switching sides. You should pick a side.

2387
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:17,066
They have good energy.

2388
01:21:17,067 --> 01:21:18,067
(I keep getting drawn to their energy.)

2389
01:21:20,277 --> 01:21:21,976
It goes really well with Coke.

2390
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,947
(Pork neck with skin has been grilled to perfection.)

2391
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,376
I think it's good to eat.

2392
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:27,746
- Go ahead and eat.
- Yes.

2393
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:30,116
This piece is burnt. For goodness' sake.

2394
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:31,916
Give it to me, Sang Uk. I'll eat it.

2395
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:34,817
I'll put a piece of pickled radish on the top.

2396
01:21:35,987 --> 01:21:37,057
Wasabi.

2397
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:39,956
I'll put it on the top.

2398
01:21:39,957 --> 01:21:41,657
(He eats the meat with pickled radish and wasabi.)

2399
01:21:43,727 --> 01:21:45,627
This is unbelievable.

2400
01:21:53,377 --> 01:21:55,507
(Moved)

2401
01:21:56,507 --> 01:21:57,846
Wasabi tastes amazing.

2402
01:21:57,847 --> 01:21:59,447
It's really tasty.

2403
01:21:59,777 --> 01:22:00,777
It's to die for.

2404
01:22:00,778 --> 01:22:01,946
- This one is ready.
- Pork neck with skin.

2405
01:22:01,947 --> 01:22:02,986
- Tae Hyun, go ahead and eat.
- This one is ready.

2406
01:22:02,987 --> 01:22:04,846
- Sir, please eat first.
- Eat it.

2407
01:22:04,847 --> 01:22:06,186
Okay. I'll try it.

2408
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,456
This one is ready.

2409
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:09,527
- I'll eat it as it is.
- It's getting fried.

2410
01:22:09,687 --> 01:22:12,426
- You should eat it now.
- Now is the time.

2411
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:13,857
- Eat it now.
- Now is the time.

2412
01:22:14,457 --> 01:22:15,556
- This one...
- Wasabi.

2413
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,066
- and this one.
- This one. Pickled radish.

2414
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:18,197
(Pickled radish and wasabi)

2415
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:23,737
(My goodness)

2416
01:22:27,837 --> 01:22:30,176
It's incredibly fun with the chewing.

2417
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,177
(Amazed)

2418
01:22:31,307 --> 01:22:32,406
- Gosh.
- The next one should go up.

2419
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:34,777
- The pork rind is a work of art.
- It feels like a rice cake.

2420
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:36,887
Right. It has the texture of rice cakes.

2421
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:39,657
(He makes a big wrap this time.)

2422
01:22:39,957 --> 01:22:41,317
The place is going wild.

2423
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:43,027
- I'll place it on the grill.
- Sure.

2424
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:47,126
The way it's chewy...

2425
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:49,667
feels like it sticks to your teeth because of the rind.

2426
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:50,997
It melts in your mouth.

2427
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:53,867
It has a better texture with the rind stuck to it.

2428
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:56,107
So it has this kind of texture.

2429
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:59,307
This is the best pork I've had recently.

2430
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:01,307
People would want to invest in this.

2431
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,407
(Amazed)

2432
01:23:04,907 --> 01:23:08,117
(The pork butt gets placed on the grill.)

2433
01:23:08,847 --> 01:23:12,717
(Pork butt)

2434
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:17,487
(The glossy pork butt looks appetizing.)

2435
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:19,897
This gets cooked quickly.

2436
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:23,326
I think this can be eaten too.

2437
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:24,327
Right now?

2438
01:23:24,327 --> 01:23:25,327
(Blowing)

2439
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,267
(It's hot.)

2440
01:23:30,737 --> 01:23:31,766
Is it ready?

2441
01:23:31,767 --> 01:23:33,307
- My gosh.
- It's really good.

2442
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:36,876
This should just be called chewy meat.

2443
01:23:36,877 --> 01:23:38,077
- Is it chewy?
- Yes.

2444
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,346
(She puts it straight into her mouth.)

2445
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:41,416
(Gosh, it's hot!)

2446
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,287
What is the pork butt good with?

2447
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:45,046
It's good when wrapped with the seasoned green onions.

2448
01:23:45,047 --> 01:23:46,057
The seasoned green onions?

2449
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:47,917
You should've told us.

2450
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,426
We learned about that now.

2451
01:23:50,427 --> 01:23:52,857
(Getting a generous amount of the seasoned green onions)

2452
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:57,566
(Pork butt and seasoned green onions)

2453
01:23:57,567 --> 01:23:58,627
Like this.

2454
01:24:05,237 --> 01:24:06,306
Thank you.

2455
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:07,436
(Sang Uk tries just the meat without anything else.)

2456
01:24:07,437 --> 01:24:09,306
- What did you try it with?
- It's so good.

2457
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:10,507
- I just tried the meat.
- Without anything else?

2458
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:13,517
- It's really chewy.
- Right.

2459
01:24:17,217 --> 01:24:18,247
(Amazed)

2460
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:27,696
(Impressed)

2461
01:24:27,697 --> 01:24:29,327
Until the very end,

2462
01:24:30,027 --> 01:24:33,467
it continues to be chewy like bubble gum.

2463
01:24:33,867 --> 01:24:34,867
It's chewy.

2464
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:37,567
- Sir?
- Yes?

2465
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:39,206
We'll get the pork shoulder,

2466
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,606
- rind, and butt once again.
- Right.

2467
01:24:40,607 --> 01:24:42,006
We'll also get some pork belly on top of that.

2468
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:43,007
Pork belly?

2469
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:45,247
It's really good.

2470
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:47,147
My gosh.

2471
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:49,886
Look at how the meat looks. Gosh.

2472
01:24:49,887 --> 01:24:51,616
(Her mouth waters again.)

2473
01:24:51,617 --> 01:24:52,917
Done. It's done now.

2474
01:24:54,317 --> 01:24:55,457
(Impressed)

2475
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:56,727
It has a great color.

2476
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:59,086
It looks like a food model.

2477
01:24:59,087 --> 01:25:00,326
- Sir?
- Yes?

2478
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:02,727
- Was the meat aged?
- Yes.

2479
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,566
How long has the meat been aged?

2480
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:07,397
The meat is aged for around two weeks.

2481
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,506
It's wet aged for around ten days...

2482
01:25:10,507 --> 01:25:12,507
and dry aged for around 3 to 4 days.

2483
01:25:13,237 --> 01:25:15,877
- Like that?
- That's really sexy.

2484
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:19,347
Su Ji, this is really sexy food.

2485
01:25:19,677 --> 01:25:20,946
This is really sexy food.

2486
01:25:20,947 --> 01:25:22,576
- Really?
- This is really sexy food.

2487
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:23,746
It tastes like milk again.

2488
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:25,687
(Shall I give it a try then?)

2489
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:28,317
It tastes like milk.

2490
01:25:29,927 --> 01:25:31,156
It must be because it was aged.

2491
01:25:31,157 --> 01:25:32,457
(The sexy food slowly gets absorbed.)

2492
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,827
(Wriggling)

2493
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:37,567
(I feel it coming.)

2494
01:25:38,227 --> 01:25:39,696
Sexy food!

2495
01:25:39,697 --> 01:25:41,197
(Hambuggy appears.)

2496
01:25:41,497 --> 01:25:43,107
(Dropping the tongs)

2497
01:25:44,137 --> 01:25:47,536
(Yummy)

2498
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:48,807
Yummy

2499
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,607
Thank you. Who made this?

2500
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:52,347
Who made this?

2501
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,077
- Who made this?
- Who made this?

2502
01:25:54,347 --> 01:25:56,247
Who made this? It's him!

2503
01:26:00,517 --> 01:26:02,616
(Passionate)

2504
01:26:02,617 --> 01:26:03,956
(He's only interested in the meat.)

2505
01:26:03,957 --> 01:26:04,987
The owner...

2506
01:26:05,757 --> 01:26:06,827
is doing this.

2507
01:26:06,897 --> 01:26:09,057
(Yummy)

2508
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:11,996
(This is exciting.)

2509
01:26:11,997 --> 01:26:13,566
- Sexy food.
- This really is sexy food.

2510
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:14,597
- Seriously.
- Right.

2511
01:26:16,367 --> 01:26:19,007
(Gosh, it's good.)

2512
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:20,607
- Gosh.
- Yes.

2513
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:22,776
Sexy sound.

2514
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:23,876
(Eating...)

2515
01:26:23,877 --> 01:26:25,006
Sexy sound.

2516
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:27,277
(and eating again)

2517
01:26:27,717 --> 01:26:28,817
I'm full now.

2518
01:26:29,047 --> 01:26:30,387
All right, Sang Uk. Let's begin.

2519
01:26:30,517 --> 01:26:31,517
What?

2520
01:26:31,747 --> 01:26:32,747
(The meat party never ends.)

2521
01:26:32,748 --> 01:26:34,017
Did I hear that wrong?

2522
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,556
- Should we get some noodles?
- What?

2523
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:38,086
We'll get some cold noodles, sir.

2524
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:39,127
Right.

2525
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:42,867
(Some cold soup would be perfect at around this time.)

2526
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:47,637
- Cold noodles?
- Could we get one of those?

2527
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:50,167
(It gets mixed up to be nice and cold.)

2528
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,107
Gosh, that looks good too.

2529
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:56,406
(Slurping a bunch of noodles at once)

2530
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:58,077
This is so good.

2531
01:26:59,947 --> 01:27:01,046
The cold noodles are good.

2532
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:02,116
(Drinking the soup as well)

2533
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:03,387
The cold noodles feel really cold.

2534
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,547
The cold noodles are great.

2535
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:10,587
(Refreshing)

2536
01:27:17,327 --> 01:27:18,467
Gosh, I'm full.

2537
01:27:19,427 --> 01:27:22,097
The mic keeps sticking to the bowl.

2538
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:24,466
(Laughing)

2539
01:27:24,467 --> 01:27:27,807
I think it wants some of the noodles too.

2540
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:30,306
Whenever I move it here,

2541
01:27:30,307 --> 01:27:32,377
- Gosh.
- it keeps sticking.

2542
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,147
It's a steel bowl.

2543
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:40,517
- Everything sticks to it?
- Gosh, the soup is great.

2544
01:27:41,717 --> 01:27:43,527
- Shall we begin now?
- Yes.

2545
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:46,697
Yes. Just like last week, it will be decided by a group game.

2546
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:48,826
- It'll be Line Up the Words.
- Right.

2547
01:27:48,827 --> 01:27:50,926
You have to take turns to say the right word in three seconds...

2548
01:27:50,927 --> 01:27:53,137
- based on the topic given by us.
- Okay.

2549
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:55,866
If the topic is "fruit," we go, "Grape, apple, pear."

2550
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:57,806
We take turns to say it and come back like this.

2551
01:27:57,807 --> 01:27:59,137
- Okay.
- Okay.

2552
01:27:59,267 --> 01:28:00,976
You get three chances.

2553
01:28:00,977 --> 01:28:01,977
- Three chances.
- Three chances.

2554
01:28:01,978 --> 01:28:04,246
If you fail, it will become an individual match...

2555
01:28:04,247 --> 01:28:07,346
and one person will be chosen to pay for the food.

2556
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:08,347
Okay.

2557
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:09,716
When we choose for one person,

2558
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,916
is it done by a vote?

2559
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,316
(It's done by a vote?)

2560
01:28:13,317 --> 01:28:16,117
Why are you looking at me?

2561
01:28:16,427 --> 01:28:18,326
- Why are you looking at me?
- Don't worry about it.

2562
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:19,327
I was just joking.

2563
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:20,756
- Let's do this. Let's do a cheer.
- Right.

2564
01:28:20,757 --> 01:28:22,557
- Gather up.
- Gather up.

2565
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:24,266
(Grunting)

2566
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:25,267
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2567
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:26,267
(Grunting)

2568
01:28:27,237 --> 01:28:28,466
- Let's beat them.
- Okay.

2569
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:30,007
We have so much energy.

2570
01:28:30,307 --> 01:28:31,566
- Let's go.
- All right.

2571
01:28:31,567 --> 01:28:32,767
- Let's go.
- This is our first attempt.

2572
01:28:33,607 --> 01:28:35,177
- We'll give you the topic first.
- Okay.

2573
01:28:35,837 --> 01:28:37,847
Names of countries that are four words in Korean.

2574
01:28:38,407 --> 01:28:39,646
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

2575
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,317
- What are there?
- Hold on.

2576
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:43,586
I'll start with the easiest one.

2577
01:28:43,587 --> 01:28:44,816
Right. Let's do this calmly.

2578
01:28:44,817 --> 01:28:46,716
I'll start with the easiest one.

2579
01:28:46,717 --> 01:28:48,557
- One, two, three.
- Republic of Korea.

2580
01:28:48,987 --> 01:28:50,757
- One, two, three.
- Jamaica.

2581
01:28:51,387 --> 01:28:53,327
- One, two, three.
- Netherlands.

2582
01:28:53,997 --> 01:28:55,827
- One, two, three.
- Stockholm.

2583
01:28:57,367 --> 01:28:58,727
- Just go with it for now.
- Stockholm?

2584
01:28:58,867 --> 01:28:59,996
Was Stockholm a city?

2585
01:28:59,997 --> 01:29:01,036
- Isn't it a city?
- Just go with it for now.

2586
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:02,837
- One, two, three.
- Romania.

2587
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:05,267
- One, two, three.
- Ecuador.

2588
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,537
- One, two, three.
- Bolivia.

2589
01:29:08,207 --> 01:29:09,377
One, two, three.

2590
01:29:09,907 --> 01:29:11,977
- Cam...
- It's you!

2591
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,347
It's you!

2592
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:15,546
- Sang Uk.
- Hold on.

2593
01:29:15,547 --> 01:29:16,717
- Hurry up and move to that spot.
- Gosh.

2594
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:18,146
- Hurry up and go!
- What was that?

2595
01:29:18,147 --> 01:29:19,246
- Gosh.
- Hurry up and go.

2596
01:29:19,247 --> 01:29:20,456
Stockholm was incorrect.

2597
01:29:20,457 --> 01:29:21,956
- Stockholm was incorrect.
- It was a city, right?

2598
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:23,957
I was thinking of Monopoly. Gosh.

2599
01:29:24,457 --> 01:29:26,326
You're a national team member.

2600
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,497
I was thinking of Monopoly.

2601
01:29:27,957 --> 01:29:29,297
Okay. Go right away with our second attempt.

2602
01:29:29,527 --> 01:29:30,926
- Will we do a cheer or what?
- Let's do it.

2603
01:29:30,927 --> 01:29:32,567
- Let's go with energy.
- Let's go.

2604
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,467
Let's go. One, two, three.

2605
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:35,937
(Let's go!)

2606
01:29:36,197 --> 01:29:38,137
- We'll begin.
- We have so much energy.

2607
01:29:39,237 --> 01:29:40,237
The topic.

2608
01:29:40,237 --> 01:29:41,237
(Please be something easy.)

2609
01:29:42,107 --> 01:29:44,476
Movie titles that end with "Man."

2610
01:29:44,477 --> 01:29:45,706
Hold on. What?

2611
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:46,847
- "Man." - "Man?"

2612
01:29:46,947 --> 01:29:48,847
Movie titles that end with "Man."

2613
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,516
(Let's think.)

2614
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:52,546
"Man."

2615
01:29:52,547 --> 01:29:54,286
Are there a lot of movies that end with "Man?"

2616
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:55,916
I got it!

2617
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:57,756
- Go with the easy one.
- We have to go for it.

2618
01:29:57,757 --> 01:29:59,686
- Go with the easy one.
- We have to go for it.

2619
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:00,996
- We will begin.
- I'll go with the easy one.

2620
01:30:00,997 --> 01:30:02,627
- We will begin.
- I'll go with the easy one too.

2621
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:03,827
We'll start with Tae Hyun.

2622
01:30:04,227 --> 01:30:05,967
- One, two, three.
- "Hitman."

2623
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:08,537
- One, two, three.
- "Superman."

2624
01:30:09,197 --> 01:30:11,307
- One, two, three.
- "Iron Man."

2625
01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:13,107
- One, two, three.
- "Birdman."

2626
01:30:13,837 --> 01:30:15,537
- One, two, three.
- "Batman."

2627
01:30:16,237 --> 01:30:18,107
- One, two, three.
- "Ultraman."

2628
01:30:18,977 --> 01:30:21,017
- One, two, three.
- "The Greatest Showman."

2629
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:22,947
One, two, three.

2630
01:30:23,147 --> 01:30:24,187
"The Gray Man."

2631
01:30:24,487 --> 01:30:25,646
One, two, three.

2632
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:27,487
"Flashman."

2633
01:30:27,587 --> 01:30:28,886
- Okay.
- There's a movie too.

2634
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:30,056
One, two, three.

2635
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:31,286
- "Spider-Man." - Okay.

2636
01:30:31,287 --> 01:30:32,387
One, two, three.

2637
01:30:32,757 --> 01:30:36,097
(They will make it with just one more title.)

2638
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:38,896
(All eyes are focused on him.)

2639
01:30:38,897 --> 01:30:39,996
One, two, three.

2640
01:30:39,997 --> 01:30:41,066
(What is Tae Hyun's last "Man?")

2641
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:42,167
(Unable to speak)

2642
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:44,237
(No!)

2643
01:30:45,307 --> 01:30:46,836
- Hey!
- There's "Bioman" too.

2644
01:30:46,837 --> 01:30:48,336
- There's "Bioman" too.
- Gosh! "Bioman?"

2645
01:30:48,337 --> 01:30:49,506
There's "Bioman" too.

2646
01:30:49,507 --> 01:30:51,006
What else is there?

2647
01:30:51,007 --> 01:30:52,446
Gosh. I really thought we were going to make it.

2648
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,646
- Gosh.
- I know how you feel.

2649
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:55,076
There was "Flashman" too.

2650
01:30:55,077 --> 01:30:56,787
Your mind went blank, right?

2651
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:58,916
Your mind went blank, right? I know that feeling.

2652
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:00,216
I thought that Tae Hyun would definitely get it right.

2653
01:31:00,217 --> 01:31:01,716
I know that feeling though.

2654
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:03,156
Your turn slowly approaches...

2655
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:04,687
and you want someone else ahead of you to get it wrong.

2656
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:07,357
- "Get it wrong instead of me!" - I kept thinking of titles.

2657
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:09,256
- Gosh.
- I thought you had this.

2658
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:10,697
This makes you feel nervous.

2659
01:31:11,027 --> 01:31:12,326
It's our last attempt.

2660
01:31:12,327 --> 01:31:13,966
- All right.
- Will you keep the same order?

2661
01:31:13,967 --> 01:31:15,096
- Let's keep the same order.
- All right.

2662
01:31:15,097 --> 01:31:16,666
- Let's do a cheer.
- I like this spot.

2663
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:18,336
- Let's do this.
- We can make it this time.

2664
01:31:18,337 --> 01:31:19,337
- Okay.
- Right.

2665
01:31:19,338 --> 01:31:20,937
- One, two, three. Let's go!
- Let's go!

2666
01:31:21,777 --> 01:31:24,447
This is your last chance.

2667
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:27,546
This topic is four words in Korean.

2668
01:31:27,547 --> 01:31:30,587
Four words? We always go with the ones with four words.

2669
01:31:31,217 --> 01:31:32,887
- Names of group names.
- What?

2670
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:34,656
Group names with four words in Korean.

2671
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:36,357
- Singers.
- Singers?

2672
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:38,686
- I really don't know any.
- Gosh.

2673
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:40,696
Gosh, hold on, everyone.

2674
01:31:40,697 --> 01:31:42,896
I don't know any groups that are in four Korean words.

2675
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:44,596
- Hold on. Four words?
- I don't know any.

2676
01:31:44,597 --> 01:31:46,197
- Let's stay calm.
- Gosh.

2677
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:48,596
Let us all return to our childhoods.

2678
01:31:48,597 --> 01:31:50,136
- Our childhoods?
- We will begin.

2679
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:51,337
(Summoning groups of the past)

2680
01:31:51,507 --> 01:31:52,837
We will begin with Tae Hyun.

2681
01:31:53,537 --> 01:31:55,507
- One, two, three.
- Metallica.

2682
01:31:56,877 --> 01:31:59,706
One, two, three.

2683
01:31:59,707 --> 01:32:00,747
H.O.T.

2684
01:32:02,377 --> 01:32:04,217
- What?
- Hold on.

2685
01:32:04,847 --> 01:32:06,986
- It can be four words.
- "H.O.T."

2686
01:32:06,987 --> 01:32:08,317
Why doesn't that work?

2687
01:32:08,917 --> 01:32:10,057
What's wrong?

2688
01:32:10,627 --> 01:32:12,356
(She must be shocked by Dong Hyun's answer.)

2689
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:14,456
It won't be pronounced to be five words.

2690
01:32:14,457 --> 01:32:16,156
- Right.
- You have to let this pass.

2691
01:32:16,157 --> 01:32:19,966
There are different methods of pronouncing Z too.

2692
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,696
Even in California,

2693
01:32:21,697 --> 01:32:23,936
- it's pronounced like that.
- We will start again then.

2694
01:32:23,937 --> 01:32:25,036
I can't think of any.

2695
01:32:25,037 --> 01:32:26,777
- Don't call them out from now on.
- Okay.

2696
01:32:27,077 --> 01:32:28,176
We'll start from Tae Hyun again.

2697
01:32:28,177 --> 01:32:29,676
- Hold on.
- What?

2698
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:30,977
- What is it?
- I can't think of any.

2699
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:32,777
- This time, - It's different this time?

2700
01:32:33,007 --> 01:32:34,616
It will be the names of groups that are only from Korea.

2701
01:32:34,617 --> 01:32:36,546
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Hey. All of sudden,

2702
01:32:36,547 --> 01:32:38,386
- it's just Korean groups?
- H.O.T will not be accepted.

2703
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:39,746
- There are many girl groups.
- H.O.T is not allowed?

2704
01:32:39,747 --> 01:32:41,486
- You can't share names.
- There are many girl groups.

2705
01:32:41,487 --> 01:32:43,656
- Just go with the next group.
- Hold on.

2706
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:45,687
- One, two, three.
- OH MY GIRL.

2707
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:47,097
One, two, three.

2708
01:32:47,197 --> 01:32:48,426
- SECHSKIES.
- Okay.

2709
01:32:48,427 --> 01:32:49,456
One, two, three.

2710
01:32:49,457 --> 01:32:50,527
LE SSERAFIM.

2711
01:32:50,567 --> 01:32:51,627
One, two, three.

2712
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:52,767
THE BOYZ.

2713
01:32:52,797 --> 01:32:53,836
One, two, three.

2714
01:32:53,837 --> 01:32:55,067
Ryang Hyun, Ryang Ha.

2715
01:32:55,167 --> 01:32:56,367
One, two, three.

2716
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:57,737
Gong Myeong Jeong Dae.

2717
01:32:58,367 --> 01:32:59,466
- That's the name of an artist.
- He's right!

2718
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:00,536
- He's right!
- Gong Myeong Jeong Dae.

2719
01:33:00,537 --> 01:33:01,636
One, two, three.

2720
01:33:01,637 --> 01:33:02,707
GroovyRoom.

2721
01:33:03,307 --> 01:33:05,076
- I was going to do that one.
- GroovyRoom.

2722
01:33:05,077 --> 01:33:06,377
One, two, three.

2723
01:33:06,617 --> 01:33:07,946
Wonder Girls. I was going to do that one.

2724
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:09,016
One, two, three.

2725
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:10,046
TVXQ.

2726
01:33:10,047 --> 01:33:11,247
One, two, three.

2727
01:33:12,287 --> 01:33:13,457
Incorrect!

2728
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:16,457
(Hitting)

2729
01:33:16,987 --> 01:33:18,086
Hold on!

2730
01:33:18,087 --> 01:33:19,487
Gosh!

2731
01:33:20,157 --> 01:33:21,697
(Groaning)

2732
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:23,897
- Hold on.
- Cool!

2733
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:25,367
- Hold on.
- C.O.O.L.

2734
01:33:25,797 --> 01:33:27,297
He's being ridiculous.

2735
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:29,466
Why did this fly toward us?

2736
01:33:29,467 --> 01:33:30,467
Hold on.

2737
01:33:30,468 --> 01:33:32,006
He got injured.

2738
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:33,166
This can't be happening.

2739
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:34,276
- Are you okay?
- What was that?

2740
01:33:34,277 --> 01:33:35,306
His shoulder got dislocated.

2741
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:36,606
My first love's shoulder just got dislocated.

2742
01:33:36,607 --> 01:33:37,906
There weren't any names I could think of.

2743
01:33:37,907 --> 01:33:39,476
- There's BLACKPINK too.
- Right.

2744
01:33:39,477 --> 01:33:41,117
Right. There's BTS too.

2745
01:33:41,247 --> 01:33:42,546
BTS?

2746
01:33:42,547 --> 01:33:43,946
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

2747
01:33:43,947 --> 01:33:45,086
- Isn't that right?
- It sounds like four words?

2748
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:46,756
Why do you keep trying to go with the pronunciation?

2749
01:33:46,757 --> 01:33:48,817
- I guess that works.
- Right.

2750
01:33:48,887 --> 01:33:50,586
Gong Myeong Jeong Dae is an artist.

2751
01:33:50,587 --> 01:33:51,727
He's right.

2752
01:33:51,887 --> 01:33:53,127
But it was a solo artist.

2753
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:54,656
(Gong Myeong Jeong Dae, solo artist)

2754
01:33:54,657 --> 01:33:56,497
It was a solo artist. Okay.

2755
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:58,266
Let's just quickly move on to the individual match.

2756
01:33:58,267 --> 01:34:00,166
- Okay.
- That was hard.

2757
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,336
It's the individual match.

2758
01:34:01,337 --> 01:34:03,466
Can't we do the individual match with this?

2759
01:34:03,467 --> 01:34:04,467
It's the individual match.

2760
01:34:04,468 --> 01:34:05,706
The two of us have to wake up.

2761
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:06,977
It's over for you if you get it wrong.

2762
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:08,106
Let's choose our spots.

2763
01:34:08,107 --> 01:34:09,576
- I don't like this spot.
- We did it like this last time.

2764
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:10,676
All right.

2765
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:12,707
Rock-paper-scissors.

2766
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,677
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2767
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:15,977
(In last place)

2768
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,386
- Okay! Your last.
- Gosh.

2769
01:34:17,387 --> 01:34:18,646
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2770
01:34:18,647 --> 01:34:19,846
Gosh, it's two!

2771
01:34:19,847 --> 01:34:21,056
It's rock-paper-scissors between the two of us.

2772
01:34:21,057 --> 01:34:22,516
Stay still for a while.

2773
01:34:22,517 --> 01:34:23,927
- I'm staying still right now.
- Okay.

2774
01:34:24,027 --> 01:34:25,286
Rock-paper-scissors.

2775
01:34:25,287 --> 01:34:26,926
- Yes!
- Which spot do you want?

2776
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:28,656
- Here.
- What about you?

2777
01:34:28,657 --> 01:34:30,197
- It's that spot obviously.
- Should it be moved?

2778
01:34:30,397 --> 01:34:31,397
It's okay?

2779
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:32,566
- I'll choose this spot.
- What about you?

2780
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:33,567
(The first spot doesn't have that much pressure.)

2781
01:34:33,737 --> 01:34:35,237
(The spots have been decided.)

2782
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:36,837
- Are you all ready?
- All right.

2783
01:34:37,067 --> 01:34:38,106
We will go back and forth...

2784
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:40,237
- until one person gets it wrong.
- It will carry on.

2785
01:34:40,877 --> 01:34:42,136
It will be great...

2786
01:34:42,137 --> 01:34:43,847
if she gets it wrong right away at the start.

2787
01:34:44,407 --> 01:34:45,707
Gosh.

2788
01:34:46,177 --> 01:34:47,646
Cancel what you just said.

2789
01:34:47,647 --> 01:34:48,716
- No.
- My gosh.

2790
01:34:48,717 --> 01:34:49,847
Do you know what's funny?

2791
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:51,646
Nobody wants to do a cheer as soon as it became individual.

2792
01:34:51,647 --> 01:34:53,217
(Nobody wants to do a cheer as soon as it became individual.)

2793
01:34:53,317 --> 01:34:54,856
As soon as it became an individual match,

2794
01:34:54,857 --> 01:34:56,456
- this is all that everyone does.
- What's the point?

2795
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:57,857
There's no need for that now.

2796
01:34:58,287 --> 01:34:59,457
We will begin.

2797
01:35:00,057 --> 01:35:01,527
