1
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:31,022
(Meat, carbs,)

2
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,122
(carbonated drinks)

3
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:33,222
(Life of Shortage in MCC started on Handsome Guys.)

4
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:34,363
Carbonated drinks?

5
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:36,192
(It won't be easy this time.)

6
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,462
(If you win the game,)

7
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:40,062
(you will gain MCC.)

8
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,662
(Diving in with boldness)

9
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:43,703
Stop.

10
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,603
(Handsome Guys break down without hesitation.)

11
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,203
(Some fail with flair.)

12
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:52,412
(While others continue to succeed.)

13
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:53,813
(Jealous)

14
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:56,242
(Shortage, abundance)

15
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,782
(After the lunch filled with mixed emotions,)

16
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:02,122
(the Forbidden Phrase Game started with dessert at stake.)

17
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,452
(He's forbidden to mention someone older than him or say "type.")

18
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:04,453
(Type O)

19
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,492
(My younger brother is type A.)

20
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:08,122
(Dong Hyun's unstoppable rampage)

21
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:09,323
(Laughing)

22
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:11,463
(He lost his chance to win the dessert again.)

23
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,433
(As the wealth gap widens)

24
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,233
(An all-out meat extravaganza for a hearty dinner)

25
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,103
(The beef brisket looks good.)

26
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,343
(A mouthwatering explosion)

27
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:24,013
(For Handsome Guys who are craving meat)

28
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:27,742
(Eun Hye appears to help them break free from the shortage.)

29
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:31,182
(It started with meat at stake. Ready, action!)

30
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:34,023
(With their mesmerizing acting skills)

31
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,322
(The meat approached right in front of them.)

32
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:38,052
(Meat)

33
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,692
(However, Dong Hyun opened...)

34
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,762
(the prologue to total chaos.)

35
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:45,062
(Handsome Guys took one step away from the meat.)

36
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,192
(As a result)

37
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,502
(Pork neck)

38
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,432
(Beef brisket)

39
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,433
(Tomahawk steak)

40
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:55,043
You won pork belly and ribeye.

41
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,742
We'll also give you 2 cans of Coke and 2 bowls of rice.

42
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,873
Yes.

43
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:02,443
- I'm good at grilling meat.
- Okay.

44
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:03,643
- Please grill it for us.
- Sure.

45
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:06,853
- Eun Hye, have a bowl of rice.
- It's for her.

46
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,823
- I don't usually eat rice.
- You don't?

47
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,493
We only have 2 bowls of rice and 2 carbonated drinks.

48
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:13,962
So we have to decide wisely.

49
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,122
- What about a carbonated drink?
- Please drink it.

50
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:16,522
- Do you drink carbonated drinks?
- I don't drink that either.

51
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:17,593
- Really?
- Yes.

52
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,932
- She's an honorable guest.
- We have an honorable guest today.

53
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,803
- She's an honorable guest.
- We have an honorable guest.

54
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:23,832
- I don't drink it.
- Eun Hye.

55
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,373
Would you like pork belly or ribeye?

56
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,042
Isn't it better to eat beef first?

57
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,372
- Shall we eat beef first?
- I'd like beef.

58
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:30,842
- That's right.
- Let's start with beef.

59
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,613
- We should eat beef before pork.
- Beef.

60
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,342
- What's this?
- Grill the beef over here.

61
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:35,482
Why are there two?

62
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,713
(I like meat.)

63
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,783
He acts like a baby at times like this.

64
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:41,922
(Baby)

65
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:42,923
"Baby."

66
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:45,222
- She called him a baby.
- Baby.

67
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,422
Yes, I'm a baby.

68
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,493
- I was born in 1996.
- It feels hot.

69
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,792
(Acting distracted out of embarrassment)

70
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:52,033
- To be clean cut...
- Gosh, that's hot.

71
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,963
(Gosh, that's hot.)

72
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,102
- It's hot.
- Of course it's hot. It's on.

73
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,232
Wait, which level is it on?

74
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,973
- Level four.
- Right.

75
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,903
Are you giving us piece by piece?

76
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:04,342
Goodness.

77
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,673
(The beef is in.)

78
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:07,283
Salt with herbs.

79
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:11,052
(Meat Lover Seung Ho takes action right away.)

80
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:12,113
That's good.

81
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,122
I will prepare it first.

82
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,153
Already?

83
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:16,882
This isn't too much.

84
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,753
This amount is perfect.

85
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,093
If I don't do it now...

86
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:21,993
Everyone is so serious when it comes to eating.

87
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,493
Yes, we love to eat.

88
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,432
The white part of the meat looks so good.

89
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,633
- That's ribeye cap.
- It's ribeye cap.

90
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,362
It looks delicious.

91
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,572
(Grilling the meat deliciously...)

92
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:31,733
(while enjoying a sense of abundance)

93
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,602
As long as we do a good job,

94
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:35,173
we can eat without lacking anything.

95
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:37,343
- Right.
- But we always do things vaguely.

96
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:39,713
Our result is neither good nor bad.

97
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,242
I'm glad that we got two questions at least.

98
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,382
Right, we answered two questions.

99
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,353
This is Eun Hye's first meal of the day.

100
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:48,223
- It's her first meal.
- Go ahead and eat cooked pieces.

101
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,282
- Thank you for the food.
- Help yourself.

102
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:51,292
Enjoy your food.

103
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,122
Eun Hye, since this is your first meal, eat slowly.

104
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,762
Okay, I'll start.

105
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:56,292
- Of course.
- Go ahead.

106
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:58,033
- Enjoy your food.
- Enjoy.

107
00:03:58,093 --> 00:03:59,293
Here you go.

108
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,163
Did you reduce the heat?

109
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:02,703
It's really delicious.

110
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,333
I will start.

111
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,532
- Today...
- Are you eating already?

112
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,733
Is that cooked?

113
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,712
(The charming guy eats raw meat.)

114
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,073
That was practically meat sashimi.

115
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:13,812
(That's not true.)

116
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,483
Yi Kyung, you can eat this. It's cooked.

117
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,253
You know what I add? Have you eaten it like this?

118
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,023
It's really good with some crushed garlic.

119
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,152
It smells good.

120
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,552
(Enjoying beef with crushed garlic)

121
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,993
I should hurry and eat.

122
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:27,793
(Sang Uk eats abundantly.)

123
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:28,793
(Pickled radish wrap)

124
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,833
(Crushed garlic on top)

125
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:34,032
(And wasabi)

126
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,132
Skate is really good.

127
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,163
(He makes a meat wrap.)

128
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,503
(Taking a big bite)

129
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,943
The combination is nice.

130
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,303
Isn't it?

131
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:46,213
Here you go.

132
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:49,183
The crushed garlic isn't spicy.

133
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,253
Didn't you eat earlier?

134
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,152
- That doesn't matter to me.
- "That doesn't matter to me?"

135
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:55,423
I'm the biggest eater here.

136
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,192
- "The biggest eater?" - I know.

137
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,223
I haven't heard that in a long time.

138
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:04,933
(When the big eaters devour the beef neatly,)

139
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:12,503
(it's gone in no time.)

140
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:15,302
(It's slightly heavy.)

141
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:16,303
Good.

142
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:17,773
We have two cans of Coke.

143
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:19,843
Eun Hye, why don't you...

144
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:24,113
serve Coke starting with the person who did the best...

145
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,753
in the game?

146
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:27,823
Starting with who?

147
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,223
Starting with the best actor.

148
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:30,723
You have to consider this.

149
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,992
You have to consider the person's experience.

150
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,262
- Consider the person's experience.
- That sounds good.

151
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:35,423
Consider the person's experience?

152
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,232
You have to consider the person's experience.

153
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,693
(Suddenly, an acting battle started.)

154
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:43,262
(Candidate 1, Tae Hyun created a perfect drunk meme.)

155
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:48,003
(Candidate 2, Dong Hyun acted as a zombie perfectly.)

156
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:51,272
(Candidate 3, Yi Kyung acted according to the number.)

157
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:54,482
(Candidate 4, Seung Ho struck Eun Hye's heart.)

158
00:05:54,483 --> 00:06:02,153
(Candidate 5, Sank Uk showed the birth of a new zombie type.)

159
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:05,552
Two people will get to drink a lot.

160
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:06,952
(Ranking based on how accurately the acting matched the numbers)

161
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,663
I'd be happy with 2nd or 3rd place.

162
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,032
- The 2nd and 3rd places are good.
- I agree.

163
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,992
It gets problematic starting from fourth place.

164
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,262
The 2nd or 3rd place.

165
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:15,463
(The real actor who's craving carbonated drinks)

166
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,902
(The zombie gets ambitious about acting.)

167
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,073
(Infected)

168
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,812
(I need to get a grip.)

169
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,843
(You won't be able to.)

170
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,642
Isn't it based on your overall acting?

171
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,252
- Yes, while playing the game...
- Yes.

172
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,613
- I can't only look at the zombie.
- Of course not.

173
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,782
(Making himself attractive as a zombie)

174
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,353
(Looking away)

175
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:38,693
Seung Ho.

176
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,692
(Eun Hye picks Seung Ho as the 1st place.)

177
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,222
- Isn't it because you fell for him?
- Thank you.

178
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:43,592
- No.
- She must've considered it.

179
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,892
His acting was excellent for number three.

180
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,393
- Right.
- For a long time, I've been...

181
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,803
I'll place you last.

182
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,832
(The zombie revives.)

183
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,873
The second place.

184
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:54,472
- Yi Kyung.
- What?

185
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:55,473
(Eun Hye picks Yi Kyung as the 2nd place.)

186
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:57,142
Thank you. I'm happy with the second place.

187
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,712
(Satisfied with the 2nd place)

188
00:06:58,713 --> 00:06:59,742
And...

189
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:00,743
(Exclaiming)

190
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,412
It's important to win third place.

191
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,413
(Desperate for a carbonated drink)

192
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:05,683
His dream is to become an actor.

193
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:07,482
Show her your acting.

194
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,483
Show her.

195
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:11,152
(Candidate 2, zombie)

196
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,552
(Candidate 3, drunkard)

197
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,562
Hurry and show her your acting one more time.

198
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,292
(Who will be in 3rd place and win a lot of carbonated drinks?)

199
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,862
You did a good job as a zombie.

200
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:22,003
(Her feedback on the 3rd place)

201
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,833
He did a good job?

202
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,173
He really did.

203
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:27,742
"No."

204
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,802
(Possessed by Zombie Sang Uk)

205
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:29,803
"No."

206
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,773
That was good acting?

207
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:35,782
Dong Hyun, it was difficult to express number four.

208
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,412
How did you do it? Could you do it again?

209
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,353
Show me briefly. Just one more time.

210
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,422
No, this isn't right.

211
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:42,952
(Encore)

212
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,092
No, this isn't right.

213
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,093
(Very satisfied)

214
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,193
"No."

215
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,422
(Sang Uk, forget about it.)

216
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,523
Is this good?

217
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,262
It looks like he did well from watching it again.

218
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,332
If you keep complaining, I'll give you this.

219
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,362
(5th place)

220
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,603
Was my acting worse than the drunkard's?

221
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,233
That was a little disappointing.

222
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,373
- The drunkard was disappointing.
- Okay, that's right.

223
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,243
- Because of the zombie...
- Because of the zombie...

224
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,373
The Coke tastes really good.

225
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,473
Coke is perfect right now.

226
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,243
- I'm drinking it sparingly.
- I have to drink this.

227
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,182
(Gulping)

228
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:12,413
You're right. I should finish it.

229
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:14,082
(They washed off the heaviness with a carbonated drink.)

230
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,653
I definitely need Coke.

231
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,922
I'm a master of pork belly.

232
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:19,493
(Let's eat the pork belly.)

233
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,092
- We can add kimchi and rice.
- Kimchi?

234
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,362
- That will be game over.
- We'll sizzle it.

235
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:25,992
We have to fry the kimchi.

236
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,262
Gosh, look at this.

237
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:28,762
- This is it.
- It will be fantastic.

238
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:29,763
(Adding bean sprouts after kimchi)

239
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:30,772
The rice is precious.

240
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,433
(Adding precious rice immediately)

241
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:35,473
(Increasing the flavor by cutting rolls of sesame leaves)

242
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:37,973
Look at this.

243
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:40,043
Dong Hyun, it's getting wild over here.

244
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:41,643
Yi Kyung, could you taste it?

245
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,452
- You don't eat the bones, right?
- Right.

246
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:45,983
(Smiling)

247
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:48,352
(Handling the cartilage that's hard to chew)

248
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,383
(He's a detailed fighter.)

249
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:52,253
- Thank you.
- It looks like...

250
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,223
I bet you make your wife happy.

251
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:56,423
- He really does.
- Right?

252
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,932
Yes, I do everything for her.

253
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,033
(The fighter's sweet husband moment)

254
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,063
Don't your family and friends tell you to get married?

255
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:03,303
Like the members of your group.

256
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,802
I'd like to get married...

257
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:07,002
in three years.

258
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,503
- Starting now?
- Yes.

259
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:10,242
My standards are getting higher.

260
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,842
- You're right.
- That's true.

261
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,973
What's your ideal type?

262
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:15,413
I like people who are diligent.

263
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,342
Someone diligent?

264
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,882
Don't you care about the person's appearance at all?

265
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:20,282
It's not very important to me.

266
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,283
But more and more...

267
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,883
(His appearance?)

268
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,623
Someone like Dong Hyun?

269
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,593
Wouldn't you be okay with someone like Dong Hyun?

270
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:28,493
I don't consider his appearance at all.

271
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:30,662
Are you saying that about Dong Hyun?

272
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:32,092
(Why are you saying that while looking at Dong Hyun?)

273
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,532
- While looking at Dong Hyun...
- Listen.

274
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,902
- I mean...
- Can't you answer the question?

275
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:37,002
While looking at Dong Hyun...

276
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,102
Can't you at least answer the question?

277
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,432
She's okay with someone who looks like Dong Hyun.

278
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,442
Right.

279
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:42,973
Oh, no. I'm getting tired.

280
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,973
You said that you were having a good time.

281
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,943
I'm attracted to people like Seung Ho.

282
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,482
- It was decided from the start.
- That's not true.

283
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,653
Starting from a while ago...

284
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,552
- When he said something to you, - No.

285
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,982
you said, "My heart is fluttering already."

286
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,382
I'll tell you why.

287
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:59,923
- You'd better be precise.
- I like to grill meat.

288
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,322
That's why I like men who eat a lot.

289
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,323
- Really?
- Yes.

290
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:04,593
- Seung Ho.
- Yes?

291
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,803
Aren't you okay with a woman who's 11 years older than you?

292
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:10,333
I go out with women who are at least 11 years older than me.

293
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,203
My ex-girlfriend is turning 60 next year.

294
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,673
(Full of regret)

295
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:19,142
(Joking)

296
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,173
My goodness.

297
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,113
Isn't Handsome Guys easier than other variety shows?

298
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,512
It was difficult at first,

299
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:27,953
but I feel so much at ease now.

300
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:30,953
If you invite me next time, we'll have fun again.

301
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,752
Are you willing to join us for the rest of the schedule?

302
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,992
- What will you be doing?
- We don't know either.

303
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,093
Are they sleeping here tonight?

304
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,232
We don't know either.

305
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,332
- Really?
- We have no hair or makeup artists.

306
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,832
- But we get to sleep.
- I can tell.

307
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,263
None of you got your hair done.

308
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,872
- None of us gets it.
- "I can tell?"

309
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:47,133
(It's obvious from their appearance.)

310
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,803
We don't get any makeup.

311
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,272
If you invite me again, I'll cook for you.

312
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,712
(Looking forward to meeting again next time)

313
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:56,082
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

314
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,582
Thank you for the food.

315
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,983
(Thanks to her, they had a dinner full of MCC.)

316
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,413
Gosh, I'm full.

317
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:03,122
Please get washed and get ready for bed.

318
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,223
Really?

319
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,222
Are we ending the shoot this easily? Wait.

320
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:08,723
What time did we finish last time?

321
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,162
It was around this time. We finished around 10pm.

322
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:12,163
Really?

323
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:14,163
- It's 10pm now.
- I became very suspicious.

324
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:15,562
Gosh, it's over.

325
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,103
- I'll take off your microphones.
- Okay.

326
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,103
- It's really over.
- Seriously?

327
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:20,233
She's taking off our microphones.

328
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:24,313
(Removing the microphones and doubts)

329
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,613
Lie back down, Sang Uk.

330
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:30,713
Don't do anything, Sang Uk.

331
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,083
Gosh, Dong Hyun...

332
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,082
When I was releasing the ball after winning,

333
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,323
the three of you were playing.

334
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:39,892
(It's still so funny.)

335
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,292
When someone said "two,"

336
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,763
I was holding the ball behind you.

337
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:45,193
I wasn't sure when to release it.

338
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:46,992
It hit him right in the face.

339
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,403
(A moment today became another memory.)

340
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,003
Hello.

341
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:51,773
We just finished now.

342
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,372
It's not far. We're in Yangju.

343
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,502
About an hour.

344
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:56,503
(Tae Hyun is talking to his wife on the phone.)

345
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,143
Today, we weren't allowed to have meat, carbs,

346
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,182
or carbonated drinks.

347
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,213
(Tae Hyun tells his wife about the staff's brutality.)

348
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,582
(Laughing)

349
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,312
(While Tae Hyun is bursting into laughter)

350
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:09,753
(Laughing)

351
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:15,163
(Yi Kyung comes out after washing in the other room.)

352
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,532
(Thinking)

353
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,893
They haven't told us when to get up tomorrow, have they?

354
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,063
That's strange. I wonder why they haven't told us.

355
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,342
They usually tell us what time we should get up.

356
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,543
It's strange how they just told us to go to bed.

357
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,542
Maybe we have to get out in a hurry.

358
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:37,513
(The production crew didn't say anything in particular.)

359
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,782
What if they wake us up all of a sudden?

360
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:40,953
I'm tired today.

361
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,653
At one in the morning?

362
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:45,353
No way.

363
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:49,092
- Goodness.
- They won't, will they?

364
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,063
(Anxiety creeps back again.)

365
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,892
Why didn't they tell us what time we should get up tomorrow?

366
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:54,933
I know.

367
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,063
What are they up to?

368
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:01,003
- There must be something.
- What are they up to this time?

369
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:03,543
Maybe they're planning to break in early in the morning.

370
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,272
Is that what they're planning?

371
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:06,673
To start the shoot right away?

372
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:09,342
(What's going on?)

373
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,283
(What could it be?)

374
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:12,453
(There has to be something.)

375
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,083
Everyone has a bad feeling about it.

376
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,293
(As they're told to sleep first,)

377
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,923
(they get ready for bed.)

378
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,193
- Sleep well.
- You too.

379
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,533
(Unlike the members' worries,)

380
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:34,172
(the night is peaceful.)

381
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,473
(There is no way.)

382
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:39,113
He's here. You have to tell us when to get up.

383
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,542
You should tell us.

384
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:44,082
Why didn't you tell us about tomorrow?

385
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,612
Are you ready to go to bed?

386
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,852
- Yes.
- Yes.

387
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,583
Tonight,

388
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,752
we're planning to sleep together.

389
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:51,893
What?

390
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,752
We're planning to sleep together.

391
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:54,862
(What?)

392
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:57,963
(What are we doing together?)

393
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,762
We prepared a comfortable room over there...

394
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,933
- so you can sleep together.
- What? Over there?

395
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:05,432
- Wait, what do you mean?
- What's going on?

396
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,802
Where is the room?

397
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:07,872
Do we have to move?

398
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,643
Just go to the next building and sleep together.

399
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,072
I'll pass out.

400
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:12,172
Go there and pass out.

401
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:13,173
(I was about to go to bed.)

402
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,713
Will it be something strange?

403
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,042
What do you mean?

404
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,752
You sound like...

405
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:20,612
- a swindler.
- We might take revenge.

406
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,622
- You sound like a swindler.
- Who?

407
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:23,782
You just said,

408
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,923
"Just come. You may sleep comfortably."

409
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:27,722
- Seriously.
- "It'll be comfortable."

410
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:30,522
- After a while...
- What if...

411
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,232
Please move when you're ready.

412
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,733
Should we take our mobile phones and chargers?

413
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,502
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

414
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:36,903
It's hard to trust him.

415
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,373
- No way.
- No matter what I tell him...

416
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,242
We don't have microphones with us.

417
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,243
(The entire group moves in the middle of the night.)

418
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:48,243
I'm tired.

419
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,343
Suddenly, it turned into a horror special.

420
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,853
It's a little scary. Wait a minute.

421
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:54,722
There's something fishy about it.

422
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,082
(It looks oddly unsettling.)

423
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:01,593
(The entrance of the building looks oddly unsettling.)

424
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:03,092
There's something fishy about it.

425
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,162
It's the best room in this lodging.

426
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:06,232
Is it the best room?

427
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,002
- Seriously?
- What kind of door is this?

428
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:12,033
(They enter with a mix of excitement and anxiety.)

429
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,273
- It's something scary.
- This is the place.

430
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:19,843
(The door opens.)

431
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:23,382
(When you pass the dark hallway)

432
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:24,483
I'm scared.

433
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:27,482
Gosh, this is scary.

434
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:30,423
(A private space for the members)

435
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,292
I hate things like this.

436
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:33,393
(Comfortable bedding)

437
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,722
This looks suspicious.

438
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:37,423
(And chamomile tea for deep sleep)

439
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,392
Isn't this strange?

440
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:40,393
(Handsome Guys' private room to sleep in)

441
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:42,933
Well done today. Please sleep comfortably.

442
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,433
Is this all?

443
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,573
Good night.

444
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,973
(Do we get to sleep...)

445
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,273
(here like this?)

446
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,772
There's something strange about it.

447
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,913
This is...

448
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,613
Goodness.

449
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,312
There's tea.

450
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,013
Why is there tea?

451
00:15:58,553 --> 00:15:59,852
Turn off the speaker.

452
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,253
I'd turn it off right away.

453
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,123
(Turning off the Bluetooth speaker)

454
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,552
I turned off the speaker.

455
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:05,553
(Blocking any strange behavior in advance)

456
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,222
- What's going on?
- Can I drink some tea?

457
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:09,563
(While everything seems suspicious)

458
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:11,832
- Who wants some?
- Is it warm?

459
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,592
(He drinks it because it's available.)

460
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,262
Have some tea while it's warm.

461
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,403
- Really?
- It's hot.

462
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:20,833
(Each of them has a cup of warm chamomile tea.)

463
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:22,443
Gosh, it's nice.

464
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:24,812
Have a good night.

465
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,273
Let's close the door.

466
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:28,542
(The lights are out.)

467
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,942
- Goodness, it's cold.
- Let's get some rest.

468
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,953
(Not yet)

469
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,622
(He's on the lookout.)

470
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:36,782
(Sliding)

471
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:37,953
No way.

472
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,492
- Wait.
- What was that?

473
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:40,853
Did you hear the sliding sound?

474
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:46,293
(A mysterious sound that they heard from the outside)

475
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:50,163
(Rascal Seung Ho gets back up.)

476
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:53,573
(Strict monitoring)

477
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:55,973
I'm going on a patrol.

478
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,273
You're so reliable.

479
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:00,242
What is it?

480
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:01,582
Just go to sleep.

481
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,313
(Seung Ho fails to patrol outside.)

482
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,512
(He goes back to his bed quietly.)

483
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:07,652
Sleep well, everyone.

484
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,983
(Sleep well, everyone.)

485
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:16,163
(Tribe Handsome finally goes to sleep at 11pm.)

486
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,663
(Peeking)

487
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,733
(Being wary)

488
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:28,803
(Peeking)

489
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,613
(There's nothing, right?)

490
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:37,983
(It's hard for Tribe Handsome to fall asleep.)

491
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,683
(A moment later)

492
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:47,593
(A creepy melody is playing from somewhere.)

493
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,422
What's that?

494
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,062
(What's that?)

495
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:52,293
Did you turn on the music?

496
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,393
Is that you, Yi Kyung?

497
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:56,633
I didn't turn it on.

498
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,272
(The tanker gets up.)

499
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:00,333
Tae Hyun?

500
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:02,372
- Is it coming from outside?
- No.

501
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,603
Someone's mobile phone...

502
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,673
I don't like it when it's scary.

503
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,743
No one leaves, okay?

504
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,453
- What?
- I'm scared.

505
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:13,383
(Flashing)

506
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,252
(The two are frightened out of their wits by the sudden light.)

507
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,582
There's something.

508
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,893
I saw it.

509
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:20,692
Did you see it, Dong Hyun?

510
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:22,292
- There's something.
- Did you see it, Dong Hyun?

511
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,293
- I saw it.
- Oh, my.

512
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:24,392
Goodness.

513
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:26,233
(This is a horror special.)

514
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,562
What did you see?

515
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:28,702
There's something.

516
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,533
Someone turned on the light in the other room.

517
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:32,273
There's something.

518
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,803
(What is over there?)

519
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,073
(Getting up)

520
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,543
I need to get closer to you.

521
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:43,583
(I'm scared. Let me get closer to you.)

522
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,413
It suddenly turned scary.

523
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,153
We'll be safe if the door is locked.

524
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,452
Are you on their side?

525
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,852
There's something here.

526
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:53,093
You aren't on our side, are you?

527
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,293
Are you...

528
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:56,423
suspicious of me now?

529
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:58,262
- Aren't you up to something?
- I am not.

530
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,792
You made a loud sound.

531
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,802
I have no idea where it came from.

532
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,233
You made a sound.

533
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:05,433
Dong Hyun is suspicious of everyone.

534
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,243
My stomach hurts.

535
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,203
Go to the bathroom.

536
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:11,872
How can I?

537
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,973
(I'm too scared to go.)

538
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:19,783
(Time passes by, and it's 11:30pm.)

539
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:25,793
(It's quiet in the sleep room.)

540
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,133
What's that?

541
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,403
Is it coming...

542
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:40,673
from that room?

543
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:45,943
(What is this sound in the middle of the night?)

544
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:48,242
(Opening)

545
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,943
(Shouting)

546
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:55,753
What's that?

547
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,593
- You startled me.
- What is it?

548
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:02,262
(A lightning strike in the middle of their sleep)

549
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,423
What's going on?

550
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,792
(The hiding production crew appears.)

551
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,892
I was going to wait until midnight.

552
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:08,962
(They're forced to get up.)

553
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:09,963
I was about to fall asleep.

554
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:11,403
Seung Ho fell asleep.

555
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,303
I'll give you questions from now on.

556
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:15,902
(What?)

557
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:18,213
(Questions?)

558
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:22,442
Tae Hyun got on the elephant bus to go to the zoo.

559
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,653
There were 33 people on the bus, including Tae Hyun.

560
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,012
At the art museum, four people got off...

561
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,383
and six people got on.

562
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:32,823
At the library, 10 people got off and 3 people got on.

563
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:36,963
What's the total number of people on the bus when they got to the zoo?

564
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,793
(Seung Ho, wake up!)

565
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:41,803
I got it.

566
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,633
- Thirty-three people.
- I got it.

567
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,633
- Incorrect.
- The answer is 29 people.

568
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,573
Twenty-nine people?

569
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:50,243
- Incorrect.
- What?

570
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,313
Twenty-nine is correct. Am I wrong?

571
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,182
The answer is 27.

572
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:56,343
Twenty-seven?

573
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:58,413
- Incorrect.
- Twenty-eight.

574
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,013
Twenty-eight.

575
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,353
Twenty-eight?

576
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:03,522
- Correct.
- Okay.

577
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:04,993
I got it. What now?

578
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,623
- Okay.
- I got it. What now?

579
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:10,693
Yi Kyung, that's correct.

580
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,863
Starting with the alarm sound a moment ago,

581
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,162
Shortage in Sleep began.

582
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:18,603
(Shortage in Sleep began.)

583
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,033
(What?)

584
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,742
- What?
- "Shortage in Sleep?"

585
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,102
(Forced laughter)

586
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:26,443
(Handsome Guys' 3 Desires)

587
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:33,583
(Appetite)

588
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:40,223
(Desire to win)

589
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,563
(And...)

590
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:49,762
(their desire to sleep)

591
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:52,173
(their desire to sleep)

592
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,943
(Today,)

593
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:02,683
(we will restrict their sleep.)

594
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:07,313
(Shortage in Sleep starts.)

595
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,352
(What?)

596
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:11,183
- What?
- "Shortage in Sleep?"

597
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:14,552
(This can't be real.)

598
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:15,863
Is Shortage in MCC over?

599
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:17,323
What is he talking about?

600
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:20,432
- Shortage in Sleep.
- Shortage in Sleep?

601
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,263
- We're in trouble.
- Does that mean you're leaving?

602
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:23,663
- That's why...
- You'll get to sleep.

603
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:25,333
What's happening?

604
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:27,072
I just gave you a question.

605
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:28,672
I should've answered it.

606
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,573
Yi Kyung got the correct answer.

607
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,573
You may go back to your original lodging...

608
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,113
- and sleep.
- Seriously?

609
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:36,312
That would be scarier for him.

610
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,882
I prefer to sleep.

611
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:40,383
Did you see them make sounds?

612
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,953
Wait, from 36...

613
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,622
It must have been 35.

614
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:45,923
It was 35.

615
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,092
I had to subtract 7 from 35.

616
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,763
That's right.

617
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:51,832
(Winner Yi Kyung gets to sleep.)

618
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,893
Am I done?

619
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:54,393
Sleep well.

620
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,502
What's going on?

621
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:58,573
(Laughing)

622
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:00,603
At least there are no ghosts.

623
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,173
I mean...

624
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:04,273
Do they have to stay awake with the lights on?

625
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:06,813
They can rest comfortably,

626
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,383
but they cannot fall asleep.

627
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:10,742
(The night will be long.)

628
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:11,853
What?

629
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,313
Seung Ho.

630
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,183
I'm not sleeping. I've been listening.

631
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:17,923
I can't fall asleep like this.

632
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:19,053
Seung Ho.

633
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:20,753
- Goodness.
- Give us another question.

634
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:23,622
- I missed my chance.
- Yi Kyung.

635
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:24,693
I'm leaving.

636
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,692
- Give us the next question.
- Good luck.

637
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:27,862
(Bye.)

638
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:28,933
Yi Kyung is so good.

639
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:32,833
(Yi Kyung is the first one to escape.)

640
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,532
I was expecting something,

641
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,103
so I didn't fall asleep.

642
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:38,843
We shouldn't sleep at times like this.

643
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:40,612
Then you get a chance.

644
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,842
(Yi Kyung seized a golden opportunity.)

645
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,383
The lucky ones always land on their feet.

646
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:46,653
As cameramen, you knew all about it, didn't you?

647
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,383
Goodness.

648
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:50,553
You're so impressive.

649
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:54,123
You're very impressive.

650
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:57,922
My goodness.

651
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:59,333
(Yi Kyung returns to the lodging.)

652
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:02,033
- Give us the question.
- The balance in the team...

653
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:03,763
Yi Kyung is so good.

654
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:05,072
Does that mean...

655
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:06,703
it's okay as long as we don't sleep?

656
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,572
Yes.

657
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,803
Then can we stay still like this?

658
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,572
Feel free to rest.

659
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:12,873
You can also drink some tea.

660
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:14,612
Gosh.

661
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:15,812
(After not moving a muscle, Rascal Seung Ho gets up.)

662
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,283
Shortage in Sleep?

663
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:20,283
(Suddenly, Utan says hello.)

664
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,022
(Seung Ho Utan appeared on Shortage in Fashion Episode.)

665
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,323
(Are you really making us stay awake at this hour?)

666
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:26,323
Can we really stay still like this?

667
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,122
(Now that they aren't doing anything,)

668
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:33,763
(they get sleepy.)

669
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:37,402
(Their eyes are closing.)

670
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:40,633
(They can't help but yawn.)

671
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,072
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

672
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:45,343
You aren't sleeping, are you?

673
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,012
Sang Uk. You aren't sleeping, are you?

674
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,313
No way. I'm not sleeping.

675
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,383
The rest of you, I'm sorry.

676
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:55,653
You'll put on a microphone now.

677
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,122
- Seriously?
- Yi Kyung, he's so lucky.

678
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,352
You'll put on your microphone.

679
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:02,522
Yi Kyung.

680
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:04,562
The production crew must be annoyed too.

681
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:06,633
- Yi Kyung.
- They can't sleep either.

682
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,302
(The black tribe members are always on their side.)

683
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,063
- I have no sense of memory.
- Yi Kyung...

684
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,272
I should've gotten it.

685
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:14,432
(In denial)

686
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,603
Goodness.

687
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:17,902
If he keeps asking us arithmetic questions,

688
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:20,073
I won't be able to fall asleep.

689
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:24,013
(Half asleep, they receive the microphone.)

690
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,453
As soon as he told us not to sleep, I got sleepy.

691
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:29,282
A moment ago, I wasn't sleepy.

692
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,892
(I was definitely not sleepy.)

693
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,053
I do the exact opposite.

694
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:36,763
- My daughter.
- Yes?

695
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:38,463
Why aren't you asleep?

696
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:39,993
What?

697
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:42,462
(He's on a video call with his daughter.)

698
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:43,563
Okay.

699
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,703
Bye. I love you.

700
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:51,912
(Dong Hyun takes another sip of the warm tea.)

701
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:53,443
Are we really not doing anything?

702
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:55,983
Do we really get to rest?

703
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,513
What do you usually do when you can't fall asleep?

704
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:01,853
When I can't fall asleep, I watch YouTube.

705
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:05,293
- When you can't fall asleep, - Or I watch TV.

706
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:07,692
read five pages of a book. Then you'll fall asleep right away.

707
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,623
I agree with you.

708
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:11,863
- It takes five pages of a book.
- I wonder why.

709
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,133
It only takes two pages for me.

710
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:15,363
I'm serious.

711
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,402
(With one book, months of restful sleep are guaranteed.)

712
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,403
I'm serious.

713
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,833
Which book do you find inspiring?

714
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,603
A book that I find inspiring?

715
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:28,213
Is it called "Don't Eat the Marshmallow Yet!"?

716
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:31,313
What is "Don't Eat the Marshmallow Yet!"?

717
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,713
That book is quite inspiring.

718
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:35,323
- Really?
- Yes.

719
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:39,493
It tells you to resist your desire to eat the marshmallow.

720
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,293
(Laughing)

721
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:45,062
I'm serious.

722
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,293
It says that it's better to eat it later than now.

723
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:50,802
It tells you to resist.

724
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:54,473
The marshmallow represents your 20s.

725
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:58,713
Everyone wants to enjoy their youth in their 20s.

726
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,412
However, it's better to focus on working hard...

727
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,443
for the future instead of enjoying it.

728
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:06,953
It left a strong impression on me when I was an athlete.

729
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,353
I always had to work out at the gym during my 20s.

730
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,423
I thought of myself as someone...

731
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,423
who resisted eating the marshmallow.

732
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:20,592
(Won't sleeping be amazing after resisting it?)

733
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,702
I got sleepy as soon as he told us not to sleep.

734
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,633
Why do I want to shut my eyes when I'm told not to sleep?

735
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:29,343
(He keeps lowering his head.)

736
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:34,313
(Getting up)

737
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:37,683
(Throwing in bait)

738
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,683
(Rushing)

739
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:41,953
What is it?

740
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,353
What's this?

741
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,492
- Wait.
- No.

742
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,323
- No?
- Do it again.

743
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:51,463
What are you doing?

744
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,092
These are too small.

745
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:56,863
- What if I can't fit in them?
- What is this for?

746
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,533
The next game is...

747
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,003
Pop Balloons in the Dark.

748
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,573
PBD?

749
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,873
- It's PBD.
- Okay.

750
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,573
- PBD.
- What is it?

751
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,182
All of you will put on the work pants...

752
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:11,342
and stuff them with 20 balloons.

753
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:12,913
(Put 20 balloons in the work pants.)

754
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,312
In total darkness,

755
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,153
you have to pop someone else's balloons.

756
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,293
The winner will be the strongest one.

757
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,993
When the lights turn on,

758
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:23,263
- you have to freeze completely.
- Okay.

759
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:24,662
You can move...

760
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,762
- only when the lights are out.
- Okay.

761
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:26,862
- Okay.
- The person...

762
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,863
with the highest number of balloons will win.

763
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:31,362
Do we count 20 of them?

764
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:32,903
Three, four.

765
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:34,333
One.

766
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,273
- Two.
- Five.

767
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:38,342
- Seven.
- Seven.

768
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,172
(The balloons keep going into the work pants.)

769
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:41,813
- Ten.
- You can't put more in.

770
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:43,043
Sixteen.

771
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:45,412
How many are you putting in?

772
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,413
Look at him.

773
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,012
- Isn't it 20?
- It's 18.

774
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:49,552
Count the balloons by touching them.

775
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:50,622
One, two, two.

776
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,252
(Groping)

777
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:54,423
It's so obvious when you look at Sang Uk.

778
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:57,723
- What have you done?
- I really have 20.

779
00:28:58,393 --> 00:28:59,892
It's because I have thick legs.

780
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,363
Didn't everyone put in too many?

781
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:04,403
Can you turn off the lights? I want to see how dark it is.

782
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:06,673
(Darkness)

783
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:08,602
It's very dark.

784
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:10,403
(They can't see anything.)

785
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:11,943
Please get into your position.

786
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:16,313
(They stand as far away from each other as possible.)

787
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:18,513
Once you're ready, we'll start.

788
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:20,952
Start.

789
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,522
(Start!)

790
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:23,523
Keep your distance.

791
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,023
(You can only hear the sound of their moving in the dark.)

792
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:28,122
(Lights on)

793
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:30,423
(Tae Hyun, the weakest, is cringing.)

794
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:33,863
(The room gets dark again.)

795
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:36,432
You startled me.

796
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,433
(Everyone crowds around Tae Hyun, the weakest one.)

797
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,073
(Moaning and laughing)

798
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:46,012
(The predators take a step back.)

799
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:47,643
(Dong Hyun and Sang Uk get close in the dark.)

800
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:49,082
Gosh.

801
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,383
Where is it?

802
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:52,183
What's going on?

803
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,783
(Dong Hyun approaches Tae Hyun again.)

804
00:29:54,883 --> 00:29:56,583
(Lights on)

805
00:29:56,783 --> 00:30:00,393
(The predators wait for the dark.)

806
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:02,993
Where did he go? When did he get that far?

807
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:06,033
(He runs away in the opposite direction.)

808
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:09,632
(Lying in wait, another predator appears.)

809
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,833
(Turning)

810
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:12,802
I can't see.

811
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,203
(The weakest one slips through the predators with ease.)

812
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:17,543
You startled me.

813
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:21,413
(An endless reconnaissance where everyone is waiting for a chance)

814
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:24,913
(He runs away again.)

815
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,513
(Everyone is concentrating on the sound quietly.)

816
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:29,952
(In front of Tae Hyun, who's running away cautiously)

817
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,523
(Predator 1 is waiting for the right time.)

818
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:32,992
(Approaching him quietly)

819
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:34,123
I don't know who is where.

820
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:36,363
(The lights are turned on at the moment of crisis.)

821
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:38,863
- Stop.
- I stopped.

822
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:40,962
(The lights are out again.)

823
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,063
(Pop)

824
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:47,303
(He tries to counterattack when he can't dodge.)

825
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,203
Where are you?

826
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:52,442
He's so quick.

827
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,243
(Another predator attacks him after waiting.)

828
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:58,083
(Sang Uk dominates Tae Hyun with force.)

829
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:59,213
(Pop)

830
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:00,812
(Pop)

831
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:02,153
(Screaming)

832
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:04,852
(He's watching them from afar.)

833
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:06,123
Where did Dong Hyun go?

834
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,223
When did you get so far away?

835
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:10,522
(Pop)

836
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,133
(Groaning)

837
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:16,403
(Tae Hyun's struggle starts again.)

838
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:19,702
(Quietly)

839
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,732
(In the midst of the confusion, Dong Hyun goes after Seung Ho.)

840
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,273
(Stopping)

841
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,513
(Look at him.)

842
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:28,373
I'm getting destroyed over here.

843
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,483
(Pop)

844
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,052
(One for you)

845
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:35,182
(One for me)

846
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:37,583
(They pop each other's balloons.)

847
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:41,623
(He ends up losing most of his balloons and runs away.)

848
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:44,693
(Dong Hyun goes after Seung Ho again.)

849
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,333
(Stay away.)

850
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:48,963
Why you...

851
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,733
That hurts.

852
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:53,803
(Pop)

853
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:55,973
Turn off the lights quickly.

854
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:00,543
(The ultimate chance to bring down the top predator)

855
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:02,982
(Pop)

856
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:04,613
He's taking off my pants. Time-out.

857
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:05,952
Goodness.

858
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:07,752
He's taking off his pants.

859
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,783
- Wait a minute.
- He's taking off his pants.

860
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:12,023
He pushed me here.

861
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:13,952
What's going on here?

862
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:15,122
(It's very unfair, but he can't explain.)

863
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:16,123
How...

864
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:17,823
Put your pants back on.

865
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:20,632
They took off my pants.

866
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,063
Take your balloons.

867
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,333
He has so many.

868
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,562
- Look at him.
- Bring it on.

869
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:25,902
- Bring it on.
- He has a lot.

870
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,473
Let's start again.

871
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:30,103
(Pop)

872
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:34,443
(I'm leaving.)

873
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,582
(Dong Hyun is helpless against the joint attack.)

874
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,983
Attack him instead of me.

875
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,312
Where is Tae Hyun?

876
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:40,683
He only has one.

877
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:43,753
(He's struck with horror with only one balloon left.)

878
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,223
- What's wrong?
- I mean...

879
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,553
- I just popped one.
- I don't have any.

880
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:50,763
(He runs away quickly again.)

881
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:54,463
(He goes into a corner quietly.)

882
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:59,073
(Dong Hyun looks for his prey while sweeping the floor.)

883
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:01,133
(Flailing his arms)

884
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,543
(There he is.)

885
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:05,473
(Rustling)

886
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:08,412
(Thud)

887
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:09,813
Gosh, you scared me.

888
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:11,812
Oh, no.

889
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:12,983
(He senses his target with his feet.)

890
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,923
(He caught him completely.)

891
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:20,253
No!

892
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:22,623
(Pop)

893
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:24,493
(Pop)

894
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:26,263
(After attacking, he gets away quickly again.)

895
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:28,793
(On the other hand, Seung Ho is after Tae Hyun only.)

896
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:30,733
(I found him.)

897
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:33,473
(Striding)

898
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,073
(He removes the protection.)

899
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:37,842
(Dragging)

900
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:39,743
This is dangerous. Turn on the lights.

901
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,482
Cha Tae Hyun is out.

902
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:43,883
(Tae Hyun, 0 balloons)

903
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:48,512
- Gosh, I have none.
- Wait.

904
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:49,652
- I don't have any either.
- Me neither.

905
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,752
You're out.

906
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:51,982
- To end the game...
- Can we do that?

907
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,652
Then I won't do it.

908
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:54,722
Why not?

909
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:56,393
We should play again from the start.

910
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:58,523
- I don't want to.
- I have none.

911
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,332
- Did all your balloons get popped?
- I don't have any either.

912
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,863
- Me neither.
- Who has balloons left?

913
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,202
- Sang Uk has 1.
- I have 1 left.

914
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,463
Why does he have so many?

915
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,372
(Sang Uk, in crisis, struggles to resist.)

916
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:09,573
Hurry up and find it.

917
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:11,073
All right.

918
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:13,273
The game is over.

919
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:14,773
Do you have any left?

920
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:16,212
I have none.

921
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:17,242
- I have none.
- You have none?

922
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,383
I have nothing.

923
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,053
- You have none?
- Do you have any?

924
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,653
(Sighing)

925
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:25,852
(Seung Ho hid one balloon.)

926
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:26,993
He has one left.

927
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,793
(A smile of victory)

928
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,133
(He made use of the ability to play without balloons.)

929
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,933
(He pretended that all of his balloons were popped.)

930
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:38,133
(He eliminated Sang Uk's last balloon with Dong Hyun.)

931
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:39,932
Seung Ho won.

932
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,803
(Seung Ho won his right to sleep.)

933
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:44,443
(Seung Ho got me again.)

934
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,213
I'll go and sleep now.

935
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:48,913
Hurry up and go to bed.

936
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,583
- Goodbye.
- I'm so jealous.

937
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:56,553
(Goodbye, everyone.)

938
00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:58,782
(Laughing)

939
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:00,353
Seung Ho, you're here.

940
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:03,623
Dong Hyun must be resentful again.

941
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,193
Yi Kyung and Seung Ho always place 1st and 2nd.

942
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:08,332
- Right.
- That's what bothers me the most.

943
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,432
- On Handsome Guys, - It's unfair.

944
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,402
I should've said it during Are We Really Okay to Continue This Way?

945
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,803
You're right. Let's have that discussion again.

946
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:16,802
Whenever we play a game,

947
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:19,143
Yi Kyung and Seung Ho always place 1st and 2nd.

948
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:21,073
- It's always the case.
- But...

949
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,583
- What should we do about it?
- in which games...

950
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,443
can we win 1st and 2nd places?

951
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:27,253
(That's another concern.)

952
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,423
Come to think of it, I'm good at spinning on the hammock.

953
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,053
- You were good at that.
- Something like that.

954
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,523
There was a physical task...

955
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:36,892
I did really well on last time.

956
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,263
Right, the photo-taking game.

957
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:40,433
- Not getting photographed.
- Not getting photographed.

958
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,033
Being smaller gave me an advantage.

959
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:45,303
We should play a game that is random and depends on luck.

960
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,573
Those two are just unbeatable.

961
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:50,373
How about this?

962
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,473
We'll kick them out.

963
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,573
- Kick them out of where?
- Here.

964
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,343
You said that quite easily.

965
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,743
(An extreme solution)

966
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:02,012
Let's bring in people who are older than me.

967
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:03,623
That's why I recommended Choo Sung Hoon.

968
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:07,752
Hold on. Sung Hoon's stronger than I am.

969
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,262
- What?
- He's stronger than me.

970
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,893
Still, he's terrible at quizzes.

971
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,693
He's atrocious.

972
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:15,533
I can't think of a decent solution.

973
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:18,233
A 2-to-1 jiu-jitsu session...

974
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,002
would be nice.

975
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,032
Two to one?

976
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:22,402
Don't you have a signature move?

977
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:24,172
A signature jiu-jitsu move.

978
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,473
I have about 10,000 of them.

979
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:27,972
(Should I show you one?)

980
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:31,043
I don't think this will hurt, considering how thick your legs are.

981
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,253
What are you going to do?

982
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,723
No way. The size of his legs...

983
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:42,423
I've never seen legs like his. I doubt this will hurt.

984
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:44,422
(Gently!)

985
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:45,423
Really?

986
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:48,292
(Even a gentle tug wakes him up.)

987
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,532
I was just testing it out.

988
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,903
Just see how much this will hurt.

989
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,402
I grab the leg like so.

990
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,503
(Groaning!)

991
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,442
(A light tug has his leg throbbing.)

992
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:57,672
Are you sure you're doing it right?

993
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,913
That was me fooling around a little.

994
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:02,612
In a real match, the choke...

995
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:05,283
would be held right here. Like this.

996
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:07,512
See what I mean?

997
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,323
- That could break a leg.
- Stop that.

998
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:12,023
That could break a leg for sure.

999
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:13,423
Are you curious about it, Tae Hyun?

1000
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:14,993
I'm not curious at all.

1001
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:17,062
- Are you curious?
- Hardly.

1002
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:18,122
Like this.

1003
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:20,463
We choke our opponents from behind as well.

1004
00:37:21,393 --> 00:37:22,432
Ask me anything you want to know.

1005
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:23,633
(Feel free to ask me anything.)

1006
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,933
(What are we even doing this late at night?)

1007
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:31,903
(Being in a choke knocks him to sleep.)

1008
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:35,643
(The more time goes by, the harder it is to stay awake.)

1009
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,513
I'm so sleepy right now.

1010
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:43,052
Since you're sleepy, why don't you play the third game?

1011
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,053
- Please.
- Yes, please.

1012
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,723
Please. It's already been an hour.

1013
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:48,392
(Half asleep)

1014
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,623
I'm so sleepy.

1015
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:53,593
The third game is Threading in Harsh Wind.

1016
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,262
Wait. That sounds doable.

1017
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:57,402
Unless it gets cold for me.

1018
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:58,963
- Threading?
- Threading a needle?

1019
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:00,632
Am I at a disadvantage?

1020
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,042
Each of you will sit in front of an electric fan...

1021
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,202
and try to thread a needle.

1022
00:38:05,203 --> 00:38:06,212
This will make you feel cold.

1023
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,773
Whoever does it the fastest will win.

1024
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:11,612
This is a fun game. I like it.

1025
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:16,622
Being younger gives you an advantage!

1026
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,782
- I can't see the hole.
- That's true.

1027
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:19,893
I'll give it a try.

1028
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:22,663
- No practice runs.
- I want to see if it blows away.

1029
00:38:23,223 --> 00:38:24,662
A black line is drawn...

1030
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,062
- on the thread.
- Right.

1031
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:27,993
Your finger can't grab it past that line.

1032
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,063
Tae Hyun, look.

1033
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,563
See the black line.

1034
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,802
Hold it right there and try to thread the needle.

1035
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,873
- I see it.
- This is impossible.

1036
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:39,342
- I can see it.
- Let me see that.

1037
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:40,572
This will take ten minutes.

1038
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:41,573
- Here.
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1039
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:43,783
Rock-paper-scissors.

1040
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:45,213
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

1041
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:46,583
I'll go third.

1042
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,053
I'll go second.

1043
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:51,723
(Dong Hyun always goes first.)

1044
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,522
Ready, go.

1045
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:54,723
Are you kidding me?

1046
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,262
I did it. Seriously?

1047
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:59,232
I got lucky just now. No way.

1048
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,393
Hey, that's cheating.

1049
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,333
Be sure to thread it all the way through.

1050
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:05,163
- For real?
- I got lucky. Look!

1051
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:07,532
It found the hole out of pure luck.

1052
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,073
- Are you done?
- No way. I got it.

1053
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:11,142
- No way.
- Thread it through.

1054
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,773
I got it. Sweet.

1055
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:16,243
I got lucky. No way.

1056
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:18,842
- Your record is 13.43 seconds.
- Really, 13.43 seconds?

1057
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:20,712
I was holding it up...

1058
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:22,983
when the fan kind of led it to the hole.

1059
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:26,092
- That's fascinating.
- Right?

1060
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:27,222
- You saw how it happened.
- Sure.

1061
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:28,223
(How can that be?)

1062
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,362
I can't believe it.

1063
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:30,363
(They need to finish in under 13 seconds to be able to sleep.)

1064
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,163
- Was it really 13 seconds?
- Hold on.

1065
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,963
Here's my problem. I can't see the thread.

1066
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,503
Are you ready?

1067
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,403
Okay, here we go.

1068
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,343
Ready, set, go.

1069
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,012
(Slowly trying to bring the thread to the hole)

1070
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:48,073
No way.

1071
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:51,142
(Sliding away)

1072
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:52,213
Tae Hyun, no way.

1073
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,653
- Seriously?
- Tae Hyun.

1074
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,853
You're nowhere close.

1075
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,892
Your fingers are crisscrossing.

1076
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:00,952
(The thread and needle aren't meeting.)

1077
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:05,163
I'm not kidding. His fingers keep crisscrossing.

1078
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,403
(He's way past Dong Hyun's record.)

1079
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:14,073
(It's hooked!)

1080
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:15,073
There you go.

1081
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:16,843
(Laser focused)

1082
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:19,273
He did it.

1083
00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:20,443
- He did it.
- It's done.

1084
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:23,113
You did it.

1085
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:25,513
You've got it, Tae Hyun.

1086
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,853
(Serious)

1087
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:31,053
Do you have to thread it past the black line?

1088
00:40:32,353 --> 00:40:34,253
- Okay.
- All right.

1089
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:35,852
It took you 1 minute and 4 seconds.

1090
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,293
(Threading in Harsh Wind: Tae Hyun, 1 minute 4 seconds)

1091
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:38,722
(By the way...)

1092
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:40,233
You were like this at first.

1093
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:42,703
He's not kidding, Tae Hyun. That startled me.

1094
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:45,332
How did you manage this in 15 seconds?

1095
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,133
- I got lucky.
- No way.

1096
00:40:47,773 --> 00:40:48,972
You can't pull it...

1097
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:50,472
right after it gets hooked, okay?

1098
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:51,873
You have to push it past the black line.

1099
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:56,513
- Are you keeping him in check?
- He can't beat your record.

1100
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,742
Hold it slightly farther back.

1101
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:01,053
Make sure the black line shows.

1102
00:41:01,483 --> 00:41:03,353
Are you kidding me?

1103
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:06,622
- Breaking news. There's a typhoon.
- Come on. That's a foul.

1104
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:08,092
- Is it? Okay.
- You'll be disqualified.

1105
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,393
(He badly wants to sabotage Sang Uk.)

1106
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:10,692
Get ready.

1107
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:11,722
(Focused)

1108
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:12,862
Ready, go.

1109
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:13,963
He can't beat your record.

1110
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,233
(Flapping)

1111
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:19,573
Keep flapping around.

1112
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,073
- Flap around.
- Hey!

1113
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,543
- Flap around.
- It's over.

1114
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:26,772
- Game over.
- Keep flapping.

1115
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:27,813
(The thread is lightly hooked on the needle.)

1116
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,042
Darn it.

1117
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:31,043
(Temperamental Sang Uk!)

1118
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:33,482
(Frustrated)

1119
00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:34,812
- Keep flapping.
- It's over.

1120
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:35,982
(Refusing to give up)

1121
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:37,722
How did he manage this?

1122
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:39,493
- I got lucky.
- He got lucky.

1123
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:40,923
I mean...

1124
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:43,622
- That's insane.
- It could be a world record.

1125
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:44,822
- It was 15 seconds.
- I guess.

1126
00:41:44,823 --> 00:41:46,993
Shouldn't a fencer perform better?

1127
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,132
Seriously, this...

1128
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,463
(It's difficult because of the wind.)

1129
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:53,772
I doubt you can do it.

1130
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:55,303
Finally. There you go.

1131
00:41:57,173 --> 00:41:58,203
He finally did it.

1132
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:01,073
It's sliding out.

1133
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:03,043
- Please don't.
- All done.

1134
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:05,183
(Done)

1135
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,412
It took you a minute and nine seconds.

1136
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:07,612
(Threading in Harsh Wind: Sang Uk, 1 minute 9 seconds)

1137
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:08,613
That was fast.

1138
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:10,353
- That wasn't bad.
- How did he get so lucky?

1139
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,352
- I was extremely lucky.
- Try that again.

1140
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:13,553
I got so lucky.

1141
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,092
- Go.
- And go.

1142
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:16,523
(Was it really luck? Dong Hyun tries again.)

1143
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:18,363
(Go)

1144
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,133
We were wrong.

1145
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:22,462
It's in.

1146
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:23,502
You have excellent...

1147
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:25,502
- dynamic visual acuity.
- It only took one attempt.

1148
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:27,533
There's something you're good at!

1149
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,703
- Suggest this for the next game.
- I got it again.

1150
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,342
- No way.
- The other two...

1151
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:33,672
didn't get to see him do this.

1152
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:34,673
It took you 16 seconds.

1153
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:37,783
- Suggest this next time.
- It's like this.

1154
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:40,713
The needle eye seemed this big to me.

1155
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,052
Even a camel could fit in there.

1156
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:46,123
(He's so annoying.)

1157
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,692
Am I allowed to leave?

1158
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,293
- Sure. Dong Hyun, - Bye.

1159
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:52,623
- you may go and get some sleep.
- You were at an advantage.

1160
00:42:52,763 --> 00:42:53,893
Who knew this day would come?

1161
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:55,763
Justice prevails.

1162
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:56,963
That's justice.

1163
00:42:58,263 --> 00:42:59,833
Sang Uk, I'll get going.

1164
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,473
I was really furious just now.

1165
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:06,842
He was so good at it that...

1166
00:43:06,843 --> 00:43:08,312
Tell me about it.

1167
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:10,142
He proved it by doing it twice.

1168
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:11,912
- That wasn't luck.
- I thought he got lucky.

1169
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:13,053
(Knocking!)

1170
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:15,053
(Knocking!)

1171
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:17,483
- What the... Did someone knock?
- I heard knocking.

1172
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:19,793
- That's scary.
- Can I open the door?

1173
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:22,653
(Who is it?)

1174
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,933
I thought this was my place. My bad. Sorry about that.

1175
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,203
I came to the wrong house. Bye, then.

1176
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:32,262
I was on my way to get some sleep. Sorry about this.

1177
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:33,602
- Keep your doors locked.
- Sure.

1178
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:35,072
- Got it.
- Good night.

1179
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,073
(Sure, good night.)

1180
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:38,243
I bet he was dying to do that.

1181
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:43,313
Teasing them is the best feeling ever.

1182
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:45,443
I'm so happy right now.

1183
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:47,353
This is for real.

1184
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,922
Good night, guys.

1185
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,523
(Sweet dreams beckon!)

1186
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:56,623
(Dong Hyun turns in.)

1187
00:43:57,323 --> 00:43:59,963
(Sang Uk and Tae Hyun are the only ones left.)

1188
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:02,363
Didn't I receive all the penalties so far?

1189
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:04,933
(During the escape game in the first round of Life in Shortage)

1190
00:44:04,963 --> 00:44:06,033
Two, three.

1191
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:08,073
(A single choice landed him in last place.)

1192
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,043
(He had to stay behind and receive the penalty.)

1193
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:15,873
(In the latest Shortage in Fashion, he narrowly finished in last place.)

1194
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:17,912
- That's right.
- I've been receiving...

1195
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:19,283
all the penalties.

1196
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,513
Maybe it's this.

1197
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:24,783
One, you're not as wily as Dong Hyun.

1198
00:44:25,153 --> 00:44:27,523
You're not as sly as he is.

1199
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,723
- That's what I lack.
- That's definitely it.

1200
00:44:31,223 --> 00:44:33,533
Playing tricks, being scheming,

1201
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,933
and acting unjustly.

1202
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:38,503
That dirty little...

1203
00:44:39,063 --> 00:44:40,833
(Chuckling)

1204
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,702
You saw how he kept complaining...

1205
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:44,743
after Yi Kyung won the first round.

1206
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:49,612
Among all the martial artists in the world,

1207
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,283
he must be the biggest complainer.

1208
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,213
- He's sneaky too.
- Yes, sneaky.

1209
00:44:54,283 --> 00:44:55,883
(Shaking his head)

1210
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:58,223
(Tutting)

1211
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,153
(Me?)

1212
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,893
While we're on the subject, just be advised...

1213
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:04,962
that the loser between you two...

1214
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,592
has to make grain syrup for the staff...

1215
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,263
to have with rice cake sticks at breakfast.

1216
00:45:09,703 --> 00:45:10,763
All night?

1217
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:15,573
(Someone will have to stay up and stir the grain syrup.)

1218
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:19,543
Grain syrup burns easily if it's not stirred regularly.

1219
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:22,613
Are we supposed to stir it all night?

1220
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:26,313
(You've got to be kidding me.)

1221
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:30,782
Do you need to stir it once every few minutes, or...

1222
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:32,283
- You need to keep stirring it.
- Keep stirring it?

1223
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:35,393
Isn't there a machine for it?

1224
00:45:36,563 --> 00:45:38,322
That's a good question.

1225
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:39,462
- I mean...
- I'm sure there's one.

1226
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:41,162
- It's hard work.
- There must be one.

1227
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:42,692
Someone definitely would've made a machine for it.

1228
00:45:42,693 --> 00:45:44,502
- There is such a machine.
- Right?

1229
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:47,633
But they switched it off today for the show.

1230
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,573
We're doomed if we lose.

1231
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:53,713
Then...

1232
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:56,813
(Sitting up)

1233
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:58,212
Shall we play the final game?

1234
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,343
- Okay.
- This...

1235
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,183
The final game...

1236
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:02,853
is Cham Cham Cham.

1237
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,722
Cham Cham Cham?

1238
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,852
You two will wear blindfolds...

1239
00:46:06,853 --> 00:46:09,493
and stand on the cushions, facing each other.

1240
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:11,963
When I say Cham Cham Cham,

1241
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,432
either stay still...

1242
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,863
or move to the adjacent cushion.

1243
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:17,363
- Cham Cham Cham. Like this?
- Yes.

1244
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:19,673
But won't we be able to tell right away?

1245
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:21,333
(Testing if they can hear anything)

1246
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:22,803
(Moving quietly)

1247
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,273
- Did you move?
- One, two, three.

1248
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:26,773
This is how you play.

1249
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:28,843
- I couldn't tell.
- Okay.

1250
00:46:29,013 --> 00:46:30,013
That's how you play.

1251
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:31,743
- So...
- Cham Cham Cham.

1252
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:33,383
I can't see anything.

1253
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:35,512
You score if you hit your opponent with your pillow,

1254
00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:36,953
and you fail if you miss your opponent.

1255
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:39,953
If you fail, your opponent will attack next.

1256
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:41,622
Whoever hits the opponent three times...

1257
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:43,023
wins the game.

1258
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:44,622
- Okay.
- Okay.

1259
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:46,022
- Decide who goes first.
- It's a mind game.

1260
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:47,432
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1261
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:49,432
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

1262
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,802
- Who will go first?
- If I manage to hit him,

1263
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:52,463
- I stay as the attacker, right?
- Yes.

1264
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,133
Get on the cushion.

1265
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:57,542
We'll start.

1266
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:59,302
(Who will be the final person to secure his sleep?)

1267
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:00,872
Follow the rhythm.

1268
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:02,443
Cham Cham Cham.

1269
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:06,783
One, two, three.

1270
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:09,882
(Surprised)

1271
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:11,452
(Sang Uk's attack fails.)

1272
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,622
Cham Cham Cham.

1273
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:13,653
(It's Tae Hyun's turn to attack.)

1274
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:16,793
One, two, three.

1275
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:20,093
(Sighing in relief)

1276
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,593
(His heart skips a beat.)

1277
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,763
I felt a strong gush of wind.

1278
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:27,303
It's Sang Uk's turn to attack.

1279
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:29,503
Cham Cham Cham.

1280
00:47:33,373 --> 00:47:34,643
One, two, three.

1281
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,173
(Smack)

1282
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:40,113
(Sang Uk attacks successfully!)

1283
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:41,613
- Nice.
- It's 1 to 0.

1284
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:43,853
Cham Cham Cham.

1285
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:46,752
(He pretends to move but returns to his prior position.)

1286
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:48,092
One, two, three.

1287
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:49,123
(Smack)

1288
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:51,663
Nice.

1289
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:54,132
- This is a mind game.
- Stirring grain syrup...

1290
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,462
throughout the night...

1291
00:47:55,463 --> 00:47:57,162
This is a mind game.

1292
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,762
I have to win.

1293
00:47:58,763 --> 00:48:00,002
It's 2 to 0.

1294
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,133
(Who will win this mind game?)

1295
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,933
Cham Cham Cham.

1296
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:05,343
Cham Cham Cham.

1297
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:09,716
It's 2 to 0.

1298
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:10,857
(Who will win this mind game?)

1299
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:12,627
Cham Cham Cham.

1300
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,227
Cham Cham Cham.

1301
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,266
One, two, three.

1302
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:23,367
(Smack)

1303
00:48:24,837 --> 00:48:28,837
(He can't believe what happened.)

1304
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,646
(He moved...)

1305
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,576
(back and forth.)

1306
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:35,916
One, two, three.

1307
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:36,947
(Smack)

1308
00:48:37,717 --> 00:48:41,157
(He was playing mind games on his own.)

1309
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,427
I really couldn't hear anything.

1310
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:45,986
I couldn't hear anything.

1311
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:47,026
Then...

1312
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,496
I've just been moving around...

1313
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:49,726
to get hit.

1314
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,366
(I've just been moving around to get hit.)

1315
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,927
I kept moving back and forth.

1316
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:55,636
You didn't, did you?

1317
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:57,536
I didn't. I just stayed here...

1318
00:48:57,537 --> 00:48:58,636
and moved once.

1319
00:48:58,637 --> 00:48:59,907
(What have I been doing on my own?)

1320
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:01,377
Oh Sang Uk wins.

1321
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:02,807
My goodness.

1322
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:03,876
It was a good game.

1323
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:05,046
(It was a good game.)

1324
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:07,146
He's good at mind games.

1325
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,217
I'll get going.

1326
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:09,776
He sure is different.

1327
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,417
- Good night.
- Good night.

1328
00:49:11,987 --> 00:49:13,046
Good night.

1329
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:14,287
Good night.

1330
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:16,057
He's so good at it.

1331
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,187
(Surprised)

1332
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:22,157
He needs to do this?

1333
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:26,837
My goodness.

1334
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,366
(He's so glad he didn't lose.)

1335
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,467
Oh, dear.

1336
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,647
(Sang Uk goes to sleep.)

1337
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:39,147
I'm sleepy.

1338
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:41,077
I'm so sleepy.

1339
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:47,587
(Half-asleep)

1340
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,286
(He forces his eyes open...)

1341
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,326
(and goes to make grain syrup for the staff members.)

1342
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,527
What's this?

1343
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,926
(Surprised)

1344
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,367
What's this?

1345
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:00,397
(Amazed)

1346
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,437
Is this really grain syrup?

1347
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,506
Yes.

1348
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:06,706
(It is a grain syrup.)

1349
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:07,876
It smells...

1350
00:50:07,877 --> 00:50:09,277
It really is grain syrup.

1351
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:16,986
To make grain syrup,

1352
00:50:16,987 --> 00:50:18,846
do you add sugar?

1353
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:20,187
How do you make it?

1354
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:24,057
(How to make grain syrup)

1355
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:29,357
(Add malt to grains and make sikhye.)

1356
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:34,597
(Boil down the sikhye until it becomes syrup.)

1357
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:39,537
(It's important to keep stirring it so it doesn't get burned.)

1358
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:43,477
(Grain syrup requires a long period of effort.)

1359
00:50:43,747 --> 00:50:46,247
(Therefore, do your best to stir it today.)

1360
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:48,747
It's made with so much effort.

1361
00:50:49,677 --> 00:50:52,587
If you stir this in a half-awake state...

1362
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:55,217
It's over once you doze off.

1363
00:50:55,657 --> 00:50:58,726
(Fighting against sleep)

1364
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:00,626
Isn't this the inferno...

1365
00:51:00,627 --> 00:51:02,227
from "Along with the Gods?"

1366
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:04,326
It's so hot here.

1367
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,596
(He stirs it with care for the staff's breakfast.)

1368
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:06,766
Both sides...

1369
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:07,866
Equally.

1370
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:09,137
(He stirs it with care for the staff's breakfast.)

1371
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:13,637
(He stirs for a long time.)

1372
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,577
This is...

1373
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:18,947
Others wouldn't have stood the heat.

1374
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:20,716
Had Sang Uk done this,

1375
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:22,817
his sweat would've gone in.

1376
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:26,217
(He starts thinking about his members who are fast asleep.)

1377
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:29,687
Can I take this as is...

1378
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:31,256
to go and slap...

1379
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:32,786
Dong Hyun's face?

1380
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:34,127
(Can I go and slap his face?)

1381
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:35,627
While he's sleeping?

1382
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:38,627
I'll give you a chance to do something similar.

1383
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:40,567
Okay.

1384
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:43,166
On your left,

1385
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,037
we have prepared three games.

1386
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:48,136
I don't know what they are, but they don't look easy.

1387
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,336
We'll now start the games to steal their sleep,

1388
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:51,647
Handsome Guys' Challenge.

1389
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:54,517
"Wear the basketball hoop on your head."

1390
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:56,786
"Bounce the table tennis balls..."

1391
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:58,147
"and score a goal into the hoop."

1392
00:51:58,187 --> 00:51:59,746
Bounce the table tennis ball on the table...

1393
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:02,017
and catch it with the hoop on your head.

1394
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,426
(This is a failed attempt.)

1395
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:05,427
Okay.

1396
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:06,796
Gosh, this...

1397
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:08,227
(He succeeds if he scores 5 out of 7 balls!)

1398
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:10,197
Bottle flipping.

1399
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,296
At the same time?

1400
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,197
How do you do that with four bottles?

1401
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:15,736
You throw four bottles like this.

1402
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:17,507
This is...

1403
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:19,167
This is way too hard.

1404
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,106
Throw gonggi into the air,

1405
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:22,406
catch half of it first,

1406
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,247
and then receive the other half?

1407
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:28,347
(Catch 5 gonggi stones with 2 movements.)

1408
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:29,716
I know what you mean.

1409
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:31,247
It's a special skill, right?

1410
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,086
Choose one of the three games.

1411
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,856
If you succeed,

1412
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:36,656
you can swap...

1413
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:39,456
with one of the members who is sleeping inside.

1414
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,527
Can I slap them with this?

1415
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,097
You're so mean, though.

1416
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:46,896
(Grinning)

1417
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,867
They're fast asleep.

1418
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:50,936
You're trying to make it...

1419
00:52:50,937 --> 00:52:53,366
so that none of us gets to sleep without waking up halfway.

1420
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:54,536
(None of us gets to sleep without waking up halfway.)

1421
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:56,376
You're currently living Shortage in Sleep.

1422
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:58,077
(It's Shortage in Sleep.)

1423
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:01,776
(I feel bad about waking them up.)

1424
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:03,017
My goodness.

1425
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:04,986
Can I practice?

1426
00:53:04,987 --> 00:53:05,987
Yes, once each.

1427
00:53:05,988 --> 00:53:08,787
(While he plays the games, a staff member will stir.)

1428
00:53:08,887 --> 00:53:10,087
This is impossible.

1429
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,927
This won't work.

1430
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:13,626
It's either this...

1431
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:14,757
or this.

1432
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:18,126
Even if someone else...

1433
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:20,297
comes out and plays this now,

1434
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,797
they will succeed...

1435
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,207
in no time.

1436
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,506
If others come out...

1437
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:29,007
and play this,

1438
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:30,977
they...

1439
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:33,307
This is the easiest out of the three.

1440
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:35,917
(His actions don't match his words.)

1441
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:37,946
No, this is hopeless.

1442
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,246
(This is hopeless.)

1443
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:40,557
This is hopeless.

1444
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:42,756
It's impossible for me.

1445
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:46,157
I've at least played this before.

1446
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,997
(He caught them!)

1447
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,666
I'll go wake them up.

1448
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:56,767
My goodness.

1449
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:00,806
You didn't say you'd start.

1450
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:02,406
- Really?
- Yes, say "here I go" first.

1451
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:03,506
I'll do it again.

1452
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,907
(Very confident)

1453
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:07,317
I'll succeed right away.

1454
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:08,976
I'll try. Here I go.

1455
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:10,647
(Here I go.)

1456
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:14,856
Tell...

1457
00:54:14,857 --> 00:54:16,557
Dong Hyun to get ready.

1458
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:25,627
(He fails.)

1459
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:28,667
(He can't believe it.)

1460
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:30,237
Do I try until I succeed?

1461
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,206
(He's shocked by his failure...)

1462
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:34,936
(that he gets serious and repositions himself.)

1463
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:36,036
Here I go.

1464
00:54:36,037 --> 00:54:37,506
(His 2nd attempt...)

1465
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,407
(fails.)

1466
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,447
(His 3rd attempt)

1467
00:54:42,477 --> 00:54:43,587
What am I going to do with this?

1468
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,947
It's up to luck. I don't know what to do.

1469
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,957
(He leaves it to fate.)

1470
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,787
Darn it.

1471
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,787
(He fails.)

1472
00:54:52,427 --> 00:54:53,456
Here I go.

1473
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,156
(His 4th attempt...)

1474
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:57,197
(fails.)

1475
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:00,737
(His 5th attempt)

1476
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:01,936
Darn it.

1477
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:03,366
(He fails miserably.)

1478
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:04,507
How did I do it?

1479
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,337
I should stand.

1480
00:55:08,877 --> 00:55:12,507
(He stands up for his 6th attempt.)

1481
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,217
There.

1482
00:55:22,657 --> 00:55:23,657
Success.

1483
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:26,586
- Do I wake them up?
- Wake someone up...

1484
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:27,897
and send them out here.

1485
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,627
Gosh, but this...

1486
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:31,796
Nobody will get to sleep this way.

1487
00:55:31,797 --> 00:55:32,897
I am now...

1488
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:37,067
(Whose sleep will Tae Hyun steal?)

1489
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:40,577
(Current time: 2am)

1490
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:44,507
(Sneaking in)

1491
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,176
(He quietly walks past the living room...)

1492
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:50,817
(where the younger members are sleeping.)

1493
00:55:51,387 --> 00:55:53,917
(He enters the main room.)

1494
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,517
(Turning on his flashlight)

1495
00:55:57,327 --> 00:56:00,057
(He spots his target.)

1496
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:03,997
(Attacking him with the flashlight)

1497
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:07,767
(Flinching)

1498
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,736
(Laughing)

1499
00:56:10,737 --> 00:56:13,436
Stop acting like you're asleep.

1500
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:15,237
(Laughing)

1501
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,777
(Struggling)

1502
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,646
(Trying to figure out what is going on)

1503
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:23,647
Dong Hyun.

1504
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,087
You need to get out.

1505
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:28,817
- You're next.
- What?

1506
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,257
What?

1507
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:33,727
You need to go work next.

1508
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:36,127
What?

1509
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:38,627
You'll find out once you go out.

1510
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:40,366
What? I need to go out?

1511
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:41,367
Yes.

1512
00:56:41,937 --> 00:56:43,537
Out where?

1513
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:46,437
We can't sleep tonight.

1514
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,707
- What?
- Get out now.

1515
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,177
Get out where?

1516
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:51,707
You'll find out once you go out.

1517
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:05,687
(Still half-asleep)

1518
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,827
(He puts on the mic without even knowing why.)

1519
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:16,237
(He tries to gauge the situation with his barely-opened eyes.)

1520
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:21,637
(But he has no idea what is going on.)

1521
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,247
(Grunting)

1522
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,747
(Grunting)

1523
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:28,277
What's happening?

1524
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:30,586
- Hold this.
- What? This?

1525
00:57:30,587 --> 00:57:31,617
Yes.

1526
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:34,416
- What is it?
- Stir it.

1527
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,457
- This?
- Yes.

1528
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,556
(He starts stirring since he's told to do so.)

1529
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:39,657
What is this?

1530
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,997
(He's still not fully awake.)

1531
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,426
What's this?

1532
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,027
(And he still has no idea what that is.)

1533
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:47,997
Is this jokbal broth?

1534
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:50,537
What's this?

1535
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:52,406
- It's grain syrup.
- What?

1536
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:53,707
- Grain syrup.
- Grain syrup?

1537
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:56,236
- The sweet one?
- Yes.

1538
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:57,347
(But why am I stirring grain syrup?)

1539
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,406
We need grain syrup for the staff members...

1540
00:57:59,407 --> 00:58:00,847
to dip their rice cake sticks in for breakfast tomorrow.

1541
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,517
(Laughing in dismay)

1542
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,686
At this hour...

1543
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,857
(Why do you suddenly want to eat rice cake sticks for breakfast?)

1544
00:58:09,057 --> 00:58:12,726
(He doesn't understand the staff's intentions.)

1545
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:13,927
What time is it now?

1546
00:58:14,127 --> 00:58:15,496
It's around 2:30am.

1547
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:16,996
(Current time: 2:25am)

1548
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,597
It hasn't been long since I went to bed.

1549
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:21,097
I was sleeping, and Tae Hyun...

1550
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,367
shone the flashlight in front of my eyes.

1551
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,507
He put it directly onto my eyeball.

1552
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,237
I thought, "Am I dreaming?"

1553
00:58:29,377 --> 00:58:31,447
"Did I do something wrong?"

1554
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:34,777
It took me a while to figure out what was going on.

1555
00:58:35,547 --> 00:58:37,117
Why am I stirring it, though?

1556
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,116
(He still has no idea what's going on.)

1557
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:40,687
- You need to stir it.
- Sorry?

1558
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,117
- I'll explain the full story.
- Okay.

1559
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,087
If you succeed in the mission,

1560
00:58:45,157 --> 00:58:47,057
you can swap with the member of your choice.

1561
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:50,696
Why would you do this to me?

1562
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,396
I... They're sleeping so soundly.

1563
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,237
How can I wake them up?

1564
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:57,037
It pains me to do so.

1565
00:58:57,637 --> 00:58:59,007
That's how you ended up here.

1566
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:02,107
It was terrible. I know how it feels.

1567
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:04,046
So you won't give the challenge a go?

1568
00:59:04,047 --> 00:59:06,747
- You won't try the challenge?
- They're sleeping.

1569
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,377
What are they?

1570
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,017
What are they?

1571
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:13,616
Read the instructions.

1572
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:14,657
Okay.

1573
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,787
(He checks out the challenges as he stirs the grain syrup.)

1574
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:19,687
This is bad.

1575
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:20,727
(Stirring)

1576
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:23,457
I need to flip four bottles at the same time?

1577
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,467
I'll need the whole night for that. It's impossible.

1578
00:59:27,637 --> 00:59:28,736
(Running the table tennis game in his head)

1579
00:59:28,737 --> 00:59:30,067
This looks better.

1580
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,407
- I'll try.
- The table tennis?

1581
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,266
This...

1582
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:35,137
(He tries the table tennis game that he's confident in.)

1583
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:37,476
This is...

1584
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:38,876
(He wears the hoop first.)

1585
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:39,947
Okay.

1586
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:43,417
(In pain)

1587
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:46,317
(He placed the pointy part to the front.)

1588
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:47,787
It hurts.

1589
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,657
You should've made it properly.

1590
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,526
You can just wear it the other way round.

1591
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:57,527
What?

1592
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,197
Oh, this way?

1593
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,537
This is how you wear it.

1594
01:00:02,237 --> 01:00:03,567
It's supposed to go behind.

1595
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:09,436
(Take the balls out before wearing it.)

1596
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:10,647
You...

1597
01:00:11,347 --> 01:00:14,377
This is what happens when you wake up from your sleep.

1598
01:00:15,217 --> 01:00:16,717
I can't think straight.

1599
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:18,147
Hold on.

1600
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:22,587
(He finally wears it properly.)

1601
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:23,886
Practice first, and say "here I go" when you're ready.

1602
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,287
- I'll practice first.
- Okay.

1603
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:29,427
(Goal!)

1604
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,797
I just need to practice bouncing the ball.

1605
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:34,537
I just need to practice this.

1606
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:37,137
Okay.

1607
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:39,467
(Dong Hyun checks which way the ball bounces.)

1608
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,307
Okay.

1609
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:44,146
Okay.

1610
01:00:44,147 --> 01:00:45,207
(He succeeds with ease.)

1611
01:00:45,447 --> 01:00:46,546
I'm ready. Here I go.

1612
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:47,677
(He's done practicing.)

1613
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:49,917
- Five out of seven, right?
- Yes.

1614
01:00:50,377 --> 01:00:51,447
Here I go.

1615
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:54,316
(Current goal count)

1616
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,357
- One.
- Yes.

1617
01:00:56,057 --> 01:00:57,216
It's so easy.

1618
01:00:57,217 --> 01:00:59,487
(He scores the first ball easily.)

1619
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:01,097
- Two.
- It's so easy.

1620
01:01:01,397 --> 01:01:02,556
It's so easy.

1621
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:03,597
(2 goals in a row)

1622
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:07,267
For people like me, this is nothing.

1623
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:09,237
Three.

1624
01:01:09,397 --> 01:01:12,137
I could even do this with my eyes closed.

1625
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:14,477
I'm joking.

1626
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,937
- Okay.
- Four.

1627
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:17,407
It's so easy.

1628
01:01:18,147 --> 01:01:19,246
(He just needs to score one more goal...)

1629
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:20,677
(to succeed.)

1630
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:24,617
(Will he successfully steal others' sleep on his first attempt?)

1631
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:25,886
It's so easy.

1632
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,616
(Current goal count: 4)

1633
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,986
- What happened?
- It didn't go in.

1634
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,286
(It didn't go in.)

1635
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,686
(He has 2 balls remaining.)

1636
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:35,056
(Current goal count: 4)

1637
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,057
(One ball left before stealing someone's sleep!)

1638
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,426
(Current goal count: 5)

1639
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:40,566
It's so easy.

1640
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,637
(Current goal count: 5)

1641
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,366
- Five goals. You succeeded.
- Okay.

1642
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,507
(Dong Hyun succeeds.)

1643
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:46,867
Thank you.

1644
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:48,937
(Relieved)

1645
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,147
- I'm off now.
- Good night.

1646
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:54,446
Who should I wake up?

1647
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:55,516
(Who should I wake up?)

1648
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:58,317
(Current time: 2:45am)

1649
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:00,547
I should spare Tae Hyun.

1650
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,957
(Dong Hyun scans for his prey.)

1651
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:07,527
(Sang Uk)

1652
01:02:08,857 --> 01:02:11,827
(Seung Ho)

1653
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:16,097
(Yi Kyung)

1654
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:19,507
(He selects his target.)

1655
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:23,337
(He attacks him with the flashlight like what Tae Hyun did to him.)

1656
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:26,946
(Tapping)

1657
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:31,316
(His target responds.)

1658
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:32,886
(Laughing)

1659
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:34,657
What are you doing?

1660
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:37,157
- Yi Kyung.
- It's too bright.

1661
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:38,727
Yi Kyung.

1662
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:40,797
I don't have a choice.

1663
01:02:42,357 --> 01:02:43,657
I don't have a choice.

1664
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,197
I don't have a choice.

1665
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:48,797
- What about me?
- What?

1666
01:02:48,937 --> 01:02:50,597
- What do you want?
- I don't have a choice.

1667
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,037
Why?

1668
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:53,867
- You'll find out when you go out.
- What?

1669
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,177
You'll find out when you go out.

1670
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:56,707
- I'll find out when I go out?
- Yes.

1671
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,107
You'll find out when you go out.

1672
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,447
I don't have a choice.

1673
01:03:08,387 --> 01:03:09,657
Don't resent me.

1674
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:11,627
Darn it.

1675
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:13,827
I'm sorry, Yi Kyung.

1676
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:20,066
(The second member to take over, Yi Kyung)

1677
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:23,137
(What is that?)

1678
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:26,807
(The staff members are half-asleep.)

1679
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:30,747
(Yi Kyung is half-asleep too.)

1680
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:34,717
Stir it.

1681
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:37,377
(Stirring)

1682
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:41,387
(All of them are obedient.)

1683
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:45,627
(Looking around)

1684
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:47,357
What time did I go to sleep yesterday?

1685
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:50,057
Is this the next day?

1686
01:03:52,127 --> 01:03:53,826
(Yi Kyung's bedtime: 11:40pm)

1687
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:55,567
(Current time: 2:50am, the next day)

1688
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:57,397
What's this boiling thing?

1689
01:03:58,107 --> 01:03:59,767
- That boiling liquid is...
- Yes.

1690
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,507
grain syrup for the staff members...

1691
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:04,006
to dip rice cake sticks in for tomorrow's breakfast.

1692
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,147
- Grain syrup?
- Yes.

1693
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:07,976
I don't think they'll eat this.

1694
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,017
(Out of all things to do...)

1695
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:10,917
Keep stirring it so it doesn't burn.

1696
01:04:18,257 --> 01:04:22,627
(He can tell it will take some time, so he gets himself a chair.)

1697
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:27,767
I don't know how long it will take.

1698
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:31,007
(Yi Kyung stirs endlessly.)

1699
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,467
(He spots something.)

1700
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:38,207
(After spotting a game, he checks the manual right away.)

1701
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:41,377
(I shouldn't forget about the grain syrup.)

1702
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,347
(What's this?)

1703
01:04:43,577 --> 01:04:46,247
"Catch half of it first, and then receive the other half?"

1704
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:48,787
Catch and receive.

1705
01:04:49,487 --> 01:04:52,087
(He tries the Gonggi Arirang Twist.)

1706
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:55,257
(Dropping)

1707
01:04:55,927 --> 01:04:58,767
(Automatic stirring mode)

1708
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:01,697
(What am I doing?)

1709
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:04,767
(He tries again.)

1710
01:05:09,537 --> 01:05:13,507
(He's busy practicing and stirring the grain syrup.)

1711
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:19,217
(He practices as he stirs.)

1712
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:27,527
(It's hard for him to put 5 stones on the back of his hand.)

1713
01:05:29,527 --> 01:05:31,627
(He changes the game.)

1714
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,537
For goodness' sake.

1715
01:05:35,467 --> 01:05:37,607
(It's impossible.)

1716
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,406
(Again)

1717
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:40,736
At the same time...

1718
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:41,737
(He practices with 2 bottles.)

1719
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:42,937
At the same time.

1720
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,607
I got the hang of it.

1721
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:51,587
(He sees the potential!)

1722
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:54,087
I'll succeed in it soon and go back inside.

1723
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:55,987
I'll succeed in it in ten minutes.

1724
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:57,956
It's 3am.

1725
01:05:57,957 --> 01:05:59,927
(Current time: 3am)

1726
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,156
Sit here and stir.

1727
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,997
(Yi Kyung shows confidence and even checks the time.)

1728
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:06,927
"Flip all the water bottles at the same time?"

1729
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,067
I'll need to do it all night long. It's impossible.

1730
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:12,837
(Everyone refused to try the bottle flip.)

1731
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:16,407
I'll get a dopamine rush if I succeed in it.

1732
01:06:17,137 --> 01:06:20,307
(Yi Kyung has miscellaneous skills. Will he be able to do this?)

1733
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,847
(Yi Kyung gives it a try.)

1734
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:30,927
I'm getting the hang of it. This is what I can try the most.

1735
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,127
There must be a way.

1736
01:06:39,467 --> 01:06:40,467
Senses.

1737
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,537
I feel like I can do one.

1738
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,037
Is this drinking water?

1739
01:06:50,037 --> 01:06:51,106
Yes.

1740
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,507
(Drinking)

1741
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,087
(He even adjusts the amount of water.)

1742
01:06:58,587 --> 01:07:01,116
("If something doesn't work, make it work.")

1743
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,617
(From "Yi Kyung's Way of Building Miscellaneous Skills")

1744
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,757
(After adjusting the amount of water, he tries again.)

1745
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:12,097
(He succeeds in flipping 2 water bottles!)

1746
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:15,167
I'm getting better at this.

1747
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,706
It's 3:05am.

1748
01:07:18,707 --> 01:07:20,707
(5 minutes have passed.)

1749
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,607
Let's send them up a bit higher.

1750
01:07:24,277 --> 01:07:25,277
Higher.

1751
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:27,917
(He succeeds in flipping 2 water bottles again.)

1752
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,546
Okay. I got the height.

1753
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:31,017
This time, both hands should be steady.

1754
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,816
Both hands should have the same amount of strength.

1755
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,487
(Both hands should be the same)

1756
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:38,887
(This time, he succeeds in flipping 2 water bottles on the other side.)

1757
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:40,156
My right hand is perfect.

1758
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:42,227
My left hand should be two percent stronger.

1759
01:07:42,427 --> 01:07:43,457
I just need to focus.

1760
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:45,097
I'm nearly there.

1761
01:07:45,367 --> 01:07:46,427
The difference is 1 to 2 percent.

1762
01:07:49,237 --> 01:07:50,497
This one has a bit more water.

1763
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:56,337
(Like a scientist in a laboratory,)

1764
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:00,007
(he adjusts the amount of water carefully.)

1765
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,517
With Sang Uk's mindset.

1766
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:06,947
(As if the gold medal depends on it)

1767
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:13,027
(He flips a water bottle on both sides.)

1768
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,457
(He briefly enjoys happiness.)

1769
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:17,597
Why did I fail?

1770
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,926
Five percent weaker.

1771
01:08:20,927 --> 01:08:21,967
(He analyzes the reason behind failure right away.)

1772
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:27,606
(Yi Kyung tries relentlessly.)

1773
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:29,537
I'm nearly done. Let's try again in this position.

1774
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,106
(It's past 10 minutes already.)

1775
01:08:33,107 --> 01:08:35,047
No. I got worked up.

1776
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:36,646
(It looks like the challenge will take a long time.)

1777
01:08:36,647 --> 01:08:38,787
Okay. I'm nearly done.

1778
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:41,917
I'll gain another specialty.

1779
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:44,287
(How about 3?)

1780
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,627
(The production crew has a meeting quietly.)

1781
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:53,496
Yi Kyung, it'll be a success if you flip three water bottles.

1782
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:54,767
- Three?
- Yes.

1783
01:08:55,037 --> 01:08:56,766
- Three.
- Three.

1784
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:57,767
(The difficulty level goes down.)

1785
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,877
(He almost succeeds in flipping 4 water bottles.)

1786
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:11,717
(He flips 3 water bottles.)

1787
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:14,586
(Yi Kyung succeeds in it.)

1788
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:16,717
Yes! Whom should I wake up next?

1789
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:20,156
But the grain syrup is nearly done.

1790
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:21,157
Okay.

1791
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,657
(The grain syrup has been reduced to the perfect consistency.)

1792
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,296
You can go and sleep.

1793
01:09:25,297 --> 01:09:26,297
How about the next person?

1794
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:27,726
It's done now.

1795
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:29,997
(Feeling disappointed, he checks the consistency.)

1796
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:32,406
Congratulations.

1797
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:33,666
(I'm disappointed.)

1798
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:34,737
It goes like this.

1799
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:36,706
(Hung up on the challenge)

1800
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:38,147
I thought you'd flip four bottles.

1801
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:40,577
Have you succeeded in four?

1802
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,576
To be honest, we haven't succeeded in four.

1803
01:09:43,577 --> 01:09:44,687
We've only succeeded in three.

1804
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:46,787
How could you ask me to do something you haven't succeeded in?

1805
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:48,957
We haven't, but other people have.

1806
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:51,427
You want to succeed in it, right?

1807
01:09:53,887 --> 01:09:54,897
This is...

1808
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:56,696
Why didn't it work?

1809
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:57,997
(The master of miscellaneous skills, Yi Kyung)

1810
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:00,066
Let's switch these two.

1811
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:02,137
(He wants to learn a new trick.)

1812
01:10:02,437 --> 01:10:03,497
Go to bed.

1813
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:06,367
I'll go back to bed after succeeding in this.

1814
01:10:07,807 --> 01:10:09,476
That must be it.

1815
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:11,576
(His desire for success beats his desire to sleep.)

1816
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:12,947
You can go now. Thank you for your hard work.

1817
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,217
We'll slate.

1818
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,446
One, two, three.

1819
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,587
(That way, cameras get turned off.)

1820
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:25,387
- Hurry up and go to bed.
- Okay. Cameramen, well done.

1821
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:30,997
(The staff members begin to pack up.)

1822
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:34,426
Go back to bed.

1823
01:10:34,427 --> 01:10:35,597
(Thus began Yi Kyung's solo challenge.)

1824
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:47,946
Why does that one bottle fall over?

1825
01:10:47,947 --> 01:10:49,016
(He just needs to fix one problem.)

1826
01:10:49,017 --> 01:10:50,047
That one.

1827
01:10:54,047 --> 01:10:58,127
(He feels like he can flip 4 bottles.)

1828
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:00,356
I don't think he can do it.

1829
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:02,896
If he succeeds in it, we'll end it then.

1830
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:04,027
Otherwise...

1831
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,497
We'll end it then. Otherwise...

1832
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:08,337
Did you film it?

1833
01:11:09,297 --> 01:11:12,107
(A cameraman returns hurriedly.)

1834
01:11:16,107 --> 01:11:19,377
(The production crew is surprised since they had no expectations.)

1835
01:11:19,577 --> 01:11:22,847
(He's even more surprised.)

1836
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:26,246
(I knew that I'd succeed in it.)

1837
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:29,517
(I'm proud of myself.)

1838
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,527
(A fist bump)

1839
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,466
I had only seen it in a short-form video.

1840
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,367
(Yi Kyung succeeded in it for real.)

1841
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:48,107
In 18 minutes.

1842
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:54,047
(With the variety show deity's help, Yi Kyung flips bottles.)

1843
01:11:54,747 --> 01:11:56,347
Please make way for Lee Yi Kyung.

1844
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:57,817
I'll go back to bed proudly.

1845
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,317
I'll get going.

1846
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,127
(The last ceremony)

1847
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:16,037
(Handsome Guys' Challenge ends.)

1848
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:20,106
(The night of Shortage in Sleep was intense.)

1849
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:23,277
(The night of Shortage in Sleep was intense.)

1850
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:30,076
(Handsome Guys finally go to sleep,)

1851
01:12:30,077 --> 01:12:32,987
(but the production crew returns once more.)

1852
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:40,531
(Handsome Guys finally go to sleep,)

1853
01:12:40,532 --> 01:12:43,461
(but the production crew returns once more.)

1854
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:44,661
(Current time: 4:50pm)

1855
01:12:44,662 --> 01:12:45,832
Sang Uk.

1856
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:48,542
Sang Uk.

1857
01:12:49,342 --> 01:12:51,842
Rock-paper-scissors.

1858
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,072
What is it?

1859
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:55,541
(Oh Sang Uk, lose)

1860
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,682
You lost.

1861
01:13:00,012 --> 01:13:02,152
(The next target)

1862
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:05,492
Seung Ho.

1863
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:07,391
(He gets startled awake.)

1864
01:13:07,392 --> 01:13:08,492
Seung Ho.

1865
01:13:08,892 --> 01:13:11,262
Rock-paper-scissors.

1866
01:13:11,362 --> 01:13:13,192
(Shin Seung Ho, win)

1867
01:13:13,532 --> 01:13:14,761
You won.

1868
01:13:14,762 --> 01:13:17,562
(He wins in this situation.)

1869
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:22,402
(Laughing)

1870
01:13:23,202 --> 01:13:25,572
- Yi Kyung, rock...
- Which hand will you play?

1871
01:13:25,872 --> 01:13:27,841
(He racks his brain in this situation.)

1872
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:29,411
- Paper.
- Will you play paper?

1873
01:13:29,412 --> 01:13:30,412
Yes.

1874
01:13:30,413 --> 01:13:31,451
- Rock...
- Really?

1875
01:13:31,452 --> 01:13:32,452
Yes.

1876
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:34,481
Rock-paper-scissors.

1877
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:35,621
For goodness' sake.

1878
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:38,081
(But he fails to win.)

1879
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,251
You lost.

1880
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:40,552
(Lee Yi Kyung, lose)

1881
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:46,292
Dong Hyun.

1882
01:13:47,062 --> 01:13:49,362
Rock-paper...

1883
01:13:49,732 --> 01:13:52,032
Rock-paper-scissors.

1884
01:13:52,232 --> 01:13:53,701
(Kim Dong Hyun, win)

1885
01:13:53,702 --> 01:13:54,942
You won.

1886
01:13:56,172 --> 01:13:58,742
(The last one)

1887
01:13:59,672 --> 01:14:03,241
(Tae Hyun is sleeping in another room.)

1888
01:14:03,242 --> 01:14:04,582
Tae Hyun.

1889
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:09,051
(The veteran of 30 years reacts even in a dreaming state.)

1890
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:10,952
Rock-paper-scissors.

1891
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:12,591
You lost.

1892
01:14:12,592 --> 01:14:14,821
(Sighing)

1893
01:14:14,822 --> 01:14:16,222
(Cha Tae Hyun, lose)

1894
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:20,762
(What's the result of the late-night rock-paper-scissors?)

1895
01:14:22,402 --> 01:14:23,661
What?

1896
01:14:23,662 --> 01:14:25,272
(What?)

1897
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:29,041
(A famous song...)

1898
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:32,712
(wakes up the members unexpectedly.)

1899
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:35,581
(The production crew...)

1900
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:38,782
(who always loves the members is back.)

1901
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:49,762
(What's going on?)

1902
01:14:56,632 --> 01:15:00,101
(He's sick and tired of it.)

1903
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:01,132
(Checking the time)

1904
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:11,712
(Wake up, my hero!)

1905
01:15:16,222 --> 01:15:17,621
(At 5am, Handsome Guys are forced awake.)

1906
01:15:17,622 --> 01:15:18,791
You guys are cool.

1907
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:20,191
(At 5am, Handsome Guys are forced awake.)

1908
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:21,321
You guys are something else.

1909
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,322
Thumbs-up.

1910
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,622
(At 5am, Handsome Guys are forced awake.)

1911
01:15:24,822 --> 01:15:28,192
(Walking Dead 1)

1912
01:15:28,302 --> 01:15:31,302
(Walking Dead 2)

1913
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:32,771
We apologize,

1914
01:15:32,772 --> 01:15:34,602
but you guys are in the middle of the Shortage in Sleep.

1915
01:15:34,672 --> 01:15:37,302
That was why you played rock-paper-scissors at night.

1916
01:15:37,572 --> 01:15:39,812
Had all members beat me,

1917
01:15:39,942 --> 01:15:43,242
everyone would've gotten out of work at that moment.

1918
01:15:43,312 --> 01:15:45,082
- We would've gotten out of work?
- Yes.

1919
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:48,052
- The probability is impossible.
- We would've gotten out of work?

1920
01:15:48,622 --> 01:15:49,821
Unfortunately...

1921
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,421
(The probability was 6.25 percent.)

1922
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:52,551
It's unfortunate indeed.

1923
01:15:52,552 --> 01:15:54,422
Yes. Some members lost.

1924
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:56,362
Thus, you failed.

1925
01:15:56,992 --> 01:15:59,662
Since you guys are up, we'll play a song.

1926
01:16:01,032 --> 01:16:02,462
(Clicking)

1927
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:10,142
(Why are you playing this song again?)

1928
01:16:14,212 --> 01:16:19,111
(And I)

1929
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:23,281
(Will always love you)

1930
01:16:23,282 --> 01:16:24,352
All right.

1931
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:27,551
You've listened to a famous song by Whitney Houston,

1932
01:16:27,552 --> 01:16:29,322
"I Will Always Love You."

1933
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:32,361
It's an original soundtrack of a movie.

1934
01:16:32,362 --> 01:16:34,191
The climax of the song is,

1935
01:16:34,192 --> 01:16:36,731
"And I..."

1936
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:38,132
You've listened to the lyrics just now.

1937
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:41,701
Right before this part, you hear the thud of a drum.

1938
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,402
- It makes the heart drop.
- Yes.

1939
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,242
(Thud)

1940
01:16:46,272 --> 01:16:47,471
That startled me.

1941
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:48,482
(What?)

1942
01:16:48,612 --> 01:16:51,442
(It's the thud you've listened to just now.)

1943
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:54,852
You'll go back to bed now.

1944
01:16:55,052 --> 01:16:56,481
When you hear this song again,

1945
01:16:56,482 --> 01:16:57,852
come out to the living room...

1946
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,752
and play the drum at the time of the thud.

1947
01:17:01,192 --> 01:17:02,322
What?

1948
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:04,522
What are you talking about?

1949
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,761
The person who succeeds in it first...

1950
01:17:06,762 --> 01:17:07,861
(The person who plays the drum at the right time first)

1951
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:10,532
will get out of work right away.

1952
01:17:12,102 --> 01:17:13,171
What?

1953
01:17:13,172 --> 01:17:14,671
(What?)

1954
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,772
(Get out of work?)

1955
01:17:17,242 --> 01:17:18,412
What time is it?

1956
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:21,071
- Is it 5:13am?
- Yes.

1957
01:17:21,072 --> 01:17:22,411
It's the perfect time to go home.

1958
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:23,681
(Seriously.)

1959
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:25,082
When do we start?

1960
01:17:25,752 --> 01:17:27,811
(The pit of sleep deprivation has been persistent.)

1961
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:30,052
(It's their first chance to escape it!)

1962
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:34,121
(Be the first one to play the drum at the right time...)

1963
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:36,761
(to get out of work.)

1964
01:17:36,762 --> 01:17:39,831
(Wait...)

1965
01:17:39,832 --> 01:17:42,401
(and play the drum at this moment.)

1966
01:17:42,402 --> 01:17:45,532
(Escape the Shortage Mission 1, Play the Drum on Time)

1967
01:17:45,572 --> 01:17:46,702
Go back to your room...

1968
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:49,301
and get some sleep.

1969
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:50,302
(We'll play the song unexpectedly.)

1970
01:17:50,303 --> 01:17:51,401
When the song gets played,

1971
01:17:51,402 --> 01:17:53,672
- people will rush over.
- Yes.

1972
01:17:53,942 --> 01:17:55,681
Grab the drumstick first to get a chance.

1973
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:57,841
That won't happen.

1974
01:17:57,842 --> 01:18:00,212
(He gives up quickly.)

1975
01:18:03,122 --> 01:18:04,821
Everyone goes to the room with air conditioning.

1976
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:07,622
(They take refuge once more.)

1977
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,561
(Do they want us to sleep...)

1978
01:18:09,562 --> 01:18:13,932
(or not?)

1979
01:18:17,762 --> 01:18:22,572
(The one who wakes up easily has an advantage!)

1980
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:29,542
(However,)

1981
01:18:30,242 --> 01:18:34,652
(you'll have move advantage if you don't go to bed.)

1982
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:40,022
(He sees the drum.)

1983
01:18:40,492 --> 01:18:42,192
(Let's begin the mission.)

1984
01:18:42,922 --> 01:18:47,392
(1. Load up on the caffeine.)

1985
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:53,071
(2. Check up on the rivals.)

1986
01:18:53,072 --> 01:18:54,731
(Tae Hyun is sleeping.)

1987
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:58,102
(3. Check the location of the drumstick.)

1988
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:02,582
(4. Block the exit.)

1989
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:08,482
(5. Listen to the song on repeat.)

1990
01:19:08,982 --> 01:19:11,182
(Dong Hyun, Yi Kyung, and Sang Uk are sleeping.)

1991
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:18,992
(Meanwhile,)

1992
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:20,232
(the managers are waiting to get out of work.)

1993
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,132
Maybe they'll escape in this order.

1994
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,831
We'll leave first since we have the farthest to travel.

1995
01:19:24,832 --> 01:19:27,032
We'll leave first for Daejeon.

1996
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:28,602
Since you need to travel far anyway,

1997
01:19:29,472 --> 01:19:30,542
you should go later.

1998
01:19:31,702 --> 01:19:37,412
(Who will escape the netherworld of sleep deprivation first?)

1999
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:41,051
Let's go.

2000
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:42,152
Let's go.

2001
01:19:42,922 --> 01:19:44,082
Let's go.

2002
01:19:44,922 --> 01:19:48,222
(Welcome, everyone.)

2003
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:52,162
(He gets the drumstick after practicing for the timing!)

2004
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:55,802
(He gets to try first.)

2005
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:58,902
(Dong Hyun rushes over belatedly.)

2006
01:19:59,372 --> 01:20:02,902
(Numbers 1, 2, and 3)

2007
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:04,741
(Number 4)

2008
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:07,312
Let's begin the challenge.

2009
01:20:07,442 --> 01:20:10,312
Will we leave in the order of success?

2010
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:11,682
Just one person who succeeds in it.

2011
01:20:11,712 --> 01:20:13,012
He'll go home.

2012
01:20:13,812 --> 01:20:15,012
He'll go home.

2013
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:17,252
May I sleep here even if I succeed in it?

2014
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,852
I'll be sleepy all day long.

2015
01:20:20,352 --> 01:20:21,392
Let's begin.

2016
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:23,921
(I'll sleep now.)

2017
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:25,831
(The oldest member can't get up.)

2018
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:27,732
I won't make it funny.

2019
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,862
Really? Does that mean I won't get a chance?

2020
01:20:31,662 --> 01:20:33,171
Let's begin.

2021
01:20:33,172 --> 01:20:35,701
(Number 1, Shin Seung Ho)

2022
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:38,172
(Focused)

2023
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:41,072
(The melody he listened to endlessly)

2024
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,912
(Distracting him)

2025
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:45,752
(Distracting him)

2026
01:20:46,752 --> 01:20:49,452
(Seung Ho fails to play it on time.)

2027
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:51,521
- Did I do it right?
- No.

2028
01:20:51,522 --> 01:20:52,551
- No.
- I thought you did...

2029
01:20:52,552 --> 01:20:53,791
because the sound was loud.

2030
01:20:53,792 --> 01:20:55,491
- You failed.
- I thought I did it right.

2031
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:56,721
- Seung Ho, - I thought...

2032
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:57,791
- did you do it early or late?
- I thought...

2033
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:59,332
I thought the melody was stretched out.

2034
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:01,462
Did you do it early or late?

2035
01:21:01,562 --> 01:21:03,432
I couldn't hear the melody because of you, you punk.

2036
01:21:04,062 --> 01:21:06,372
We got busy distracting you and thought that you had done it..

2037
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:09,441
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

2038
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:11,642
(Number 2, Oh Sang Uk)

2039
01:21:20,652 --> 01:21:22,582
(Distracting him)

2040
01:21:23,152 --> 01:21:24,651
(Sang Uk plays the drum.)

2041
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:26,092
What? Did I succeed in it?

2042
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:33,562
What? Did I succeed in it?

2043
01:21:33,992 --> 01:21:35,031
(Did I do it?)

2044
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:36,061
He did it, right?

2045
01:21:36,062 --> 01:21:37,062
No.

2046
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:38,201
- He was offbeat.
- Did he do it?

2047
01:21:38,202 --> 01:21:39,732
- Let's see.
- He did it.

2048
01:21:40,002 --> 01:21:41,071
Did I do it?

2049
01:21:41,072 --> 01:21:42,471
Yes. Sang Uk, it's a success.

2050
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:44,301
(Sang Uk succeeds in it.)

2051
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:47,142
Sang Uk must be good with timing.

2052
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:49,681
That's incredible.

2053
01:21:49,682 --> 01:21:50,682
(Tae Hyun missed the song.)

2054
01:21:50,683 --> 01:21:52,281
- Did he do it?
- It's over.

2055
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,612
Can't I give it a go?

2056
01:21:53,682 --> 01:21:54,951
You can give it a go without any reward.

2057
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:55,981
Can't I give it a go?

2058
01:21:55,982 --> 01:21:57,551
- It's over.
- I think he'll succeed in it.

2059
01:21:57,552 --> 01:21:59,122
I want to see if it's easy.

2060
01:21:59,892 --> 01:22:02,792
(Dong Hyun gives it a go.)

2061
01:22:04,192 --> 01:22:06,392
When does the sound come?

2062
01:22:11,902 --> 01:22:13,602
(Dong Hyun plays the drum.)

2063
01:22:14,732 --> 01:22:17,671
(Through experience, he realizes the insane difficulty level.)

2064
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:18,872
Let me try it.

2065
01:22:19,212 --> 01:22:20,412
It's hard.

2066
01:22:21,912 --> 01:22:23,341
Sang Uk, congratulations!

2067
01:22:23,342 --> 01:22:24,542
(Sang Uk, congratulations!)

2068
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:32,321
(Yi Kyung plays the drum.)

2069
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,452
Do you want to try it?

2070
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:37,321
(Can't I go back to bed?)

2071
01:22:37,322 --> 01:22:38,992
You should try it since you're up.

2072
01:22:39,392 --> 01:22:41,332
This is the handle.

2073
01:22:41,392 --> 01:22:43,101
He's sleeping in a standing position.

2074
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:47,072
(A bonus round for an old man)

2075
01:22:47,932 --> 01:22:51,942
(Cha Tae Hyun is between sleep and music.)

2076
01:22:53,912 --> 01:22:55,272
It's impossible.

2077
01:22:55,682 --> 01:22:57,541
(Tae Hyun plays the drum.)

2078
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:58,881
(I'm going back to bed.)

2079
01:22:58,882 --> 01:23:00,282
It was too early.

2080
01:23:00,682 --> 01:23:02,181
Sang Uk, it's a success.

2081
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:03,552
You may go home.

2082
01:23:04,122 --> 01:23:05,651
Sang Uk arrives last...

2083
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:06,952
and leaves first.

2084
01:23:08,122 --> 01:23:09,821
It's 6am. I shouldn't go home so soon.

2085
01:23:09,822 --> 01:23:11,062
What should I do?

2086
01:23:11,322 --> 01:23:13,362
Once I reach home,

2087
01:23:13,562 --> 01:23:15,292
I'll be able to sleep soundly.

2088
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:18,432
I'll sleep in the old people's room.

2089
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:19,731
(Tae Hyun is sleeping already.)

2090
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:21,172
I'll sleep in the old people's room,

2091
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:22,741
not the young people's room.

2092
01:23:22,742 --> 01:23:24,372
(The old members desperately need sleep.)

2093
01:23:24,742 --> 01:23:26,871
(Sang Uk finishes packing up.)

2094
01:23:26,872 --> 01:23:28,242
This fiery pit.

2095
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:31,442
I'm going to leave right away.

2096
01:23:31,942 --> 01:23:34,052
- Are you going to leave?
- I'm off.

2097
01:23:34,812 --> 01:23:35,852
Bye.

2098
01:23:37,552 --> 01:23:38,852
I'll get going now.

2099
01:23:46,262 --> 01:23:47,992
Oh, this wasn't it.

2100
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:49,901
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

2101
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:51,432
- I thought this was the door out.
- Hey!

2102
01:23:51,562 --> 01:23:53,372
- Hey!
- Good night.

2103
01:23:53,402 --> 01:23:54,632
- Bye.
- That punk.

2104
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:00,172
Someone is coming out.

2105
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:01,741
(Sang Uk's manager, Yi Kyung's manager)

2106
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:03,042
(The managers got to sleep to drive safely.)

2107
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:06,782
Sang Uk?

2108
01:24:09,552 --> 01:24:10,921
We'll get going first.

2109
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:11,952
(One feels joy, and one feels sorrow.)

2110
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,191
- You won?
- Yes.

2111
01:24:13,192 --> 01:24:14,651
- Are you serious?
- We can go now.

2112
01:24:14,652 --> 01:24:15,761
(Let's move far away together now.)

2113
01:24:15,762 --> 01:24:16,792
Okay.

2114
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:18,321
Goodbye.

2115
01:24:18,322 --> 01:24:19,732
(Let's move far away together now.)

2116
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:21,332
We'll get going first.

2117
01:24:21,892 --> 01:24:23,301
- Goodbye.
- See you.

2118
01:24:23,302 --> 01:24:27,202
(Feeling jealous will make us lose once again.)

2119
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:29,272
What was the mission?

2120
01:24:31,742 --> 01:24:33,072
It was about playing the drum.

2121
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:37,411
I finished it neatly on my first try.

2122
01:24:37,412 --> 01:24:38,482
Nice one.

2123
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:40,981
(Sang Uk escapes to Daejeon like that.)

2124
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:42,651
I should get some sleep.

2125
01:24:42,652 --> 01:24:45,322
(Sang Uk escapes to Daejeon like that.)

2126
01:24:47,352 --> 01:24:49,662
(Current time: 6:04am)

2127
01:24:50,422 --> 01:24:54,531
(The sun has come up to start a new day.)

2128
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:56,632
Should we have some tofu kimchi while we're up?

2129
01:24:57,762 --> 01:24:59,102
Should we have some ramyeon?

2130
01:25:00,272 --> 01:25:02,872
- Could we get some ramyeon?
- The shortage in carbs is over.

2131
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,241
We're in the shortage of sleep now.

2132
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:05,371
(They're currently in the shortage of sleep.)

2133
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:07,472
I'm going to reaffirm my determination with some ramyeon.

2134
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:10,311
We won't be sleeping anyway.

2135
01:25:10,312 --> 01:25:13,881
(The two make ramyeon in the morning.)

2136
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:15,081
Gosh!

2137
01:25:15,082 --> 01:25:18,021
(We'll just make 4 packets for a simple meal in the morning.)

2138
01:25:18,022 --> 01:25:19,322
How many eggs should we put in?

2139
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:21,052
Three.

2140
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:22,521
- Four?
- Should we add four?

2141
01:25:22,522 --> 01:25:24,692
(But 4 eggs are added as well.)

2142
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:26,561
Nice.

2143
01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:30,862
(Nothing beats ramyeon when keeping yourself awake!)

2144
01:25:32,302 --> 01:25:36,501
(The older ones are knocked out.)

2145
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:37,902
(Opening)

2146
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,382
Here.

2147
01:25:44,982 --> 01:25:46,282
I'll get the remote control for the air conditioner.

2148
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:51,952
(What is it now?)

2149
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:56,292
(Sitting)

2150
01:25:58,622 --> 01:26:02,702
(It's time to have breakfast in earnest!)

2151
01:26:04,262 --> 01:26:05,532
Why are you eating here?

2152
01:26:07,432 --> 01:26:10,602
(There's so much space.)

2153
01:26:11,642 --> 01:26:14,172
(It's because...)

2154
01:26:14,672 --> 01:26:18,112
(this is fun to do.)

2155
01:26:18,482 --> 01:26:21,382
(Blowing)

2156
01:26:24,922 --> 01:26:25,992
Gosh.

2157
01:26:26,892 --> 01:26:28,292
You guys are amazing.

2158
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:33,592
You guys are amazing.

2159
01:26:35,392 --> 01:26:37,932
What time is it for you guys to be eating ramyeon?

2160
01:26:39,472 --> 01:26:42,242
Gosh, you're eating ramyeon at 6:16am?

2161
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:46,071
Gosh, I'm not able to sleep at all.

2162
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:48,212
(What's wrong? This is the perfect time to eat ramyeon.)

2163
01:26:49,082 --> 01:26:51,582
(Did you sleep well, my pancreas?)

2164
01:26:52,482 --> 01:26:54,612
(Do you want some?)

2165
01:26:55,282 --> 01:26:56,552
Sang Uk is gone.

2166
01:26:57,222 --> 01:26:58,282
He left.

2167
01:27:00,892 --> 01:27:03,392
(A new message has arrived.)

2168
01:27:03,562 --> 01:27:05,892
Sang Uk sent a message.

2169
01:27:06,092 --> 01:27:07,261
What did he say?

2170
01:27:07,262 --> 01:27:09,261
"I'm going home, Mom."

2171
01:27:09,262 --> 01:27:10,862
"Gosh, I sent it to the wrong chat group."

2172
01:27:11,262 --> 01:27:12,532
My gosh.

2173
01:27:13,502 --> 01:27:15,642
What's his problem?

2174
01:27:17,102 --> 01:27:18,141
(The Handsome Guys all wake up at 6:20am)

2175
01:27:18,142 --> 01:27:19,542
Give us the question.

2176
01:27:19,912 --> 01:27:21,772
We should eat outside now that they're awake.

2177
01:27:22,942 --> 01:27:25,041
Gosh, I've been out of it all day.

2178
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:26,311
(Shortage in sleep)

2179
01:27:26,312 --> 01:27:27,382
This is bad.

2180
01:27:29,322 --> 01:27:32,692
(Why are you so exhausted?)

2181
01:27:33,592 --> 01:27:36,962
(Being in your 40s is tough.)

2182
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:38,892
As you all are out,

2183
01:27:39,492 --> 01:27:41,162
- I'll give an explanation.
- Okay.

2184
01:27:41,932 --> 01:27:44,702
This game is a 2-on-2 team match.

2185
01:27:45,432 --> 01:27:46,632
Two people will be able to go home!

2186
01:27:46,802 --> 01:27:48,302
Right. Two people will be able to go home.

2187
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:49,902
Here are the rules.

2188
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:55,911
(Escape the Shortage Mission 2, Pillow Timing)

2189
01:27:55,912 --> 01:27:59,181
One person will sit against the wall and push the pillow.

2190
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:00,481
(One person will push the pillow into the rectangle.)

2191
01:28:00,482 --> 01:28:02,682
The other person will be seated...

2192
01:28:02,782 --> 01:28:05,482
and have to time it correctly to rest the head on the pillow.

2193
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:07,821
Shall we team up, Tae Hyun?

2194
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,292
- Let's do this.
- Right.

2195
01:28:09,592 --> 01:28:12,091
Let's do this.

2196
01:28:12,092 --> 01:28:13,662
- We can do this, right?
- Yes. Let's do this.

2197
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:15,761
You should push the pillow.

2198
01:28:15,762 --> 01:28:17,701
Do it like you're kicking a ball.

2199
01:28:17,702 --> 01:28:19,872
(Team YB, game geniuses)

2200
01:28:20,072 --> 01:28:21,601
Do we keep taking turns until we make it?

2201
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:23,041
Yes. Both teams will keep taking turns.

2202
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:24,442
It's important to start, though.

2203
01:28:24,702 --> 01:28:26,771
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- The two of us will play.

2204
01:28:26,772 --> 01:28:28,611
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2205
01:28:28,612 --> 01:28:29,711
(Yi Kyung wins.)

2206
01:28:29,712 --> 01:28:30,842
Okay. I won.

2207
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:32,382
It's okay. We'll do it after taking a look.

2208
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,612
- Right.
- We'll do it after taking a look.

2209
01:28:33,852 --> 01:28:35,281
We have the advantage as we can take a look.

2210
01:28:35,282 --> 01:28:37,082
- Right. It's better to take a look.
- Sit.

2211
01:28:37,652 --> 01:28:39,391
(Practice time)

2212
01:28:39,392 --> 01:28:40,422
All right.

2213
01:28:40,592 --> 01:28:43,392
(Working hard)

2214
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:44,722
I'll trust you.

2215
01:28:44,822 --> 01:28:46,461
- Am I the one lying down?
- Yes.

2216
01:28:46,462 --> 01:28:49,202
There's something I want to check.

2217
01:28:49,762 --> 01:28:51,901
(Checking the speed of reaching the floor)

2218
01:28:51,902 --> 01:28:53,132
You should do that.

2219
01:28:53,532 --> 01:28:55,972
I'm much slower going up and down.

2220
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,402
- Okay.
- Right.

2221
01:28:57,902 --> 01:28:59,972
- Count to three, Seung Ho.
- Right.

2222
01:29:00,072 --> 01:29:01,641
I'll come down at three with all my trust in you.

2223
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,741
(Yi Kyung lies down for Team YB.)

2224
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:03,842
I'll trust you.

2225
01:29:04,312 --> 01:29:06,082
It'll be better if it's slower.

2226
01:29:06,452 --> 01:29:08,552
One, two, three.

2227
01:29:09,122 --> 01:29:10,251
- This is better?
- Yes.

2228
01:29:10,252 --> 01:29:11,252
Okay.

2229
01:29:11,253 --> 01:29:12,651
How will that work?

2230
01:29:12,652 --> 01:29:14,952
We should lie down quickly.

2231
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:17,691
We'll keep switching to take turns.

2232
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:19,022
- Should we go for it right away?
- Yes.

2233
01:29:19,162 --> 01:29:20,461
- Will you start?
- Yes. Here we go!

2234
01:29:20,462 --> 01:29:21,531
(Team YB's 1st attempt)

2235
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:23,032
One, two, three.

2236
01:29:24,832 --> 01:29:25,872
You have failed!

2237
01:29:26,772 --> 01:29:27,801
(Team YB fails with their 1st attempt.)

2238
01:29:27,802 --> 01:29:29,032
- That was close.
- Hold on.

2239
01:29:29,942 --> 01:29:31,801
I can get it into the rectangle.

2240
01:29:31,802 --> 01:29:33,171
(It's hard to get the timing right.)

2241
01:29:33,172 --> 01:29:35,111
Go right away. We'll need a few attempts.

2242
01:29:35,112 --> 01:29:36,142
Right.

2243
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:38,641
(But...)

2244
01:29:38,642 --> 01:29:41,582
(it's Tae Hyun who is the one to step forward?)

2245
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:45,582
(A while ago)

2246
01:29:45,992 --> 01:29:47,552
- Two, three.
- Right.

2247
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:49,561
- It seems right, doesn't it?
- Yes.

2248
01:29:49,562 --> 01:29:51,261
- One, two, three.
- Is it better for me to go down?

2249
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:52,361
It'll be better for you to push it, right?

2250
01:29:52,362 --> 01:29:53,491
- Right here.
- Right.

2251
01:29:53,492 --> 01:29:54,591
- It seems right, doesn't it?
- Yes.

2252
01:29:54,592 --> 01:29:55,631
Hold on.

2253
01:29:55,632 --> 01:29:58,162
We can get it done right away like that. It's really easy.

2254
01:29:58,362 --> 01:29:59,372
What?

2255
01:30:00,032 --> 01:30:01,972
The production crew didn't think about this.

2256
01:30:02,372 --> 01:30:03,702
We could get it done right away.

2257
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:05,871
(Is that so?)

2258
01:30:05,872 --> 01:30:07,442
You have to lie down quickly.

2259
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:09,242
Your head should catch it right away.

2260
01:30:09,342 --> 01:30:11,081
It won't work...

2261
01:30:11,082 --> 01:30:12,681
if we try to get it perfectly done.

2262
01:30:12,682 --> 01:30:14,512
I can come down quickly if you signal me.

2263
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:16,281
- It'll be fine.
- It just needs to be similar.

2264
01:30:16,282 --> 01:30:17,381
Look.

2265
01:30:17,382 --> 01:30:18,752
I can get the timing right.

2266
01:30:19,692 --> 01:30:21,792
(What is the athletic genius's strategy?)

2267
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:24,791
(It's Team OB's turn!)

2268
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:26,092
- You'll push the pillow?
- Like this?

2269
01:30:27,392 --> 01:30:28,392
- There.
- Okay.

2270
01:30:28,393 --> 01:30:30,362
- I'll come down like this.
- You have to go down a little.

2271
01:30:30,532 --> 01:30:32,061
Your shoulders are high up.

2272
01:30:32,062 --> 01:30:34,302
Okay. Let's go.

2273
01:30:34,632 --> 01:30:36,242
Could you come down quicker?

2274
01:30:37,402 --> 01:30:38,441
No?

2275
01:30:38,442 --> 01:30:39,442
(I'm sorry.)

2276
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:40,712
- There you go.
- Like this?

2277
01:30:41,072 --> 01:30:42,981
(There you go.)

2278
01:30:42,982 --> 01:30:44,282
- Like this?
- Right.

2279
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:45,741
Let's do it.

2280
01:30:45,742 --> 01:30:47,182
- Go down?
- Yes.

2281
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:50,781
- How?
- Lie down.

2282
01:30:50,782 --> 01:30:52,551
- Should I count to three?
- Lie down.

2283
01:30:52,552 --> 01:30:54,152
- Just lie down.
- What's better for you?

2284
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:55,861
I can see everything. You just need to lie down.

2285
01:30:55,862 --> 01:30:56,862
Okay.

2286
01:30:56,863 --> 01:30:59,432
(Team OB's 1st attempt)

2287
01:31:00,632 --> 01:31:01,691
You have to lie down quickly.

2288
01:31:01,692 --> 01:31:03,561
(The pillow gets pushed!)

2289
01:31:03,562 --> 01:31:04,802
- Right.
- Two, three.

2290
01:31:07,002 --> 01:31:09,472
- It just took so long to get ready.
- Gosh.

2291
01:31:09,742 --> 01:31:11,742
He sounded so confident.

2292
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:13,472
"I can do this."

2293
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:16,041
"The production crew didn't think about this."

2294
01:31:16,042 --> 01:31:18,242
- He kept saying this.
- You should push the pillow.

2295
01:31:18,342 --> 01:31:19,412
Gosh!

2296
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:22,282
Let's just copy them.

2297
01:31:23,222 --> 01:31:24,251
You push the pillow.

2298
01:31:24,252 --> 01:31:26,552
- What strategy was that?
- What?

2299
01:31:26,952 --> 01:31:29,191
We have hope. Hold on.

2300
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:30,322
(Team YB gets another chance.)

2301
01:31:30,622 --> 01:31:32,091
Show me how you'll lie down one more time.

2302
01:31:32,092 --> 01:31:33,631
I'll match your count.

2303
01:31:33,632 --> 01:31:35,231
No. You should get my timing.

2304
01:31:35,232 --> 01:31:37,232
It's better for me to match your timing of coming down.

2305
01:31:37,302 --> 01:31:38,661
I'll do it accurately.

2306
01:31:38,662 --> 01:31:39,871
One, two, three.

2307
01:31:39,872 --> 01:31:41,771
Okay. That's enough.

2308
01:31:41,772 --> 01:31:43,502
There's no need for more. We don't have to practice.

2309
01:31:43,802 --> 01:31:46,042
(How will they do?)

2310
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:47,971
- Gosh.
- We'll go right away. Here we go.

2311
01:31:47,972 --> 01:31:49,141
(Team YB's 2nd attempt)

2312
01:31:49,142 --> 01:31:51,812
One, two, three.

2313
01:31:52,612 --> 01:31:53,782
One, two, three.

2314
01:31:54,582 --> 01:31:55,582
Okay.

2315
01:31:56,922 --> 01:31:58,022
Did we do it?

2316
01:31:58,222 --> 01:32:00,022
- I'm staying still.
- We did it.

2317
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:01,492
I'm staying still right now.

2318
01:32:03,562 --> 01:32:05,692
Did they do it? It has to be in the rectangle.

2319
01:32:05,762 --> 01:32:07,431
Film it from the top to check.

2320
01:32:07,432 --> 01:32:09,502
I'm staying still. I haven't moved at all.

2321
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:11,062
(He hasn't moved at all.)

2322
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,232
I haven't moved at all.

2323
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,501
It can't be better than this.

2324
01:32:14,502 --> 01:32:15,901
We'll give you another turn.

2325
01:32:15,902 --> 01:32:17,741
This was good enough for us,

2326
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:18,742
but we'll still give you a turn.

2327
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:21,241
- If you do better than us...
- There's no doubt about this.

2328
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:23,411
- They'll be given another turn.
- Right.

2329
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:24,442
Okay.

2330
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,512
It's better for the one with experience to do it.

2331
01:32:27,752 --> 01:32:29,752
- Okay. I got it.
- Good.

2332
01:32:29,852 --> 01:32:31,682
- Call out that you're ready.
- Here we go!

2333
01:32:32,252 --> 01:32:33,392
- I'm going to go down.
- Okay.

2334
01:32:34,552 --> 01:32:36,492
Hold on. You have to tell me when.

2335
01:32:36,922 --> 01:32:38,222
Tell me when you're going to start.

2336
01:32:39,192 --> 01:32:40,691
(You said you didn't need a signal earlier.)

2337
01:32:40,692 --> 01:32:42,601
- Will you start?
- What are you two talking about?

2338
01:32:42,602 --> 01:32:44,102
Hold on, Tae Hyun.

2339
01:32:44,762 --> 01:32:46,731
I can just lie down then?

2340
01:32:46,732 --> 01:32:47,732
Yes.

2341
01:32:47,733 --> 01:32:49,032
We can't make new teams, can we?

2342
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:51,872
I was just wondering.

2343
01:32:52,272 --> 01:32:53,672
- I was just wondering.
- That can't happen.

2344
01:32:53,872 --> 01:32:55,011
- Shall we start?
- Yes.

2345
01:32:55,012 --> 01:32:57,682
All right. One, two, three.

2346
01:32:57,842 --> 01:33:01,052
(Let's go home!)

2347
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:03,722
(Having a bad feeling about it)

2348
01:33:05,922 --> 01:33:07,392
Why did you come down so quickly?

2349
01:33:08,152 --> 01:33:10,861
Why are you blaming me?

2350
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:14,731
(Team YB's pillow was in the rectangle a lot more.)

2351
01:33:14,732 --> 01:33:16,831
- Gosh!
- Yi Kyung and Seung Ho win.

2352
01:33:16,832 --> 01:33:18,202
(Team YB wins!)

2353
01:33:19,772 --> 01:33:22,471
We ate ramyeon, we kept the older ones awake,

2354
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:23,872
and we won the game.

2355
01:33:24,902 --> 01:33:26,612
You two can head home right away.

2356
01:33:27,572 --> 01:33:30,282
We'll get going. When will the next game happen?

2357
01:33:30,382 --> 01:33:32,542
- Sorry?
- When will the next game happen?

2358
01:33:33,552 --> 01:33:35,252
They have to go back to sleep now.

2359
01:33:36,122 --> 01:33:37,251
I'm feeling so exhausted.

2360
01:33:37,252 --> 01:33:38,452
I'll escort you to your bed.

2361
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:43,462
(Please let us go home.)

2362
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:47,292
(For the 16th time, the lights are turned off.)

2363
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:49,032
I can't even fall asleep.

2364
01:33:52,432 --> 01:33:54,502
We won't be able to sleep. It's over for us.

2365
01:33:54,972 --> 01:33:56,472
This is bad. How will we survive today?

2366
01:33:58,372 --> 01:33:59,971
Thank you for letting us eat.

2367
01:33:59,972 --> 01:34:01,542
(Seung Ho cleans up the counter.)

2368
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:04,641
(He gets done with cleaning up.)

2369
01:34:04,642 --> 01:34:05,712
Let's go.

2370
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:10,822
Attention! Bow.

2371
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:12,322
Goodbye.

2372
01:34:12,582 --> 01:34:13,721
Shortage over.

2373
01:34:13,722 --> 01:34:15,091
(The life in shortage is over.)

2374
01:34:15,092 --> 01:34:17,792
- We were in great shortage again.
- Right. Goodbye.

2375
01:34:18,762 --> 01:34:20,031
It feels just like an escape.

2376
01:34:20,032 --> 01:34:22,032
It feels sweet. It feels like "The Shawshank Redemption."

2377
01:34:22,262 --> 01:34:23,432
How refreshing.

2378
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:25,162
I'm out.

2379
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:26,731
I won't fail twice.

2380
01:34:26,732 --> 01:34:27,732
(Current time: 7:50am)

2381
01:34:27,733 --> 01:34:29,202
That's how life is.

2382
01:34:33,872 --> 01:34:38,882
(The 5 psychological stages of the pitiful ones that are left)

2383
01:34:39,812 --> 01:34:43,052
It's much better to stay until the end.

2384
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:44,952
You can be on TV longer.

2385
01:34:45,282 --> 01:34:47,392
Think about Sang Uk.

2386
01:34:47,422 --> 01:34:49,561
He came late and left early. He was here only for a while.

2387
01:34:49,562 --> 01:34:51,661
He won't appear much on the screen.

2388
01:34:51,662 --> 01:34:53,531
Sang Uk can't be like that.

2389
01:34:53,532 --> 01:34:54,991
(Stage 2: Anger)

2390
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:57,301
Sang Uk lacks experience.

2391
01:34:57,302 --> 01:34:59,162
- Why get it right?
- Right.

2392
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:01,431
He should've appeared a bit more on TV.

2393
01:35:01,432 --> 01:35:02,602
Right.

2394
01:35:02,632 --> 01:35:04,201
You should get more screentime then.

2395
01:35:04,202 --> 01:35:07,712
No. I've filmed enough. There's too much of me.

2396
01:35:09,512 --> 01:35:10,741
Gosh, I feel exhausted.

2397
01:35:10,742 --> 01:35:12,081
(Stage 4: Depression)

2398
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:14,282
How did I work out all night in the past?

2399
01:35:15,282 --> 01:35:17,181
I'll explain the next game as it gets prepared.

2400
01:35:17,182 --> 01:35:18,351
It's Cham Cham Cham.

2401
01:35:18,352 --> 01:35:19,592
This is hard.

2402
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:22,961
I've played this with Sang Uk.

2403
01:35:22,962 --> 01:35:24,192
I don't know what it is at all.

2404
01:35:24,922 --> 01:35:26,022
Is it based on luck?

2405
01:35:26,392 --> 01:35:28,832
No. You'll love it. It's a mind game.

2406
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,002
Gosh, I can't see a thing.

2407
01:35:32,432 --> 01:35:34,071
When you win three points first,

2408
01:35:34,072 --> 01:35:36,071
- you can go home right away.
- Right.

2409
01:35:36,072 --> 01:35:38,672
- This is what the loser will do.
- Right.

2410
01:35:39,272 --> 01:35:42,241
You two worked hard to stir the grain syrup, right?

2411
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:43,341
Right.

2412
01:35:43,342 --> 01:35:46,752
(It has been made thanks to your effort.)

2413
01:35:47,012 --> 01:35:48,381
- Right.
- The loser will pick up...

2414
01:35:48,382 --> 01:35:49,981
the rice cakes that will be eaten with it.

2415
01:35:49,982 --> 01:35:51,282
What? The rice cakes?

2416
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:52,722
The loser has to pick up the rice cakes.

2417
01:35:53,352 --> 01:35:56,292
- Where?
- The rice cake sticks were ordered.

2418
01:35:56,562 --> 01:35:59,022
Gosh, that's a hassle.

2419
01:35:59,962 --> 01:36:02,801
The loser will bring us the rice cakes.

2420
01:36:02,802 --> 01:36:04,731
- We have to decide.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2421
01:36:04,732 --> 01:36:05,801
Okay.

2422
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:07,332
Why play scissors while pretending to play rock?

2423
01:36:07,532 --> 01:36:08,702
- All right.
- Gosh.

2424
01:36:09,002 --> 01:36:10,742
- We'll begin.
- It's the first to three.

2425
01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:12,572
Tae Hyun will start.

2426
01:36:12,702 --> 01:36:14,712
Cham Cham Cham!

2427
01:36:15,112 --> 01:36:16,812
Cham Cham Cham!

2428
01:36:18,342 --> 01:36:20,252
One, two, three.

2429
01:36:27,522 --> 01:36:29,391
My time attack that I couldn't do earlier!

2430
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:30,522
It's 1 to 0.

2431
01:36:30,692 --> 01:36:31,722
Did I make it obvious?

2432
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:34,162
You won't be able to tell at all.

2433
01:36:34,562 --> 01:36:36,732
I moved around a lot earlier.

2434
01:36:37,132 --> 01:36:38,402
All right.

2435
01:36:38,962 --> 01:36:40,602
Cham Cham Cham!

2436
01:36:43,602 --> 01:36:48,042
(The tips of their feet becoming alluring all of a sudden.)

2437
01:36:49,912 --> 01:36:52,081
(Feel your opponent's movement!)

2438
01:36:52,082 --> 01:36:53,412
One, two, three.

2439
01:36:53,912 --> 01:36:54,912
(Shouting)

2440
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:56,352
One, two, three.

2441
01:36:57,952 --> 01:36:58,952
(Laughing)

2442
01:36:58,953 --> 01:37:00,351
The attacker has changed.

2443
01:37:00,352 --> 01:37:01,522
(Dong Hyun will attack now!)

2444
01:37:03,662 --> 01:37:04,922
Cham Cham Cham!

2445
01:37:09,702 --> 01:37:11,032
One, two, three.

2446
01:37:13,502 --> 01:37:14,502
(Groaning)

2447
01:37:16,072 --> 01:37:18,302
(It's Tae Hyun's attack again.)

2448
01:37:19,172 --> 01:37:20,272
Here we go.

2449
01:37:20,772 --> 01:37:23,012
- I get to attack now, right?
- Yes.

2450
01:37:24,742 --> 01:37:26,352
Cham Cham Cham!

2451
01:37:27,352 --> 01:37:30,322
(He's moving to get hit?)

2452
01:37:32,992 --> 01:37:34,722
(Rustling)

2453
01:37:35,422 --> 01:37:36,892
One, two, three.

2454
01:37:41,032 --> 01:37:43,332
- Did I get hit?
- Yes. You were on the same line.

2455
01:37:44,432 --> 01:37:45,801
(Tae Hyun can go home with one more hit.)

2456
01:37:45,802 --> 01:37:47,601
- It's 2 to 0.
- Whose turn is it?

2457
01:37:47,602 --> 01:37:48,802
It's my turn again.

2458
01:37:49,032 --> 01:37:52,101
- I can hear things.
- You're supposed to make sounds...

2459
01:37:52,102 --> 01:37:53,641
to confuse your opponent.

2460
01:37:53,642 --> 01:37:54,771
- Is that so?
- Here we go.

2461
01:37:54,772 --> 01:37:55,772
(Attacker)

2462
01:37:55,773 --> 01:37:57,242
Cham Cham Cham!

2463
01:37:58,982 --> 01:38:01,711
(Where will...)

2464
01:38:01,712 --> 01:38:04,021
(Dong Hyun be?)

2465
01:38:04,022 --> 01:38:05,822
One, two, three.

2466
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:07,022
(Screaming)

2467
01:38:11,092 --> 01:38:12,992
(Perfect game)

2468
01:38:14,192 --> 01:38:15,192
Okay!

2469
01:38:15,193 --> 01:38:16,232
(Tae Hyun wins.)

2470
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:19,431
Gosh, this is so hard for me.

2471
01:38:19,432 --> 01:38:21,401
Did you keep moving around?

2472
01:38:21,402 --> 01:38:22,601
I kept moving around.

2473
01:38:22,602 --> 01:38:24,571
I kept moving around as well.

2474
01:38:24,572 --> 01:38:26,571
Gosh, I kept moving around!

2475
01:38:26,572 --> 01:38:27,711
(Dong Hyun is in last place and will pick up the rice cakes.)

2476
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,872
Yes!

2477
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:36,652
(Tae Hyun goes home without looking back.)

2478
01:38:37,252 --> 01:38:38,982
(Bye.)

2479
01:38:41,692 --> 01:38:43,292
How should I get dressed?

2480
01:38:44,962 --> 01:38:48,592
(Dong Hyun is the only one left.)

2481
01:38:50,162 --> 01:38:51,532
The rice cakes must be good with the grain syrup.

2482
01:38:53,402 --> 01:38:56,671
(Dong Hyun heads out to pick up the rice cakes for the crew.)

2483
01:38:56,672 --> 01:38:58,171
I'll be back.

2484
01:38:58,172 --> 01:38:59,712
(Current time: 7:30am)

2485
01:38:59,812 --> 01:39:00,841
Gosh, it's the morning.

2486
01:39:00,842 --> 01:39:02,212
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

2487
01:39:03,182 --> 01:39:07,452
(He heads to the mill that is 20 minutes away.)

2488
01:39:08,682 --> 01:39:13,552
(Knocked out)

2489
01:39:14,092 --> 01:39:16,491
(He arrives at a mill in Yangju.)

2490
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:18,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

2491
01:39:18,662 --> 01:39:19,792
Gosh, that looks good.

2492
01:39:19,832 --> 01:39:22,661
There was an order of rice cakes for Handsome Guys, right?

2493
01:39:22,662 --> 01:39:24,162
- Yes.
- I'm here to pick them up.

2494
01:39:24,332 --> 01:39:26,632
- They're here.
- Gosh, they look delicious.

2495
01:39:26,832 --> 01:39:29,571
Are these it? They look delicious.

2496
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:30,941
They're still hot.

2497
01:39:30,942 --> 01:39:32,441
- They're here.
- Gosh, they look good.

2498
01:39:32,442 --> 01:39:33,642
(Hot rice cake sticks that were freshly made!)

2499
01:39:34,242 --> 01:39:35,512
Gosh!

2500
01:39:36,272 --> 01:39:38,082
- I was up all night.
- Right.

2501
01:39:38,342 --> 01:39:40,181
- I was up all night.
- It's tough to make a living.

2502
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,351
We wake up at 3am.

2503
01:39:41,352 --> 01:39:42,881
- You two wake up at 3am?
- Yes.

2504
01:39:42,882 --> 01:39:44,852
That's incredible. Don't you two sleep early, though?

2505
01:39:45,222 --> 01:39:46,522
We go to bed at 8pm.

2506
01:39:48,522 --> 01:39:49,822
I was up all night.

2507
01:39:50,422 --> 01:39:51,922
Gosh, there are so many delicious rice cakes.

2508
01:39:53,162 --> 01:39:54,292
That's great.

2509
01:39:54,462 --> 01:39:57,661
No. I shouldn't have mentioned that.

2510
01:39:57,662 --> 01:39:59,301
No!

2511
01:39:59,302 --> 01:40:01,031
We're fans. It's okay.

2512
01:40:01,032 --> 01:40:03,601
- I shouldn't have mentioned that.
- Good luck with your shoot.

2513
01:40:03,602 --> 01:40:06,141
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2514
01:40:06,142 --> 01:40:07,772
Thank you so much.

2515
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:12,012
(He felt their warm hearts early in the morning.)

2516
01:40:12,582 --> 01:40:13,812
Have some of these.

2517
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,282
I got them as gifts.

2518
01:40:15,552 --> 01:40:18,322
(He heads back to the filming site that is being cleaned up.)

2519
01:40:18,852 --> 01:40:20,021
Sleep is the best medicine.

2520
01:40:20,022 --> 01:40:21,691
(Everyone must have struggled to sleep.)

2521
01:40:21,692 --> 01:40:22,952
It's tough with just a single night's sleep missed.

2522
01:40:23,922 --> 01:40:25,021
(A round of applause from the production crew)

2523
01:40:25,022 --> 01:40:26,732
Why clap?

2524
01:40:26,832 --> 01:40:28,031
I was forced to go.

2525
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,692
It's still hot.

2526
01:40:30,102 --> 01:40:31,202
It's amazing.

2527
01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:33,132
Enjoy the grain syrup.

2528
01:40:35,302 --> 01:40:37,441
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

2529
01:40:37,442 --> 01:40:38,601
(Thank you.)

2530
01:40:38,602 --> 01:40:41,341
The grain syrup was made all night.

2531
01:40:41,342 --> 01:40:42,571
Gosh.

2532
01:40:42,572 --> 01:40:43,941
I stayed up all night to make it.

2533
01:40:43,942 --> 01:40:45,281
(The grain syrup Dong Hyun made all night!)

2534
01:40:45,282 --> 01:40:46,312
Is it different?

2535
01:40:47,412 --> 01:40:49,882
You weren't able to eat.

2536
01:40:50,152 --> 01:40:52,352
Have some. You went through so much in the morning.

2537
01:40:52,522 --> 01:40:53,721
Thank you.

2538
01:40:53,722 --> 01:40:55,751
(It's hot.)

2539
01:40:55,752 --> 01:40:57,521
She will get married on November 1.

2540
01:40:57,522 --> 01:40:58,992
Congratulations!

2541
01:40:59,122 --> 01:41:00,832
Enjoy a happy life together!

2542
01:41:01,462 --> 01:41:02,992
- You stayed up all night, right?
- Yes.

2543
01:41:03,102 --> 01:41:04,331
Gosh.

2544
01:41:04,332 --> 01:41:05,332
(Have some of the grain syrup.)

2545
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:06,432
Gosh.

2546
01:41:07,002 --> 01:41:09,871
(Should I give it to you or not?)

2547
01:41:09,872 --> 01:41:11,071
Please give it to me!

2548
01:41:11,072 --> 01:41:12,901
(Teasing)

2549
01:41:12,902 --> 01:41:14,542
Fine!

2550
01:41:16,342 --> 01:41:17,842
(Laughing)

2551
01:41:19,312 --> 01:41:23,181
(He seems to be enjoying his penalty.)

2552
01:41:23,182 --> 01:41:24,581
They're running away.

2553
01:41:24,582 --> 01:41:26,922
- Great work.
- Great work.

2554
01:41:29,252 --> 01:41:30,921
- Great work.
- Let's move out now.

2555
01:41:30,922 --> 01:41:32,791
Right. The rice cake looks good.

2556
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:34,992
(Dong Hyun takes his penalty with the fresh morning breeze.)

2557
01:41:35,034 --> 01:41:37,234
(Up until now, the Handsome Guys went through...)

2558
01:41:37,504 --> 01:41:38,533
I can't move!

2559
01:41:38,534 --> 01:41:41,143
(Competition)

2560
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:43,813
(Betrayal)

2561
01:41:43,814 --> 01:41:45,043
Give me your plate.

2562
01:41:45,044 --> 01:41:48,044
(They were all individualistic.)

2563
01:41:48,184 --> 01:41:50,013
(Today, you all will give up working as individuals.)

2564
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:51,883
(Your arms will be tied up.)

2565
01:41:51,884 --> 01:41:52,884
(Our arms will be tied up?)

2566
01:41:52,885 --> 01:41:54,983
(Next week's shortage)

2567
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,154
This feels so uncomfortable!

2568
01:41:56,594 --> 01:41:58,754
(Shortage in Privacy)

2569
01:41:58,924 --> 01:41:59,924
(Even when the tents are set up,)

2570
01:41:59,925 --> 01:42:01,023
(their arms are tied up.)

2571
01:42:01,024 --> 01:42:02,563
(Even at the supermarket,)

2572
01:42:02,564 --> 01:42:03,734
(their arms are tied up.)

2573
01:42:04,164 --> 01:42:05,233
(Guest Jang Hyuk)

2574
01:42:05,234 --> 01:42:06,634
(He gets tied up as well.)

2575
01:42:06,804 --> 01:42:08,164
(Even their legs are tied up.)

2576
01:42:09,034 --> 01:42:10,803
(Wherever they are)

2577
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,434
(Whatever they do)

2578
01:42:12,704 --> 01:42:15,174
(There's no privacy at all!)

2579
01:42:15,304 --> 01:42:17,444
(The only method to keep their privacy)

2580
01:42:18,444 --> 01:42:20,344
(Chieftain?)

2581
01:42:20,944 --> 01:42:22,413
(An intense competition...)

2582
01:42:22,414 --> 01:42:24,714
(to become the chieftain)

2583
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:26,654
(Where is my private life?)

2584
01:42:26,884 --> 01:42:28,423
(Even the actor of 10 million in audience...)

2585
01:42:28,424 --> 01:42:30,324
(and a medalist)

2586
01:42:30,654 --> 01:42:32,994
(On a rampage)

2587
01:42:34,164 --> 01:42:37,094
(Haven't I done enough to become the chieftain?)

2588
01:42:38,034 --> 01:42:43,034
(Will Handsome Guys be able to protect their private lives?)

2589
