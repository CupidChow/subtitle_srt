1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,360
(Is it meat or fish?)

2
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,630
(Naengmyeon...)

3
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,729
(or kalguksu?)

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,969
(After making the choice...)

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,039
(Exultation...)

6
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:27,964
(and regret)

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,940
(Anguish and resolution)

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,450
(The time of abundance)

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,550
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,959
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,159
(It starts again today.)

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,960
(Yongsan-gu in Seoul)

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,500
(Complex Cultural Space P in Itaewon)

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,900
(One drizzling day in spring)

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,409
- It's cold. - It's really cold.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,570
When will it stop being cold?

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,109
- It's really cold. - Isn't it moist from the rain?

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,239
(Handsome Guys gather in Hannam-dong during the last cold snap.)

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,340
This is unbelievable.

20
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,050
Everyone, don't misunderstand.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,609
We definitely said...

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,856
- For so many months... - We've been saying the same thing.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,050
This is mid-April.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,460
We may look like we're dressed more lightly than before.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,636
- Are you wearing long underwear? - Long underwear?

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,789
Of course.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,559
(Of course he's wearing it.)

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,529
I'm wearing thermal underwear.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,760
- Of course. - Of course.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,230
Me too.

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,760
- Look. - Of course.

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,910
- Look at this. - I'm wearing it too.

33
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,769
This is normal for us.

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,299
- In the middle of April, - Sure.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,716
I pulled it out again from the closet.

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,540
It seems like Seung Ho is too cool to be wearing it.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,610
He's wearing it.

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,579
What? Wait a minute.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,879
- Hold on. - Wait.

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,619
- He cut it. - I cut it.

41
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,350
- Did you cut it? - I did.

42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,526
He trimmed the long underwear to wear a V-neck top.

43
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,749
I thought that he wasn't wearing it,

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,889
but I saw something white underneath.

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,210
(The older guys are excited to detect his long underwear.)

46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,059
(Meanwhile...)

47
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,660
(Shivering)

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,159
Why are you shaking?

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,600
My legs are so cold.

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I mean...

51
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,070
- Aren't you wearing it? - No.

52
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,269
That's why I'm the only one who's cold. I'm cold.

53
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,409
Today...

54
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,680
Once he joins us, won't the group be complete?

55
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,249
- Definitely. - That's right.

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,779
- One person has been missing. - Won't the group be complete?

57
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,020
He's been with us since the first episode.

58
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,100
Everyone from all over the world is in Itaewon.

59
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,720
It's definitely him.

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,190
Finally.

61
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,389
Should we call him our regular guest...

62
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,519
or a regular member?

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,659
Once he arrives, the group will be completed.

64
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,500
(Everyone must have noticed by now who it is.)

65
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,199
(Everyone knows today's guest.)

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,300
We're finally complete.

67
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,830
Run away

68
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,339
Jin!

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,870
(Handsome Guys' sixth member, Jin of BTS)

70
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,980
(Worldwide Handsome Jin makes a comeback with a new album.)

71
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
(From the first episode, )

72
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:49,480
(he shouted for joy as Frog Seok Jin.)

73
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,119
(The exhausting work of packaging mackerels)

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,230
(And a controversy over unfair treatment)

75
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,259
(Today's guest experienced...)

76
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,699
(all kinds of emotions with Handsome Guys.)

77
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,799
- Hello. - It finally feels warm.

78
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,399
- We're welcoming you like a member. - Hello.

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
- Hello. - You're one of the members.

80
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,139
- Stand over here. - Come this way.

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,339
- Where are you going? - This is your place.

82
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,769
- What? - What's wrong? You're one of us.

83
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,770
Be natural.

84
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:15,379
Jin is becoming a regular member.

85
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,679
- Shall we toss him in the air? - No.

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,809
No.

87
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,479
- Shall we lift him up? - Lift him up.

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,960
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,790
- I'm not ready yet. - Let's go.

90
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,250
Wait. I don't mind tossing people in the air,

91
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
but we'd cause big trouble if we hurt him.

92
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,560
- He shouldn't get hurt. - I have to be very careful.

93
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,330
- He joined us as a member. - Seriously.

94
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,699
Among shows to appear for promoting my album,

95
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,769
I had to choose a few.

96
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,100
I asked Handsome Guys to be on my priority list.

97
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,109
- I knew it. - I was on the show's first episode.

98
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,669
- Exactly. - That's why.

99
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,609
This show is where I feel at home the most.

100
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,170
You're definitely a member on the show.

101
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,879
Currently,

102
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,450
- Jin resides in Hannam-dong. - That's correct.

103
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,149
How is living in Hannam-dong?

104
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,689
What are the charms at this place?

105
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,789
The first charm of Hannam-dong is...

106
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,459
how quiet it is. The neighborhood is very quiet.

107
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,289
It almost feels deserted.

108
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,290
- Is it quiet? - The neighborhood is very quiet.
(Charms of Hannam-dong by Jin: 1. It's quiet.)

109
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,069
Also, there are many famous tasty restaurants.

110
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,699
- That's true about Hannam-dong. - People often make appointments...

111
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,039
in Hannam-dong.

112
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
That's right.

113
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,809
(Today's Menu Recommendation Area: Hannam-dong)

114
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,780
Hannam-dong is a nice area.

115
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,609
It has many affluent neighborhoods and embassies.

116
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,610
(There are many luxurious mansions and embassies.)

117
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,479
(A cultural center that embraces recent trends)

118
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,990
It's a cultural assembly.

119
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,720
When you live in Hannam-dong,

120
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,320
you can hear every language in the world.

121
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,790
I always thought of it as a gourmet neighborhood.

122
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,736
- It has many tasty restaurants. - Yes.

123
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,870
As there are many foreigners, there must be various types of food.

124
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,239
(A marketplace of food from all over the world)

125
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,039
(What will be today's dishes in Hannam-dong?)

126
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,439
How shall we split into teams today?

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,479
It will depend on the food.

128
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,309
- We're by Itaewon Station. - We're in Hannam-dong.

129
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,379
Hannam-dong.

130
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,150
I made a recommendation because they asked me for it.

131
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,349
That's right.

132
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,050
You must know all the tasty restaurants.

133
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,690
I recommended a naengmyeon restaurant.

134
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,760
Isn't Jin's recommendation...

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,389
a really famous restaurant?

136
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,559
- Right. - It's a famous place.

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,329
- Isn't it extremely famous? - It's very famous.

138
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,759
(Naengmyeon full of meat flavor with a spicy taste of high quality)

139
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,859
Naengmyeon?

140
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,230
(But naengmyeon?)

141
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,470
It's cold.

142
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,269
But this is April.

143
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,540
- Of all things... - It's the right season for that.

144
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,569
Right now is the perfect season for naengmyeon.

145
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,570
(It's the perfect season for naengmyeon.)

146
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:28,810
But I can see my breath.

147
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,850
This episode will be aired on May 15.

148
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,979
However, we're cold right now.

149
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm cold right now.

150
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,720
- We can see our breath. - We can see our breath.

151
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,289
- They have warm broth too. - Okay, we can eat that.

152
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,290
Warm broth sounds good.

153
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,829
(No worries. The restaurant has warm broth.)

154
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,859
We have naengmyeon. What's the other option?

155
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,730
There's a famous restaurant here.

156
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830
Which one?

157
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,930
(Anticipating)

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dried pollack soup.

159
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,770
- I see. - Dried pollack soup?

160
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,570
- Dried pollack soup sounds good. - I go there often.

161
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,110
I've been there often with my colleagues in the movie industry.

162
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,679
It's only three minutes away from my place,

163
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
so I order deliveries a lot.

164
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,049
I usually eat their dried pollack soup.

165
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,910
Their dried pollack soup is milky.

166
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,419
- It's very delicious. - It is.

167
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,249
(With milky broth and a clean taste, )

168
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,650
(the dried pollack soup will soothe your stomach.)

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,489
(And so, today's LMR)

170
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,829
(Lunch Menu Recommendation)

171
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,929
- Today, - Dried pollack soup and naengmyeon.

172
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,030
We'll start with naengmyeon and dried pollack soup.

173
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,400
I pick dried pollack soup.

174
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,030
- No matter what. - Dried pollack soup?

175
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,699
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?

176
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,640
If we already have someone who wants that...

177
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,370
Can I justify my choice?

178
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,179
How?

179
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,609
(Justify what?)

180
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,330
I've never been to a naengmyeon restaurant.

181
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,209
You've never been to a naengmyeon restaurant?

182
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,549
- When there's no meat, - Really?

183
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,319
It feels like something is missing.

184
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,949
I eat naengmyeon after eating meat.

185
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,859
I've never gone to a restaurant just to eat naengmyeon.

186
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,489
That's why I'd like to eat dried pollack soup.

187
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,689
(Dong Hyun wants to avoid naengmyeon at all costs.)

188
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,490
- What's your choice? - Dried pollack soup.

189
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,399
(3 picked dried pollack soup.)

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,199
- How about you, Jin? - Dried pollack soup.

191
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,469
(4 picked dried pollack soup.)

192
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,500
How about you, Tae Hyun?

193
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,269
- I'll get naengmyeon today. - Naengmyeon?

194
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,776
(1 picked naengmyeon. 4 picked dried pollack soup.)

195
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,469
- Naengmyeon? - We have one for naengmyeon.

196
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,509
Is that even possible?

197
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,539
(Naengmyeon in this weather?)

198
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,609
I'd like dried pollack soup.

199
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,979
(1 picked naengmyeon. 5 picked dried pollack soup.)

200
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,239
It's freezing today.

201
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
- These are our choices for now. - Everyone picked.

202
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,770
You're wearing thermal underwear.

203
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,950
(What?)

204
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
- I am. - Right.

205
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,450
What does that have to do with anything?

206
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,559
I don't eat naengmyeon...

207
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,119
even in the middle of summer.

208
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,489
Let's recommend each other.

209
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,029
We'll point to the one who should eat naengmyeon.

210
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,906
The one with the most votes will eat naengmyeon.

211
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,200
(Suddenly, a new method of choosing has been added.)

212
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,069
Okay.

213
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,639
- That's a great idea. - Is it?

214
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,609
I don't agree with you. Wait.

215
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,610
Wait.

216
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,570
Shouldn't we eat what we want to eat?

217
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,679
We can split into 1 and 5,

218
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,400
- but it's better to split evenly. - Right.

219
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,050
Is that so?

220
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,580
We have to point at him.

221
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
Okay, that sounds good.

222
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,480
We'll shout, "You get naengmyeon today!"

223
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,859
- You didn't plan beforehand, right? - I promise.

224
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,889
Two, three.

225
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,090
- You get naengmyeon today. - You get naengmyeon today.

226
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,960
- You get naengmyeon today. - You get naengmyeon today.

227
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,829
- We didn't plan it beforehand. - Are you sure?

228
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,899
We really didn't.

229
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,069
But I don't eat naengmyeon.

230
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,870
I eat naengmyeon...

231
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,710
less than three times a year.

232
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,869
- Their naengmyeon is amazing. - It's amazing.

233
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,380
- It's really amazing. - Naengmyeon is good, but...

234
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,809
It's good, but...

235
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,690
(Naengmyeon must be good, but I don't want it.)

236
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,950
- Their dumplings are to die for. - You can order various dishes.

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,590
Can I just order 30 dumplings?

238
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,159
(The protein fighter is upset.)

239
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,620
At a naengmyeon restaurant?

240
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,759
I'll eat naengmyeon too because I recommended it.

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,089
- Okay. - I'll join you.

242
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,129
(As Jin joined Team Naengmyeon, they're split into 3 and 3.)

243
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,330
In this case...

244
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,769
Team Naengmyeon and Team Dried Pollack Soup.

245
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,239
We divided into teams fair and square.

246
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,810
- "Fair and square?" - Where we'll go first is important.

247
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,339
You'll have naengmyeon first.

248
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,439
(They decide to go to the naengmyeon restaurant first.)

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,339
It's nearby, so shall we go?

250
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,579
- Let's go. - Let's get naengmyeon.

251
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,550
This naengmyeon place is incredible.

252
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,120
(Hannam-dong in the damp, rainy weather)

253
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,920
(The first lunch menu in Hannam-dong)

254
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,159
Things don't change a lot here,

255
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,330
and I like that.

256
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,499
They remain the same as I remember.

257
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,559
This street doesn't change.

258
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,829
(A Hannam-dong resident guides them to the naengmyeon restaurant.)

259
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,669
Here it is. There's a long line during lunchtime at this place.

260
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,139
- Yes, it's a tasty restaurant. - People wait along this line.

261
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,639
The colors are really beautiful.

262
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,669
I can tell that it's a popular restaurant.

263
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,790
(It looks like a tasty restaurant from the exterior.)

264
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,509
(At lunchtime during the week)

265
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,709
(Lined up)

266
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,719
(The line continues.)

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,420
(The line continues even more.)

268
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,690
(This tasty restaurant is always full.)

269
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,220
I heard about a good naengmyeon place by the embassy.

270
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,930
I crossed the bridge from Apgujeong-dong to have lunch here.

271
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,760
I came from Los Angeles to eat naengmyeon here.

272
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,700
(Spicy seasoning)

273
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,240
(Sour broth with floating thin ice)

274
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,580
(It turns into a fantastic combination.)

275
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,680
(Today's lunch menu)

276
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,819
(LMR 1, naengmyeon)

277
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,219
Tasty restaurants with confidence have...

278
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,619
only one thing on the menu.

279
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,289
Right. They only sell one dish.

280
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,189
Mul naengmyeon, bibim naengmyeon, and dumplings.

281
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,590
(There are only three on the menu.)

282
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,160
(Their simple menu shows their pride.)

283
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,200
The restaurant's warm broth is to die for.

284
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,100
(Jin pierces through the cameras and brings warm broth.)

285
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,869
- Is this how you eat it? - Have a cup of warm broth.

286
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,840
Can we have some warm broth at least?

287
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,380
It's not really food.

288
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,679
This is like water.

289
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,109
Having warm broth could make it harder.

290
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,790
(Jin allows them to taste the warm broth.)

291
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,689
(Exclaiming)

292
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,789
Isn't it delicious?

293
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,960
(Exclaiming)

294
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,190
Isn't it delicious?

295
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,529
Now you know why I brought it up.

296
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,590
(A culture shock)

297
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,699
(Tae Hyun also tastes it.)

298
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,620
- Now you know why I brought it up. - This is...

299
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,499
- Wait a minute. - Wait.

300
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,169
- We can't let them have it. - No way.

301
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,639
- No way. - Wait.

302
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,509
Sang Uk, don't bring anymore.

303
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,916
- They can't have this. - Wait a minute.

304
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,609
- They can't have it. - But...

305
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,780
This is like tasting everything.

306
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,079
It's so good that it's like a dish.

307
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,919
Some people come here just to drink this.

308
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
- This is the main dish. - It's the main dish.

309
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,620
It's very good.

310
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,059
Broths are usually good.

311
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:22,600
(Team Dried Pollack Soup gets to taste the warm broth.)

312
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,059
You can add meat and rice to this broth.

313
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460
You can eat it for an entire month.

314
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,970
It tastes similar to galbitang.

315
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,699
It's even better than galbitang.

316
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,969
You know what?

317
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,739
The warm broth whets the appetite.

318
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,239
Yes, this is delicious.

319
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,456
(Their appetite gets stimulated by the warm broth.)

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,479
- Why don't you three... - What's this?

321
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,709
Make your order?

322
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,749
(Shall we order?)

323
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,120
Should we get small or large naengmyeon?

324
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,249
I'll eat a small one. I won't eat a lot.

325
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,619
But it's naengmyeon.

326
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,159
I don't really like naengmyeon.

327
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,389
- Seriously. - Clearly...

328
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,159
Let me explain. It's delicious, but...

329
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,830
Dong Hyun, try the large one. It's good.

330
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,359
I need some protein in my meal.

331
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,459
You'll eat dumplings too.

332
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,069
- There will be dumplings. - It's good with dumplings.

333
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,700
This is what it feels like.

334
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,439
At the workplace, your boss suggests...

335
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,169
getting naengmyeon because the day is hot.

336
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,810
You say to yourself, "I hate naengmyeon."

337
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,709
- Goodness. - It can't be helped.

338
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,956
You're an employee with the lowest position.

339
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I know.

340
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,080
- Sir? - Sir?

341
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,189
- Hello. - Hello.

342
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,889
- It's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

343
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,890
The restaurant owner.

344
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,219
(Park Jung Seok, the naengmyeon restaurant owner)

345
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,759
Did you know that Jin frequented here?

346
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,589
He's known all over the world.

347
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,100
Anyone would know that.

348
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,759
(Embarrassed)

349
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,300
I frequented here a lot too, but it was a long time ago.

350
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,569
Isn't the original restaurant around the corner?

351
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,509
- Yes. - Everyone thinks this is the main.

352
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,839
- That's what I thought too. - My parents run it.

353
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,686
(The original restaurant is run by his parents.)

354
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,479
- It's run by your parents. - His parents?

355
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,779
- I'm their son. - You're their son.

356
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,249
- And your son? - And my son.

357
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,119
- It's run by 3 generations. - They're 3 generations.

358
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,180
When did your parents start this restaurant?

359
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,949
It's been almost 50 years now.

360
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,089
(The naengmyeon restaurant has been running for 50 years.)

361
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,819
- At the same place? - Yes.

362
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,959
At the same spot?

363
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,359
You said that your bibim naengmyeon was slightly spicy.

364
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,329
Is your spicy naengmyeon the signature dish?

365
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,670
We started by selling spicy naengmyeon.

366
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,499
We also have mild naengmyeon.

367
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,899
There's seasoning on the side.

368
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,216
- It's right here. - You can add that.

369
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,980
- Let's try the original naengmyeon. - It's really good here.

370
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,380
Okay, in that case...

371
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,049
One large naengmyeon?

372
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,349
- A medium size? - Two large naengmyeon.

373
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,049
- No, two large naengmyeon. - You want a large?

374
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,150
- For bibim naengmyeon... - One large.

375
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,689
- Two plates of dumplings. - Two plates.

376
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,319
We'll start with that first.

377
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,419
For now.

378
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,489
Thank you so much.

379
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,759
- Thank you. - I'll prepare the food.

380
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,359
- Thank you. - Thank you.

381
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,430
(They finish ordering.)

382
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,369
(10 minutes after making the order)

383
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,099
- The food is here. - It's here.

384
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,340
(The food order appears.)

385
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,669
- Is large this big? - Please serve them.

386
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,739
Just the three of us.

387
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,009
I'll take that.

388
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,216
(A generous amount of naengmyeon appears.)

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,410
This is 11 dollars?

390
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,149
(Plentiful)

391
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,750
It has a lot of noodles.

392
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,049
I'll eat the leftovers.

393
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,280
Thank you.

394
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,020
These dumplings are so good.

395
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,150
The dumplings are packed inside.

396
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,860
(Well-cooked noodles)

397
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,570
(Spicy seasoning)

398
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,970
(Sour and refreshing broth is added.)

399
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,680
(Appetizing naengmyeon)

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,809
(On the side)

401
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,910
(King-sized dumplings)

402
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,380
(They complement naengmyeon perfectly.)

403
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,019
(A meal of naengmyeon)

404
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,820
- I'll enjoy the food. - Me too.

405
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,130
(Three of them start to mix the naengmyeon.)

406
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,559
It looks good.

407
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,440
Saliva is practically spurting out of my mouth.

408
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,030
It smells good too.

409
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,170
This will drive me crazy.

410
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,940
I want it so badly after tasting the warm broth.

411
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,609
Now that I feel warm...

412
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,139
It was cold a moment ago.

413
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,879
- Now our bodies have warmed up. - We're warmed up.

414
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Right.

415
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:59,209
I have an appetite now.

416
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,170
- The smell is so strong. - My mouth is watering.

417
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,180
Saliva is spurting out of my mouth.

418
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,050
It smells good too.

419
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,950
- Hey. - It looks bland.

420
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,459
It looks bland.

421
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,559
Thank you.

422
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,790
Here you go.

423
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,330
How is it, Tae Hyun?

424
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,360
Isn't it tasty? Their naengmyeon is quite good.

425
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,329
- It's so good. - Right?

426
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,176
- This is a really tasty restaurant. - It's amazing.

427
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,100
- Really? - Goodness.

428
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,410
Recently, I've been eating...

429
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,480
mostly Pyongyang naengmyeon.

430
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,810
It's amazing to eat naengmyeon that's spicy.

431
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,809
I'll try it later.

432
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,180
(They can't take their eyes off.)

433
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,819
I've never seen Tae Hyun eat like this.

434
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,460
(I've never seen Tae Hyun eat like this.)

435
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,389
The mul naengmyeon looks good.

436
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,799
(Jin who frequents here also takes a big bite.)

437
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,959
It looks good.

438
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,706
I've been eating mostly Pyongyang naengmyeon.

439
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,969
Give us the quiz.

440
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,370
(Give us the quiz.)

441
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,500
I haven't had a bite yet.

442
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,899
Dong Hyun hasn't tried it yet.

443
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,210
I haven't even tasted it.

444
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,490
- Dong Hyun, have your 1st bite. - It's my 1st bite.

445
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,280
- Goodness. - Dong Hyun took his first bite.

446
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,749
(Humming)

447
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,780
Is it spicy?

448
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,790
What? What did you try?

449
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,819
It's slightly sweet.

450
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,919
It's sweeter than bibim naengmyeon I've tried before.

451
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,230
With the spicy taste,

452
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,230
it tastes exactly how I like it.

453
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,599
It's delicious.

454
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,630
(It looks delicious.)

455
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,599
The red broth makes me want it even more.

456
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,770
(Slurping)

457
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,510
Dong Hyun, didn't you say that you hate naengmyeon?

458
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,279
He enjoys eating...

459
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,940
all the food that he claims to hate.

460
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,510
Dong Hyun, you said that you hated naengmyeon.

461
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,080
The seasoning is strong.

462
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,150
I know how it tastes, so it drives me crazy.

463
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,489
It's quite spicy.

464
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,620
(Jin goes for the dumpling.)

465
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,820
This bibim naengmyeon is...

466
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,260
(Eating)

467
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,130
Gosh, Jin is eating the dumpling.

468
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,800
You have to tear the dumpling as you eat it.

469
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,370
Right, you have to dip it.

470
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,670
Do you dip it in the naengmyeon?

471
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,840
It's good.

472
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,340
(Tae Hyun also takes a dumpling.)

473
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,509
(In awe)

474
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,749
- The dumpling is amazing. - It's good.

475
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,679
- Hurry up and eat some dumplings. - Eat a lot of it.

476
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,479
It calms the spiciness.

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,890
Dumplings are good to eat when they're hot.

478
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,030
- It's perfect with spicy food. - It's perfect.

479
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,869
(A perfect match...)

480
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,399
(of spicy naengmyeon and dumplings)

481
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,409
Let's do something to win one bite.

482
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,079
- Tae Hyun, what do you think? - One bite sounds good.

483
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,179
Even if it's just one bite...

484
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,410
I don't mind. Gosh.

485
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,650
You don't mind? You aren't interested in us at all.

486
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,649
You aren't interested in us at all.

487
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,620
You should at least look at us when you respond.

488
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,220
Everything is up to Jin.

489
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,590
Do you want some?

490
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
By the way...

491
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,260
Yes, sir!

492
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,200
- Then... - By now...

493
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,429
By the way...

494
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,030
He's worse than us.

495
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
I mean...

496
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:11,999
You don't want it?

497
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,669
- I do. - By the way...

498
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,039
Hey, Jin.

499
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,780
Did you watch our show last week?

500
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,209
We didn't inform you at all,

501
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,549
- but how did you... - I know.

502
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,250
- Did you practice beforehand? - No.

503
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,179
- On our show last week... - How does he know so well?

504
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,350
Here you go.

505
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,349
(Swiftly)

506
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,650
Can you taste anything?

507
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,319
Now that Yi Kyung had some,

508
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
- No way. - give us the question.

509
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,990
- I only had that. - Seung Ho.

510
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,490
Are you giving me cucumber?

511
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,199
(Can you taste anything?)

512
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,699
- By the way... - How shall I put it?

513
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,399
The cucumber I had was...

514
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,070
seasoned with broth.

515
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,140
(What about a bite that Jin will give to Sang Uk?)

516
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,040
(Anticipating)

517
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:55,736
(What about a bite that Jin will give to Sang Uk?)

518
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:58,376
(Anticipating)

519
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:02,016
- That's not right. - What's wrong?

520
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,416
- That's not right. - What's wrong?

521
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,456
- I mean... - What?

522
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:09,686
- What is it? - It's egg yolk.

523
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:11,625
This is really good.

524
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,695
It absorbed all the broth.

525
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,555
I know that it's good.

526
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,066
Try it first.

527
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,535
- I'm giving you a good one. - It hurts his sense of pride.

528
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,866
Try it.

529
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:22,035
My sense of pride...

530
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,535
- It looks like... - What's wrong?

531
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,636
A nose booger.

532
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,836
No, try it first. It's delicious.

533
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,046
Can you even taste anything?

534
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:32,275
- That is... - Isn't it delicious?

535
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:33,315
Can you taste anything?

536
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,276
More than anything, it makes me feel weird.

537
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:37,785
It makes me feel very weird.

538
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:40,116
- All of us had something different. - You're right.

539
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:43,856
It's like omakase served by Jin. Each of us had something different.

540
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,626
I customized each piece.

541
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,796
Now...

542
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,765
We usually let one of them eat.

543
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,966
One person?

544
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,896
It's fun to watch.

545
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,196
We try.

546
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,405
What happened up to now doesn't matter.

547
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,635
Do we participate too?

548
00:19:58,636 --> 00:19:59,936
No, it's only them.

549
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,135
How about we pick a noodle strand?

550
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,446
- The one with the longest wins. - Shall we?

551
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,276
Pick from here.

552
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:07,715
(White radish salad)

553
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:09,076
Let's pick one of these.

554
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,985
You have to pick one from the bottom.

555
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,415
- You can't look. - Pick the longest one.

556
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,556
Don't search around.

557
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:17,456
Let's just take a look.

558
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:20,755
You can tell which ones are long.

559
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,502
(After observing the white radish salad with resolution)

560
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:24,126
I'll pick the one inside randomly.

561
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,966
- Okay. - It's long.

562
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,236
It's neither long nor short.

563
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:31,705
I'll go now.

564
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,035
(Sang Uk goes second.)

565
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:34,436
This is mine.

566
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,576
- This is it. - Gosh.

567
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:38,346
(Concentrating)

568
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,646
- This is it. - Gosh.

569
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,015
Out.

570
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,536
(Sang Uk's radish is slightly longer.)

571
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,285
(Yi Kyung is out.)

572
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,416
This is great.

573
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:47,186
Here I go.

574
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:52,755
Here I go.

575
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:54,596
(Hunter who's after Seung Ho suddenly got up.)

576
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:57,666
(Snapping)

577
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,935
You have to pick randomly anyway.

578
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:06,276
- Hey. - It's random anyway.

579
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,375
It's random.

580
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,336
I flipped it over once.

581
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,705
- Pick from this side. - You never know.

582
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,045
- This side. - You never know.

583
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,175
You never know.

584
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:15,616
Just do it. You never know.

585
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:18,315
- You never know. - But you cut it.

586
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,115
- Just try it. - He's so ridiculous.

587
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,315
Go ahead.

588
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,855
It's supposed to be random.

589
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,885
(Seung Ho goes again.)

590
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:27,395
- It'd be amazing if you win. - Of course.

591
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,396
How will it turn out?

592
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:30,266
Compare it with mine.

593
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,296
Mine is the shortest.

594
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,466
Mine is the shortest.

595
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,366
(Upset)

596
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,636
I lost.

597
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:43,646
Okay.

598
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:46,175
I was only trying to help you eat.

599
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:47,445
What's this?

600
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,146
(What's this?)

601
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,245
I was only trying to help you eat.

602
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,546
Help him?

603
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,415
(It's Sang Uk's turn to eat.)

604
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,526
Just one bite.

605
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,026
This is great.

606
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,796
Thank you.

607
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:07,766
(Slurping)

608
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:14,975
Did you see that?

609
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:17,176
(This time, he takes a bite of the dumpling.)

610
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:18,675
(Humming)

611
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:19,715
Isn't it good?

612
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,046
The dumplings are amazing.

613
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,686
The dumplings are really good.

614
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,416
- Isn't it good? - It's so good.

615
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,455
When the naengmyeon gets spicy, it's perfect to eat.

616
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,555
(The dumpling calms down the spiciness.)

617
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,026
Here's the quiz.

618
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,696
- Naengmyeon has been... - It's about naengmyeon.

619
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,396
Loved by everyone.

620
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,795
In 1938, there was an event...

621
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:43,136
where the police had to intervene because of naengmyeon.

622
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,205
- It's hard. - It occurred when...

623
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,735
people protested to the police...

624
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,576
after being disturbed by something related to naengmyeon.

625
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:51,006
I've heard of it.

626
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:52,406
This is very hard.

627
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,615
What had disturbed them?

628
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:56,816
- What had disturbed them? - It's so difficult.

629
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,546
It feels like...

630
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:00,715
- I think this is it. - What people...

631
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:03,025
- This is very hard. - This must be...

632
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:04,185
What do you think?

633
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:07,756
Only naengmyeon was selling so well...

634
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,326
that no one was eating...

635
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:11,896
at other restaurants.

636
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,436
That's serious enough for the police to intervene.

637
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:18,166
What?

638
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,276
I got it.

639
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,605
- You got it? - I got it.

640
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:23,926
- Tell us, Dong Hyun. - Tae Hyun.

641
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,075
Back in the day, ice was rare.

642
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,916
As it was used in naengmyeon,

643
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:31,086
- Okay. - they put a limit to naengmyeon.

644
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:32,515
- What do you think? - Not to sell naengmyeon?

645
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,036
That's good. That's serious enough for the police to intervene.

646
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,026
That sounds suspicious.

647
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:39,625
Let's think again.

648
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,906
- Let's think again. - I mean...

649
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,956
When do the police come?

650
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:45,465
- When there's a problem. - What type...

651
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,766
Do they know the answer?

652
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,196
- No. - What?

653
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,236
They always do that.

654
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,405
- This is how it's done. - Really?

655
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:53,406
That's why it's confusing.

656
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:54,435
I'm sorry,

657
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:55,876
but you'll do the same later.

658
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:58,546
How about this?

659
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:02,846
Do you know why there's half an egg in naengmyeon?

660
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:05,316
- Why? - I'm asking you.

661
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,956
I'm asking you.

662
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,255
- Are you asking me? - Yes.

663
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,485
- But he sounded like... - No.

664
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,325
- I thought he knew. - Right.

665
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:16,365
- Wasn't it a rhetorical question? - I thought he was asking to guess.

666
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,365
I think it's related to why...

667
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,865
there's an egg in it.

668
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:22,065
There's no context to why there's an egg in it.

669
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,766
- This is hard. - Why were they disturbed?

670
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,005
(The quiz on naengmyeon is difficult.)

671
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,036
It's difficult.

672
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:29,176
Take a guess.

673
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:31,946
Jin came back...

674
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,775
after a long time.

675
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,345
Since it's your first time after the show changed,

676
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:36,486
we'll trust your intuition.

677
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:37,915
Let's go with this.

678
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,985
Naengmyeon restaurants were so successful...

679
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,055
that other restaurants complained.

680
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:42,736
The police came because there was a fight.

681
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:44,425
If this is correct...

682
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,266
There's a one-percent chance of being correct.

683
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:47,496
It could be simple.

684
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:49,866
Incorrect.

685
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,395
- This is so difficult. - Goodness.

686
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:53,396
What should we do?

687
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,365
- I'll give you a huge hint. - A huge hint.

688
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:56,465
The first one to answer...

689
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,626
- will be the winner. - Okay.

690
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:02,536
At that time, people got naengmyeon delivered to them.

691
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:04,246
- Is that the hint? - Yes.

692
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:06,276
- It's related to that... - Jin.

693
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,716
Jin?

694
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:10,246
There was a fight because naengmyeon arrived too soggy.

695
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:13,085
Because it was soggy or the delivery got delayed?

696
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:14,686
- The delivery got delayed. - Incorrect.

697
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,086
I got it. How about...

698
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,826
When naengmyeon was getting delivered,

699
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,555
- there were people... - Who ate it?

700
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:24,425
Who tried to steal it.

701
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,635
- The police would come... - Naengmyeon thieves?

702
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,716
- Naengmyeon thieves? - Due to naengmyeon thieves...

703
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,465
- Naengmyeon thieves? - Stealing?

704
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:31,505
Yes.

705
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:33,375
People got so frustrated that the police intervened.

706
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:34,776
That was a groundbreaking approach.

707
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,336
It was groundbreaking,

708
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:37,906
but it's incorrect.

709
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:42,076
As naengmyeon delivery got so popular,

710
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,846
everyone in the country became delivery men.

711
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,215
I thought of that too.

712
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:49,216
(Laughing)

713
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,756
Everyone in the country delivered naengmyeon.

714
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,195
The government said,

715
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:55,225
"The country will go down at this rate."

716
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:58,066
- We can't have everyone deliver. - Delivery men in 1938?

717
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,595
What needs to happen for all deliveries to stop?

718
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:01,635
(A huge hint)

719
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:02,896
Traffic lights should stop.

720
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:05,605
When traffic lights stopped working...

721
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,166
There were no traffic lights back then.

722
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:10,405
Did the delivery men go on a strike?

723
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:11,446
Correct.

724
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:18,246
(Answer: Delivery men on a strike)

725
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:19,686
Is that correct?

726
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:20,785
Dong Hyun is correct.

727
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:22,055
- Because of a strike? - A strike?

728
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:24,286
He always answers correctly like this.

729
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:25,756
This is so annoying.

730
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,425
What's this?

731
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:29,995
Did the delivery men go on a strike?

732
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:32,726
I didn't know that there were labor unions back then.

733
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,236
In 1938,

734
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:37,336
the delivery man's wage was 0.1 cent.

735
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,406
As the economy got worse, it was reduced to 0.09 cent.

736
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,475
Then the delivery men went on a strike.

737
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,046
(The naengmyeon strike in 1938)

738
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:46,645
- Now... - I couldn't even imagine it.

739
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,976
- There are only two of you. - Will it be BTS...

740
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:51,615
- Okay, let's go. - or the best actor in Korea.

741
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:52,845
Will it be the popular actor?

742
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:54,086
- Give us the question. - Okay.

743
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:56,156
The second question is...

744
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:57,956
- Show them this drawing. - Okay.

745
00:26:58,286 --> 00:26:59,932
- I'll show you. - Are they making naengmyeon?

746
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:00,995
Here it is.

747
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,756
(The drawing is revealed.)

748
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,925
- They're making naengmyeon noodles. - No, that's not it.

749
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:06,766
- Someone is hanging. - The one who's hanging.

750
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:08,336
- What is it? - What are they doing?

751
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,365
This drawing is...

752
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,535
by Painter Kim Jun Geun in the late 19th century.

753
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:14,906
It's called "Making Noodles."

754
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:17,976
The man who's hanging from the ladder.

755
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:21,216
What is he doing?

756
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:24,496
- You might know the answer. - The one who's hanging here.

757
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,176
- Who is he? - Are they making noodles?

758
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:27,586
I got it.

759
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,556
The ventilator.

760
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,886
He's running the ventilator?

761
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:33,755
By pulling...

762
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,395
- The answer is obvious. - Incorrect.

763
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:36,425
I can already tell.

764
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:39,066
Is he ringing a bell to attract customers?

765
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:42,166
- This is so easy. - How about this?

766
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,036
Does it press down when it goes like this?

767
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:48,505
When he goes down, this goes up.

768
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:49,805
(Instead of competing, are they discussing?)

769
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,475
- When he goes down... - Guys.

770
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,046
Just take a guess.

771
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:55,575
Isn't this done for making naengmyeon?

772
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:57,816
- Oh, right. - It's not related to fire.

773
00:27:58,086 --> 00:27:59,615
- What did you say? - You said the answer.

774
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,115
The batter for naengmyeon?

775
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:03,256
That's not it either.

776
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,656
Are they making noodles?

777
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:07,466
Is he making noodles in the drawing?

778
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:10,496
Cooling down naengmyeon?

779
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,195
Cooling down naengmyeon? Incorrect.

780
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:14,096
- Cooling it down? - What's this?

781
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,165
I think they said the answer. I'm about to lose it.

782
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,405
Please give us a hint.

783
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:18,605
Is that necessary?

784
00:28:18,606 --> 00:28:20,506
Didn't you already say the answer?

785
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,875
- We said the answer? - You shouted the answer...

786
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,506
While discussing.

787
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,205
- Did we discuss? - What did we say?

788
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,416
Go ahead and say the answer.

789
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,345
You said the answer while discussing.

790
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,586
They're saying that we said the answer while discussing.

791
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,016
What did we discuss?

792
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:34,585
Tae Hyun is being the most foolish ever.

793
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,085
- I said... - Let's discuss it again.

794
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,185
- When he goes down, it goes up. - It goes up.

795
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:40,055
(They trace back their steps.)

796
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:41,396
What did we discuss?

797
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,756
When it goes up...

798
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,125
The noodles...

799
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,066
Is the answer cutting noodles?

800
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:50,736
Incorrect.

801
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:52,365
I got it.

802
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,705
- He got it. - Making noodles?

803
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:54,736
Correct.

804
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:57,646
What was that?

805
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,075
How do they make them?

806
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,575
You can't remember when you have to guess.

807
00:29:00,576 --> 00:29:01,775
You already guessed it.

808
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,645
- Thank you, Tae Hyun. - Thank you for the food.

809
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,416
(Thank you for the food.)

810
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:06,985
This is very gratifying.

811
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,455
(Mild Taste, Spicy Taste, Everyday Outfit of the Day)

812
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,286
- Thank you for the food, sir. - Sure.

813
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:13,396
It's 57 dollars.

814
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:17,426
The prices are nice and cheap.

815
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,625
- Thank you. - Here you go.

816
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,596
I enjoyed it.

817
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,535
(Hannam-dong under the cloudy sky with the spring rain)

818
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,676
I know this place very well.

819
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:30,875
The craft beer place over here...

820
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,382
(6 umbrellas walk side by side for the next dish.)

821
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,075
I walk here...

822
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,315
- I know. - every day.

823
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,475
(With a Hannam-dong resident who's familiar with the street)

824
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:37,985
This place feels new.

825
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,285
(Each street in Hannam-dong feels new to the youngest.)

826
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:40,816
I never come here.

827
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:42,856
Hannam-dong is really nice.

828
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:44,826
It's nice.

829
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:45,886
(Exclaiming)

830
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:47,226
I love places like this.

831
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:48,555
Me too.

832
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:49,755
This is the dried pollack soup restaurant.

833
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:51,556
(Soon, they arrive at the second restaurant.)

834
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:53,435
- This is just... - Their food is delicious.

835
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:54,795
- It looks delicious. - It is.

836
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:55,796
Their deliveries are quick too.

837
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:57,242
- It's already delicious. - This is amazing.

838
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,665
Their menu on the wall will be delicious too.

839
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,252
(They enter the restaurant full of anticipation.)

840
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,275
Look at the font of Hannam Dried Pollack Soup.

841
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:05,382
(Even the signboard shows that it's a tasty restaurant.)

842
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:07,815
(The restaurant is packed during lunchtime every day.)

843
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,976
(Everyone knows about this tasty restaurant.)

844
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,045
(Rich broth with depth)

845
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:15,416
(Dried pollack soup, their signature dish)

846
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:22,196
(A place where you can enjoy a hearty, delicious meal)

847
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,366
It tastes like my mom's cooking.

848
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,896
I like that it tastes like homemade food.

849
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:30,835
When I miss seafood,

850
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:34,376
this is the perfect place to eat.

851
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,206
All right.

852
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,376
There's a lot on the menu.

853
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:43,486
There's so much on the menu.

854
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:44,945
We can order whatever we want.

855
00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:46,686
- We'll get the quiz right anyway. - Right.

856
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,385
It looks like 50 dishes on the menu.

857
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:49,386
(The menu shows how serious they're about food.)

858
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:50,485
There's a lot on the menu.

859
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:51,786
I don't know what to order.

860
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,285
Look at this, Sang Uk.

861
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,425
- Yukjeon, oyster jeon, - It's still on the menu.

862
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:55,455
And beef tartare.

863
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:56,865
How do they manage to make all these?

864
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,295
There's bibimbap.

865
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:00,266
- Hello. - Hello.

866
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:01,436
Hello.

867
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,365
Could you recommend us something?

868
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,805
- What should we order? - How many of you will eat?

869
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,035
- Today, three of us... - Three.

870
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,635
It could be four too.

871
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:10,175
Kim Dong Hyun likes skate, doesn't he?

872
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:11,446
I also like skate.

873
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:13,775
We'll skip that. Dong Hyun won't eat anyway.

874
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:16,645
Whether Dong Hyun likes it or not,

875
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:18,186
he won't get to eat.

876
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,215
- Whether he likes it or not. - Whether he likes it or not.

877
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:21,315
- The three of us will eat. - At this restaurant,

878
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:23,955
our suyuk dishes are popular.

879
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:26,025
We have wild deodeok and pork.

880
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,295
Wild deodeok and pork sounds delicious.

881
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:29,056
- We'll order one of that. - Wait.

882
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,996
I wanted to eat here. Why did I get naengmyeon instead?

883
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,496
- I really wanted to eat here. - Dong Hyun...

884
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,735
If you hadn't cut the white radish salad,

885
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:38,536
- I was going to give you food. - Right.

886
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,406
One dried pollack soup, please.

887
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:42,152
- Would 1 be enough? - I'll split it into 3.

888
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,206
Okay.

889
00:31:43,746 --> 00:31:46,175
Is bibimbap with marinated Yeongdeok crabs available?

890
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,176
Of course.

891
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,515
- Let's get one of that. - This is what I want.

892
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:50,785
This is good too.

893
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,015
Seaweed fulvescens oyster stew is delicious.

894
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,316
- You can have that next time. - You can eat that later.

895
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,016
Now...

896
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,025
- And brown croaker jeon. - Okay.

897
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,185
- Brown croaker jeon? - That's all for now.

898
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:00,795
We'll order those first.

899
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,955
- Thank you. - Thank you.

900
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,126
Give us the question.

901
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:06,566
The food isn't here yet.

902
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,246
- The food isn't here. - We want the question first.

903
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:13,165
Yi Kyung has tried their dried pollack soup.

904
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,175
How about the two of you?

905
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,176
- I... - It's their first time.

906
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:16,235
- It's my first time. - Mine too.

907
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,346
As soon as you eat it,

908
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,476
you'll get this feeling.

909
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,245
- Is it refreshing? - No, it's not.

910
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:22,352
- Is it clean? - It's milky.

911
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:23,896
- What? - It's like invigorating food.

912
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:25,546
- Is it milky? - The food is here.

913
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:27,155
(In awe)

914
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,156
Goodness.

915
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:30,455
- This place is amazing. - The side dishes.

916
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:31,886
The side dishes look insane.

917
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,255
- Each of them is different. - Is it?

918
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:34,425
They're all different.

919
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:35,625
(The side dishes are diverse.)

920
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,126
- What? - There are nine side dishes.

921
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,625
I should come here to eat...

922
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,865
- every day. - You should.

923
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,465
Please let me know if you want more soup.

924
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,565
- Here it is. - Thank you.

925
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:44,806
This is what I'm talking about.

926
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:47,705
(Introducing dried pollack soup, )

927
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,536
(the recommendation for today's lunch)

928
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:54,416
(A cream-colored broth filled with tofu and dried pollack)

929
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:59,816
(Poured deliciously into a bowl)

930
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:03,556
(Enjoy with a spoonful of rice in the soup)

931
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:08,326
(A rich and refreshing broth, dried pollack soup)

932
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:10,996
- Check out the broth. - It's cream-colored.

933
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,296
It really is.

934
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:15,595
Try the broth first.

935
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:16,966
(Goodness)

936
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:19,036
Try it.

937
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:20,306
I'll enjoy it.

938
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:22,676
(My gosh)

939
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,376
I'll tell you how it is.

940
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:27,015
You won't find something like this anywhere else.

941
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:28,045
(A one-of-a-kind broth)

942
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:29,176
It's hot.

943
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:32,516
(Slurping)

944
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,855
(The flavors of the rich broth tingle their tongues.)

945
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,596
Look at Sang Uk enjoy the soup.

946
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:46,766
I should've had a drink last night.

947
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,765
- It's refreshing. - That's a new approach.

948
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,305
(A hot hangover soup on a rainy day)

949
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:56,406
I didn't know one could think that while having hangover soup.

950
00:33:57,846 --> 00:33:59,605
- This would've tasted even better. - Exactly.

951
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,945
- He's saying it would've left... - I know.

952
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,046
Even a bigger impact.

953
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,015
- Other places... - It's perfect.

954
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:06,685
Serve dried pollack soup too,

955
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,755
but it's as if they cooked it...

956
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,756
with a rich beef bone base.

957
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:12,186
Look at its creamy color.

958
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,125
The tofu and dried pollack...

959
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:16,225
- are both in small cubes. - Exactly.

960
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,772
(The tofu and dried pollack are cut into bite-sized pieces.)

961
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:19,965
- Right? - It'll go down with rice better.

962
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,165
- That's right. - Like radish kimchi.

963
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,496
Yes, exactly.

964
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,106
Here you go.

965
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,976
It's wild deodeok and pork.

966
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,616
(Well-cooked pork suyuk is cut into slices.)

967
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:43,156
(Laid evenly on a plate)

968
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,586
(Mixing)

969
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:49,926
(The wild deodeok salad is placed on one side.)

970
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:54,565
(Smells like spring, wild deodeok salad)

971
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:56,535
- Dureup is also served. - Nice.

972
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:58,005
It's the dureup you ordered.

973
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,006
(Even blanched dureup is served.)

974
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:00,487
Thank you. Let's try them one by one.

975
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:02,836
(Humming)

976
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:05,406
Gosh, the aroma.

977
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:07,846
(Dipping in vinegar gochujang)

978
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:11,116
(Awakening his palate with dureup)

979
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:14,985
The aroma...

980
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:16,156
(I love the aroma.)

981
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:17,856
The aroma of the dureup...

982
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:21,256
comes out of my nose more than I expected it to.

983
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:24,495
These two together are the ultimate combo.

984
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,016
(Dureup and pork suyuk, what a combo.)

985
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:28,196
It's like breathing it in.

986
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,036
(Satisfied)

987
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:34,975
This is insane.

988
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,776
(A foolproof combo)

989
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:41,446
(This time, he has the pork with the wild deodeok.)

990
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:46,286
This waters the mouth as soon as you eat it.

991
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:47,696
It balances the whole dish.

992
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:49,116
The wild deodeok?

993
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,286
- I mean... - I bet it's similar.

994
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,766
Whoever said that won't get to have a bite.

995
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,736
I don't think it's similar at all.

996
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:07,935
- Unbelievable. - Anyone can tell...

997
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:09,752
- that it will taste different. - It looks different.

998
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,506
Can we play a game where the winner gets the combo with dureup?

999
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:13,975
I'll come up with a simple game...

1000
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:15,945
- for you to win the dureup combo. - Just that.

1001
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:16,976
Are you going to compete?

1002
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:18,445
- What? - Are you going to play?

1003
00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:19,915
Of course, I'm going to play.

1004
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,285
As if you needed to ask.

1005
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:23,116
Here are two pieces of meat.

1006
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:25,426
How about garlic or chili?

1007
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:26,986
- I'm good. - Minus that.

1008
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:28,656
You won't play the game?

1009
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,255
No, he didn't mean the game.

1010
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:32,095
Tae Hyun, until the day I die,

1011
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,396
I will play the games.

1012
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:35,236
Don't count me out.

1013
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:37,305
- To that... - Until the day you die?

1014
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,765
- The dureup. - Even the dureup.

1015
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,835
(Dureup as a bonus)

1016
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,976
Actually, I want to eat them separately.

1017
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:45,675
(Shooting lasers)

1018
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:47,645
I mean, I'll have what you give me.

1019
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,675
What game should we play?

1020
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:50,016
Here's the game.

1021
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,316
The three of you...

1022
00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:54,136
- Only one wins? - You'll go around in a circle.

1023
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,356
The one who says 31 will get to eat this.

1024
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,325
- The one who says 31? - The one who says 31.

1025
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:01,272
- Oh, that game. - Can we say up to three numbers?

1026
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:03,596
- One, two, three. - Why are you kicking it off?

1027
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:05,625
Why can't it be one of us?

1028
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,236
- Let's start with Tae Hyun. - Hold on.

1029
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:09,095
- Like this? - Start with Tae Hyun.

1030
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,535
Okay, got it.

1031
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:12,565
- One, two, three. - Tae Hyun, then Dong Hyun.

1032
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,705
- Sure. - Go according to age.

1033
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:15,805
- One, two, three. - Four, five, six.

1034
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:16,836
Seven, eight, nine.

1035
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:18,176
Ten.

1036
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:19,376
And 11, 12, 13.

1037
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:20,776
I'll go 14, 15, 16.

1038
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,715
Then 17 and 18.

1039
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:24,516
- I'll go 19 and 20. - They're getting close.

1040
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,716
Then 21.

1041
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:27,986
Whoever says 31 wins.

1042
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:29,256
Then 22.

1043
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:30,985
- They're now only saying one. - Okay, 23.

1044
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,026
They're saying one each.

1045
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,055
(Thinking)

1046
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:36,256
Then 24 and 25.

1047
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,925
But... Hold on.

1048
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,466
Did you end at 25?

1049
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,366
Tae Hyun, there's no way you can eat.

1050
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,836
So let me eat instead.

1051
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,175
There's no way you can eat.

1052
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:49,696
You should just say all three numbers.

1053
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:51,506
Then 26.

1054
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:58,716
(Is there no way out of this?)

1055
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,785
(Groaning)

1056
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:01,856
Seriously?

1057
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:04,126
Tae Hyun, come on. I won't let you eat.

1058
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:06,886
I'll go 27, 28, 29.

1059
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,826
- Done. - Jin will get to eat.

1060
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,525
- Then 30 and 31. - Okay!

1061
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:12,896
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

1062
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:16,177
- Tae Hyun, I can't believe you. - Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

1063
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:17,736
It's really good.

1064
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:18,805
(Open wide!)

1065
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:19,866
If it doesn't fit...

1066
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:22,205
- There you go. - Eat all of it together.

1067
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:23,306
(A big mouthful!)

1068
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:26,576
Here's a napkin.

1069
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,416
(Yummy)
I bet that was good.

1070
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,045
(My gosh)

1071
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,245
He's saying it's really good.

1072
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:34,286
I told you it was insane.

1073
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:35,915
Everything gets mixed...

1074
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,055
- in the mouth. - Chew slowly.

1075
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,136
He says the combo is great.

1076
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,796
He's also saying that the meat is juicy.

1077
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:43,966
The dureup balances out the entire dish.

1078
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:48,656
I'm probably the first to see inside Jin's mouth.

1079
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,156
I was the first person to see the inside of his mouth.

1080
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:54,376
(Laughing)

1081
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:55,836
You have healthy teeth.

1082
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,356
It didn't take long for everything to get mixed.

1083
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,676
(It's the best.)

1084
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,275
- Goodness. - Here you go.

1085
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:03,716
- There isn't any seaweed. - No way.

1086
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:05,716
This is the jeon.

1087
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,656
(Sizzling)

1088
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:12,985
(Golden-brown and tasty)

1089
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,455
- Brown croaker jeon and yukjeon. - Brown croaker jeon and yukjeon?

1090
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,125
The whiter ones are the brown croaker jeon.

1091
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:17,526
The others are yukjeon.

1092
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:19,296
Brown croaker is a pricey fish.

1093
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,796
(Starting with brown croaker jeon)

1094
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,306
(No way!)

1095
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,835
How can this be? Normally, the fish...

1096
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:30,306
breaks up in your mouth.

1097
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:31,975
That's not the case.

1098
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,336
(The brown croaker remains plump.)

1099
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,445
Everything was cooked on a griddle...

1100
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,046
in the kitchen downstairs.

1101
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,416
(Everything goes into the mouth.)

1102
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:45,656
This is great.

1103
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:47,996
They just know how to cook proper food.

1104
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,872
- That's what I think. - The jeon is the best.

1105
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:52,025
Look. Check out the fish.

1106
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:53,425
(A taste of the brown croaker jeon)

1107
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:54,736
- That's quite thick. - Look.

1108
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,706
How can it be that thick?

1109
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,575
The seasoning...

1110
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:02,976
I ate it without any dip.

1111
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,645
It's seasoned perfectly.

1112
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:05,675
- It's already good. - Can we also...

1113
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:06,746
get a brown croaker jeon?

1114
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:09,016
The one who says 31 will eat that too.

1115
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:10,246
This time around,

1116
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,885
the magic number will be 30.

1117
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:13,345
- The one who says 30? - The one who says 30.

1118
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:15,555
- Okay. - Let's go. Tae Hyun, you first.

1119
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:17,216
- One. - Two, three, four.

1120
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:18,825
- Five, six, seven. - Eight, nine, ten.

1121
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:20,855
- Then 11, 12, 13. - I'll go 14, 15, 16.

1122
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:22,056
And 17, 18, 19.

1123
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,156
Then 20.

1124
00:40:23,356 --> 00:40:24,926
- I'll go 21. - I'll go 22.

1125
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,125
They're at this moment again.

1126
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:29,035
(The section that requires thinking)

1127
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,066
Did you end at 22?

1128
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:33,606
Then 23.

1129
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:35,606
I'll go 24.

1130
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:37,946
And 25.

1131
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:42,246
He said one less compared to the last round.

1132
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:44,216
Seriously?

1133
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,716
Unbelievable.

1134
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:49,656
There's no way I can eat.

1135
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,825
- What happened? - This wasn't scripted though.

1136
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,295
- It wasn't. - It wasn't scripted.

1137
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:55,925
We're all trying hard to win the game.

1138
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:56,955
This wasn't scripted.

1139
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:58,525
How can we plan this in advance?

1140
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,795
I want a bite as well.

1141
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,066
- Did you end at 25? - Yes.

1142
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:03,035
- Go on. - Okay, I got it.

1143
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:04,596
We can see if this was scripted or not.

1144
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:06,736
You ended at 25. I'll go 26.

1145
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,775
Depending on what Jin says,

1146
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:10,535
- Tae Hyun... - I'll go 27, 28, 29.

1147
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:11,976
You should've only said 27.

1148
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:16,475
Thanks, Jin. 30.

1149
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,785
I can't believe it. What a bummer.

1150
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,186
I thought I'd get to eat.

1151
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:21,255
Which one would you like?

1152
00:41:21,256 --> 00:41:23,415
- I thought I'd get to eat. - He would've eaten no matter what.

1153
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,825
- He would've eaten. - The brown croaker jeon.

1154
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:25,885
- The brown croaker jeon. - Good choice.

1155
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,996
(Brown croaker jeon and a slice of onion)

1156
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:29,556
(A bite)

1157
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:32,066
Like I said, it's insane.

1158
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,165
The fish doesn't break up.

1159
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,495
This fish does not make sense.

1160
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,566
You can keep chewing it.

1161
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:39,835
- These people know how to cook. - Right?

1162
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:41,236
- The jeon... - Yes?

1163
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:43,135
Isn't greasy at all,

1164
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,106
and it's been cooked perfectly. Look.

1165
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:47,976
(Glancing)

1166
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:49,845
It's affordable too.

1167
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:51,086
(Quickly eat it.)

1168
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:53,186
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

1169
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:55,986
What is this?

1170
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:01,226
Hold on a second. Are you kidding me?

1171
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,655
Come on.

1172
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:05,526
So I turned around...

1173
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:08,836
and saw that his head was bobbing up and down.

1174
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:10,266
(Laughing)

1175
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:11,405
- His head. - Like this.

1176
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:14,476
He was moving his head for no reason.

1177
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:15,706
What was that?

1178
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:17,106
(He choked on something while laughing.)

1179
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:18,745
Seriously. That startled me.

1180
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:19,976
Tell me what's going on.

1181
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,446
Are you okay?

1182
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:23,846
Did you apply lip gloss?

1183
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:26,585
Isn't it yukjeon lip gloss?

1184
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,185
Why are you quiet all of a sudden?

1185
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:29,255
I mean...

1186
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,256
(Flinching)

1187
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,385
- That was funny. - It's surprising how fast Jin...

1188
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,256
adjusted to this dynamic.

1189
00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:36,995
It's as if he had been a regular on the show.

1190
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:39,196
Just to keep the peace, can we offer this to Dong Hyun?

1191
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:40,625
Well...

1192
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:41,935
Seung Ho wants to suggest something.

1193
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:43,666
- What now? - You can...

1194
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,505
- I haven't eaten much. - Seriously.

1195
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:47,336
I don't ask you to do anything unfair.

1196
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,306
Just say this. "Seung Ho."

1197
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:51,806
"My lovely brothers."

1198
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:54,046
"I'll be kind from now on."

1199
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:57,175
"I cut the radish before,"

1200
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,385
"and that was my fault."

1201
00:42:58,386 --> 00:42:59,616
(Sighing)

1202
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:00,855
You just need to admit that it was your fault.

1203
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:02,915
- You should admit it. - He committed a mortal sin.

1204
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,725
- I'm not asking you a lot. - That's right.

1205
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:07,386
(Are you asking me to apologize to you?)

1206
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,050
I don't ask you to do anything unfair.

1207
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,820
Just say this. "Seung Ho."

1208
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,489
"My lovely brothers."

1209
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,560
"I'll be kind from now on."

1210
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,729
"I cut the radish before,"

1211
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,999
"and that was my fault."

1212
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,160
(Sighing)

1213
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,399
You just need to admit that it was your fault.

1214
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,569
- You should admit it. - He committed a mortal sin.

1215
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,470
- I'm not asking you a lot. - That's right.

1216
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,469
(Do I need to make a sincere apology...)

1217
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,709
(just to eat a piece of jeon?)

1218
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,279
- I'm not asking you a lot. - That's right.

1219
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,650
- I can apologize a hundred times. - Go ahead.

1220
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,210
Sang Uk.

1221
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,679
Seung Ho.

1222
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,319
Yi Kyung. I love you all so much.

1223
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,049
I'm so sorry about what happened before.

1224
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,220
I'm sorry. It was for fun.

1225
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,089
(If I can get a biteful, this is nothing.)

1226
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,559
- I can do it a hundred times. - Try it.

1227
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,989
- I can do it 100 times. - Just try 1 piece.

1228
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,389
- It is the thickest piece. - Try it now.

1229
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,199
- Take a piece of onion too. - That's the brown croaker.

1230
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,559
Look how thick it is.

1231
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,569
(Thick)

1232
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,090
- Does it have cilantro in it? - Gosh.

1233
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,369
The brown croaker was thick and tasty, indeed.

1234
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,840
It was so delicious. Gosh.

1235
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,979
He apologizes to them, then he comes at us.

1236
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,710
It's a sickness.

1237
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,679
You can't cure it.

1238
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,379
(He has a habit of getting into others' nerves.)

1239
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,519
You have the sickness of being rude.

1240
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,549
- Jin, look. - After saying that it hurt.

1241
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,260
(Bobbing his head)

1242
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,830
(Getting even with him)

1243
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,369
- Dong Hyun, take a piece of onion. - Eat it with the onion.

1244
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,599
With a piece of onion, it tastes different.

1245
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,140
The lip gloss is put on automatically.

1246
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,710
That's how it tastes.

1247
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,209
- It was hilarious. - Okay, then.

1248
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,650
We ordered three bowls of bibimbap.

1249
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,579
I'll get some of these two's bibimbap...

1250
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,020
so that I can give one whole bowl...

1251
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,319
to one person.

1252
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,719
- To one person? - It's crazy.

1253
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,290
He's so generous.

1254
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,420
Let's play a fair game for it.

1255
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,640
Why don't we ask the staff to pick the one they love?

1256
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,530
We can't do that. Also,

1257
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,259
we can't do rock-paper-scissors and pick the one...

1258
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,600
with a different shape.

1259
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,469
There they are.

1260
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,700
They are here.

1261
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,069
(The last dishes have arrived just in time.)

1262
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,686
It comes with the dried pollack soup again.

1263
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,809
- Gosh. What is it? - Goodness.

1264
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,869
- That's red snow crab. - Gosh.

1265
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,940
- Is it any different? - Please take a look.

1266
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,756
- Look at the crab meat. - Is it different?

1267
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,980
The crab meat.

1268
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,820
(Innards)

1269
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,450
(Crab meat)

1270
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,420
(Flying fish roe)

1271
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,620
(Baby greens)

1272
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,290
(Sesame oil)

1273
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,100
(Red snow crab bibimbap with the ultimate flavors of a crab)

1274
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,099
- You should come and try it. - I've never had it.

1275
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,270
Does it even make sense?

1276
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,540
Gosh. It doesn't even make sense.

1277
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,000
With these two ingredients, I'm all good.

1278
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,740
(Should we mix it first?)

1279
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,980
(After mixing it gently, )

1280
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,150
(it is well mixed to enjoy.)

1281
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,019
(Isn't it well-mixed?)

1282
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,619
Are you on a separate personal channel?

1283
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,789
I didn't want to ruin the crab meat,

1284
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,110
so I mixed it with my chopsticks.

1285
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,830
(Enjoying a bite after mixing it carefully)

1286
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,559
That has to be good.

1287
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,730
Gosh. No.

1288
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,200
That's right.

1289
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,869
Drink the soup. Is there soup?

1290
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,270
No. Don't sip the soup yet.

1291
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,040
- Feel it in your mouth. - More?

1292
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,110
That's right. Gosh.

1293
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:27,210
It just can't go wrong.

1294
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,350
- Actually, - Gosh.

1295
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,519
It feels like I'm chewing...

1296
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,059
the whole crab.

1297
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,389
I can smell every possible scent from a crab.

1298
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,270
(I can smell every possible scent from a crab.)

1299
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,170
(Savoring)

1300
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,909
I will come back here 100 percent.

1301
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,969
(I will come back here 100 percent!)

1302
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,410
It's really tasty.

1303
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,879
It's so good.

1304
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,579
(They are totally satisfied with the dish.)

1305
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,486
Dong Hyun, which game do you want to play, then?

1306
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,220
Precisely, all six of us...

1307
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,260
will write down a name out of the three of you.

1308
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,349
When the owner comes, she will pick one.

1309
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,630
The name she picked gets to eat.

1310
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,620
For example, Sang Uk might write Tae Hyun's name down.

1311
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,559
Seung Ho might write down Jin's name.

1312
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,590
I might write your name.

1313
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,460
It already sounds fishy.

1314
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,759
Come on. It's fishy already.

1315
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,369
- Why? It sounds fair. - Is it fair?

1316
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,499
- It's fair. - But...

1317
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,940
Is there anyone who'd write my name?

1318
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,500
I was going to write your name.

1319
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,569
- Why can't you trust us? - Exactly.

1320
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,779
You should trust your brothers.

1321
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,340
I will overcome the odds against me.

1322
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,579
- I can overcome it. - You should trust your brothers.

1323
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,150
- They're your brothers. - Let's do it.

1324
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,979
Are there six ballots?

1325
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,150
- You can't rig it. - I won't.

1326
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,789
Stop being suspicious.

1327
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,649
You have to fold it like this.

1328
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,560
- Fold it twice. - Once and twice.

1329
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,029
- I'll set it up. - Fold it twice...

1330
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,360
and hold onto it.

1331
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,030
Like this,

1332
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,830
I can write my own name.

1333
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,746
- Is there something going on? - This is a secret vote.

1334
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,069
- What? - It's by secret ballot.

1335
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,239
(Careful)

1336
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,770
I have this one. I trust the odds.

1337
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,509
- Give it to me. - He's from the election committee.

1338
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,710
- Here. - Whatever.

1339
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,349
Wait. You have to put them here.

1340
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,280
- That's not right. - I'll hold onto them.

1341
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,949
- Ma'am. This is... - Yes.

1342
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,980
You can pick one.

1343
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,990
Here we go.

1344
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,350
Pick one and hand it to me.

1345
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,860
I'll beat the odds.

1346
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,860
- Pick one and give it to me. - Okay.

1347
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,860
- Good. I have a good feeling. - Thank you.

1348
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,029
- Don't use any tricks. - No.

1349
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,429
- Put it over here. - I'll reveal the others first.

1350
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,300
- Okay. - You have to put it down.

1351
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,840
Here. It's under the bowl.

1352
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,139
- What are those? - These are the ones...

1353
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,979
- who won't be eating. - I see. Who are they?

1354
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,286
(Revealing the non-freeloaders first)

1355
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,056
- It says Kim Dong Hyun. - "Jin, not Kim Dong Hyun."

1356
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,349
- For goodness' sake. - Jin failed.

1357
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,449
I saw my name on it

1358
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,749
- That means Jin lost his chance. - If two ballots say Dong Hyun,

1359
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,549
it's over for him, isn't it?

1360
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,589
Jin loses his chance.

1361
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,860
- Gosh. - It's over for Jin.

1362
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,860
Many people voted for Jin.

1363
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,480
Jin loses... Did everyone write Jin's name?

1364
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,529
Come on. Hold on.

1365
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,399
- Did everyone write Jin's name? - Gosh.

1366
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,200
- Jin got three votes. He loses. - No.

1367
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,040
There's 1 left since 2 people voted for Jin.

1368
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,770
Tae Hyun loses his chance.

1369
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,039
- It's Tae Hyun's vote. - I think I wrote that one.

1370
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,280
- Yes. It was yours. - It means it's over for me.

1371
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,300
- Dong Hyun's vote isn't there. - "Dong Hyun..."

1372
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,780
"will spoon-feed Tae Hyun."

1373
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,019
What? That means...

1374
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
- Dong Hyun. - What?

1375
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,289
The one I wrote down hasn't been opened.

1376
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,196
(Is it the only vote with his name that he wrote himself?)

1377
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,990
- The one I wrote down. - It's crazy.

1378
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,289
- It's impossible. - Kim Dong Hyun!

1379
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,629
(Kim Dong Hyun!)

1380
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,630
Kim Dong Hyun!

1381
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,270
(He has won.)

1382
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,270
- Hold on. - Dong Hyun.

1383
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,139
- The world is just. - Yes.

1384
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,039
- It's crazy. - Dong Hyun, I told you.

1385
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,310
- It hasn't been rigged. - It's crazy.

1386
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,709
- What could this be? - I said it was a fair game.

1387
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,549
- You won it after being nice. - Exactly.

1388
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,390
- It's a fair game. - I didn't try to be nice.

1389
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,049
(He feels great.)

1390
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,820
No. I did try to be nice.

1391
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,249
Gosh. It's crazy.

1392
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,389
- There was only one vote for him. - The probability was... Dong Hyun.

1393
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,859
None of you three voted for me.

1394
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,180
(None of you three voted for me.)

1395
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,960
It hurt him.

1396
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,459
- Gosh. It looks so good. - Dong Hyun.

1397
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,569
He will enjoy it so much. It's unbelievably good.

1398
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,870
- I'm glad you won. - Me too.

1399
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:08,999
- Yes. - It's a spoonful.

1400
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
(A big spoonful)

1401
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,640
Isn't it awesome?

1402
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,540
(Savoring)

1403
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,900
- How is it? - Isn't it good?

1404
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,509
I thought I'd only taste sesame oil.

1405
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,649
But I can taste the innards very well.

1406
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,180
The crab innards give it a kick.

1407
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,319
- It has a lot of innards in it. - It's the key.

1408
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,519
They put so much innards.

1409
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,159
It also has so much crab meat.

1410
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,690
It has so much crab in it.

1411
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,430
The flavors linger.

1412
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,929
Do you want coke?

1413
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,430
- Coke. - Sure.

1414
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,869
- It's here. - Okay.

1415
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,370
Is there a fridge, Tae Hyun?

1416
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:42,899
- It's really tasty. - Thank you.

1417
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,620
- They had water in here. - I'll get water.

1418
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,469
(He locates his prey.)

1419
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,239
- This can't be it, can it? - We were short-sighted.

1420
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,639
- We can use this. - It's here.

1421
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,679
We can have it.

1422
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,180
Nothing is stopping him now.

1423
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,080
- What is he doing right now? - Well.

1424
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,650
(Feeling guilty)

1425
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,189
Apologize.

1426
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,250
(What?)

1427
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,719
(What just happened?)

1428
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,789
Good job.

1429
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,389
(While everyone was all over the place, )

1430
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,030
You can't eat that, Dong Hyun.

1431
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,469
(Dong Hyun was busy eating secretly.)

1432
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,030
Nothing is stopping him now.

1433
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,270
(And Jin eats secretly next to him.)

1434
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,710
(What?)

1435
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,250
(There may be blue and better blue.)

1436
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,709
I can't believe...

1437
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,049
the food is gone as soon as I take my eyes off it.

1438
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,189
(One's food is gone if one takes the guard down.)

1439
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,050
- It smells so much like crab. - I see.

1440
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,559
I guess...

1441
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,420
the crab innards taste great.

1442
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,530
Gosh. I enjoyed it very much.

1443
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,029
- I think... - I think...

1444
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,960
it'll be over 300 dollars.

1445
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,699
It's 241 dollars.

1446
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,969
(Total: 241 dollars)

1447
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:47,970
It's quite a bit.

1448
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,940
We just need to get the quiz right.

1449
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,809
Please give them the quiz.

1450
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,469
- It's 241 dollars. - I'm curious.

1451
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,510
Okay.

1452
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,786
Pollack is "myeongtae," and dried pollack is "bookeo."

1453
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,410
- That's too easy. - It's an easy one.

1454
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,980
- We're in trouble. - Yes.

1455
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,550
Pollack, myeongtae, has many stories about the name's origin.

1456
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,419
Some say it's called myeongtae...

1457
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,889
because a person with the last name of Tae...

1458
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,410
from Myeongcheon area caught the fish.

1459
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,860
That was one story that was documented.

1460
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,889
Some say it was called myeongtae...

1461
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,200
because you felt a change after eating pollack's liver.

1462
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,729
- What's this change? - What?

1463
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,970
(What's this change?)

1464
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,169
What is this?

1465
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,439
I was writing down "myeongtae" and "liver."

1466
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,610
I didn't even know that pollack had a liver.

1467
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,710
A change after eating the pollack's liver?

1468
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,879
Your liver gets healthier.

1469
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,280
That's the only one I can think of.

1470
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,419
In Chinese characters, "Myeong" means "bright and clear."

1471
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,980
So, a person becomes brighter.

1472
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,490
Or...

1473
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,760
it has a rumor that they can make their names widely known.

1474
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,219
I keep thinking...

1475
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,989
We have "becoming popular" and "brighter."

1476
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,329
- I don't think "brighter" is right. - I agree.

1477
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,236
I can't throw away the idea that they become popular.

1478
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,129
Right. They spread their names and become popular.

1479
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,170
I'll go with that.

1480
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,800
- We got it. - Okay.

1481
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,999
They spread their names and become big guns.

1482
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,510
It means they become successful.

1483
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,109
That's one of the stories.

1484
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,440
Awesome. It was a nice approach.

1485
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,660
- They became successful. - "They became successful."

1486
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,710
(Who will pay for the meal in the end?)

1487
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,820
I think so.

1488
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,720
Incorrect.

1489
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,719
For goodness' sake. It sounded plausible, though.

1490
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,640
I got it! Are we having an individual match now?

1491
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,860
- Should we pick one now? - I got it.

1492
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,470
They thought their livers got bigger.

1493
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:22,859
- That's possible. - Which means they became bold.

1494
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,899
- No? - You might be right.

1495
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Say it.

1496
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,430
Incorrect.

1497
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,340
I'll give it a go.

1498
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,870
You could see more clearly.

1499
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,010
Correct.

1500
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,009
Myeong of "bright and clear" was correct.

1501
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,439
Is it because their eyes can see more clearly?

1502
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,109
- Yes. - Myeong means bright and clear.

1503
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,280
- Was I right about "myeong," then? - You were.

1504
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,079
Because of malnutrition,

1505
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,979
many farmers couldn't see well.

1506
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,890
A pollack's liver contains lots of vitamin A,

1507
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,259
- It had a scientific reason. - so they could see...

1508
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,259
- more clearly. - It was scientific.

1509
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,460
It's between Sang Uk and me.

1510
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,630
- Should we narrow it down? - Yes.

1511
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:54,999
- Let's pick one to pay for all. - Okay.

1512
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,430
A young pollack is called "Nogari."

1513
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,030
That's easy.

1514
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,799
"Like nogari" is a phrase...

1515
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,840
- that we use frequently. - Yes.

1516
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,909
It means one is talking unnecessarily a lot...

1517
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,739
or people are chatting for a long time.

1518
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,780
That's right.

1519
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,709
Which characteristic of the pollack created...

1520
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,509
- this phrase? - It's so easy.

1521
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,319
- I got it. Its big mouth. - Its big mouth?

1522
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,979
(Its big mouth?)

1523
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,080
Incorrect.

1524
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,950
I got it. It's because the ladies...

1525
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,319
who prepare the pollack at the market are chatty.

1526
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,659
(Because the ladies who prepare the pollack...)

1527
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,929
(at the market are chatty?)

1528
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,999
- Nice approach. - Hey.

1529
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,329
- Sang Uk. - Yes?

1530
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,530
Take your card out.

1531
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,900
- Take your card out. - Incorrect.

1532
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,169
- I know what it is. - I got it.

1533
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,900
Because pollack lays many eggs?

1534
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,110
"Because pollack lays many eggs?"

1535
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,010
- Correct. - What?

1536
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,239
- Is it correct? - Yes.

1537
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,279
- What? Is it correct? - Come on.

1538
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
- It's crazy. - Why?

1539
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:48,419
Is it because it lays many eggs?

1540
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,019
Like how many eggs are hatched...

1541
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,849
I thought it was about opening up the young pollack.

1542
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,819
But it was about having many young fish.

1543
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,420
- That's right. - So many.

1544
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,490
Why did you miss such an easy one?

1545
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,690
Sang Uk.

1546
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,310
You've come back after a while. Thanks for the meal.

1547
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,830
We did order a lot.

1548
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,300
- Hey. - I'm full.

1549
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,599
I thought I'd be paying today...

1550
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,240
because I hadn't paid for it once.

1551
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,740
- Really? - That's right.

1552
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,310
So I thought I'd be paying today.

1553
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,570
Use the prize money from the tournament.

1554
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,240
I got eliminated quickly this time.

1555
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,780
I fell off quickly.

1556
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,349
(Lunch recommendations in Hannam-dong)

1557
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,549
(Naengmyeon: mouth-watering, spicy and sweet, )

1558
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,719
(the spiciness you miss overseas)

1559
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,096
(Dried pollack soup: hearty, warm, great side dishes)

1560
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,590
Hey. I brought something.

1561
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,219
It's probiotic for your metabolism.

1562
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,659
- I always have it. - I see.

1563
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,889
It's good for keeping a balance.

1564
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,330
- It's easy on the stomach. - I see.

1565
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,129
- We're big eaters. - Right.

1566
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,499
- We are heavy eaters. - We love food.

1567
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,729
We have to take it.

1568
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:37,730
- Probiotic? - Yes.

1569
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:39,469
- I love it. - We eat three servings per person.

1570
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,300
I love it.

1571
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,780
It helps you with your diet. I work out too, so...

1572
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,586
- it's important to take it. - You're right.

1573
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,549
My bowel movement is on fire these days.

1574
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,880
- That's important. - Yes.

1575
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,636
It works right away. I'm going to the restroom.

1576
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,289
(Laughing)

1577
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,200
- We enjoyed our lunches... - Yes.

1578
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,599
In Hannam-dong.

1579
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,099
We have to eat dinner now.

1580
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,100
- Yes. - That's right.

1581
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:14,569
Based on what we had,

1582
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,970
we should grill some meat for dinner.

1583
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,369
- That sounds good. - That's right.

1584
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,609
- It's a must. - We have to go for it.

1585
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,110
- What kind of meat? - It's Korean beef.

1586
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,480
- It's Korean beef, but... - Hold on.

1587
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,949
A Korean beef place in Hannam-dong.

1588
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,709
And it's the finest one.

1589
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,620
If it's the finest, it's a different story.

1590
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,980
We're in trouble.

1591
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:33,420
It's famous as a place that celebrities go to.

1592
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,590
- We can't miss it. - Jin can recommend one too.

1593
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,289
There's another good restaurant near that place.

1594
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,430
How about grilled shellfish?

1595
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,360
I'd love it. I love shellfish.

1596
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,670
- It'll be perfect as it's raining. - Yes.

1597
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,399
I go there with my friends...

1598
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,340
and have grilled shellfish with soju.

1599
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,169
(So, here are today's DMR.)

1600
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,139
(Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1601
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,379
I have to go with the shellfish.

1602
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,340
Choose between Korean beef and grilled shellfish.

1603
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,449
Since I brought up the Korean beef,

1604
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,280
I'll choose it and break the record there.

1605
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,549
- I always pick the meat. - You're right.

1606
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,189
Will it be just you and me for the grilled shellfish again?

1607
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,866
I'll absolutely choose the grilled shellfish.

1608
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,589
- Really? - I love it.

1609
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,619
- Me too. - Really?

1610
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,229
- I love seafood. - Me too.

1611
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,529
- I'll choose the grilled shellfish. - I...

1612
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,600
I'll choose the beef, then. I love them both.

1613
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,760
Dong Hyun, Seung Ho,

1614
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,729
and I will eat at the Korean beef place.

1615
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,169
Tae Hyun, Jin, and Sang Uk will have the grilled shellfish.

1616
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,000
- Okay. - it's all set.

1617
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,970
I'm losing money today.

1618
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,840
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you.

1619
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,390
- Sang Uk. - Sang Uk, thanks for the food.

1620
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,050
- Thanks for the food. - It was good.

1621
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,789
(Today, they take a walk in Hannam-dong.)

1622
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,150
(Embassy of Malaysia)

1623
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,719
(UAE Embassy in Seoul)

1624
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,959
(Embassy of India)

1625
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,559
(Embassies in Hannam-dong)

1626
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,589
(Of 110 foreign official residences, )

1627
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,659
(about 30 embassies are gathered in Hannam-dong, )

1628
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,660
(creating a unique atmosphere.)

1629
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,239
(Hannam-dong and Itaewon)

1630
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,669
(Hannam-dong and Itaewon have been the hub...)

1631
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,209
(of foreigners living in Korea.)

1632
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,570
(Alongside Gangnam, they're places with the hottest trend.)

1633
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,480
Actually, it's lovely to stay in Hannam-dong all day.

1634
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,279
Jin goes to many places.

1635
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,949
- Which way should we go? - Where is it?

1636
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,720
- Go straight. - Straight.

1637
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,189
Its entrance is really small.

1638
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,120
It makes you think, "Is there a restaurant here?"

1639
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,259
- It's here. - It's hard to tell, right?

1640
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,429
- They didn't even have this before. - What?

1641
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,876
(Jin from the area has guided them to...)

1642
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,199
- Is this it? - This is it.

1643
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,300
- Hey, it's... - It has a great vibe.

1644
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,429
It feels like I'm on the way to the west coast.

1645
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,639
(It doesn't feel like Hannam-dong.)

1646
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,640
It has a cool vibe.

1647
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:31,499
- It's awesome. - The food is good.

1648
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,369
- It's really... - I can't believe this place.

1649
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,439
- It's an old restaurant. - What is it?

1650
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,280
- Which seats should we take? - What?

1651
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,810
I didn't know this place until my friends told me about it.

1652
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,120
(Menu: Grilled shellfish, steamed shellfish...)

1653
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,749
(As soon as you enter, )

1654
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,720
(you time-travel back to Eurwangni in 1990s.)

1655
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,220
(A cozy spot in the middle of Hannam-dong)

1656
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,530
It feels so much like Pohang.

1657
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,299
It's a restaurant with a good price...

1658
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,460
that I often come after work.

1659
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,600
(There is fresh seafood.)

1660
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,840
(And you can choose what you like and taste it.)

1661
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,009
(DMR 1: Grilled shellfish)

1662
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,179
This place is a bit...

1663
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,709
I feel like I'm on the west coast right now.

1664
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,080
(Welcome.)

1665
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,819
Please start the fire first.

1666
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,890
We...

1667
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,389
Did you hear what they say because it's cold?

1668
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,390
"Please start the fire."

1669
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,111
I need the heat even though I'm not eating.

1670
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,090
Seriously.

1671
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,670
- We'll order the grilled shellfish. - The grilled shellfish.

1672
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,669
After having some... I love the scallops so much.

1673
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,670
- The scallops. - We have to order them.

1674
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:35,270
I love Venus clams. Big ones.

1675
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,640
The Venus clams.

1676
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,910
It has all kinds of clams.

1677
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,639
You can order it first and order more later.

1678
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,640
- For now? - For now.

1679
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,209
We should order the large grilled shellfish.

1680
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,210
(A large one, it is.)

1681
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,619
We'll order the large grilled shellfish and grilled prawns.

1682
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,179
(Orders: Large grilled shellfish, grilled prawns)

1683
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,356
Something like young radish kimchi.

1684
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,140
- With that? - Yes. Leave some behind and...

1685
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,619
- You don't have to serve them. - Young radish kimchi bibimbap?

1686
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,180
- Please put them here. - But that's...

1687
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,989
Isn't it all right to have some carrots?

1688
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,090
- These are just carrots. - Then...

1689
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,760
Just take one piece each.

1690
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,759
- Just take one piece each. - Why are you taking the carrots?

1691
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,799
I don't like these.

1692
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,070
If I were to have it, I have to eat 3,000 pieces.

1693
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,200
With just one...

1694
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,039
In that case, let's place it for a bet.

1695
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,139
- No. - Put it here.

1696
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,709
Let's do rock-paper-scissors, and the winner takes three.

1697
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,510
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1698
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,110
Okay.

1699
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,750
Gosh. I even lost this one.

1700
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,809
Let's do rock-paper-scissors while putting three on the bet.

1701
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,319
Please do it, so I can have six.

1702
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,419
Do you want six of them?

1703
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,649
- Okay. - You're something.

1704
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,689
Who's doing it? Tae Hyun?

1705
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:26,889
Rock-paper-scissors.

1706
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,720
Okay. Give me those three.

1707
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,389
- Does it keep increasing? - Do you want to bet those six?

1708
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,659
- Six of them? - Try it.

1709
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,459
- Double it. - Okay. Wait for it.

1710
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,759
Please double it.

1711
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,399
- Please double it. - This is new.

1712
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,270
For now, I'll raise three.

1713
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,929
- I'll raise 3 for now. - For now, 3.

1714
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,469
Hey. It has turned into a casino all of a sudden.

1715
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,139
(Betting carefully)

1716
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,869
Let's place them here, and the winner takes them.

1717
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:46,969
- Okay. - Good.

1718
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,980
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1719
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,939
(Jin won.)

1720
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,449
- Jin won. - It was a good game.

1721
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,079
(It was a good game.)

1722
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,480
- What was that? - No.

1723
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,080
No one can have it.

1724
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,920
When I look at you,

1725
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,066
you look like a member who started the show with us.

1726
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,659
When I look at you guys, you look like my members too.

1727
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,990
(It feels like it's my team.)

1728
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,590
Of the members of BTS,

1729
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,659
who will blend well with our show?

1730
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,970
- Of my members? - Does anyone come to mind?

1731
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,540
For this role, Jung Kook will be a perfect fit.

1732
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,609
- Why? - Is he a big eater?

1733
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,440
- He eats really well. - Really?

1734
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,840
V would fit into this vibe the most.

1735
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,280
Why?

1736
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,320
The vibe of bad-mouthing each other.

1737
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,210
Good.

1738
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,650
He doesn't get hurt when he hears rough words.

1739
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,720
Things we say because we're close.

1740
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:36,520
Sang Uk, why don't you send a video to invite them?

1741
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,229
- How old are they? - Jung Kook was born in 1997.

1742
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,930
V was born in 1995.

1743
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,059
- I was born in 1996. - You're older than Jung Kook.

1744
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,000
So you just need to visit the show as my junior.

1745
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,629
(My goodness)

1746
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,469
- Will you be okay? - Yes. Why won't I be?

1747
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,769
- His fans are scary. - Exactly.

1748
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,970
Even I watch what I say to Jung Kook.

1749
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,340
- Exactly. - Hurry up and apologize.

1750
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,080
Shall I send him a video message?

1751
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,249
- Shall I do that? - Yes.

1752
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,319
- I'll go ahead and do it. - Why weren't you saying something?

1753
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,420
We'll be grateful it if you guys visit the show.

1754
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:08,219
We can go abroad too.

1755
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,719
Let us know whenever you have time.

1756
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,430
Then all of us will go and meet you guys.

1757
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,760
- Please come. - It'll be nice.

1758
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,730
It'll be great.

1759
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,960
Promise me.

1760
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,529
I'm not the one who manages their schedules.

1761
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,099
But you can still talk to them.

1762
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,670
Jin, I'll give you this much.

1763
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,370
- One more time. - You finished it.

1764
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,009
- It's here. - I'll put it here.

1765
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,139
(While they chat, the briquette fire enters first.)

1766
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,986
- Do you put in two at a time? - They don't need the briquettes.

1767
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,080
It's perfect.

1768
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,940
Gosh, it's warm.

1769
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,680
It warms you up.

1770
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,679
It looks like you guys will eat.

1771
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,450
(Then food follows!)

1772
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,819
(Impressed)

1773
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,920
Is it the big size?

1774
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,490
(Grilled shellfish, big size)

1775
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,700
(They offer an assortment of fresh shellfish!)

1776
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,729
(Scallop, Asian hard clam, pen shell, )

1777
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,399
(oyster, cheese in an aluminum foil tray)

1778
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,269
(There are many others.)

1779
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,139
You get cheese in an aluminum foil tray.

1780
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,410
You put the aluminum foil tray over the fire.

1781
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,349
(They put the pen shell on the grill first.)

1782
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:09,870
That's right. You need to put it here.

1783
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,420
As the cheese melts, you add some sliced pen shell.

1784
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,340
Sir, what's inside the round aluminum foil tray?

1785
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,429
It contains vegetables and cheese.

1786
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,030
That's right. You put it here.

1787
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,700
Once the shellfish are grilled,

1788
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,969
you put all of them in the aluminum foil tray...

1789
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,200
and mix them with cheese.

1790
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,050
Then you eat the mixture with a spoon.

1791
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,570
I like this one.

1792
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,740
Please hold on.

1793
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:33,769
Let's make it more visible.

1794
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,010
Please lift it up.

1795
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,950
- It's a hazelnut ark. - A hazelnut ark?

1796
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,780
How does it look?

1797
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,319
It looks great.

1798
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,419
(One scallop is on the grill of the team that isn't eating.)

1799
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,850
- Let's put three. - All right.

1800
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,089
- What's this? - We want to grill it for you guys.

1801
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,689
- What's this? - There isn't enough room.

1802
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,659
- It walked into our grill. - Is that so?

1803
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,429
- Did it walk? - It walked into our grill.

1804
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,229
Didn't you know? I'm sorry.

1805
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,329
- All of them are raw. - These are for the three of you.

1806
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,330
(They politely hand over the eating utensils.)

1807
01:03:59,331 --> 01:04:00,430
These are for us.

1808
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,180
These are for us. We don't have a plate either.

1809
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,209
I find them so fascinating.

1810
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,139
(Let's see.)

1811
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,140
Where did they get it?

1812
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,909
Do you want to make a bet for that shellfish?

1813
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,020
- This one? - Yes. Do you want to make a bet?

1814
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,019
Hold on a second. Before we begin,

1815
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,989
- may I ask you a question? - What is it?

1816
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,389
May we have a round for a scallop?

1817
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,859
You should give us a sizable one. It's too small. It should be big.

1818
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,930
- Forget it then. - We'll do it.

1819
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,050
A round of a scallop should come after this one.

1820
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,599
(There should be steps.)

1821
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,629
Seung Ho is angry.

1822
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,770
(I won't do it.)

1823
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,510
(Laughing)

1824
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,239
In that case, is there someone who's good at grilling shellfish?

1825
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,839
- I'm really good at it. - As for me,

1826
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,650
I was born inside a shellfish.

1827
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,019
- So you're Venus. - Listen.

1828
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,819
("The Birth of Seung Ho")

1829
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,520
I'll give you my profile first.

1830
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,189
My family is from Goheung, South Jeolla Province.

1831
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,190
- Goheung. - Yes.

1832
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:02,999
I grew up eating grilled shellfish.

1833
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,460
You can see my scar over here.

1834
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,429
I was digging up shellfish in the mudflat...

1835
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,029
at the age of seven when I fell.

1836
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,269
When I got up, I saw that an oyster had pierced my hand.

1837
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:11,470
You can see the scar, right?

1838
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,110
This is how much I love shellfish.

1839
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,779
We need to eat shellfish quickly.

1840
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,909
It's tasty that way.

1841
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,850
If you grill shellfish well, we'll give you a benefit.

1842
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,980
(The one who grills shellfish well will receive a benefit.)

1843
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,520
- We'll grill them well. - Yes.

1844
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,889
I'm really good at grilling shellfish.

1845
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,149
That way, you'll be able to eat quickly.

1846
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,120
(Thus, two grills get used.)

1847
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,690
That one looks tasty.

1848
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,390
- That one. - This one?

1849
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,999
- It must be chewy. - This one?

1850
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,099
Seriously.

1851
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,370
When can we eat it?

1852
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,520
Shall I eat it and see if it's cooked?

1853
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:43,769
(They almost fell for it.)

1854
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,769
- You don't need to grill them. - I was just asking.

1855
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,110
It's a good idea to be careful since they're raw.

1856
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,540
Let's ask the owner just in case.

1857
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,010
When can we eat the shellfish?

1858
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,820
- Once a shellfish opens up... - Okay.

1859
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,690
- Listen carefully. - Once it opens up...

1860
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,390
Do this.

1861
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,490
(Take off one side of the shell.)

1862
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,260
You take it off.

1863
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:08,230
Eat it when it boils like this.

1864
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,060
(Eat it when the shellfish boils.)

1865
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,029
Sang Uk, eat this one.

1866
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,939
I see that we need to eat more quickly than we expected.

1867
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,170
(Overcooked shellfish won't be tasty!)

1868
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,780
(Plump shellfish!)

1869
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,390
It has been a while since I had grilled shellfish.

1870
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,780
- Isn't it delicious? - It's delicious.

1871
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,030
The shellfish comes alive in your mouth.

1872
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,159
Here, Jin.

1873
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,669
- Thank you. - Here.

1874
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,770
This one is ready.

1875
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,999
- Cook it thoroughly. - Okay.

1876
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,540
Seriously. It's already seasoned.

1877
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:53,840
Shellfish.

1878
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,839
(Tae Hyun, try it.)

1879
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,279
Seriously. It's already seasoned.

1880
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,680
It's because of the seawater.

1881
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,820
(Happy)

1882
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,579
Since it's shellfish,

1883
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,849
- it's... - It's seasoned.

1884
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,320
It's seasoned. It's so nice.

1885
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:16,030
(The cheesy pen shell is getting cooked.)

1886
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,200
(Savory cheese and pen shell meat)

1887
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,000
It's tasty.

1888
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,149
- It's really tasty. - It's like pizza cheese.

1889
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,249
It's like kimchi stew.

1890
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,849
(Will it suit Tae Hyun's taste?)

1891
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,850
Gosh, this is it.

1892
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:39,619
Adding an ingredient like this makes it so tasty.

1893
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,819
- It's great, right? - Seriously.

1894
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,219
When I eat grilled shellfish,

1895
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,119
I add a lot of ingredients.

1896
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,480
(Pen shell and scallop with cheese stimulate the appetite.)

1897
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,060
Is there a cooked scallop?

1898
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,259
I was about to give you one.

1899
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,340
- Let's eat one. - I'm cooking it as a special dish.

1900
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,439
This scallop is fully cooked. Do you want it...

1901
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,209
or should we have a question?

1902
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,839
(You'll give a quiz for the freeloaders, right?)

1903
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,939
Well...

1904
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,039
(They can't hear Seung Ho since they're absorbed in eating.)

1905
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,209
It's so tasty with cheese.

1906
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:08,280
It's so tasty, right?

1907
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,119
- It's tasty. - It's tasty. Seriously.

1908
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,889
Let me ask you this one more time.

1909
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,150
This scallop is fully cooked.

1910
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,260
Shall I give it to you? Will we get another quiz?

1911
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,260
It's difficult to give a quiz.

1912
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:23,159
(Sad)

1913
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,630
- I flipped it over. - Here you go.

1914
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,700
It's so tasty.

1915
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,799
Please add a lot.

1916
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,100
- Thank you. - Please add a lot.

1917
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,610
It's hot.

1918
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,469
How did you do it?

1919
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,470
(They begin to find their own ways.)

1920
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:36,579
What did you do?

1921
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,180
- I mean... - It keeps happening.

1922
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,750
What?

1923
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,910
They won't know even if we eat.

1924
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,260
They won't know. They aren't interested in us.

1925
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,919
(Thus, they begin to cheat.)

1926
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,790
- What are you doing? - I'm cutting it.

1927
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,490
(Asking for help)

1928
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:58,800
- We're cutting and grilling them. - What's that in your mouth?

1929
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,629
It's my tongue.

1930
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:03,269
- You're chewing your tongue. - I'm chewing my tongue.

1931
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,869
- You're chewing your tongue. I see. - I'm chewing my tongue.

1932
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:06,969
- Really? - Yes. It's my tongue.

1933
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,469
How is there no blood?

1934
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,540
I'm training my tongue by chewing it.

1935
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,409
- How strange. - Your tongue hurts...

1936
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,209
when it's punched, after all.

1937
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:16,450
- Your tongue hurts. - You're training it by chewing it.

1938
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,580
It's my tongue.

1939
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,019
- Even when you bite on it... - It's my tongue.

1940
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,859
Is that your tongue as well?

1941
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,920
What?

1942
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,029
- What? - What are you chewing?

1943
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,710
- What is it? - Are you chewing something?

1944
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,100
What?

1945
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,160
Why can't you speak more than one word at a time?

1946
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,770
Are you chewing your tongue?

1947
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,100
To avoid getting caught, he's swallowing it whole.

1948
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,970
What is it?

1949
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,580
(Swallowing)

1950
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,880
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1951
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,279
- I mean... - To avoid getting caught...

1952
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,050
Did you chew something?

1953
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,480
No, I bit my tongue.

1954
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,850
You bit your tongue.

1955
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,419
- It's cooked. - Shall I do that?

1956
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,090
I'm putting it inside. It's fully cooked.

1957
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,019
There should be about 3 to 4 shellfish,

1958
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,230
but there are only two.

1959
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,690
Where did they go?

1960
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:01,929
- Did you take them... - Yes?

1961
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,430
Instead of putting them inside?

1962
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,629
(Preparing the shellfish with a lot of effort)

1963
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:05,870
This is...

1964
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,680
Is it because we added cheese in the beginning?

1965
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,569
Vinegar gochujang and cheese...

1966
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,139
- are the best. - It's sweet and sour.

1967
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,309
What are you doing?

1968
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,610
(Chuckling)

1969
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,179
What are you doing?

1970
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,180
(He got caught.)

1971
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,409
Gosh, it was a mistake.

1972
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:23,449
I'm sorry.

1973
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,550
Grilling the shellfish like this became a habit.

1974
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,819
I did it without thinking.

1975
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,950
I'm sorry.

1976
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,620
He's observant. I thought he wasn't looking.

1977
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,960
Sir, when will we get more pen shells?

1978
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,459
They're the real deal.

1979
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,499
(They get 2 more pen shells that they ordered earlier.)

1980
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,299
He keeps giving them to us.

1981
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,369
(He delivers them to the servants.)

1982
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,399
- In that case, - I was getting ready.

1983
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,680
Don't you want to eat something?

1984
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,269
How about this one?

1985
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:51,779
We'll grill these two pen shells.

1986
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,280
Give one of them to the person who gets the quiz right.

1987
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,750
That's a good idea.

1988
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,819
- A quiz for the freeloaders. - A quiz for the freeloaders.

1989
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,419
- Let's have a quiz. - Yes.

1990
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,949
Tell us what the prize will be.

1991
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,519
- The aluminum foil tray? - The pen shell and...

1992
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,919
- This one and that one. - These two.

1993
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,859
- Those two? Are they right? - Yes.

1994
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,540
(They add the aluminum foil tray as well.)

1995
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,529
- They're for one person. - What was that?

1996
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,199
- What? - If those two items are the prize,

1997
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,500
only one person should eat.

1998
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,029
Of course.

1999
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:18,970
(1 pen shell and 1 aluminum foil tray)

2000
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,540
- Please eat. - Let's add one more each.

2001
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,579
We'll add one more each.

2002
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,510
(They begin embezzling shellfish.)

2003
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,110
(A quiz for the freeloaders)

2004
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,850
Kim Ryeo, a scholar in the late Joseon dynasty,

2005
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,619
studied various types of shellfish...

2006
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,590
and wrote a book titled "Uhaeieobo."

2007
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:39,559
Because this shellfish had...

2008
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,389
many grooves, he thought it looked like a tiled roof...

2009
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,100
and called it "Wareungja."

2010
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,129
What's this shellfish that was offered to the king...

2011
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,869
as 1 of the 8 delicacies?

2012
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,910
Please repeat the question. I missed the beginning.

2013
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,110
- What was the question? - I'll repeat it.

2014
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,679
Kim Ryeo, a scholar in the late Joseon dynasty,

2015
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,009
studied various types of shellfish...

2016
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:59,949
and wrote a book titled "Uhaeieobo."

2017
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,779
Because this shellfish had...

2018
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,049
many grooves, he thought it looked like a tiled roof...

2019
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,750
and called it "Wareungja."

2020
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,389
Let me answer.

2021
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,619
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2022
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,019
- Go ahead. - Let me answer. Scallop.

2023
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,359
Scallop.

2024
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,559
- We had so many scallops. - Incorrect.

2025
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,660
- Whelk. - Whelk? Incorrect.

2026
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,999
It looks like I'll eat.

2027
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,129
- What is it? - Isn't it correct?

2028
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,659
- Let me answer. - What is it?

2029
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,869
- Cockle. - It was 1 of the 2.

2030
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,629
- Correct. - Yes!

2031
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:22,639
(Dong Hyun is correct.)

2032
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,699
How did you know?

2033
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,799
I thought it had to be a scallop or a cockle.

2034
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,440
My first choice was a cockle.

2035
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,209
- You earned them. - Yes.

2036
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,339
I'll go ahead and eat.

2037
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,310
- I'll give it to them now. - Okay.

2038
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,980
Hey, that's mine.

2039
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,079
- That's mine. - This one is yours.

2040
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,020
Both of them are mine.

2041
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,750
Both of them are mine.

2042
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,589
I should've gone with cockle.

2043
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,819
(Disappointed)

2044
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,589
- I should've gone with cockle. - It's my first time eating it.

2045
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,690
(I'll finally eat.)

2046
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:49,500
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

2047
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,860
Well,

2048
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,029
- do you want a 1-on-1 match? - For what?

2049
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,770
For this pen shell.

2050
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,770
If you win, you'll eat two.

2051
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,469
He won't get to eat if he loses?

2052
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,169
(Interested)

2053
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,509
- I see. - Is this a casino?

2054
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,179
(Is this a shellfish casino?)

2055
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,380
Well,

2056
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,809
I'll bet 1 item. If I win, we'll eat 1 shellfish each.

2057
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,810
(He'll bet one of his items to feed the younger members.)

2058
01:13:08,811 --> 01:13:10,819
- How about it? I'll bet one item. - Okay.

2059
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,619
- What do you want to eat? - Will you win an item...

2060
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,820
- for us? - Yes.

2061
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:15,019
What do you want to eat?

2062
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,189
- Anything. - This one.

2063
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,519
- This one? - I'll take it out now.

2064
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,719
- This one. - It's getting burnt.

2065
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,889
- That one and this one? - Yes.

2066
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,171
- If I win, we'll eat one each. - Okay. That sounds nice.

2067
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,369
(Dong Hyun will bet his pen shell. If he wins, all of them will eat!)

2068
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,999
Will we play rock-paper-scissors as a team?

2069
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,076
- Shall we have a team competition? - Let's have a team competition.

2070
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,239
- Okay. - Let's have a team competition.

2071
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,340
It'll be neat.

2072
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,810
One-on-one.

2073
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,209
Hold on. Why is there so much shellfish?

2074
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:37,890
(Hold on. Why is there so much shellfish?)

2075
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:40,949
We added it.

2076
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,920
- What did you add? - I didn't do anything.

2077
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,519
- Seriously. - What do you mean?

2078
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,126
The aluminum foil tray doesn't have shellfish inside.

2079
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,019
- It doesn't? - It doesn't have shellfish inside.

2080
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,289
- Why is there so much shellfish? - Why is there so much shellfish?

2081
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,260
It's hardened cheese.

2082
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,099
It's hardened cheese. It's cheese.

2083
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,199
- It's cheese. - The pen shell on our grill...

2084
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,300
only had a tiny scallop.

2085
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,200
I should've known.

2086
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,539
They took it out.

2087
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,669
Confiscate it.

2088
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:05,739
- Why? - Bring it here.

2089
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,239
- I didn't add anything. - Bring it here.

2090
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,209
- Confiscate it. - Time out.

2091
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:12,439
Then I'll bet both of them.

2092
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,750
Our pen shell only had one tiny piece of shellfish.

2093
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,579
I've cooked it with care for 30 minutes...

2094
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,189
- in order to enjoy it. - No.

2095
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,320
- Switch it with ours. - Hold on.

2096
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,519
- It's because it looks tasty. - We can't let this happen.

2097
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,460
- Come on. I cooked it. - Switch it with ours.

2098
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,089
I put so much effort into it.

2099
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,530
It looks so tasty.

2100
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,130
This is too much.

2101
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,069
(Justice is served.)

2102
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,969
- For goodness' sake. - It has all the shellfish.

2103
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,370
- I know. It's shellfish stew. - Seriously.

2104
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,740
Would you give me a spoonful?

2105
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,440
I cooked it so well.

2106
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,810
- Bring it. - Switch it with ours. It's a no-no.

2107
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,326
- Give me a spoonful. - Let's win and bring it back.

2108
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,379
Give me a spoonful.

2109
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,650
- Let's win and bring it back. - What?

2110
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,990
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

2111
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,650
Dong Hyun will go first.

2112
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,820
- Who will go from that team? - Gosh!

2113
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,296
- Who is the first player? - They're eating all of it. Oh, no.

2114
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,660
- Who is the 1st player? - Sang Uk is the 1st player.

2115
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,599
- Sang Uk. - Hurry up, Sang Uk.

2116
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,100
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2117
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,699
- What? - Come on!

2118
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:08,999
(Sang Uk won.)

2119
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,370
- Come on! - You should've started here.

2120
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,269
How could you play a hand while eating?

2121
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,440
This is ridiculous.

2122
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,179
It's tasty because Dong Hyun added kimchi.

2123
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,639
- I made it tasty. - It's tasty.

2124
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,510
Exactly. My goodness.

2125
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:21,649
It's disappearing.

2126
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,709
- We need to hurry. - We need to hurry.

2127
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,880
Here I go.

2128
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,250
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2129
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,450
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2130
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,260
(Seung Ho takes 1 win.)

2131
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,589
- Let's go right away. - Jin.

2132
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,759
Ready...

2133
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,206
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2134
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:37,960
(Seung Ho takes 2 wins.)

2135
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,529
There you go. Okay.

2136
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,269
- I'll get ready. - Seung Ho.

2137
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,340
Rock-paper-scissors, right? Okay.

2138
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,500
- All right. - All right.

2139
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,769
Tae Hyun, let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2140
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,586
(Tae Hyun, stop eating and play rock-paper-scissors.)

2141
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,880
Tae Hyun, it looks like you're having a team dinner.

2142
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,549
Director.

2143
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,220
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2144
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,450
- Okay. - Okay.

2145
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,090
Shin Seung Ho is back.

2146
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,066
- Look at him. - Shin Seung Ho is back.

2147
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,990
(Happy)

2148
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,829
(They retrieve the cheese and shellfish stew.)

2149
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,259
I made it so well.

2150
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,660
It's practically gone.

2151
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,000
We got a good taste.

2152
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,530
They ate all of it.

2153
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:16,539
(Let's hurry up and eat.)

2154
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,400
I usually add radish kimchi.

2155
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,180
It's tasty!

2156
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:29,410
(This is it.)

2157
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,819
It's like shellfish gratin.

2158
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,449
- Right? It's like an Italian dish. - Shellfish and kimchi gratin.

2159
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,390
(It tastes like proper shellfish gratin!)

2160
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,899
Come to think of it, I haven't had grilled shellfish in a long while.

2161
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,559
- You need to go to the beach. - That's right.

2162
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,069
- It's common by the beach. - It was like that in the past.

2163
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,906
Grilled shellfish restaurants are rare in Seoul.

2164
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,069
Back in the day, you had to go...

2165
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,390
- to the West Coast. - Seriously.

2166
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,310
Thank you.

2167
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,769
How much is the total? About 200 dollars?

2168
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:56,879
My goodness.

2169
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,640
- It's pretty good. - Why? How much is it?

2170
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,109
It's about 150 dollars. It's 149 dollars.

2171
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,779
- Did you say 150 dollars? - You guys ate so much.

2172
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,140
How is the total only 150 dollars?

2173
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,849
Six of us had our fills.

2174
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,520
Not 6. It's just 3.

2175
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,089
- You ate too. - You guys ate a lot.

2176
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,990
We only ate a bit at a time.

2177
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,490
- We'll have a quiz. - Give us a quiz.

2178
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,429
(They begin making a new shellfish dish.)

2179
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,070
- Is it fully cooked? - My goodness.

2180
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,270
- Are you making a new one? - Is it fully cooked?

2181
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
I need to add it.

2182
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,339
Let it cook a bit more.

2183
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,539
You'll add it, right?

2184
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,216
- We'll have a quiz. - It's a proper dish.

2185
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,280
- Do you want the quiz now? - Yes.

2186
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,539
We need more soup.

2187
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,979
In this atmosphere?

2188
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,709
They'll keep eating anyway.

2189
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,620
May I eat a scallop?

2190
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,289
- Hold on. - He's so funny.

2191
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,720
You need to show us a specialty.

2192
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,119
- I mean... - Seriously.

2193
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,959
- Let me eat one. - Answer a question.

2194
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,089
You need to do that.

2195
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,590
(It's a big mess.)

2196
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,429
Here comes a quiz.

2197
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,799
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2198
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,469
- A scallop... - What about a scallop?

2199
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:58,599
Is unlike other types of shellfish that rarely move.

2200
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,539
It moves on its own.

2201
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,820
- A scallop is like that. - Yes.

2202
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,809
How does it move?

2203
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,570
- Which one is a scallop? - I know this one.

2204
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,349
- You do? - Yes, I do.

2205
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,450
Okay.

2206
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,280
A scallop...

2207
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,290
- A scallop moves like this. - Doesn't it do this?

2208
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,119
That's what I know as well.

2209
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,280
- A scallop moves like this. - I've seen it somewhere.

2210
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,836
- Really? - A scallop moves like this.

2211
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,330
If you think about it, there are no other ways.

2212
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,889
It isn't like it has feet.

2213
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,100
- Seriously. - It has feet.

2214
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,790
It runs around with the feet that come out when the shell opens.

2215
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,130
It runs around.

2216
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,499
I'm serious.

2217
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,599
When a bad man approaches,

2218
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,240
the shell opens and feet come out. Then it runs off.

2219
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,909
- I'm serious. - Hey.

2220
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,440
Its thigh muscles are no joke.

2221
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,209
- Legged scallops. - Legged scallops?

2222
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,649
- Legged scallops. - They have legs.

2223
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,519
This is our answer. It moves like this.

2224
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,250
I think it's correct.

2225
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,089
(Will it be correct?)

2226
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,190
Correct.

2227
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,520
I saw it somewhere.

2228
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:53,060
I saw it somewhere.

2229
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,529
Does it move forward or backward?

2230
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,660
It moves like this.

2231
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,429
- It moves like this. - Let's check out the video.

2232
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,469
- Yes. - Let's see it.

2233
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,530
It's easy.

2234
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:03,270
- Look at that. - My goodness.

2235
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,800
- I told you. It moves like this. - Is it computer graphics?

2236
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,569
- It moves like this. - Why is that?

2237
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:08,740
My goodness.

2238
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,840
It moves forward.

2239
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:11,410
Isn't it attached to a fishing line?

2240
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,150
It was an easy quiz.

2241
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,350
How fascinating.

2242
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,350
Do we need to pay again?

2243
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,520
Eat comfortably. You guys are paying.

2244
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,660
(Okay.)

2245
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,460
- Here comes a quiz. - Okay.

2246
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,199
In the 1970s, most foreigners lived in Hannam-dong.

2247
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,699
For the first time in Korea, "Blank" came to be.

2248
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,800
I know what it is.

2249
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,699
It came to be for the modernization of distribution.

2250
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,709
Then it popped up in Seoul and other big cities...

2251
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,840
and gained popularity in a short amount of time.

2252
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,980
- What goes in the blank? - I know what it is.

2253
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,110
Well...

2254
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,650
- In 1970? - Yes.

2255
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,250
- In the 1970s... - In that case...

2256
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,520
I know what it is.

2257
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,250
- Go ahead. - Let me answer.

2258
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,890
- A telephone booth. - Incorrect.

2259
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,289
A post office?

2260
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,119
A post office? Incorrect.

2261
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,289
An embassy.

2262
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:01,459
An embassy. Incorrect.

2263
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,590
McDonald's.

2264
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,459
Incorrect.

2265
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,530
Supermarket.

2266
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,500
A convenience store.

2267
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,090
A convenience store is incorrect.

2268
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,070
It's a supermarket.

2269
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,669
(Glancing over)

2270
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,309
- Hurry up and answer. - Let me answer. A supermarket.

2271
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,370
- Correct. - What?

2272
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,040
- What? - It's correct!

2273
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,309
- What? - It's correct!

2274
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,249
- What? - My goodness.

2275
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,350
What?

2276
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,849
Is it a supermarket?

2277
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:27,019
Dong Hyun is lucky.

2278
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,890
Being easily persuaded helped.

2279
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,600
- I told you that I knew everything. - That's right.

2280
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,589
Hannam Super which existed in Hannam-dong...

2281
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:38,830
was the first supermarket to open in Korea.

2282
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,420
Then it's a 1-on-1 match between me and Seung Ho.

2283
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,299
A pearl is a hard spherical mass inside the shellfish...

2284
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,840
that's made up of secretion.

2285
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,080
- It's one of the oldest gems. - I know this.

2286
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,779
In order to get on the good side of a Roman general,

2287
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:56,410
Marcus Antonius, Queen Cleopatra of Egypt...

2288
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,749
she boasted of her wealth...

2289
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,189
by taking off one of her pearl earrings...

2290
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,060
and melted it in "Blank" for drinking.

2291
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,259
What goes in the blank?

2292
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,459
Let me answer. Liquor.

2293
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,030
Liquor? Incorrect.

2294
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,499
Apparently, Emperor Qin Shi Huang drank...

2295
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,959
mercury for health.

2296
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,630
Let me answer. Mercury.

2297
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,599
He had to check.

2298
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,840
He tried the answer right away.

2299
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,409
Let me answer. Tears.

2300
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,569
Tears? Incorrect.

2301
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,009
- Sweat. - Sweat? Incorrect.

2302
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:25,079
Blood?

2303
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,080
Sweat and tears

2304
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:29,109
Incorrect.

2305
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,780
- Let me answer. Vinegar. - It must be vinegar.

2306
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,190
- It must be correct. - Is it correct?

2307
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,349
- Correct. - Yes!

2308
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,519
- I did it. - Was vinegar precious?

2309
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,520
- What? - Vinegar.

2310
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,429
Thank you for the meal, Seung Ho.

2311
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,689
Let's have some meat now.

2312
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:44,729
- That was great. - We can't lose now.

2313
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:45,799
(Seung Ho pays for DMR 1.)

2314
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,520
- Right. - Let's have some Korean beef now.

2315
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:48,929
I'm jealous.

2316
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,300
What are you jealous about?

2317
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:53,209
I want to treat these great people to a meal too.

2318
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,210
- Gosh. - Right.

2319
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:57,709
It wasn't easy for me to do that as I never got the chance.

2320
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:00,390
I'm really jealous for you to be able to get that chance, Seung Ho.

2321
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,979
I always make that chance.

2322
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,479
"Should I treat others to a meal today?"

2323
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,320
I think that as soon as I open my eyes in bed.

2324
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,149
- Really? - You think that?

2325
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:10,220
- "Should I treat others?" - It was your choice to!

2326
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:12,850
- I came with that thought in mind. - Right.

2327
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:14,889
(Receipt: Total of 149 dollars)

2328
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,529
- Thank you. That was great. - Thank you.

2329
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,459
- That was great. - That was great.

2330
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,420
- I paid with a generous heart. - That was great.

2331
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,199
Let's have some meat now.

2332
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,040
(Now, it's the Korean beef that is left!)

2333
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:32,440
(Night has come and Hannam-dong feels different.)

2334
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,130
There are a lot of great restaurants.

2335
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:42,720
- There are a lot here. - Well, it's Hannam-dong.

2336
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,159
- On our left. - It's here.

2337
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,229
(The Handsome Guys arrive at the second restaurant.)

2338
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,710
It's your favorite, aged Korean beef.

2339
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,729
It looks really fancy.

2340
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,529
(A Korean beef restaurant...)

2341
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,670
(located in Hannam-dong)

2342
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:59,070
(The age Korean beef made with an unrivaled method...)

2343
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:03,480
(is cooked over a charcoal fire with the most suitable temperature.)

2344
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,809
(It's the perfect place to treat someone to a meal...)

2345
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:07,910
(as it's neat and sophisticated.)

2346
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:12,350
(It's a place loved by big names too.)

2347
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,520
(Do you wish to end a luxurious day with your loved ones?)

2348
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,190
(DMR 2: Aged Korean beef)

2349
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,006
The ones that aren't eating will sit on this side.

2350
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,030
The ones that aren't eating will sit on this side.

2351
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,970
I think I can eat again.

2352
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,469
I feel happy.

2353
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:32,699
(Feeling happy already)

2354
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,709
I feel happy.

2355
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:35,950
I'm going to start my eating show for Korean beef today.

2356
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,010
It's cold.

2357
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:38,339
(What is this?)

2358
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:41,080
(Amazed)

2359
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,109
- What is it? - We don't get any.

2360
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,556
(The condiments are placed in a cute way.)

2361
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,019
(We don't get any.)

2362
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,390
We don't get any from the start.

2363
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,820
We don't get anything.

2364
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,129
- It makes you put on a smile. - It's cute.

2365
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,959
- This is smart. - It's a simple detail.

2366
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,729
(This place feels great from the start.)

2367
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:01,470
So this place is known for its aged Korean beef.

2368
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,070
What's the difference between...

2369
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,769
aged Korean beef and regular Korean beef?

2370
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,869
When we bring in the meat,

2371
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:10,240
we sort out the best parts again from the best-quality meat.

2372
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,839
They are then gone through a three-week process of wet aging.

2373
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,310
- For three weeks? - Right.

2374
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,479
(Wet aging: A process of aging raw meat...)

2375
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,849
(through vacuum packaging and storing it in a refrigerator...)

2376
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,219
(of 0 to 5°C for 2 to 3 weeks.)

2377
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,849
When this is done, the meat's flavor gets enhanced...

2378
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,620
- Right. - and it becomes very tender.

2379
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,689
- It can't be bad. - The taste becomes rich.

2380
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,760
Three weeks?

2381
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,990
Can we get the tenderloin, sirloin,

2382
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,199
- and special cut? - You can do that.

2383
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,300
- Okay. - And on our menu,

2384
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,329
we have the mashed potato.

2385
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,939
It's mixed with mascarpone.

2386
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,039
- Mashed potato. - It's great to have with the meat.

2387
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,509
(Interested)

2388
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,609
Please prepare the meat for us first.

2389
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,639
(Order complete)

2390
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,040
We will get it prepared right away.

2391
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,480
It's coming!

2392
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,719
(The meat finally appears.)

2393
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,080
It has been diced.

2394
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,119
- Are they each for two servings? - Yes.

2395
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,390
(Sliced into cubes)

2396
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,290
This is the thick skirt.

2397
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,090
(Impressed)

2398
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,689
This is the thick skirt?

2399
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,090
- Yes. - It looks like a xylophone.

2400
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,300
Ding!

2401
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
(A special cut in which only 500g can be obtained from each cow)

2402
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,910
(Aged thick skirt)

2403
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,780
(The best-quality tenderloin and sirloin...)

2404
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,890
(get sliced into cubes.)

2405
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:34,459
(The triple aged Korean beef set)

2406
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,529
Please pass the tenderloin first.

2407
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,529
I was going to grill the tenderloin for you.

2408
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,629
- Oh, right. - Please do.

2409
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,029
It tastes even better when it's grilled properly.

2410
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,869
(Please grill the meat nicely for us.)

2411
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,129
How much is everything until now?

2412
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,070
Just the meat itself is 458 dollars.

2413
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,610
- Sorry? - It's 458 dollars.

2414
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,209
That's just for the meat.

2415
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,540
Can we move onto the rice right away?

2416
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,849
Can we move onto the rice right away?

2417
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,970
All of these are part of it.

2418
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,840
Don't feel afraid and try some of this.

2419
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,090
The mashed potato is amazing.

2420
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,159
(The signature mashed potato)

2421
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,929
It has mascarpone and Parmesan cheese.

2422
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:13,130
(Savory mashed potato with mascarpone and Parmesan cheese)

2423
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,530
Right.

2424
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,610
It's 1,000 dollars if we get another set of the meat.

2425
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:23,069
(Nodding)

2426
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:25,039
This is really good.

2427
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,880
The potatoes were grilled...

2428
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,510
and grated on a grater.

2429
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:30,650
It's soft enough to be baby food.

2430
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:31,850
I can't stop eating this.

2431
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:34,920
And check out the cheese. This is just amazing.

2432
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,549
(Feeling bitter)

2433
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:37,560
Gosh.

2434
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,189
I'll serve you some of this.

2435
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:41,736
- Please pass your plates. - Thank you!

2436
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,829
(Getting his plate right away.)

2437
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,200
You're going to be blessed.

2438
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,730
(Please give us some too.)

2439
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:48,930
I really want to try some.

2440
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,299
- It was really fascinating. - It's so good.

2441
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,400
Thank you.

2442
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,790
- You should say, "Thank you!" - Thank you.

2443
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,670
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2444
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,940
Give it a try.

2445
01:26:57,941 --> 01:26:59,101
(Full of military discipline)

2446
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,450
(Eating)

2447
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,549
It's really soft, creamy,

2448
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,790
and totally savory.

2449
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:10,320
Tae Hyun is loving it too.

2450
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,059
(Impressed)

2451
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,620
- Should I grill it all at once? - Yes.

2452
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,360
It was seasoned perfectly.

2453
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,259
I'll start grilling the tenderloin.

2454
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,359
- Okay. - Should I grill it all at once?

2455
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,370
- Yes. - Yes.

2456
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,970
Please grill as much as you can.

2457
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,640
- It looks amazing. - This is good.

2458
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,740
- It's really good, isn't it? - Right.

2459
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,109
It looks so good as it was sliced like that.

2460
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:33,039
- It looks so pretty. - Right.

2461
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,650
- This one? - Right.

2462
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,909
It puts a smile on your face.

2463
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:39,480
(The way it looks puts a smile on your face.)

2464
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,626
You can eat the ones I put to the side right away.

2465
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:44,189
- They're good right now. - Is now the time?

2466
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:45,190
Hurry up and eat it.

2467
01:27:45,191 --> 01:27:46,989
I like it cooked thoroughly like this.

2468
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:49,029
(Let's give it a try.)

2469
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,559
(Dipping)

2470
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,570
(Yi Kyung and Seung Ho try it with some salt.)

2471
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,600
- Just like tripe. - Is it good?

2472
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,369
This is what aged beef tastes like.

2473
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,780
(Amazing taste)

2474
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,850
(His cheeks slowly go up.)

2475
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,149
This is what aged beef tastes like.

2476
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,080
(Eyes opening wide)

2477
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,589
As for me,

2478
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,719
(As for me...)

2479
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,290
I like having it with wasabi.

2480
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:19,990
Like this.

2481
01:28:19,991 --> 01:28:21,389
The chimichurri is really good too.

2482
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:22,660
Gosh, that must taste great.

2483
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,959
This is a sauce that is eaten a lot in South America.

2484
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,969
(Chimichurri: Argentina's representative sauce...)

2485
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,246
(which is an oil sauce made with crushed fresh herbs)

2486
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,699
(The scent of the herbs is charming.)

2487
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,939
- With these two together? - You can do that.

2488
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,460
- This is the best combination? - Yes.

2489
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:41,680
Did you try it?

2490
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,019
(Lost for words)

2491
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,220
Your tongue can feel its texture in every direction.

2492
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,220
It keeps spreading out in your mouth.

2493
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,030
It's really tender.

2494
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:57,930
The juice flows out from the cooked meat.

2495
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,159
The juice.

2496
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,399
(The tenderloin's juice bursts out with each chew.)

2497
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,280
You can definitely feel the flavor of the meat.

2498
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,870
(Another bite after dipping it in the mashed potato!)

2499
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:09,269
Look at this. I'm having it like this.

2500
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:11,480
- That's what I think. - Like this.

2501
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:13,210
- Right. - Give it a try.

2502
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,510
- Did you eat it like that? - Right.

2503
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,520
(Touched)

2504
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,090
I gave it some thought. Slicing the meat into cubes...

2505
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,666
makes it get cooked to the inside without burning up the meat.

2506
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:29,290
And it completely fills up your mouth.

2507
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:32,029
It really satisfies you.

2508
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:35,370
(A satisfaction that can be felt from the cube-shaped meat)

2509
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:42,310
(Eating in earnest)

2510
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:49,150
(Groaning)

2511
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:51,180
(Impressed)

2512
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,696
Let us play rock-paper-scissors for a piece.

2513
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,789
For this kind of meat, you three have to get into a fight.

2514
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,819
(You three have to get into a fight.)

2515
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,230
(Agreeing)

2516
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,960
I'll call my father right now.

2517
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,499
The person my father chooses should be able to eat it.

2518
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,629
(The person my father chooses should be able to eat it.)

2519
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:09,869
(Laughing)

2520
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,600
I wish your father knows who I am.

2521
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,910
My name is BTS and not Jin starting from today.

2522
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:16,839
- Father! - Hey.

2523
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,779
- Do you have time to talk? - Yes. I do.

2524
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:22,080
I will call out three names.

2525
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,210
Right.

2526
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:25,450
Just pick one.

2527
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,920
Okay.

2528
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:28,550
Number one.

2529
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,989
Kim Seok Jin of BTS.

2530
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,459
(Kim Seok Jin of BTS, made his debut in 2013)

2531
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,489
Number two.

2532
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:35,189
Cha Tae Hyun of "My Sassy Girl."

2533
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:36,389
(Cha Tae Hyun of "My Sassy Girl," made his debut in 1995)

2534
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,429
Number three.

2535
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:39,459
Oh Sang Uk, the gold medalist in fencing.

2536
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,529
(Fencing gold medalist, Oh Sang Uk, made his debut in 2015)

2537
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:41,729
Who is the one you wish to pick?

2538
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,440
(Who will Yi Kyung's father choose?)

2539
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:45,940
Oh Sang Uk!

2540
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,509
(I'm the one that will get the tenderloin.)

2541
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,540
Thank you.

2542
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,309
Why did you choose him?

2543
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:57,380
It's Oh Sang Uk the Handsome Guy.

2544
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:02,089
- Thank you, Father. - Thank you.

2545
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,189
(The advantage of the regular member)

2546
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:05,759
(Sighing)

2547
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,819
My goodness.

2548
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,430
Enjoy it as much as you can, Sang Uk.

2549
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:11,010
I'm going to chew on this until we leave this place.

2550
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,199
It's a different cut now.

2551
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,399
(A bite with the wasabi and chimichurri on top)

2552
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,029
- It's good, isn't it? - Of course.

2553
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,240
How is it, Sang Uk?

2554
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,939
(Eyes opening wide)

2555
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,910
What is it? How is it?

2556
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,370
It's amazing.

2557
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:25,940
This is just amazing.

2558
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,480
What is this?

2559
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,410
Gosh.

2560
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,049
It suits perfectly with this.

2561
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:33,179
(Chimichurri)

2562
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,519
- Actually... - These ones.

2563
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,089
- What is this? - The sirloin.

2564
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,090
Sirloin!

2565
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,531
(The sirloin gets cooked nicely while laughing and chatting.)

2566
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,529
I love this size.

2567
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,229
(Thank you.)

2568
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,360
Does this make sense?

2569
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:49,200
(The first bite is eaten with salt.)

2570
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,040
No way.

2571
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:58,940
(Popping in the sirloin)

2572
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:02,380
Is there a big difference between the tenderloin and the sirloin?

2573
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,250
You can feel the grains until the end with the tenderloin.

2574
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:08,850
The texture of the sirloin lasts really long.

2575
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,720
Well, it's from the same cow,

2576
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,219
but how can they taste so different?

2577
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,359
- Does the sirloin have more fat? - You can definitely feel...

2578
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,480
- more of the fat. - It has a stronger taste of meat.

2579
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,360
Do you still prefer the tenderloin?

2580
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,246
The sirloin tastes good since I'm eating it right now.

2581
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,790
Right. I can't choose between the two.

2582
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,840
- I like cuts that are fatty. - It flows around in your mouth.

2583
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,740
Should we do it again for the sirloin?

2584
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,879
Should I call my cousin?

2585
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,280
- Sure. - Gosh.

2586
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,719
- Her child... - Ask her to rank them.

2587
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,849
Just turned one.

2588
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:42,049
I'll give her a call based on that.

2589
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:43,619
- She's your cousin? - Right.

2590
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:45,260
I can't beat BTS then.

2591
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,829
This is a tough one to win.

2592
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:50,530
How old is your cousin?

2593
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,159
- She was born in 1990. - She was born in 1990?

2594
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,299
She would love BTS then.

2595
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,470
I'll give her a call.

2596
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:56,799
Right. Since she was born in 1990.

2597
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,400
(Seok Jin feels happy for some reason.)

2598
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,940
Ask who she likes.

2599
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,609
- Right. - Put me on the list too.

2600
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,369
(Seung Ho calls his cousin right away.)

2601
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,880
- Hello? - Hey.

2602
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,409
- Hey. - I'm filming...

2603
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:07,780
Handsome Guys right now.

2604
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,979
(Surprised)

2605
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:11,649
- Just choose one... - Okay.

2606
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:13,580
- out of the list. - Right.

2607
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,850
Jin of BTS.

2608
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,160
Cha Tae Hyun of "My Sassy Girl."

2609
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:23,960
Oh Sang Uk, top ranker in fencing.

2610
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,129
Choose one.

2611
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:28,400
Just one? Then I will choose...

2612
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:33,400
(Feeling expectant)

2613
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,140
I'll choose Cha Tae Hyun!

2614
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,109
(Cha Tae Hyun wins the sirloin.)

2615
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:40,650
- What? She was born in 1990. - Thank you!

2616
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:45,019
- Here's Tae Hyun. - Gosh, thank you so much.

2617
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:46,719
- I'm a big fan! - Gosh.

2618
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,550
Congratulations on your baby's first birthday.

2619
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:52,619
- Thank you! - Gosh, thank you!

2620
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,829
(Thank you for being on the phone with us.)

2621
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:57,599
(I'm jealous.)

2622
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,880
What should I dip it into again?

2623
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:01,469
It's my style to have it with salt no matter what.

2624
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,170
Right. It's great with salt.

2625
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,946
I think it'll be great for the first bite.

2626
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:06,700
I love this though.

2627
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,140
The mashed potato, Tae Hyun.

2628
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,609
I already dipped it in salt.

2629
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:12,039
You can do this, Tae Hyun. Look at this.

2630
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,109
Salt here, mashed potato here, and wasabi here.

2631
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,149
(Using all sides)

2632
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,020
This is how I eat it.

2633
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,819
This is the best for me.

2634
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,949
I don't want to be eating it like that.

2635
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:24,159
(Eating)

2636
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,419
I think salt is the best choice.

2637
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:28,159
(Tae Hyun eats it with salt.)

2638
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,460
It's really tender, isn't it?

2639
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:33,030
(Satisfied)

2640
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,169
Slicing the meat into cubes...

2641
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,840
was a smart decision.

2642
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:38,900
- Right? - Yes.

2643
01:34:38,901 --> 01:34:40,939
The meat doesn't feel overcooked.

2644
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,470
It doesn't feel that way.

2645
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,309
Should I start grilling the thick skirt?

2646
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:45,670
Before we go with the thick skirt,

2647
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,209
- we have one piece left. - Right.

2648
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:49,609
Jin should try a piece.

2649
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:51,679
I agree. I was thinking the same thing.

2650
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,049
But...

2651
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:54,519
it's only right if he dances for us.

2652
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,789
(Are you trying to get it for free?)

2653
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:59,089
There were people who were chosen to get their piece.

2654
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,119
(The 2 who were chosen)

2655
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,629
You should dance to "Dynamite" for us, at least.

2656
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,530
(Feeling very torn)

2657
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,730
- Hold on. - He's starting.

2658
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,229
- Put the chair in. - Right.

2659
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:10,269
It can be dangerous.

2660
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:12,069
(A very small space)

2661
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:14,909
(Will he be able to dance well here?)

2662
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,709
This is an honor.

2663
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:19,410
Can I take a video of this?

2664
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,609
I ate here four months ago.

2665
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:24,419
I'm not sure if I should be doing this...

2666
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:25,879
for a piece of meat.

2667
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,589
We'll give you a piece of the thick skirt too.

2668
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,589
The thick skirt too? I should do it then!

2669
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:32,060
(Then...)

2670
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,400
(The professional does his job even though it's embarrassing.)

2671
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:45,940
(He set the small stage on fire!)

2672
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,809
(Winning a piece of tenderloin and thick skirt with his dancing)

2673
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:51,680
- Gosh. - This meat is surely amazing.

2674
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,909
The tenderloin of qualification gets served to him.

2675
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:55,479
- That was the best. - This place will become...

2676
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,050
really popular.

2677
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:00,426
(The chimichurri sauce gets placed on top of the tenderloin.)

2678
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:02,789
(Eating)

2679
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:06,019
(Mesmerized)

2680
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,460
- This is worth dancing for. - Right.

2681
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:09,659
It's worth it.

2682
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,999
- This is the thick skirt. - You even get the thick skirt.

2683
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
(The thick skirt gets grilled as the last cut.)

2684
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:15,129
Does this have a lot of fat?

2685
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:16,930
- It doesn't have a lot of fat. - It doesn't?

2686
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,969
The thick skirt?

2687
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,269
(The thick skirt has a decent amount of fat...)

2688
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:21,710
(with its great flavor and texture.)

2689
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:23,840
This one is really tender.

2690
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,639
Have a piece.

2691
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,379
- Can I really have it? - We said you were going to get it.

2692
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,909
He deserves a piece even though he may not join in.

2693
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,149
- You really deserve it. - Thank you.

2694
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:32,380
Hurry up and eat it.

2695
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:37,589
(Taking a bite of the thick skirt)

2696
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,160
(Amazed)

2697
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,390
The meat is definitely cooked,

2698
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,400
but it feels really tender.

2699
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,900
It's delicious.

2700
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:47,099
(There's no need for words.)

2701
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,529
I danced, Sang Uk.

2702
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,369
- Show us your fencing moves. - Right.

2703
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:51,800
Show us with the chopsticks.

2704
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,109
The cameras have to be removed for me to do that.

2705
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:55,839
- Just do it lightly. - Right.

2706
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,039
I even danced here!

2707
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,280
I have to go that far.

2708
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:00,980
There's no room here.

2709
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,049
- Take a step outside. - Come from outside.

2710
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,350
Is this right?

2711
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,050
I'm not sure if this will work.

2712
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:08,819
Give it a try.

2713
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,789
(Oh Sang Uk, 28: Gold medal at 2020 Tokyo Summer Games...)

2714
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:12,890
(and 2024 Paris Summer Games, FIE Ranking Number 1)

2715
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,730
Start!

2716
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,569
(The fente toward the thick skirt)

2717
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,040
That was impressive, Sang Uk!

2718
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,909
He reached all the way here at once.

2719
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,709
- Right. That was impressive. - Right.

2720
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:31,156
- He reached that far at once. - Go ahead and eat it.

2721
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,839
It felt embarrassing to do it here, right?

2722
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,350
- Yes. - Same here.

2723
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,130
It was something you always did.

2724
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,419
I'll have this.

2725
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,880
(Excited)

2726
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:43,790
(The thick skirt that is as precious as fencing)

2727
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:49,360
This one tastes the best.

2728
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,250
(You can miss out on other dishes after having meat.)

2729
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:55,770
(Doenjang stew and ramyeon)

2730
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,270
My gosh.

2731
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,969
- The pot rice is here. - That's for me.

2732
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,709
This is the beef rib.

2733
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:02,710
Right.

2734
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:03,739
(The last dish to get served)

2735
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:04,740
It was grilled to perfection.

2736
01:38:04,741 --> 01:38:07,080
(Amazed)

2737
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:09,390
- What is that? - What is that?

2738
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,179
Show us the pot rice.

2739
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,250
Show it to us. Is that really pot rice?

2740
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,190
What has gone into this?

2741
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:22,590
(Truffle beef brisket mushroom pot rice)

2742
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:27,359
It has beef brisket, mushrooms, and truffle oil.

2743
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,200
(A generous amount of beef brisket, various mushrooms, and truffle oil)

2744
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:33,639
(Spicy peppers are added to the pot rice.)

2745
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,640
Check this out.

2746
01:38:34,641 --> 01:38:37,040
(It gets mixed up nicely.)

2747
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,979
(One scoop with the ladle)

2748
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:45,249
(Two scoops with the ladle)

2749
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,679
- May I have some rice? - The pot rice?

2750
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,690
- Who wants the pot rice? - Me.

2751
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,260
I wanted to eat it like this.

2752
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,659
(Placing the beef rib on top of the pot rice)

2753
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,390
That must be amazing.

2754
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,760
Gosh.

2755
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:05,470
(It's annoying as it's so good.)

2756
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,140
(Feeling dizzy)

2757
01:39:11,141 --> 01:39:12,310
The pot rice is amazing.

2758
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:18,049
The pot rice embraces the flavor of the mushrooms and truffle oil.

2759
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:19,879
The rice has all the flavors it can possibly have.

2760
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,766
(The scent of the truffle comes up from deep inside.)

2761
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,889
The pot rice is the best.

2762
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:26,360
(Pot rice lover)

2763
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,159
- The pot rice is amazing. - With the pot rice.

2764
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,659
(Praising the pot rice)

2765
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,000
Look at Dong Hyun.

2766
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:33,359
(Scraping)

2767
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,899
(He's about to dig a hole.)

2768
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,239
The pot rice with the meat on top.

2769
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,570
(Wanting more)

2770
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:45,680
(Another delicacy, Korean beef doenjang ramyeon)

2771
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,809
(He brings up the ramyeon.)

2772
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,120
(Insane looks)

2773
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:55,620
(Amazed)

2774
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:59,219
(Eyes fixed)

2775
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:02,090
(The most exciting moment right before eating)

2776
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,860
(Slurping)

2777
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:11,300
(He's eating well.)

2778
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,569
(Their joyful meal comes to an end.)

2779
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:19,780
I'm curious about how much it will cost.

2780
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,279
- May we have the bill? - Here it is.

2781
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,679
(The nerve-racking bill arrives.)

2782
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,750
Thank you.

2783
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,479
- How much is it? - Let's see.

2784
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,019
(How much will it cost?)

2785
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,889
(Aged tenderloin, aged sirloin, thick skirt, mashed potato, )

2786
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,819
(Beef rib fingers, truffle pot rice, )

2787
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,860
(doenjang stew, doenjang ramyeon, soft drinks)

2788
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,429
- Let's see. - Hey!

2789
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,859
- What is it? - Will it be a new record?

2790
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:38,860
Can I take a look?

2791
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:40,800
How is this possible?

2792
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,670
How is this possible?

2793
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,169
- It's 741 dollars. - It's 741 dollars.

2794
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:50,210
(Aged Korean beef restaurant, total of 741 dollars)

2795
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,709
- It's quite expensive. - I have to starve tomorrow...

2796
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:52,779
if I pay for this.

2797
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:53,909
It's 741 dollars?

2798
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:55,049
I'm still skipping meals.

2799
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,250
I'm always having ramyeon.

2800
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,349
Seung Ho paid 774 dollars in Yeouido.

2801
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,750
Why try to break that record?

2802
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,789
Let's try to guess it right.

2803
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,219
If we get it wrong, we'll have to fight against each other.

2804
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,119
- Let's try to get it right. - Right.

2805
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,560
- We had a great meal. - Right.

2806
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:09,290
Here's the question.

2807
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,569
Forbes Korea and the Hanwoo Association...

2808
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:16,669
This is hilarious.

2809
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:19,369
Put together a video that introduces Korean beef to the world.

2810
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,330
A video that introduces Korean beef to the world.

2811
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:25,210
In this video, when gifts are purchased for Koreans,

2812
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,880
rather than kimchi, squid,

2813
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,980
- and this, - This is too easy.

2814
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,890
Korean beef is recommended.

2815
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,189
Kimchi and squid.

2816
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,619
These three items represent Korea.

2817
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,489
Kimchi represents K-food.

2818
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:44,900
Squid from "Squid Game" represents Korean dramas.

2819
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,100
Among three presents that were proposed,

2820
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:51,539
it was the only item that wasn't food. What is it?

2821
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,740
It must be BTS merchandise.

2822
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,910
- That's what I thought too. - You're right.

2823
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:58,279
- Because it represents K-pop? - Yes, it's BTS merchandise.

2824
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,510
K-pop.

2825
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:02,980
Isn't K-pop really famous?

2826
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:05,149
- They represent K-pop. - BTS.

2827
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,019
- BTS merchandise. - BTS merchandise.

2828
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,320
Albums.

2829
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:10,520
K-pop sounds reasonable, but what gifts...

2830
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,759
- related to K-pop are there? - That's ambiguous.

2831
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,829
It's ambiguous as presents.

2832
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:17,930
It's too ambiguous to select a particular group's album.

2833
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,629
Right. There are so many groups.

2834
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:20,630
(They're thinking together.)

2835
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:22,469
To foreigners,

2836
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,299
- hanbok represents Korea. - I think it's 1 of the 2.

2837
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:27,170
Or it can be related to K-beauty.

2838
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,539
- K-beauty? - There are cosmetics.

2839
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,339
Here's what I think.

2840
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,780
Think about it.

2841
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,579
Every time foreigners come to Korea,

2842
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:37,279
- they look for cosmetics first. - That must be it.

2843
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,649
You go abroad a lot for competitions.

2844
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:42,120
What do foreigners say when you tell them your age?

2845
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:46,089
- They say, "You look so young." - Right?

2846
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:48,759
Among Asians, Koreans have particularly good skin.

2847
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,400
People often say that Koreans look young.

2848
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,960
They always ask me what cosmetic items I use.

2849
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,869
Cosmetics for K-beauty. This sounds the most...

2850
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,606
(If they guess correctly, the others must pay 740 dollars.)

2851
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:58,770
I'd go with cosmetics.

2852
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,509
- I can't think of anything else. - Dong Hyun.

2853
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:02,870
Say the answer loud and clear.

2854
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,080
- We got it. - What's the answer?

2855
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:09,310
Cosmetics that represent K-beauty.

2856
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,419
Representing K-beauty...

2857
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,719
- Cosmetics. - Cosmetics?

2858
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,120
- Yes. - Cosmetics.

2859
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,350
Cosmetics.

2860
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:21,190
(Who will pay 740 dollars?)

2861
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,759
- Cosmetics. - That is...

2862
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,930
- incorrect. - What?

2863
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,930
Tae Hyun, I'm so happy right now.

2864
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:28,500
(Screaming with joy)

2865
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:30,129
(The global star avoided the disaster.)

2866
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,770
We don't have to pay.

2867
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,069
I think the answer is BTS album.

2868
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:35,369
- I think so too. - Seriously.

2869
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:37,239
It can't be BTS album.

2870
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,256
- It must be related to K-pop. - It can't be our album.

2871
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,579
Could it be their merchandise?

2872
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,579
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

2873
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:43,780
BTS' album.

2874
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,780
- What did I tell you? - Goodness.

2875
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:47,679
- What did I tell you? - Did you know that?

2876
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,789
Of course not.

2877
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:50,749
I kept suggesting it because I didn't know.

2878
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,219
- It had to represent K-pop. - Strangely,

2879
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:55,189
- I wanted to say that. - That's right.

2880
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:57,130
- We were exactly right. - Seriously.

2881
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,799
(The actual video by Forbes Korea)

2882
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,000
(But kimchi, squid, and BTS albums are not good options.)

2883
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:10,110
(BTS' album was mentioned.)

2884
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,009
This time again, when I gave you...

2885
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:14,116
the question, Jin said the right answer within one second.

2886
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,749
I must be smarter than I think.

2887
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,209
- Yes. - You are.

2888
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,879
I'm good at guessing.

2889
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:19,950
You're the best.

2890
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:22,749
We'll start the quiz with 740 dollars at stake.

2891
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,150
Oh, no.

2892
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,289
During the Joseon dynasty,

2893
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:29,559
oxen were important assets to farming.

2894
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,259
To prevent them from decreasing in number,

2895
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,860
consumption of beef was often banned.

2896
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:37,129
Under King Taejong, there was an award...

2897
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:39,469
for reporting someone eating beef...

2898
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:41,240
during the time when it was banned.

2899
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:42,909
What was the award?

2900
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,210
It must be beef.

2901
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:45,680
Seriously?

2902
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:49,049
Beef consumption was banned.

2903
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,409
If beef was the reward...

2904
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:51,949
You can't do anything else with a dead ox.

2905
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:53,449
- So that was the award. - Hurry up.

2906
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:54,650
- Hurry up. - I got it.

2907
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,890
Beef.

2908
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:58,719
(Jin, I'm counting on you.)

2909
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,589
Beef consumption was banned.

2910
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:02,259
- Beef couldn't be the award. - Is it correct?

2911
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,659
That's incorrect.

2912
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,500
That startled me. I thought it was beef.

2913
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,799
Of course not.

2914
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,229
- If Dong Hyun had been right... - Each of you...

2915
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,629
The answer must be pork.

2916
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,039
I would have paid.

2917
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,639
- I'd have paid the total. - The answer must be pork.

2918
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,009
It's pork.

2919
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:16,209
- The answer must be pork. - I'll give it a try.

2920
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:18,210
- I'll go with pork. - Pork?

2921
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,109
Incorrect.

2922
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:22,880
All I can think of is what we just said.

2923
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,819
- The answer is money. - Money?

2924
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,149
Cash is incorrect.

2925
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:27,550
I thought of a monetary reward.

2926
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:30,449
The answer isn't a product...

2927
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:32,689
or a type of goods.

2928
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,936
(Hint: The reward wasn't a product or a type of goods.)

2929
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,290
- What award was given to him? - I got it.

2930
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:39,729
The award must be properties of the person who was reported.

2931
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:41,846
(The award must be properties of the person who was reported.)

2932
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:42,970
I got it.

2933
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:45,869
The person's properties.

2934
01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:47,969
(Answer: Properties of the one who ate beef)

2935
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:49,139
The person who ate it.

2936
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:51,309
(Answer: Properties of the one who ate beef)

2937
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,709
(It can't be right...)

2938
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:54,910
Correct.

2939
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,909
- Did I answer correctly again? - I know.

2940
01:45:57,910 --> 01:46:00,879
(He knows all the right answers.)

2941
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,449
(Yi Kyung is exempt from paying for dinner.)

2942
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:06,060
The lack of oxen could lead to damage in farming.

2943
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:08,659
Properties of the one who had beef were seized.

2944
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,460
They were given to the one who reported him.

2945
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:11,999
How many did you get right?

2946
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,400
It was impossible to know.

2947
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:17,270
It'd be intense if it happens again.

2948
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,169
- Seung Ho... - Let's go.

2949
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:22,046
- He has to split the ramyeon. - At this rate...

2950
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:23,709
At this rate...

2951
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,110
(Total that Dong Hyun paid so far: 403.5 dollars)

2952
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:29,409
Next question is the final one for the day.

2953
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,709
Give us the final question.

2954
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,450
(Starting the final quiz with 740 dollars at stake)

2955
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,989
- In the past, - It's used for oxen.

2956
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:37,489
Oxen were treated like family.

2957
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:40,360
There were straw shoes for the ox when traveling far.

2958
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,629
A blanket for the ox was made for the winter.

2959
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:44,800
The ox was raised with care.

2960
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:47,529
For the ox, what was the item in the photo...

2961
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,500
- used for? - I got it.

2962
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:52,740
(Surprised)

2963
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:54,470
Scraper.

2964
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,370
Scraper?

2965
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,840
- That's correct. - Goodness.

2966
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,339
What does it scrape?

2967
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:01,409
(Seung Ho won't pay for dinner either.)

2968
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:03,209
Is scraper the accurate term?

2969
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:04,310
The back scraper.

2970
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:06,450
Yes, your answer is right.

2971
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,649
- It also scraped the skin. - Right.

2972
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:10,720
That's right.

2973
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:12,819
(Tossing over the bill)

2974
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,119
Gosh, it's okay.

2975
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:16,059
Thank you so much. I'm sorry.

2976
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,390
It's okay.

2977
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:20,260
Dong Hyun, you've been paying a lot these days.

2978
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,999
I think I'm paying a lot.

2979
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,099
(I think I'm paying a lot.)

2980
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:24,899
I didn't pay bills that were 50 dollars.

2981
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,100
They were more like 100 to 200 dollars.

2982
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,310
The bill is high today.

2983
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:30,870
The food was great.

2984
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:33,279
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2985
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,110
- Thank you, Dong Hyun. - Thank you.

2986
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:37,250
I love you, Hannam-dong.

2987
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:40,950
Thank you for the food. I'd like to pay.

2988
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,789
Gosh, I'm so full.

2989
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:44,959
(He had a lot of food again today.)

2990
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,959
(Total: 741 dollars)

2991
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,130
I'm so full.

2992
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:50,859
All right. Thank you.

2993
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:52,399
(Thank you!)

2994
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:57,070
(What dishes await them next week?)

2995
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:58,795
(The next area for food)

2996
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:00,519
(Bloomed in the midst of sounds from steel machines)

2997
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,930
(A neighborhood with a nice vibe)

2998
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:07,030
(Where the past and art coexist)

2999
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,330
(Mullae Is Full of Charms)

3000
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,470
(What's the number 1 tasty restaurant hidden between alleys?)

3001
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,539
(An abundance of tasty restaurants)

3002
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:17,070
(The new world of taste opens up.)

3003
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,739
(Handsome Guys in trouble?)

3004
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,940
The rumors have spread.

3005
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,449
(A show that takes away money from guests)

3006
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:23,750
That's why this week...

3007
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,619
(A notice of in-house dispute on Handsome Guys)

3008
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,590
(A special rule is added to spice up the fight.)

3009
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:31,119
(After ordering as much as they want)

3010
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:34,489
(They get to eat in the order of answering.)

3011
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:38,460
(For the first time on Handsome Guys, someone will starve.)

3012
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,399
(Getting very competitive)

3013
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,070
Seung Ho is ready to fight.

3014
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:44,970
I got it. The one with the short tongue is...

3015
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:47,100
Kim Dong Hyun.

3016
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,310
Seriously?

3017
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:52,040
Isn't it "The short tongue goes a long way?"

3018
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,239
Goodness.

3019
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,639
(That can't exist.)

3020
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,810
Name celebrities' names with four syllables.

3021
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:58,250
Kim Nabaki.

3022
01:48:58,780 --> 01:48:59,920
Eulji Mundeok.

3023
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,349
(A party of wrong answers)

3024
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:04,290
(From shocked staff members...)

3025
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,559
(to the youngest who's getting violent)

3026
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:10,160
(Who will be the last person to starve?)
