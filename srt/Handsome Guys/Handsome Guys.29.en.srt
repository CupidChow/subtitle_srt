1
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:30,486
(During the summer, is it soybean noodles...)

2
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:32,157
(or young radish naengmyeon?)

3
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,886
(Charcoal-grilled meat...)

4
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:35,256
(or meat grilled over briquet?)

5
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,527
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:39,764
Sang Uk is eating well.

7
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,266
(Exultation...)

8
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,497
(and regret)

9
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,096
(Anguish and resolution)

10
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:49,306
(The time of abundance)

11
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,377
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

12
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:53,937
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

13
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:55,677
I'll show you what it means to eat well.

14
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:56,906
I have an infinite number of ways.

15
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:03,017
(It starts again today.)

16
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:05,017
(Yongsan-gu)

17
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,156
(The familiar sound of the train...)

18
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,886
(fills the streets in the neighborhood.)

19
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,657
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,366
- Goodness.
- Where are we?

21
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,396
Goodness.

22
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:16,966
- Are we starting right away?
- Is this the terrace?

23
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,366
- You got a haircut.
- Yes.

24
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,437
You cut your hair.

25
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:20,706
You look neat.

26
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:21,707
You cut your hair short.

27
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,707
You look younger than before.

28
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,477
- You got a haircut.
- Yes, I did.

29
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:25,876
- Why are you wearing makeup today?
- I am wearing makeup.

30
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,877
Why?

31
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,976
- Why are you wearing makeup?
- Why?

32
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:29,146
(Yes, he's wearing makeup.)

33
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:32,177
When I watched the show with Jin as our guest,

34
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:34,047
I was the only one who looked like a middle-aged man.

35
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,316
I thought, "I can't continue like this."

36
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:37,616
Sang Uk, who is another athlete,

37
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,716
looks as handsome as an actor.

38
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,387
That's why I went to a hair salon this morning.

39
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,156
Up until now, I haven't noticed...

40
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,697
- much of a difference.
- I don't look very different?

41
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,596
It's hard to tell on TV.

42
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,597
(Upset)

43
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:49,666
You should've brought Sang Uk with you if you arrived early.

44
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,296
- Sang Uk?
- Why didn't you bring him with you?

45
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,696
Sang Uk participates in so many competitions.

46
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,036
Is he coming as soon as he can? I have no idea.

47
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,406
He's flying as we speak.

48
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,607
- Right.
- Yes.

49
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:01,577
Is it just the four of us today?

50
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,377
- Isn't someone else coming?
- Wait a minute.

51
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:04,876
- Hello.
- My goodness.

52
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,047
- You startled me.
- Oh, my.

53
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:09,986
(The guest is half forced to appear.)

54
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,016
- What on earth...
- Hello.

55
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,516
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,986
- Kang Hoon and Ju Hyun.
- Hello.

57
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,727
- Hello.
- Boxer Ju Hyun.

58
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,626
How do we have two guests today?

59
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:19,296
Right, it's our 1st time having 2 guests.

60
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,427
What brings you here? Just tell us honestly.

61
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,467
- We're from "Hunter..." - "With a Scalpel."

62
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:25,996
What does that mean?

63
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,266
Is that the name of a group?

64
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,237
We came to promote a drama.

65
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:34,676
(Tae Yeon)

66
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,547
(What do you think of a younger man?)

67
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:40,786
(The irresistible charming man who has been the talk of the town)

68
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,347
(The puppy-like younger man, Kang Hoon)

69
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:46,257
(The youngest on "Iron Girls")

70
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:50,897
(As Director Dong Hyun's favorite pupil)

71
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,867
(Park Ju Hyun will return on "Iron Girls 2.")

72
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:59,236
(The two of them met on "Hunter with a Scalpel.")

73
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,467
(Aired on June 16)

74
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:09,346
(Park Ju Hyun as Seo Se Hyun, the brilliant forensic pathologist)

75
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,606
(Police)

76
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,146
(Kang Hoon transformed into Jung Jung Hyun, )

77
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:18,787
(the chief of the violent crimes unit.)

78
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,587
- Hoon, you must be the hunter.
- Right.

79
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,586
I'm the one who holds the scalpel.

80
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,997
I play a police officer.

81
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,556
- A police officer?
- We investigate together.

82
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:27,667
A police officer?

83
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,596
You know the kind and gentle police officer, right?

84
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:30,937
(Gentle)

85
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:33,566
- Exactly.
- Your appearance is...

86
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,767
- You're right.
- very...

87
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,267
- A person's image is...
- Your image is...

88
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,136
hard to get rid of.

89
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,436
This is our first time.

90
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,846
- You came on the show...
- To promote.

91
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,306
- to promote your work.
- Really?

92
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,546
Also, we have a female guest...

93
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:45,816
- for the first time today.
- You're right.

94
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:46,817
- Seriously?
- Right.

95
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,817
A lot of people hesitate to come on our show.

96
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,387
We keep telling them to bring their own card.

97
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,856
- Right.
- I brought mine for now.

98
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,556
- Did you bring yours, Hoon?
- I did,

99
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:55,557
but will I have to use it?

100
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:57,796
- Were you informed of that rule?
- Yes.

101
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,357
You won't have to use it.

102
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,426
- We never had two guests at once.
- I'm with my director.

103
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:02,726
- Me?
- That's right.

104
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,837
You worked together on "Iron Girls."

105
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,196
As my boxing coach,

106
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:07,197
- Right.
- will you make me pay?

107
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:08,666
That's right.

108
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,306
- Are you still working together?
- Yes.

109
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,776
- For "Iron Girls 2?" - We're getting prepared.

110
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,476
Oh, that's right.

111
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,246
It can't be helped because of your relationship.

112
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,477
We know each other,

113
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:18,346
and you're his big senior in acting.

114
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:19,476
We have our relationship too.

115
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,616
- We were on a variety show.
- We know each other,

116
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,587
but I'm not close enough to him to pay for him.

117
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:24,887
Not close enough to pay for him?

118
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:26,886
I don't have to treat him.

119
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:28,556
- We're not that close.
- Really?

120
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,127
Yi Kyung and I worked together...

121
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,197
for my acting debut.

122
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,556
- In that case...
- Her debut on TV...

123
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,926
- For the year of my debut.
- She won't have to pay anything.

124
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,766
- She won't.
- For her debut on TV.

125
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,767
I should put my card back.

126
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,596
Seung Ho, you're standing there awkwardly.

127
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,796
Is it your first time meeting them?

128
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,537
I met them only through the media.

129
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:44,937
"Media?"

130
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,476
It's my first time meeting them.

131
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:49,407
No, we worked together in the past.

132
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:52,116
On "At Eighteen," I appeared in a cameo...

133
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,847
- as your older brother.
- That's right.

134
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,616
(Prey...)

135
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,717
(detected)

136
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,656
(Seizing the moment to bombard him with criticism)

137
00:04:58,657 --> 00:04:59,716
- Oh, my goodness.
- He made a mistake.

138
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:00,756
- That's so disappointing.
- He made a mistake.

139
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:01,886
Oh, my goodness.

140
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,327
- Hey.
- Let me explain.

141
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,026
(Seung Ho and Hoon 6 years ago)

142
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,157
(You know what?)

143
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,337
(You know what, Seung Ho?)

144
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,466
(Later, you'll forget about him.)

145
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,636
- He played my older brother.
- That's right.

146
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,766
- He played my older brother.
- Your older brother?

147
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,006
- No.
- And you never met him before?

148
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,176
He played my older brother.

149
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,376
He played my older brother.

150
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:21,646
(And you never met him before?)

151
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,207
- He wasn't just a close friend.
- He played my older brother.

152
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:25,116
In the drama,

153
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,217
- Hoon was at a mental hospital.
- Right.

154
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,686
I only saw him once.

155
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,017
- He's talking way too much.
- I think...

156
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,257
I'm quite talkative.

157
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,486
(I see.)

158
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,426
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

159
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:35,756
- That's nice and clean.
- It's okay.

160
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,086
(He ends it neatly with an apology.)

161
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,957
- You should definitely apologize.
- That's nice and clean.

162
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,326
Is it really your first time meeting Ju Hyun?

163
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,227
- It's really our first time.
- Right.

164
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,666
- Is it really?
- That's good.

165
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,566
Hoon, how old are you this year?

166
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,836
I was born in 1991.

167
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:48,666
He's older than I imagined.

168
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,067
How about you, Seung Ho?

169
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,777
- I was born in 1995.
- Yes, he's our youngest member.

170
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:55,247
- What about you, Ju Hyun?
- I was born in 1994.

171
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,646
- Is Seung Ho younger than her?
- She's older than him.

172
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,517
- That's awkward.
- You're older than me.

173
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:01,987
- She's older.
- Really?

174
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,817
Ju Hyun, did you think that Seung Ho was older than you?

175
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,057
Yes.

176
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,556
I thought that he was older than Hoon.

177
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:10,586
- Goodness.
- Older than him?

178
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,056
But he called him as someone older than him.

179
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:14,127
- I just look older for my age.
- Right?

180
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,396
- I was definitely born in 1995.
- She's older than you.

181
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,397
Ju Hyun...

182
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:19,366
- How should he call you?
- He should call me...

183
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,837
I should call her with respect.

184
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,166
You can call me however you want.

185
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,466
- But...
- Ms. Ju Hyun?

186
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,206
Doesn't "Ms. Ju Hyun" sound strange?

187
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,906
- Just call me...
- As someone younger...

188
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,247
- "Ju Hyun." - Call her "Ju Hyun."

189
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,007
- I'll call you "Ju Hyun." - "Ju Hyun."

190
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,016
- All right.
- Then what will you call him?

191
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,017
Seung Ho.

192
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:34,847
- That sounds good.
- "Seung Ho."

193
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:35,887
- Okay, Seung Ho.
- The names have been decided.

194
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,417
Your hairstyle today makes you look older.

195
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:39,717
No.

196
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,226
- His hairstyle has been the same.
- It's been the same...

197
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:42,656
- throughout the show.
- Has it always been like this?

198
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,326
- Yes.
- It's been the same.

199
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,397
I'd also like to cut my hair, but...

200
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:47,966
Is this his original hairstyle?

201
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,727
I'm worried about Seung Ho today.

202
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,136
(It looks like he met his match today.)

203
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,667
Today, we're in Namyeong-dong.

204
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,066
Namyeong Station Subway Line 1. Seoul Station Subway Line 1 and 4.

205
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,376
Sookmyung Women's University Station and Sinyongsan Station.

206
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,407
It's where Subway Line 1 and 4 intersect.

207
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,006
There's even a railway.

208
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,877
It's an old transportation hub.

209
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:07,846
(During the period of the Korean Empire, )

210
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,347
(the Gyeongbu railway line was built.)

211
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:15,986
(An old town with over 100 years of history was created next to it.)

212
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,356
(Namyeong-dong Food Street)

213
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,956
There are surprisingly many hidden yet popular restaurants.

214
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,327
It's rising as one of the hottest places.

215
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,097
(In Namyeong-dong, a unique hot place)

216
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:30,107
(Meet unforgettable food!)

217
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,806
Hoon, do you usually like to eat?

218
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,836
I like to eat.

219
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,176
My eating habit changed because of work.

220
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,306
I used to eat a lot...

221
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,877
- while working out.
- Right.

222
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,146
Ju Hyun, do you eat a lot?

223
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,616
You probably have to control your weight.

224
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,087
- She eats well.
- I do.

225
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,216
Ju Hyun eats well.

226
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:44,286
- You must know her well.
- Yes.

227
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,787
When we eat at a restaurant,

228
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:47,986
she eats as much as four athletes.

229
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:50,227
- These days...
- I eat very well.

230
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,897
Today's lunch menu is...

231
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,596
either cheonggukjang...

232
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:56,596
or Vietnamese pho.

233
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,197
(Cheonggukjang versus Vietnamese pho)

234
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:04,937
(Light and savory)

235
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,307
(Korean's comfort food, cheonggukjang)

236
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,676
(Awakening the taste buds)

237
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:14,647
(The charm of unusual spices)

238
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:19,416
(The taste of local Vietnamese food, pho)

239
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,056
(Today's LMR)

240
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:25,196
(Cheonggukjang versus pho)

241
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,626
- I like both.
- I also like both.

242
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:30,327
Please make your choice.

243
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,037
I'd like to eat both.

244
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,197
That would be nice.

245
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,007
That would be nice,

246
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,437
but you have to choose between two restaurants.

247
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,037
- You can't eat both. Pick only one.
- Choose only one.

248
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:40,837
Ju Hyun.

249
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,707
Just do it like Seung Ho.

250
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,416
- It's possible, Ju Hyun.
- Right.

251
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,916
- You can do it.
- Seung Ho will help you out.

252
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,046
- Seung Ho.
- See?

253
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:49,287
You can eat four meals.

254
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,556
You should eat all four meals today with Ju Hyun.

255
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:53,986
You also can.

256
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,527
You can also eat it.

257
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:56,787
"You also can."

258
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,056
(On the other hand)

259
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:01,326
Is there something you can't eat?

260
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:02,696
- I can't eat cheonggukjang.
- You don't have to.

261
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,297
- You can eat Vietnamese pho.
- Okay.

262
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:07,237
Please make your choice.

263
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,767
I don't think Hoon likes to eat cheonggukjang.

264
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,206
- I pick Vietnamese food.
- Okay.

265
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,906
- Have you had pho before?
- Yes.

266
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,107
I've had it often.

267
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,316
- Have you tried it?
- Of course.

268
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,176
- I'm craving for some noodles.
- Right.

269
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:21,416
Actually, it's simple.

270
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,046
- Noodles.
- Pick what you're craving now.

271
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,916
Simply, my choice is Vietnamese food.

272
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,256
I like pho.

273
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:27,656
Go ahead and get pho.

274
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,156
Go ahead. Feel free to get pho.

275
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:31,996
Dong Hyun has been thinking very seriously about it.

276
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:33,756
- I'm still thinking about it.
- Have you decided?

277
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,466
There seems to be depth...

278
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,266
to cheonggukjang in this neighborhood.

279
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,567
I'm leaning towards cheonggukjang.

280
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,136
- Cheonggukjang?
- I'm leaning towards it.

281
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:44,976
I started being on a diet recently,

282
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,306
so I'll go for Vietnamese food.

283
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:47,336
To be clear-cut?

284
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,077
- I'll pick Vietnamese food.
- To be clear-cut?

285
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,316
Four people chose Vietnamese food.

286
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,276
I also picked Vietnamese food. You're the only one.

287
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:54,346
Am I eating cheonggukjang alone?

288
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:55,916
- All right.
- Four actors...

289
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,156
- I mean, five actors will eat...
- Seriously?

290
00:09:58,157 --> 00:09:59,756
Pho, and you'll be eating alone?

291
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:00,786
- That's fine.
- Are you okay with that?

292
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:01,826
I don't mind.

293
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,026
- You really don't mind?
- No.

294
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,156
I'll join you if you feel lonely.

295
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:05,757
Why would I feel lonely?

296
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,127
What's wrong with eating alone?

297
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,126
- Are you upset?
- I'll eat alone...

298
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,697
"Are you upset?"

299
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:13,766
You'll stay with me while I eat, right?

300
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,836
- Of course.
- Right?

301
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,276
It's okay as long as you picked pho...

302
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:19,376
because you really wanted it.

303
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,776
As long as it wasn't because you didn't want to eat with me.

304
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:22,947
That's not why, right?

305
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,816
Does Dong Hyun have terrible table manners?

306
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:25,846
No.

307
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,746
He just likes mixing food.

308
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,217
(He always asks when he has questions.)

309
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:31,317
He will be the first lonely one...

310
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,086
to eat alone on the show.

311
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,126
- He'll eat cheonggukjang.
- If you want, I can change my mind.

312
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,996
I don't mind eating either one.

313
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:40,696
- Me neither.
- Me neither, as your pupil.

314
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,666
- It doesn't matter to me either.
- It doesn't?

315
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,866
- Yes, it does.
- Right.

316
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,296
Which one you eat matters to you.

317
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:47,197
- Right.
- We can't decide on the range.

318
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:49,266
Between cheonggukjang and pho,

319
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,066
which dish will we eat first?

320
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,137
(Which dish will they eat first?)

321
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:55,246
It'd be the worst for us if it's cheonggukjang.

322
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:57,206
I have a feeling that we'll get cheonggukjang first.

323
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:58,616
- Right?
- He'd have so much fun...

324
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,346
teasing the five of us.

325
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:02,316
(The first meal is...)

326
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,647
You will get pho first.

327
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,256
(Sorrow and joy)

328
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,816
(Sorrow)

329
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,386
(Team Pho is celebrating already.)

330
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:10,156
- That's amazing.
- It's the worst for him.

331
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,126
I thought that we were getting cheonggukjang first.

332
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,497
I feel so bad for him.

333
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,226
(He didn't expect today's tragedy to start so soon.)

334
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:19,136
- This is problematic.
- I feel so bad for him.

335
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,506
For our lunch in Namyeong-dong, let's get pho first.

336
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:22,566
- Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,707
Let's go.

338
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:31,047
(Will Dong Hyun be okay with eating alone?)

339
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:34,046
We can just walk there leisurely.

340
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,316
(Namyeong-dong, a small neighborhood at the foot of Mount Nam)

341
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,446
It's nice.

342
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,757
It has a great vibe.

343
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,286
I like that there aren't tall buildings.

344
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,587
(An alley where the old Seoul and modern Seoul coexist)

345
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:45,826
(They follow along the US military base fence.)

346
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:47,496
- Let me briefly explain.
- Sure.

347
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:48,666
Hasn't it been a while...

348
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,396
since you've seen a house with roof tiles on the left?

349
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,597
Yes.

350
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,266
What is it? Is it a restaurant?

351
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,366
That was built...

352
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,166
during the Japanese colonial period.

353
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,076
- Do you mean this?
- Yes, Tae Hyun.

354
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:00,207
I mean, all these buildings. On the other side is...

355
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,846
- the former US military base.
- Yes.

356
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,277
There's also an embassy.

357
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:06,077
Development was prohibited in this area.

358
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,116
That's why it hasn't changed much.

359
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,317
(Regaining vibrancy after the relocation of the US base)

360
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,517
- I see.
- Really?

361
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,116
I'm doomed.

362
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,226
I wanted to eat cheonggukjang alone first...

363
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,257
and make fun of you while giving off the smell.

364
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,227
It didn't work out the way I wanted.

365
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,026
This place must be...

366
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,596
- full of popular restaurants.
- It has many popular restaurants.

367
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:23,696
There must be so many...

368
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,537
- popular restaurants.
- By the way...

369
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:26,937
Where's the pho restaurant?

370
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,537
Where's pho?

371
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,207
Goodness, look over here.

372
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,576
- This is the place.
- This is it.

373
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:33,707
This is it.

374
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,046
- Goodness.
- I love signboards like this.

375
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,176
Seriously.

376
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,347
It looks pretty.

377
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:39,946
Did they make the signboard like this,

378
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,277
or is it just old?

379
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,417
It looks like an old restaurant.

380
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,457
(The rich aroma of meat broth that stimulates the nostrils)

381
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:54,827
(And exotic vibes that are present everywhere)

382
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,466
(You can enjoy it from early morning.)

383
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:02,367
(A variety of Vietnamese dishes)

384
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,437
(For those who want a hearty meal)

385
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,046
- The smell.
- The smell.

386
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,717
- The smell.
- It smells so good.

387
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,987
Do you smell the rich meat broth?

388
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,057
It smells like Vietnam.

389
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,986
The advantage of eating with a group of five is...

390
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,056
that we can order as much as we want.

391
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:23,256
- Right.
- We can order various dishes.

392
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:25,497
Even if we're a group of two, we order as much as we want.

393
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,197
This will be more plentiful.

394
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:28,697
We can feel freer to order as much as we want.

395
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,166
Excuse me, sir.

396
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,366
(They call the chef to make the order.)

397
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,666
Sir?

398
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,836
- Sir?
- Yes.

399
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:34,837
Gosh.

400
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,806
- He was hiding.
- He was hiding.

401
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:37,906
Hello.

402
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:39,877
- Thank you.
- You look younger than I expected.

403
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,177
Thank you.

404
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,846
Did you learn how to cook in Vietnam?

405
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,276
I started cooking in Australia 15 years ago.

406
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:49,147
I made Asian food there for a long time.

407
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,446
After returning to Korea,

408
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,487
I visited Vietnam and Thailand many times.

409
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:55,556
What do these Chinese characters mean?

410
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,386
It's "munhyanghama."

411
00:13:57,387 --> 00:14:00,496
It means getting off a running horse...

412
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:03,967
after smelling something irresistibly delicious.

413
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,396
- It's a Chinese idiom...
- Yes.

414
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,067
That calls for customers.

415
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,507
Ever since we arrived here...

416
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,906
Is it the smell of seolleongtang?

417
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,576
It doesn't smell like Vietnamese pho.

418
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,077
- It smells like ox bone broth.
- Right.

419
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,146
My favorite restaurant in Hanoi is a very old restaurant.

420
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:23,086
I thought about why their food was so delicious.

421
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:24,186
After eating there a few times,

422
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,717
I realized that it was about serving...

423
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,886
fresh broth made with local ingredients.

424
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,126
However,

425
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,796
to imitate flavors from abroad, pho restaurants in Korea use...

426
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,367
imported ingredients.

427
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,667
Then I thought,

428
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,396
"The best pho is made..."

429
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,066
"with local ingredients."

430
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,467
That's why I use Korean beef.

431
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,866
That's why?

432
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,976
That's why it looks similar to seolleongtang.

433
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,437
You're so eloquent with words.

434
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,446
Based on his words, there's depth to his cooking.

435
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,876
I can also feel a sense of confidence.

436
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,017
Make the order.

437
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,246
We'll start with...

438
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,146
four pho with Korean beef.

439
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,256
- Four pho with Korean beef?
- Yes.

440
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:00,056
There are five of us.

441
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,726
- For 2 or 3...
- There's something...

442
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,186
that my customers get addicted to.

443
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:05,397
It's spicy pho.

444
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:06,597
I see.

445
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:08,027
That sounds delicious.

446
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,096
Okay. Two pho with Korean beef.

447
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,766
Two spicy pho.

448
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,596
I'm curious about this rice with sauce.

449
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:14,866
- Mixed rice with sauce.
- For me,

450
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,936
this recipe has a soul.

451
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:17,937
(The recipe for mixed rice with sauce has a soul.)

452
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,506
You have so many dishes like that.

453
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:20,576
His words are...

454
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,176
- You've been saying the same.
- Here's why.

455
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:23,876
When I started to learn how to cook in Australia,

456
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,546
I assisted a cook with making dumplings.

457
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,017
On the first floor of Sydney Tower.

458
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:30,816
The one who made dumplings was a Chinese lady.

459
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,816
She had run a noodle restaurant...

460
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:35,456
somewhere in China a long time ago with her husband.

461
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:38,596
She taught me her recipe as a stamp of approval.

462
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,327
I continue to follow her recipe even to this day.

463
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,926
This is...

464
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,927
- It's a true story.
- Each dish on the menu...

465
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,736
He's so good at explaining his dishes.

466
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,266
- Why don't you sit down?
- It may sound like a setup, but...

467
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,367
Two orders of mixed rice with sauce.

468
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,376
How are your fried spring rolls?

469
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:54,207
My fried spring rolls are very delicious because...

470
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,076
My fried spring rolls are different.

471
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:58,417
Please bring a chair and sit down with us.

472
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,477
- What about your spring rolls?
- When you try them,

473
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:03,017
you'll experience a texture that you never tried before.

474
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,617
It's because the wrapper is different.

475
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:07,056
- I see.
- Really?

476
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:08,656
Isn't Vietnamese iced coffee famous?

477
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,087
You must drink it no matter what.

478
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:11,796
(We can't take this anymore.)

479
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:13,426
- This is very famous.
- It's really famous.

480
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,996
We might order everything on the menu at this rate.

481
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:17,697
- It's very famous.
- I'm not trying to sell it.

482
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,666
- He's not trying to sell it.
- He's not trying to sell it.

483
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,736
Then why should we drink it?

484
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:24,106
It symbolizes the combined Vietnamese and French...

485
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,976
culinary cultures. It's historic.

486
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:27,576
That's the best fusion drink.

487
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:28,747
(He just finds it fascinating now.)

488
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,446
Wait a minute.

489
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,246
- Hey, friend.
- Yes?

490
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,176
Why didn't you order cold bun cha?

491
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:35,487
- I haven't finished ordering.
- I see.

492
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,787
He's still making the order.

493
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,017
I'll wait.

494
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,787
- And one bun cha.
- We'd like two orders of bun cha.

495
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,027
Two? Okay.

496
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,726
Two pho with Korean beef. Two spicy pho.

497
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,656
One seolleongtang, two cold bun cha,

498
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,166
one French carrot salad, two rice with sauce,

499
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,126
one salad, and six pieces of handmade fried spring rolls.

500
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:52,437
That's exactly correct.

501
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:53,997
You ordered too much.

502
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:55,606
What's salted vegetables?

503
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,636
(It's not over yet.)

504
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:58,676
Forget it.

505
00:16:58,677 --> 00:16:59,837
Don't even ask him.

506
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:02,777
(Hoon should stop too.)

507
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,077
Here's your French carrot salad.

508
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:06,016
- Is this French carrot salad?
- Yes.

509
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,946
- So this is it.
- "French carrot salad?"

510
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,117
Is this the carrot dish?

511
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,186
I was craving some carrots.

512
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,317
It looks like jjolmyeon.

513
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:16,957
(Glancing)

514
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,426
Go ahead and eat.

515
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,397
(Everyone stares at him like meerkat for his first bite.)

516
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:24,097
- Why are you being so cautious?
- Don't be so cautious.

517
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:26,067
It's good.

518
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:27,936
How dare you eat when your seniors haven't started?

519
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:29,606
- It's not polite.
- Seriously.

520
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:30,766
(Walking on eggshells)

521
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,676
I haven't swallowed it yet.

522
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,937
(I haven't swallowed it yet.)

523
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,076
- Are you holding it in your mouth?
- I'm holding it.

524
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,446
I haven't even swallowed the sauce.

525
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,976
- Not even the sauce?
- Thank you for the food.

526
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:40,977
(That was a proper response.)

527
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:42,817
Shall we drink, Tae Hyun?

528
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,946
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

529
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,487
Nice to meet you.

530
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,557
(Thank you for the food.)

531
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:55,427
(Enjoy your food.)

532
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:57,797
My plans got ruined.

533
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,666
I wanted to make fun of you while eating first.

534
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,397
Has anything ever happened according to your plan on the show?

535
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:04,513
You wouldn't have any appetite because you'll be full.

536
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,123
- Your food is here.
- There it is.

537
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:07,454
(It starts to unfold in front of Dong Hyun with mixed feelings.)

538
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,494
- It's with extra meat and toppings.
- That's for him.

539
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,793
Look at the meat.

540
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:14,424
- The broth looks different.
- You're right.

541
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,134
- It looks like seolleongtang.
- I need to try this.

542
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,603
- The color is different.
- It's milky white.

543
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:21,974
The broth is very clear.

544
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,943
(On top of Vietnamese noodles)

545
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:29,073
(With a lot of Korean beef garnish)

546
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,143
The base is clear seolleongtang broth.

547
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,984
It looks similar to seolleongtang.

548
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,713
- Look how clear the broth is.
- This is amazing.

549
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:38,054
(Pho with Korean beef)

550
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,383
The base is clear seolleongtang broth.

551
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,623
It looks similar to seolleongtang.

552
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,354
It looks like seolleongtang,

553
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:48,263
but the vegetables inside have the Vietnamese smell.

554
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:49,934
That's basil.

555
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,293
It's not western basil.

556
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,264
It's Thai basil that's found in Southeast Asia.

557
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,103
Shall we try it?

558
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,173
- Let's eat.
- Let's try it.

559
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,304
(They finally start a proper meal.)

560
00:18:57,634 --> 00:19:00,643
(Taking a sip of the broth that he was curious about)

561
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:01,674
What?

562
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,144
- How should I describe this?
- How is it?

563
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,314
- It's pho, but...
- It's definitely pho,

564
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,454
- How is it?
- but it's much easier to eat it.

565
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,524
It tastes like pho with a familiar taste.

566
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,623
It doesn't taste strong at all.

567
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,764
After trying the broth once,

568
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,563
mix the dish with your chopsticks.

569
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:21,993
There are vegetables and herbs.

570
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,163
You have to mix them.

571
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:24,963
Mix everything before eating it.

572
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,133
The portion is generous.

573
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,403
He told us to try it like this.

574
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:28,404
Look at the noodles.

575
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,603
These noodles are also authentic.

576
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,743
Sir, aren't these noodles from Vietnam?

577
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:33,843
- Sir?
- Yes?

578
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,143
- Did you bring them from Vietnam?
- Stop harassing him.

579
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,573
Aren't these authentic from Hawaii?

580
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,083
- It's the authentic taste.
- Hawaii.

581
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,643
- "Hawaii?" - No, wait.

582
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,983
- He meant, Hanoi.
- I'm sorry.

583
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,114
"Hawaii?"

584
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,224
(How does the authentic pho from Hanoi taste with herbs?)

585
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:50,454
I never tried it in Hanoi.

586
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:56,363
It has a lot of meat.

587
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,594
- You know what?
- It's so delicious.

588
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:01,134
- Dong Hyun, it tastes excellent.
- It looks delicious.

589
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,274
I feel like we're in Vietnam.

590
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,304
Eating this makes me feel like I'm in Vietnam.

591
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:08,103
It has a lot of meat.

592
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:09,243
(Plentiful meat topping that makes your mouth water)

593
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:10,843
I'd love some with the meat.

594
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,214
Goodness.

595
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,923
(Everyone is eating from all directions.)

596
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,024
It looks so good.

597
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:27,094
(Swirling)

598
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,763
Is that how you eat it, Ju Hyun?

599
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:31,263
- It's delicious this way.
- Is it teriyaki sauce?

600
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,604
- It's called hoisin sauce.
- "Hoisin?"

601
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,103
(Adding more flavors)

602
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,503
Ju Hyun is eating so well.

603
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,904
She keeps eating it after drizzling the sauce.

604
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,514
I smell something delicious.

605
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:51,313
I can smell something very delicious in the back.

606
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:52,354
This is amazing.

607
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:56,323
(In awe)

608
00:20:56,324 --> 00:20:57,853
(Exclaiming)

609
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,164
- When I was a child...
- Why are you being so loud?

610
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:03,064
I'm being loud because I'm not eating.

611
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,104
Look at this.

612
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,903
- Isn't that bun cha?
- It's bun cha in the back.

613
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:09,074
(It's bun cha, not a pie in the sky.)

614
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,804
(Quietly)

615
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,473
Don't touch it.

616
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,604
(Don't touch it.)

617
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:17,473
(Iron Ju Hyun stops Dong Hyun.)

618
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:18,884
She told him not to touch it.

619
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,383
(Moaning)

620
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,484
It smells like delicious fried food.

621
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:27,224
He said that it had a texture that we never tried before.

622
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:29,654
I always feel like I make the wrong choice.

623
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,994
It's okay. We all learn from our mistakes.

624
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:34,963
- Here's your fried spring rolls.
- Fried spring rolls.

625
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,633
(Fried spring rolls with a texture that they never experienced)

626
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,864
This looks amazing.

627
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,004
It looks really delicious.

628
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:43,203
As you know, you need to grab the fried spring roll...

629
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,003
and dip it in the fish sauce.

630
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,273
(Dip it in a lot of fish sauce...)

631
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:49,014
(and munch on it.)

632
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:51,574
If you're curious about the taste...

633
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,213
Is it a texture that you never tried before?

634
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,284
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

635
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:57,214
Gosh, there's shrimp.

636
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:59,454
It's much thinner than regular fried spring rolls.

637
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,354
The outside is crunchy.

638
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:06,494
(Falling in love with fried spring rolls)

639
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,094
This is delicious.

640
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:10,863
The fried spring rolls look so good.

641
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,704
(Everyone is highly praising the fried spring rolls.)

642
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,944
- The fried spring roll is good.
- Isn't it?

643
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:22,113
Shouldn't we do something? The food is almost gone.

644
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,914
- We'll leave one for you.
- Yes, please.

645
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:26,183
The outside has a net-like pattern.

646
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:28,643
It's crunchy on the outside. For you to feel the texture,

647
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:30,513
the ingredients are clumped together inside.

648
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:32,684
There's a whole shrimp inside.

649
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,753
I never had it with so much shrimp.

650
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,223
There's a whole shrimp inside.

651
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,693
Can I do a quiz for the freeloaders?

652
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,123
Can I do a quiz to win a fried spring roll?

653
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:41,224
- I can't resist it.
- What?

654
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:42,863
Tae Hyun.

655
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:43,993
(He takes it back.)

656
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,464
- Seriously, Tae Hyun.
- That's not right.

657
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,434
Why did you even say that you'll leave one for me?

658
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,604
I'll leave half of it for you.

659
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,633
I changed my mind.

660
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,744
- I'll eat it.
- Goodness.

661
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,404
Goodness.

662
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,614
That looks so good.

663
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,553
- Here's your next dish, bun cha.
- Please bring it.

664
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,584
- What's this?
- This is cold bun cha.

665
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,854
- Actually...
- Oh, my.

666
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,394
- It's bun cha.
- What is bun cha?

667
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:13,723
Bun cha is served with pork grilled over charcoal.

668
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,563
You eat it with noodles drenched in the sauce.

669
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:16,734
It's like bibim pho.

670
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,803
Normally, bun cha is warm.

671
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,833
- I came up with it for the summer.
- You did?

672
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,904
(Isn't it your first time trying cold bun cha?)

673
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,873
Usually, we dip the food in the sauce.

674
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,943
I've never seen bun cha filled with so much sauce.

675
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:30,944
- Me neither.
- I know.

676
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,014
It's usually not like this.

677
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,613
- Like cold buckwheat noodles, - Right.

678
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,284
You usually dip the noodles in the sauce.

679
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:38,684
Goodness.

680
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:41,154
Goodness.

681
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,393
Wrap some pork with cold noodles.

682
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:44,654
(Slurping the meat wrapped in noodles drenched in the sauce)

683
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,694
I love bun cha.

684
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,863
(Hoon has a huge appetite today.)

685
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,964
- It gives a texture to the noodles.
- It's really delicious.

686
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:57,333
- Eat it with the vegetables.
- It's really good.

687
00:23:57,334 --> 00:24:00,274
Since it's served cold, it gives a texture to the noodles.

688
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,874
Aren't the noodles chewy like jjolmyeon?

689
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:06,244
(Humming)

690
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:09,714
That looks delicious.

691
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:12,454
Don't the noodles have a texture now?

692
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,354
That looks delicious.

693
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,623
(He has no energy to beg.)

694
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:18,154
Don't the noodles have a texture now?

695
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,993
Can I have a quick bite of this?

696
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,193
Does he need our permission to eat?

697
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:25,363
Yes, please give me your permission.

698
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,003
He has to answer a quiz.

699
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:28,303
Can I have a bite?

700
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:29,703
(Feeling lonely in the crowd)

701
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:30,804
All right.

702
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:33,673
Hoon, could you...

703
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:34,874
Could you give me your permission?

704
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,743
Hoon, could you give me your permission?

705
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:38,913
The taste is very refreshing.

706
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,043
(Evaluating the taste without being told)

707
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,713
A taste you don't want to lose to anyone.

708
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,954
(Evaluating the taste again without being told)

709
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:46,483
Why don't Hoon and I...

710
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,883
Unlike regular pho...

711
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:48,924
(He's being ignored many times today.)

712
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,953
You know the game of 31? Let's play that.

713
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:53,324
Which game are you good at?

714
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,064
Game 31.

715
00:24:55,664 --> 00:24:58,034
- Game 31.
- But you know how to win.

716
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,933
(Determined to win every time)

717
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:04,834
(He mastered the winning formula for Game 31.)

718
00:25:05,274 --> 00:25:07,643
(It's the result...)

719
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:11,474
(of pure obsession.)

720
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,513
(He tries to freeload by playing 31 again.)

721
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,383
Why don't you two play? If you say 31,

722
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:16,414
you will win.

723
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,353
(The person to say "31" first wins.)

724
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:20,384
- We have to say 31?
- Yes.

725
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:22,754
- One, two, three.
- You must play without thinking.

726
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,324
Four, five, six.

727
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,494
Seven, eight, nine.

728
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:28,424
- Hurry up.
- Ten, eleven, twelve.

729
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:30,363
- Thirteen.
- Fourteen.

730
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:32,533
- Fifteen, sixteen.
- Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.

731
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,204
Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two.

732
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:36,273
- Hurry.
- Twenty-three.

733
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:38,134
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

734
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:43,874
- Incorrect.
- Twenty-six, twenty-seven. I won.

735
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:47,184
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

736
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:49,813
- I have to say it.
- She said up to 28.

737
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,213
It's not against the rules...

738
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,183
- to say four numbers.
- That's true.

739
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,324
Just say up to 31.

740
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,024
- That's not part of the rules.
- Just say up to 31.

741
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,324
What?

742
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,693
Thirty, thirty-one.

743
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:01,864
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one.

744
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,803
(Dong Hyun fails to freeload.)

745
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,804
- It wasn't part of the rules.
- Hold on.

746
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,474
- You're right.
- Gosh, you're a genius.

747
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:13,773
We didn't set the rules.

748
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:15,373
There was no rule of saying three numbers.

749
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,444
You're right.

750
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,173
You're very smart.

751
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:19,183
(In awe)

752
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:20,383
This is how I survive.

753
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:21,643
(A hunter with petty tricks)

754
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:22,813
He's amazing.

755
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,753
Since it's too late for food,

756
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:26,684
can I have...

757
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:27,984
a cup of Cafe Sua Da?

758
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,254
You can drink that later.

759
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,693
Is it losing rock-paper-scissors?

760
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:33,223
You play it in two beats.

761
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,123
- You play later, but you must lose.
- Does that exist?

762
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,494
- Do you want to try it?
- Let's do it.

763
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:39,003
- For example, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

764
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,564
- You have to lose.
- Okay.

765
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:42,103
(Buffering)

766
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:43,174
Okay.

767
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:45,473
- Let's do it.
- You can't play slowly like this.

768
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:47,143
- You must play right away.
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

769
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:49,313
- You must play on time.
- Let's try it.

770
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:52,513
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

771
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:53,984
(Oh, no)

772
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,554
(Trembling)

773
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,054
His hand looks sad.

774
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,553
We should take turns.

775
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:01,723
- We should take turns.
- Right.

776
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,823
We should play until someone wins.

777
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:04,853
Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

778
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:05,994
(Rock, rock)

779
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:08,163
- Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.
- It doesn't work.

780
00:27:08,164 --> 00:27:09,264
I'm sorry.

781
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:11,063
It doesn't work.

782
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,133
(A match between two geniuses with strong egos)

783
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,663
Both of them are the same.

784
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,273
- They're neck and neck.
- I don't know.

785
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,603
The first one to win wins.

786
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,073
- Play it again.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

787
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:21,143
(Scissors, scissors)

788
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:22,243
Rock-paper-scissors, scissors.

789
00:27:22,244 --> 00:27:23,374
It doesn't work.

790
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:27,083
It doesn't work. I can't help but try to win.

791
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:29,013
- Hoon, you can't do it.
- I can't help but try to win.

792
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,213
- Thanks to Hoon...
- I won.

793
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,453
You should keep Hoon around all the time.

794
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:34,453
Thank you.

795
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:36,923
Shall we try Cafe Sua Da?

796
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:37,953
We should try it.

797
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:38,993
How many of you want it?

798
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:40,723
Can I have some? I won rock-paper-scissors.

799
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:43,363
You're only freeloading, so you can't make an order.

800
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,163
- Doesn't he get a sip of mine?
- Exactly.

801
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,164
You won against him.

802
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,104
It's strange how you're smart only sometimes.

803
00:27:49,374 --> 00:27:51,473
- You need to get a sip of his.
- Right.

804
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:52,474
He can't make an order.

805
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:53,874
I won't have any.

806
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,573
- What?
- I won't have any.

807
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,844
Then I can't have any.

808
00:27:58,114 --> 00:27:59,114
Right.

809
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:01,483
(Why did Dong Hyun even play?)

810
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,454
I don't like sweets.

811
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,853
- Really?
- Yes.

812
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:06,484
Just order it for now.

813
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:07,984
It's free.

814
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:10,723
Can we get four orders of Cafe Sua Da?

815
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:11,893
- Four?
- No, five.

816
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:14,523
- We'll only get four.
- Four Cafe Sua Da, please.

817
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:15,624
(They only order 4 Cafe Sua Da.)

818
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,364
I'll drink this instead of coffee.

819
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:19,633
(He's an expert at mocking.)

820
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:20,904
Even the way you mock...

821
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,204
You're intermittently clever.

822
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:27,244
- "Intermittently?" - He's smart when he wants to be.

823
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:30,773
- The coffee looks amazing.
- Gosh, it's already served.

824
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:33,343
- What is this called?
- It's Cafe Sua Da.

825
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,783
- Sua Da.
- Sua Da.

826
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,583
- What does "Sua Da" mean?
- Isn't it condensed milk?

827
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:38,714
"Sua" means condensed milk. "Da" means ice.

828
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,424
It's iced coffee.

829
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,523
(Exclaiming)

830
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,794
This is Vietnam.

831
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:49,593
- It's Vietnam.
- The aftertaste...

832
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,564
- This is authentic.
- Goodness.

833
00:28:52,134 --> 00:28:53,303
It's like caramel coffee.

834
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:54,404
This is the best.

835
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:55,934
(Congratulating himself)

836
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:57,274
This is the best.

837
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:58,933
It's really good.

838
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,343
It tastes more flavorful...

839
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:01,773
than what I had in Vietnam.

840
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:02,973
It has more...

841
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,214
- This is the best.
- Goodness, it's so good.

842
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,544
I can try some, can't I?

843
00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:08,544
You should drink mine.

844
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,554
But Hoon didn't order any, so you don't get any.

845
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:12,083
I won the game...

846
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,384
with Vietnamese iced coffee at stake.

847
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,353
Play rock-paper-scissors with the restaurant owner.

848
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,924
If you win, I'll give you some of mine.

849
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,323
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- You have to win.

850
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,593
- You must win in this game.
- Defeat the restaurant owner.

851
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:21,693
If Dong Hyun wins, please give him a cup of coffee.

852
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,364
- Okay.
- Really?

853
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:26,163
That's a sudden, shocking condition.

854
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,233
- Really?
- Will you really give me some?

855
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:28,434
If Dong Hyun loses, he has to wash the dishes.

856
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:29,974
What?

857
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:33,274
- There has to be an exchange.
- In that case...

858
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:35,844
- There has to be an exchange.
- You said...

859
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:38,143
that you're willing to give me some for free.

860
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,684
Then I'll play scissors.

861
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:41,414
If you want to give me some,

862
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:44,254
If you want to give me some, please play paper.

863
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:48,384
(Who made Dong Hyun like this?)

864
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,053
- That's what you said.
- All right.

865
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,454
- Sir, it's up to you.
- Okay.

866
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,763
Here we go.

867
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,193
- Ready or not, - Ready or not,

868
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,334
- rock-paper-scissors.
- rock-paper-scissors.

869
00:29:58,394 --> 00:29:59,463
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

870
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,733
(I'm sorry.)

871
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:02,903
He's really shocked.

872
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,833
- Dong Hyun is truly shocked.
- He's really shocked.

873
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:05,944
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

874
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:08,403
(Horrified)

875
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:09,413
Dong Hyun is...

876
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:11,543
(Dong Hyun is very hurt.)

877
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:12,614
He's hurt.

878
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,213
Dong Hyun is truly shocked.

879
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:15,954
Please sit down.

880
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,083
(Running away)

881
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,084
You are...

882
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:20,854
so greedy about money.

883
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:22,323
What's wrong with you?

884
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,423
- I'll buy it.
- No.

885
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,994
- I'll buy it with my money.
- No.

886
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:26,363
We spent over 200 dollars.

887
00:30:26,364 --> 00:30:27,523
Don't hold any grudges.

888
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:29,024
He could've given me a cup of coffee.

889
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:32,733
This type of coffee has a lot of caffeine.

890
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:33,803
Since you're an athlete...

891
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:35,803
Athletes love caffeine. It's their favorite.

892
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:36,833
It's before your workout, right?

893
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,233
- He's being considerate.
- It's good before a workout.

894
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:39,403
He was being considerate of your health.

895
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,603
I'm worried about your health.

896
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:41,944
- You're worried about my health?
- Yes.

897
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:44,043
- He's right.
- You'll earn a lot of money.

898
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:45,714
(Still holding grudges)

899
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,743
Shall we take a look at our bill?

900
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,183
Can we get our bill, please?

901
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,184
Sure.

902
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,754
It wasn't intentional.

903
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,854
- The total is huge.
- It's the most I sold in a day.

904
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,623
The highest since you opened the restaurant...

905
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,263
- From one table...
- The highest total.

906
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:00,863
Over the last six years.

907
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,223
Over the last six years?

908
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:03,893
Over the last six years,

909
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:05,563
- we ate the most.
- We wrote history.

910
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,963
(We wrote history.)

911
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,234
That makes me feel good.

912
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,274
Will you put up our photo?

913
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:11,673
If you take a photo,

914
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:13,044
- I'll put it up.
- We should do that.

915
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,944
- The total is 205 dollars.
- Nice.

916
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,044
This is serious.

917
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,413
Wait.

918
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:20,014
- Things got suddenly serious.
- Why?

919
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,144
If I lose...

920
00:31:22,754 --> 00:31:24,484
We could get it wrong.

921
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,384
Okay. All right.

922
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,324
- For 205 dollars.
- Yes.

923
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:29,754
Here's the quiz.

924
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:33,463
In Vietnam, there is a tradition of placing the most valuable items...

925
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:35,394
on the table for ancestral rites.

926
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,193
Something from Korea is placed...

927
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:39,564
on the table for ancestral rites.

928
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,134
"Something from Korea?"

929
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,903
Since 1995, this product has been exported to Vietnam...

930
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,374
and has deeply integrated into the daily life in Vietnam.

931
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,974
What could it be?

932
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:49,813
The table for ancestral rites?

933
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,214
(The table for ancestral rites in Vietnam?)

934
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,143
- For ancestral rites?
- In 1995?

935
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,213
Could it be a type of food?

936
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:55,743
It must be a type of food since it's for ancestral rites.

937
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:56,754
I think so.

938
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,314
It must be Coke.

939
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,283
But that's not Korean.

940
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:01,953
He said that it's something from Korea.

941
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,124
Something from Korea.

942
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:04,794
Is it a type of food?

943
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,993
All I will say is...

944
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,324
that it's placed on the table for ancestral rites.

945
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,233
So that's why it's difficult.

946
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,434
It's difficult.

947
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:14,164
- It could be a type of snack.
- It's difficult.

948
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:15,863
It can't be a snack.

949
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:17,733
- Snack like Banana Kick.
- Was the IMF crisis in 1998?

950
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:19,174
(The answer must be a snack like Banana Kick.)

951
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,674
Banana...

952
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,514
I was pretending not to hear Dong Hyun.

953
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:25,374
In 1995?

954
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:27,844
I was one year old then.

955
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:30,254
This is just my guess.

956
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,023
Since they drink coffee in Vietnam,

957
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,723
it could be instant coffee mix.

958
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,823
We had so many questions with instant coffee mix as the answer.

959
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:37,853
- It could be the answer again.
- Right?

960
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,224
But it's probably not the answer.

961
00:32:39,564 --> 00:32:40,864
How about Korean kimchi?

962
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:42,394
On the table for ancestral rites?

963
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:43,894
How about ramyeon?

964
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:47,064
For me, ramyeon sounds reasonable.

965
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,663
Like Shin Ramyun?

966
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:52,204
I have friends in Vietnam, and I go there very often.

967
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,303
They eat a lot of ramyeon in Vietnam.

968
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:56,373
- Why Korean ramyeon?
- You mean, Korean ramyeon?

969
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,244
Korean ramyeon is extremely popular all over the world.

970
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,943
Ramyeon for ancestral rites?

971
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:03,153
- That's possible.
- Unlike Korean ancestral rites,

972
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:05,013
they could hold the rites like a party.

973
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,953
They place valuable food on the table.

974
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:09,654
I'm a model for one of the ramyeon brands.

975
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:11,694
The person in charge told me...

976
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:13,724
that in Southeast Asian countries,

977
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,333
sharing ramyeon with the family is...

978
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,864
considered rare.

979
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:21,033
- Then there's more chance...
- It's considered rare.

980
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:22,303
That ramyeon is the answer.

981
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,674
You have to name the ramyeon brand.

982
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,443
- You have to say the name.
- If it's rare...

983
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:28,343
He got a strong feeling...

984
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:29,943
that ramyeon could be the answer.

985
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:31,543
So far, ramyeon sounds...

986
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:32,784
- the most likely.
- It's number one.

987
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,184
Shall I give you the last hint?

988
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,183
Pho is famous in Vietnam.

989
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,454
You think they'd eat ramyeon instead?

990
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:40,154
Instead of such a popular noodle dish?

991
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,553
Let's go with ramyeon.

992
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,554
Okay.

993
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,554
Go ahead, Hoon.

994
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:46,994
- Say "I got it" first.
- I got it.

995
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:49,094
Ramyeon.

996
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:51,833
Ramyeon?

997
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:56,973
(Ramyeon)

998
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,134
Maybe it's too simple.

999
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,444
Incorrect.

1000
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,343
(Roaring of victory)

1001
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,874
Rock-paper-scissors, paper.

1002
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,284
(Dong Hyun is exempt from paying.)

1003
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:13,683
- The answer isn't so simple.
- It must be a type of alcohol.

1004
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,483
If you get the right answer, you'll be exempted.

1005
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:17,293
- Exempted? Okay.
- Each of you should guess.

1006
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:18,753
Shall I narrow it down?

1007
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:19,824
Yes.

1008
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:21,993
It's a type of bread.

1009
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,133
- What?
- Bread.

1010
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,493
What kind of Korean bread is there?

1011
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:25,834
- Korean bread?
- I got it.

1012
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,633
- Flower-shaped bun?
- Flower-shaped bun? Incorrect.

1013
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:28,864
I got it. Donuts.

1014
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,173
Incorrect.

1015
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:31,633
Mammoth bread?

1016
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:32,673
Mammoth bread is incorrect.

1017
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:34,673
- I got it. Twisted donut?
- Twisted donut is incorrect.

1018
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,574
Which bread was exported?

1019
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:38,913
I got it. Choco Pie.

1020
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:41,383
(Choco Pie)

1021
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:42,814
It's correct.

1022
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:45,313
- It's correct.
- Yi Kyung is correct.

1023
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:46,383
(Yi Kyung is exempted from paying.)

1024
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,123
- Choco Pie is a snack.
- It's correct.

1025
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:49,794
- It's not bread.
- You're right.

1026
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:51,453
- Choco Pie? That's a bummer.
- It's bread?

1027
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:53,724
While talking about snacks, why didn't Choco Pie come up?

1028
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,193
In 1995...

1029
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,594
Choco Pie? We were so close.

1030
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,163
- All right.
- So...

1031
00:34:58,164 --> 00:34:59,393
will you give us the next question?

1032
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:00,463
Yes, I will.

1033
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:01,563
It's a multiple-choice question...

1034
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:03,073
with four options.

1035
00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:04,234
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1036
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:05,974
- One, two, three, four.
- Okay.

1037
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,173
If you pick the right answer, you'll be exempted from paying.

1038
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,273
Okay.

1039
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,074
So I have a good chance.

1040
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,583
Here's the quiz.

1041
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,013
Cilantro,

1042
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:17,984
which pairs perfectly with pho,

1043
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,484
is a vegetable that belongs to the water parsley family.

1044
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:24,793
In the following, three of them belong to the water parsley family.

1045
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:25,854
I have no idea.

1046
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:28,163
Pick a vegetable in the water parsley family.

1047
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:29,224
This is difficult.

1048
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:30,694
Number one, carrot.

1049
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:32,734
- What?
- Carrot is a type of water parsley?

1050
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:34,304
Number two, arugula.

1051
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:36,773
- One of the pizza toppings?
- Yes.

1052
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:37,934
Number three, dong quai.

1053
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:40,104
- "Dong quai?" - Your ear.

1054
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:42,174
Number four, celery.

1055
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,113
- This isn't easy.
- This is...

1056
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:45,673
- This isn't easy.
- This isn't easy.

1057
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,213
- None of them sound like an answer.
- Why carrot?

1058
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,013
Isn't the carrot random?

1059
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,353
- Three of them belong...
- Pick carrot.

1060
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,784
- to the water parsley family?
- Pick carrot.

1061
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:52,954
(Hoon, pick carrot.)

1062
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:54,083
Think of the intention behind the question.

1063
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:56,493
- Isn't the carrot so random?
- So it's definitely carrot.

1064
00:35:56,494 --> 00:35:57,924
Have you seen the leaves of a carrot plant?

1065
00:35:58,054 --> 00:35:59,894
- It's over once you pick one.
- They look like cilantro.

1066
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,594
Choose one.

1067
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:03,533
I'd go with carrot. I'm 100 percent sure.

1068
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:04,633
My answer is celery.

1069
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,063
(Hoon's pick, celery)

1070
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,763
Celery seems the closest to cilantro,

1071
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,134
- but that's the wrong answer.
- Be quiet.

1072
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:11,403
(Frustrated)

1073
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:12,433
- Be quiet.
- It's so frustrating.

1074
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:13,903
- He can't even talk.
- Please, Hoon.

1075
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:15,103
Why can't you leave Hoon alone?

1076
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,443
Did I do something wrong?

1077
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:17,973
- I'm trying to save you.
- Really?

1078
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,213
- Kang Hoon.
- I don’t need...

1079
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:20,683
- to take any risks, right?
- Right.

1080
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:22,583
- I'm the first one to choose.
- Play it safe.

1081
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,683
- Of course.
- So you picked celery?

1082
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,083
Wait a minute.

1083
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,483
Avoid the answer that seems closest to cilantro.

1084
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,583
You already said celery.

1085
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:28,883
- I pick arugula.
- That's right.

1086
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:30,153
- Number two.
- Aruguli.

1087
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,553
(He changes from celery to arugula.)

1088
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:32,853
I mean, arugula.

1089
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,263
- Can I really trust you?
- Arugula.

1090
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:36,093
Arugula sounds ambiguous.

1091
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:38,433
It has a higher chance of being correct.

1092
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,364
- Is it the answer?
- What's "dong quai?"

1093
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,334
It's a plant called "you're cute."

1094
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:44,804
It must look pretty.

1095
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:46,203
Dong quai is...

1096
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,803
I'll just pick dong quai.

1097
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,074
- My answer is dong quai.
- Okay.

1098
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:50,613
Please pick carrot.

1099
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,073
Celery and carrot remain.

1100
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:53,484
Please pick carrot, Ju Hyun.

1101
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,013
There must be something about carrot.

1102
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:56,914
Ju Hyun, if carrot is wrong, I'll pay for you.

1103
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:59,313
- Carrot.
- I'll pay for you.

1104
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:00,623
- Make it clear.
- Carrot.

1105
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:01,953
- That's right.
- My answer is celery.

1106
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:03,294
- Carrot?
- Celery.

1107
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,093
I'll announce the answer.

1108
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:06,723
(The only one with the wrong answer will pay.)

1109
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,763
Celery...

1110
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,093
(4. Celery)

1111
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:10,693
belongs to the water parsley family.

1112
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:12,133
(Tae Hyun is exempt from paying.)

1113
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:14,134
- He survived.
- He even picked the last choice.

1114
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:16,234
My original answer was celery.

1115
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,974
I know.

1116
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:19,974
Dong quai...

1117
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,474
Is dong quai correct?

1118
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,043
(Wait a minute.)

1119
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:24,444
The wrong answer must be arugula.

1120
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:25,644
No way.

1121
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,413
It belongs to the water parsley family.

1122
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,613
I told you.

1123
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,254
- Hold on.
- Thank you for believing in me.

1124
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:31,814
Thank you for believing in me.

1125
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,524
- Let it be carrot, please.
- Let it be carrot, please.

1126
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,084
Let it be carrot, please.

1127
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:38,893
Let it be carrot.

1128
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:40,163
- After going around...
- Let it be carrot, please.

1129
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:41,164
- After going around...
- Wait.

1130
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,724
- Is it arugula?
- Wait a minute.

1131
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:44,894
You must be curious. Carrot...

1132
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,064
belongs to the water parsley family.

1133
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,873
(Both Ju Hyun and Dong Hyun are exempt from paying.)

1134
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:53,004
All right.

1135
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:54,673
What?

1136
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:56,543
(In that case, )

1137
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,943
(Kang Hoon has to pay the total.)

1138
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:00,384
(Arugula is a type of crucifer.)

1139
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,243
Arugula? You got to pick first.

1140
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:03,353
He picked his answer first.

1141
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,114
You said that celery was wrong.

1142
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,053
This is all your fault.

1143
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,183
He changed his mind because of me.

1144
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,223
I'm so sorry.

1145
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,854
You said that aruguli was correct.

1146
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:13,624
Yes, aruguli.

1147
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:16,193
If it's okay with you, I'll pay for you.

1148
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,833
I'm okay with you paying.

1149
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:21,904
(I'm okay with you paying.)

1150
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,703
Are you really okay with that?

1151
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,273
Of course, it'd be okay if you pay for me.

1152
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,544
I'd be happy to pay for him.

1153
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:34,183
I'd be happy to.

1154
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:35,714
Let me ask you one more time.

1155
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,954
Are you really okay with me paying for you?

1156
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:40,324
You might think that it's rude.

1157
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:41,883
It's not rude.

1158
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,823
- Is it not rude?
- I'd be grateful.

1159
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,693
Will you be grateful with all your heart?

1160
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:48,023
- Yes. But still, I should...
- No, it's fine.

1161
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,194
- Really?
- What?

1162
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:53,563
- I'd gladly cover the bill.
- Sure.

1163
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,163
- Still...
- Really?

1164
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,673
- It's fine.
- I'll get it.

1165
00:38:57,674 --> 00:38:58,733
It's fine.

1166
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:00,103
(An intense game of wits)

1167
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,273
- I mean it.
- I could...

1168
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:03,543
I bet his credit card isn't even in there.

1169
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,273
I'm itchy, that's all.

1170
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:06,373
(I'm itchy.)

1171
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:07,513
I'm itchy, that's all.

1172
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,913
(Oh, Hoon was itching.)

1173
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,654
- Were you itchy?
- I'm afraid so.

1174
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,354
I'll get the bill, okay? It's really fine.

1175
00:39:13,424 --> 00:39:15,053
- I'll feel bad, that's all.
- It's fine.

1176
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,323
- I made him switch answers.
- Still.

1177
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:17,793
I'd feel bad if you cover the bill instead.

1178
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:19,424
No, it's fine.

1179
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,863
Sir!

1180
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:22,793
(Sir...)

1181
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,794
- Yes?
- Sir!

1182
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,263
Are you sure I can cover the bill?

1183
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:26,363
(For Team Pho, Dong Hyun ends up paying.)

1184
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,604
I enjoyed the meal!

1185
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,203
It was another great meal.

1186
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,904
- Thanks, Dong Hyun.
- No way.

1187
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,303
Can we get our photo up on the wall?

1188
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,443
We should.

1189
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:35,944
Let's stick our receipt on there too.

1190
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:38,674
- Proudly.
- This is oddly proud.

1191
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,783
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1192
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:43,484
(Let's go.)

1193
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:45,884
Captain, it's time for you to eat now.

1194
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,884
I can't believe it's just me.

1195
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,194
I've been starving for too long.

1196
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:51,724
I'm on an empty stomach.

1197
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:53,053
It's taking too long.

1198
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:54,263
I'm full now...

1199
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:55,963
- and the weather is amazing.
- Tell me about it.

1200
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,094
I'm the only one who's hungry.

1201
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,334
N Seoul Tower looks so close.

1202
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,664
Hasn't it been a while since you walked over an overpass?

1203
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,773
It's true.

1204
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:05,104
(Over an overpass from Namyeong-dong to Munbae-dong)

1205
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:08,003
(Located in the heart of Seoul, )

1206
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,474
(N Seoul Tower feels just a foot away.)

1207
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,044
- Dong Hyun.
- Yes?

1208
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,343
The walk is telling me that we're on our way...

1209
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,143
to a delicious restaurant.

1210
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,753
Is that so?

1211
00:40:16,754 --> 00:40:17,883
(A cheonggukjang place by the railroad?)

1212
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:19,584
Is this the place? The cheonggukjang place?

1213
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,824
This must be it.

1214
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:22,524
- Over there.
- We passed it.

1215
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,223
- This must be it.
- It's been around for ages.

1216
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:25,953
For 43 years!

1217
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,623
- I'm so hungry.
- It has that old restaurant spirit.

1218
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:28,663
- I'm starving.
- I can't wait.

1219
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:29,863
(Though it looks old, the restaurant is small and charming.)

1220
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:30,933
I'm so hungry.

1221
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,664
This is the real deal.

1222
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:36,104
(Compact but welcoming)

1223
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,904
(And...)

1224
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,343
Check out all those autographs.

1225
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:43,674
A lot of famous people ate here.

1226
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:47,713
This place is more than just a popular restaurant.

1227
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,084
(Beans here and beans there.)

1228
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:51,914
(People wait in line to eat here.)

1229
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:54,483
(Rustic and tasty! Thanks for using home-grown beans.)

1230
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,953
(A well-known Korean restaurant)

1231
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,954
(The second I tasted the soybean noodles, )

1232
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:58,954
(I knew this was the real deal.)

1233
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,994
(If this were in my neighborhood, I'd eat here every day.)

1234
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:07,064
(LMR 2, Cheonggukjang)

1235
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,263
- Hello.
- Hello.

1236
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:10,874
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I am.

1237
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,333
Didn't you inherit this from your parents?

1238
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:15,174
Yes, I'm the second-generation owner of the restaurant.

1239
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,913
- You look young.
- By the looks of it...

1240
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,243
Check out the photo behind you.

1241
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:19,743
It shows how it was in the family.

1242
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:20,913
Is that one of your family?

1243
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:24,914
Yes, the restaurant has been here for 48 years.

1244
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:26,553
Only in this spot?

1245
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:28,884
Yes, it's been open here for 48 years.

1246
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,853
(The old store became a restaurant that represents the neighborhood.)

1247
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:34,563
You must know the entire history of the place.

1248
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,163
It was even in the newspapers...

1249
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:37,333
as a long-lasting small business.

1250
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:39,034
(The flavors have been passed down for 2 generations.)

1251
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:42,103
Normally, a cheonggukjang place...

1252
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:43,373
would smell like cheonggukjang.

1253
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:44,473
- It's not like that.
- I don't smell it.

1254
00:41:44,474 --> 00:41:46,203
That's right. Our cheonggukjang doesn't smell.

1255
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:50,113
Our food is made before the beans ferment too much.

1256
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:51,913
- It doesn't smell when served?
- Even when you cook...

1257
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:53,484
That's right. It doesn't have a bad smell.

1258
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:55,714
- That's fascinating.
- Really?

1259
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:57,783
I haven't come across cheonggukjang that doesn't smell.

1260
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,084
Now that I think about it, there isn't a strong smell.

1261
00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:02,824
- Once you taste it...
- It's a first.

1262
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,154
- I'm sorry to ask this, - Yes?

1263
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:08,364
- but I'll be eating on my own.
- I see.

1264
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:10,693
- There's a whole group of us but...
- Order everything you want.

1265
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,764
Eat as much as you want.

1266
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,133
Our most popular dishes are cheonggukjang,

1267
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:17,504
soybean noodles, and stir-fried squid.

1268
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:19,733
- That sounds great.
- They're all plant-based.

1269
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:20,803
Everything sounds good.

1270
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,703
I'll have the two first and finish the meal...

1271
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,243
- with soybean noodles.
- Got it.

1272
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:25,244
Coming right up.

1273
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:26,574
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

1274
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,744
The rest are full though.

1275
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:30,483
How could they be hungry...

1276
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,954
after eating 200 dollars worth of food at the Vietnamese place?

1277
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:35,953
Ju Hyun, aren't you experiencing a blood sugar spike?

1278
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,094
I am.

1279
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,193
- You seem sleepy.
- Same here.

1280
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,564
That's why I don't eat while I'm filming on set.

1281
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:43,863
I get sluggish when my stomach is full.

1282
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,263
It can be exhausting.

1283
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:47,034
Are you one to easily bloat?

1284
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:48,903
I don't bloat easily,

1285
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,274
but I like eating food that makes me bloat.

1286
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,633
I eat a lot too. I usually eat a lot.

1287
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,374
I'm the only one here who's hungry.

1288
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:57,214
- I haven't worked out in...
- It's like they're here for coffee.

1289
00:42:57,944 --> 00:43:00,113
It's like they're a group of employees...

1290
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,014
who gathered at a coffee shop.

1291
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,714
- Just wait till the food is served.
- Exactly.

1292
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,483
- He's right.
- It's because the food isn't here.

1293
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:06,613
Once it's served...

1294
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:08,354
Tae Hyun, to be honest,

1295
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:11,153
I'm upset that he didn't order...

1296
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:12,354
- the spicy meat dish.
- Exactly.

1297
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,063
You should know...

1298
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:16,124
that my favorite dish in the world is stir-fried pork.

1299
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,234
Should I order a plate?

1300
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:19,794
You can have it all.

1301
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,163
Should I order it?

1302
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:22,763
You should at least taste it.

1303
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:24,433
(He gets talked into ordering stir-fried pork.)

1304
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,873
- The food is now served.
- Really?

1305
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,143
The cheonggukjang.

1306
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:28,503
(Cheonggukjang is served.)

1307
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:30,213
(Bursting with curiosity)

1308
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:31,774
Here's your cheonggukjang.

1309
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,074
The stir-fried squid.

1310
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:37,154
(Filled with nutty beans)

1311
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:41,454
(The odorless cheonggukjang that people line up to eat)

1312
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:44,693
(Don't forget cheonggukjang's best friend.)

1313
00:43:44,694 --> 00:43:47,323
(Hot and spicy red flavors!)

1314
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,534
(Stir-fried squid with a 48-year tradition)

1315
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,903
(A variety of bean dishes, The cheonggukjang set menu)

1316
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:56,664
(This will be served later.)

1317
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,033
That looks good.

1318
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:59,134
(Mouth-watering)

1319
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:01,643
The stir-fried squid looks delicious.

1320
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:02,773
It looks like a replica.

1321
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,313
- This...
- Doesn't this look fake?

1322
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,313
- Exactly.
- Squishy, chewy,

1323
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:07,613
- and soft.
- Moist...

1324
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,243
- with a shiny coating.
- It looks like a food replica.

1325
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:10,653
- My mouth is watering.
- It looks so bouncy.

1326
00:44:10,654 --> 00:44:12,214
- Could I have that, please?
- This...

1327
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,923
- I...
- You know this, right?

1328
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:16,894
- You can see the squid wiggle.
- This is a first for me.

1329
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,493
- It looks like a replica.
- Hand it over already.

1330
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:19,823
- Do you need it right now?
- Of course, I do.

1331
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,193
- It looks like a replica.
- That's hot. This...

1332
00:44:22,194 --> 00:44:23,964
The smell of the cheonggukjang.

1333
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:25,563
Even though it was just served...

1334
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:26,863
- I don't smell anything.
- It doesn't smell.

1335
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,663
- It doesn't have that smell.
- How is this possible?

1336
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:30,904
It doesn't have a bad smell.

1337
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:33,003
- It's just...
- How is this possible?

1338
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,743
- It smells like kimchi stew.
- Exactly!

1339
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:36,914
You can't smell the doenjang.

1340
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,213
- This...
- Every cheonggukjang place...

1341
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:41,684
- has that unique smell.
- Of course.

1342
00:44:43,344 --> 00:44:44,754
- Exactly.
- I don't smell a thing.

1343
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,653
I smell it now.

1344
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:48,783
- Does it smell when you eat it?
- Yes, but it's subtle.

1345
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:49,983
(The rustic smell of cheonggukjang gently spreads inside your mouth.)

1346
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:52,724
Some enjoy cheonggukjang for its thick texture.

1347
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:54,724
- The stew is...
- It's a bit like doenjang stew.

1348
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:56,364
(So hot)

1349
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:58,064
(He can't stop eating even though it's hot.)

1350
00:44:58,434 --> 00:44:59,633
I'll have it alone first.

1351
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:00,634
(Next, he tries the stir-fried squid.)

1352
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:01,734
That's fake.

1353
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:03,934
- It's so squishy.
- That's fake.

1354
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:06,633
That looks so good.

1355
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:08,343
(I'll gently pour some over the rice.)

1356
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:09,443
That looks delicious.

1357
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:11,413
This would've been hard to bear...

1358
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,174
if we had come here first.

1359
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:15,543
(A drizzle of sesame oil)

1360
00:45:15,544 --> 00:45:17,554
It smells incredible.

1361
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:21,153
I love this, you know.

1362
00:45:21,154 --> 00:45:22,823
Stir-fried squid and rice.

1363
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:24,354
(Tossed together to look mouthwatering!)

1364
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:26,294
All right.

1365
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:29,194
In one bite.

1366
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,133
Get a lot of squid in there.

1367
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:32,493
- Of course.
- Eat like a YouTuber.

1368

(Solitary Dong Hyun: Eating cheonggukjang alone)

1369

I expected no less from Cicada Kim.

1370
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:38,003
(The stir-fried squid is incredible!)

1371
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:39,074
It's so good.

It's really good.

He's busy eating...

1375
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:46,773
and expressing the flavors.

(A general at the dining table)

Here's your stir-fried pork.

1378
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:53,113
- That was fast.
- The pork looks amazing.

1379
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,224
It's stir-fried pork.

1380
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:56,084
Stir-fried pork?

1381
00:45:58,024 --> 00:45:59,353
This looks really good.

1382

(Savoring)

1386
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,303
How is it? How are the flavors?

1387
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,204
It's not spicy, but there's a smokiness to it.

1388
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,603
It's like stir-fried pork braised in soy sauce.

1389
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:15,943
- Soy sauce?
- The sauce is sticky.

1390
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:18,374
The sauce is sticky like it was made with gochujang and soy sauce.

1391
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,683
It's making me crave rice.

1392

Especially back in the day.

1393
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:23,613

- I'll be quick.

00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:33,154
Why...

1398
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,263
(Smirking)

1399
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:36,464
I'm sorry to say this,

1400
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:38,563
but it's like the whole family is here...

1401
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:39,833
to visit the brother in the military.

1402
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:42,233
(Visiting his brother while he's in the military)

1403
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,774
You're not wrong.

1404
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:45,304
- That's what it looks like.
- Thank you.

1405
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:46,833
- What?
- It's like we're a family...

1406
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,203
watching him eat.

1407
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:49,504
It's so good!

1408
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:52,074
- I hope you're not being bullied.
- I'm good.

1409
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:53,243
Do they serve adequate meals?

1410
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,184
- He's disciplined.
- I'll keep eating.

1411
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:57,314
- Sure. Dig in.
- Thank you, Father.

1412
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:01,283
- Shortly, you'll have to...
- Go back to base.

1413
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:03,753
You can't stay out and must return to base.

1414
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,823
- He must return to base.
- That's right.

1415
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,024
Eat up, then.

1416
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:08,723
- Still...
- Don't eat so fast.

1417
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,123
- I'm on double speed.
- Dong Hyun, slow down.

1418
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:11,433
- I eat fast.
- It's fine.

1419
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:12,694
I tend to eat quickly.

1420
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:15,033
Can we all try the cheonggukjang?

1421
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:16,464
That's fine by me but...

1422
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,973
- Taste it if you want.
- Shall we?

1423
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,244
All right, then.

1424
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:21,404
I'll eat.

1425
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:23,873
Are we just eating this?

1426
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,174
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

1427
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:27,613
(You get it for free!)

1428
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:28,644
Hold on a second.

1429
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:31,213
- We're visiting him on base.
- Dong Hyun doesn't want us...

1430
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,513
- to go through hoops.
- It's fine.

1431
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:35,653
So that's what happens when you eat alone.

1432
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:37,023
- Well...
- You lose your motivation.

1433
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,053
This is how it is.

1434
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:40,154
I'm grateful that they're joining me.

1435
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,264
- I ordered too much.
- Exactly.

1436
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:44,063
I'd be grateful if you all pitched in.

1437
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:48,964
(Then we'll eat without worrying.)

1438
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,833
This isn't your typical cheonggukjang.

1439
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:54,074
- Really?
- The beans must be of good quality.

1440
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,174
It could be a dish liked by almost anyone.

1441
00:47:57,844 --> 00:48:00,074
(Rookie foodie Hoon mainly targets the stir-fried pork.)

1442
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:03,713
(A huge bite)

1443
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,253
That's the kind of stir-fried pork I like.

1444
00:48:06,254 --> 00:48:07,953
I would polish off 2 to 3 bowls of rice.

1445
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:09,123
This is a dangerous dish of stir-fried pork.

1446
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:10,654
- Why?
- You'll be craving rice.

1447
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:12,794
- At least 3 bowls.
- I could eat at least 5 bowls.

1448
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:15,464
We can have more with the soybean noodles.

1449
00:48:15,494 --> 00:48:17,864
- The noodles will be a delight.
- Let's try some of that.

1450
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:19,734
Will you let us have the soybean noodles too?

1451
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,964
I'm sorry, but I can't let you have the soybean noodles.

1452
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,134
If you had the stir-fried squid, you must play a game.

1453
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:26,774
I didn't have the stir-fried squid.

1454
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:28,544
I didn't even touch that.

1455
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:30,313
The more you want them,

1456
00:48:30,314 --> 00:48:31,373
the less I can share.

1457
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:32,873
So this is what you wanted from us.

1458
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,143
- It was an act.
- I'll share...

1459
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,413
if you don't seem interested.

1460
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:36,843
Why are you toying with us?

1461
00:48:36,844 --> 00:48:38,983
That's the nature of the show. You should want it.

1462
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:40,383
I'll take it. It already looks good.

1463
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,884
This is your soybean noodles.

1464
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:43,553
I have just enough room for that. Check out the bowl.

1465
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:44,694
Look at that.

1466
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,093
(No way!)

1467
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:47,163
What is it?

1468
00:48:47,164 --> 00:48:49,664
- Why is it pink?
- Gosh.

1469
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:52,363
It looks like it's breathing as the bubbles are popping.

1470
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:54,363
- What's in it?
- Large soybeans were used...

1471
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,403
and that is why it has a strong color.

1472
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,564
They're not regular soybeans.

1473
00:48:57,474 --> 00:49:01,374
(When Mungyeong's large soybeans get boiled, )

1474
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:06,914
(a unique pink soymilk broth gets made.)

1475
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:14,084
(The thick and creamy texture is amazing.)

1476
00:49:15,754 --> 00:49:17,593
Should we play a game for this or what?

1477
00:49:17,594 --> 00:49:18,693
- What should we do?
- Sorry?

1478
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:19,723
It should be done with a game.

1479
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,163
(Tasting the soup first)

1480
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:23,464
- Go ahead.
- It must be good.

1481
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:26,564
This must be good. This is 100 percent good.

1482
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:28,103
This can't be bad.

1483
00:49:28,104 --> 00:49:29,304
Soybean noodle lovers would love this.

1484
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,034
It's really thick.

1485
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,173
It's usually thick,

1486
00:49:32,174 --> 00:49:33,204
but it's even thicker than the regular ones sold.

1487
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:34,603
It feels like some kind of soup.

1488
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:35,773
- Really?
- A cold soup.

1489
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:37,113
- I think it will taste good.
- Me too.

1490
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:39,744
It could feel different to everyone.

1491
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:49,454
It would be great to have it with some sugar.

1492
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,054
- Some sugar would be great.
- I added some.

1493
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,024
I think it will taste better.

1494
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:58,164
(How is it?)

1495
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,593
- Do you regret adding it now?
- I should've added it earlier.

1496
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:01,603
- Right?
- But...

1497
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,263
adding it toward the end...

1498
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,573
instead from the start...

1499
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:06,633
- could be better.
- Right.

1500
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:07,844
You can try different tastes that way.

1501
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:10,004
(Satisfied)

1502
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:12,973
It starts salty but ends sweet.

1503
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:14,114
How should I put it?

1504
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:16,013
- It's nice and sweet.
- Gosh, that must be good.

1505
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,113
(Encore slurping performance)

1506
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,354
(Amazed)

1507
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,423
It's really nice.

1508
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:22,484
(He clears 4 portions on his own!)

1509
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:24,894
- I think it's around 42 dollars.
- Thank you.

1510
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:27,123
- You were exactly right.
- Was I?

1511
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,363
It's 42 dollars.

1512
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:29,763
(Bill: Total of 42 dollars)

1513
00:50:29,764 --> 00:50:33,234
If I get it right,

1514
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:34,734
I think I will be able change the atmosphere.

1515
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:36,534
You're answering the quiz on your own for the first time.

1516
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:37,834
Right. I'm on my own for the first time.

1517
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,834
Please help me out.

1518
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,100
Here's the quiz.

1519
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,869
Cheonggukjang is a traditional dish of Korea.

1520
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,299
For the people of Goguryeo in the past,

1521
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,940
it was an important military supply in the battlefield.

1522
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:51,440
This is easy.

1523
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,739
Boiled beans were wrapped by rice straw...

1524
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,279
and they were naturally fermented...

1525
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,480
as they were carried in this by the cavalry.

1526
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,150
Where were the beans put in?

1527
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,449
- This is easy.
- Crocks.

1528
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,889
- Their pockets.
- Plastic bags.

1529
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,190
- Luxury purses.
- What?

1530
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,189
(He feels dizzy because of the wild fake news.)

1531
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,930
- Plastic bags.
- Birkin bags?

1532
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,000
- That sounds correct.
- Hold on.

1533
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,229
I'm sorry, but could you read the question one more time?

1534
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,769
As soon as "cheonggukjang" was mentioned,

1535
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,000
they started yelling it was easy.

1536
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,409
(It's just so funny.)

1537
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,639
It's just the cavalry that brought them around?

1538
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,710
It's just the cavalry?

1539
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,050
What's the cavalry though?

1540
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,519
I have to know what the cavalry is.

1541
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,720
What's the cavalry?

1542
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,749
Are they the people on horses? Or...

1543
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,559
They're the people who listen to the sounds of the enemies.

1544
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,059
(The ones that use their ears?)

1545
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Gosh.

1546
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,090
- I paid for you earlier.
- Oh, right.

1547
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,729
I'm sorry.

1548
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,000
- You have to help me out.
- I heard it wrong.

1549
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,240
The cavalry carried it around?

1550
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,369
They were on horses.

1551
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,670
It could've been kept in the horse's saddle.

1552
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,779
That seems so obvious though.

1553
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,579
I don't think it's the horse's saddle.

1554
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,749
- Really?
- It's not that.

1555
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,519
Horses sweat so much.

1556
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,980
The beans would rot if they are kept there.

1557
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,120
It'll be their pockets or the inside of their suit of armor.

1558
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,990
You were on "Let's Go Time Expedition" before.

1559
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,460
I was a slave.

1560
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,529
Really? You never wore a suit of armor?

1561
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,660
Never.

1562
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,500
(He fails to bring something out of his memory.)

1563
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,029
(It's hard to think of the answer.)

1564
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,740
- Gosh.
- It should sound reasonable.

1565
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,970
The quiz must be done by at least two.

1566
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,640
I need to have someone to discuss the question with.

1567
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,009
You must feel lonely.

1568
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,479
The answer could pop out...

1569
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,009
while discussing about the answer with someone.

1570
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,049
The five of us are trying our best to help you.

1571
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,110
This is a lonely fight.

1572
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,750
Isn't the water bottle the only thing they carry around?

1573
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,049
It could've been carried just with their hands.

1574
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,050
- Like this.
- No.

1575
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:49,660
Won't it be related to the horse as it's about the cavalry?

1576
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,260
It could've been the lunchboxes packed by their mothers.

1577
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,899
(Running a quick scan)

1578
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,559
- Right. The cavalry...
- I mentioned the water bottle...

1579
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,500
and crazy answers were mentioned all of a sudden.

1580
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,829
(He finds it to be suspicious all of a sudden.)

1581
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,300
Could it be their pockets?

1582
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,100
You should go with the water bottle then.

1583
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:06,269
(Feeling torn)

1584
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,939
- I got it.
- He got the answer.

1585
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,980
The water bottle.

1586
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,179
I'll just go with the water bottle.

1587
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,479
You're bound to go with the first answer.

1588
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,449
The water bottle is the only answer that makes sense.

1589
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,750
I don't know what they carried back then.

1590
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,650
(Could it be the right answer?)

1591
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,219
- The water bottle.
- Right.

1592
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,289
(Water bottle)

1593
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,790
That is incorrect.

1594
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,789
Try to make quick guesses.

1595
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,490
I got it. I'll go with the helmet.

1596
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,599
- That is incorrect.
- The pocket.

1597
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,899
- It was mentioned earlier.
- The horse saddle.

1598
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,229
The horse saddle is correct.

1599
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,829
(Answer: Horse saddle)

1600
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,099
The horse saddle is correct.

1601
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,369
(Feeling upset)

1602
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,910
He said it was never that!

1603
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,940
He said it was never that as horses sweat so much!

1604
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,710
How was that?

1605
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,650
I was going to pay for you if you got it right in three attempts.

1606
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,919
(They manage to tease him perfectly.)

1607
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,020
Right.

1608
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,689
- He got it right in five attempts.
- Right.

1609
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,090
I thought it was something they actually carried.

1610
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,160
Gosh. This isn't much.

1611
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,560
Gosh, Dong Hyun.

1612
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,359
Your wallet isn't even there.

1613
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,659
No. It's right here.

1614
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,699
- His wallet is there.
- His wallet is there.

1615
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,299
But this is what I think.

1616
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,530
I think he brought around four wallets.

1617
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,299
- Right.
- We don't know...

1618
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,499
where his actual wallet is.

1619
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,399
(Kang Hoon, 34, Keeps many wallets)

1620
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,970
All right. Let's go.

1621
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,409
- Thank you.
- The food was great.

1622
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,839
- That won't work.
- Right.

1623
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,910
Gosh.

1624
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,109
I don't need the receipt. Thank you.

1625
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,410
He looks so lonely.

1626
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,919
(Namyeong-dong Lunch Menu Recommendation)

1627
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,949
(Pho: You head to Vietnam as soon as you taste it.)

1628
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,419
(Pho: Korean beef and Thai basil are perfect partners.)

1629
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,359
(Pho: It was the best pho I had ever!)

1630
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,459
(Pho: It was the first pho to make me eat like crazy.)

1631
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,789
(Pho: No words are needed. It's highly recommended.)

1632
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,200
(Cheonggukjang: It's a traditional taste that anyone would like.)

1633

(After enjoying a satisfying meal...)

1634
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,869
(I was a bit late.)

1635
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,270
- I was a bit late.
- What?

1636
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,339
- He's back from the plane.
- Gosh.

1637
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,149
(Sang Uk has returned after his busy schedule.)

1638
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,909
- You've gone through so much.
- He came right away.

1639
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,579
- I'm sorry.
- You've gone through so much.

1640
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,849
- This is Hoon and Ju Hyun.
- Right. Hello.

1641
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,449
- Hello.
- You came right away...

1642
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,450
from the airport?

1643
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,120
He came right away from the airport.

1644
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,659
Is it your first time meeting Hoon and Ju Hyun?

1645
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,999
- We've never seen each other.
- Right.

1646
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,400
I've watched him on TV a lot.

1647
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,870
- You've watched him on TV?
- Right.

1648
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,599
What should you call each other?

1649
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,839
- He's younger than Seung Ho.
- How old are you?

1650
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,939
Ju Hyun is older again.

1651
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,009
I was born in 1996.

1652
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,270
Gosh, again?

1653
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,109
"Again?"

1654
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,409
- He's younger than Seung Ho.
- Really?

1655
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,410
He's the youngest.

1656
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:26,509
Then will you treat them as your older brother and sister?

1657
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,850
Right. I will treat them like that.

1658
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,720
- Right. Sang Uk.
- Right.

1659
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,020
- Speak comfortably with me.
- Right.

1660
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,990
- Right. Mr. Sang Uk.
- Right now,

1661
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,289
Sang Uk is feeling really hungry and he really wants Korean food.

1662
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,030
This place is known for its pork belly.

1663
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,630
It's pork belly?

1664
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,799
Don't just say the food that you want right now.

1665
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,129
- But...
- Your eyes are shining brightly.

1666
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,130
It's really popular in this area?

1667
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,970
This place is really popular for its pork belly.

1668
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,569
What if we all...

1669
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,109
choose the same place again?

1670
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:56,639
- There's another place.
- The US army base is here.

1671
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,749
They have the budae stew and steak here.

1672
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,850
It's really famous.

1673
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,490
(A steak dish full of beef...)

1674
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,119
(and the mouthwatering red budae stew)

1675
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,030
(Today's DMR)

1676
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,159
(Pork belly versus budae stew and steak)

1677
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,800
What will you have?

1678
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,029
I will go with pork belly.

1679
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,399
You can't choose first. The others will go with budae stew.

1680
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,639
- No way.
- Take your time to choose.

1681
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,269
I'm curious about what Sang Uk will choose.

1682
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,239
He has eaten anything and craves Korean food.

1683
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,679
I really want some budae stew right now.

1684
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,779
- Really?
- Yes.

1685
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,249
Is there a reason? Is it because of the soup?

1686
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,019
I really want some red soup right now.

1687
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,889
But if I am to choose from these two,

1688
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:38,949
I will go for budae stew.

1689
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,419
- That's your choice?
- Right.

1690
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,090
Why are things feeling strange again?

1691
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,989
My gosh!

1692
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:47,259
- That's just deliberate.
- Gosh.

1693
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,859
It would be funny to see him eat pork belly on his own.

1694
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,229
(Will we see him eat meat on his own?)

1695
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,829
- That will never happen.
- No, right?

1696
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,000
- Never.
- Okay.

1697
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,339
What will you choose, Ju Hyun?

1698
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,699
I want to go to the pork belly place.

1699
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,700
The pork belly place?

1700
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:57,969
- Right.
- Why?

1701
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,340
I think pork belly will be better for my weight.

1702
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,840
- Pork fat is good for you.
- Right.

1703
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,149
I've made my decision.

1704
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,350
- Where will you go?
- Namyeong-dong?

1705
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,349
- We're in Namyeong-dong right now.
- Namyeong-dong.

1706
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,350
When will I get a chance to go to that restaurant?

1707
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,720
I'll go with pork belly.

1708
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,419
- You'll go with pork belly? Okay.
- Right.

1709
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,959
I'll go with pork belly. That's it.

1710
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,659
So many of us are having pork belly.

1711
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,629
- Isn't it just him?
- It's just Sang Uk and Tae Hyun?

1712
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,329
I'll go with budae stew and steak then.

1713
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,769
- Budae stew?
- Well, I like that too.

1714
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,040
I've never been to the budae stew and steak place.

1715
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,769
Then don't say this.

1716
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,270
Don't say, "I've made the wrong decision."

1717
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,239
When I get there?

1718
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,139
- He can say that.
- I always say that.

1719
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,279
- I always say that.
- He can't control himself.

1720
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,449
- He says it automatically.
- It can't be helped.

1721
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,689
Him saying that proves that the food is great.

1722
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,990
It always happens.

1723
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,659
- All right then.
- Then...

1724
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,889
For the budae stew,

1725
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,589
it will be Dong Hyun, Tae Hyun, and Sang Uk.

1726
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,290
Seung Ho, Ju Hyun, Hoon,

1727
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,530
and I will go for pork belly.

1728
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,730
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1729
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:56,829
Let's head to the pork belly place.

1730
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,000
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1731
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,630
So this place is a famous place.

(It's the season when the sun sets later.)

1738
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,789
(They walk through the Food Street...)

1739
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:18,790
(toward the first DMR place.)

1740
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,019
- Here.
- Look at this.

1741
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,089
(Look at this.)

1742
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,660
I love the atmosphere here.

1743
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,730
I think the places we go to always have great atmospheres.

1744
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,400
There are so many restaurants.

1745
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,799
(At the alley with great vibes, )

1746
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,829
It's so pretty.

1747
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:31,969
There are so many places that have a great vibe.

1748
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,099
Right.

1749
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,170
(people are enjoying a relaxed time.)

1750
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,969
- It's this place.
- Right.

1751
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,999
This is it.

1752
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,640
Check this out. He's working on the charcoal.

1753
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,539
This was where the smell was from.

1754
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,010
- Gosh, it smells amazing.
- I should've chosen this place.

1755
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,679
(Regretting very quickly)

1756
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,049
- Dong Hyun...
- Right.

1757
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,550
Failed right away.

1758
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,079
- He regretted his decision again?
- Right.

1759
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,450
Look here.

1760
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,989
I should've chosen this place.

1761
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,990
- Gosh.
- Check this out.

1762
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,659
"Paused for a while for too many people waiting."

1763
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,959
(Paused for a while for too many people waiting)

1764
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,560
This is a really good restaurant.

1765
00:58:58,730 --> 00:58:59,730
- Gosh.
- Look at this.

1766
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:01,599
There are this many people waiting in general.

1767
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,829
Right now? These are the people waiting?

1768
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:04,929
These are the reservations.

1769
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,299
- My gosh.
- Look at this.

1770
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,540
How many stovepipes are there?

1771
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,709
(The stovepipes fill up the roof wildly.)

1772
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,310
The charcoal is of great quality. It makes the food really good.

1773
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,979
Check out the charcoal.

1774
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,650
- It's written on the box.
- You can smell the charcoal fire.

1775
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,280
Shall we go inside? This is the entrance.

1776
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,250
(Charcoal)

1777
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:31,560
(Pork)

1778
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,159
(A place where you can really feel these two)

1779
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,569
(Choiza)

1780
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:42,000
(Sung Si Kyung)

1781
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,570
(A place chosen by many foodies)

1782
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:50,340
(DMR 1, pork belly)

1783
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,149
The ones that are eating...

1784
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,579
- must be sitting here.
- Right.

1785
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,949
- The ones eating are here.
- The ones eating are here.

1786
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,179
You're eating here, right?

1787
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,790
- You can't cross the line.
- Okay. Gosh, it must be good.

1788
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:00,960
I made the wrong decision.

1789
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,060
As expected.

1790
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,259
Why did I change my mind? Why did I feel bad for them?

1791
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,190
Should we ask the owner here?

1792
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,900
- The owner.
- Sir?

1793
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,470
Hello. Please come this way.

1794
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,470
How long has this place been around?

1795
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:16,669
This place started since 1985.

1796
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,869
- What?
- What?

1797
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,180
My grandfather ran this place first.

1798
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,010
- My father is the current owner.
- He's the owner?

1799
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,379
I see.

1800
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,149
- Then he's the third generation.
- He's the owner too then.

1801
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,420
Right.

1802
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,620
Sir,

1803
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:33,119
how is the waiting system...

1804
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,220
usually run for this place?

1805
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,489
We usually open at 4pm.

1806
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,430
Reservations are over after around an hour or an hour and a half.

1807
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,830
- It's over after that?
- Right.

1808
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,730
Please enter.

1809
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:48,900
(As soon as it is opened, )

1810
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,639
(the restaurant is filled.)

1811
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,769
(The current time during the shoot)

1812
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,739
It's over for our waiting list.

1813
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,310
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

1814
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,449
What? No way!

1815
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,680
Reservations are over?

1816
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,420
Can we...

1817
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,549
Today's waiting list is finished.

1818
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,150
- Today? Already?
- Yes.

1819
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,760
- I see.
- Right.

1820
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,960
(Customers came endlessly even after reservations were over.)

1821
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,460
(Walking away)

1822
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,769
Is there something different about the meat here...

1823
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,670
- for many customers to come here?
- Is there something different?

1824
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,009
I believe the charcoal is a key point to our meat.

1825
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,539
- The charcoal.
- The meat and the charcoal...

1826
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,979
- are kept really close.
- Right.

1827
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,880
That's the difference between other places.

1828
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,820
We signed with different farms based on each season.

1829
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,019
That is where our meat comes from.

1830
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,349
- Based on each season?
- I see.

1831
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,419
What is the reason for signing with different farms...

1832
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,449
based on each season?

1833
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,059
Pigs are usually struggle a lot against heat.

1834
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,260
- Right.
- So when summer comes,

1835
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,590
we bring our meat from the northern part of Gyeonggi.

1836
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,860
When it's winter, we bring our meat from the lower areas of Chungcheong.

1837
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,869
That is why it's different here.

1838
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,169
- The meat is brought...
- They're serious about meat.

1839
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,499
- based on each season.
- Right.

1840
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,099
Just that fact means...

1841
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,169
- Our representative cuts...
- The pork neck?

1842
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,769
Are the pork neck and top loin.

1843
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,879
Let's go with them then.

1844
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,879
We'll have two portions of pork neck and top loin each...

1845
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,179
as they are the representative cuts here.

1846
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,579
- We'll have two portions each.
- Right.

1847
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,019
- We'll order those.
- Just for now.

1848
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,180
- We'll order those first.
- Right.

1849
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,850
- It's special.
- Gosh.

1850
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,150
What is that?

1851
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,590
- It already looks different.
- The individual dishes.

1852
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,620
- What?
- These are the sauces.

1853
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,159
- Gosh.
- There are salted clams?

1854
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,189
They must have developed this sauce.

1855
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,629
- These must be salted clams.
- There's a salted dish.

1856
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,859
Could you explain to us the sauces?

1857
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,870
Right.

1858
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,500
- This is the sea salt we use.
- Sea salt.

1859
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,069
To the left is the fresh wasabi.

1860
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,440
- Then there's the ssamjang.
- Ssamjang.

1861
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,939
These are salted clams.

1862
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,940
- Salted clams.
- Salted clams.

1863
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:34,109
They were made with Manila clams.

1864
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,279
- Manila clams.
- Manila clams.

1865
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,509
They would taste great...

1866
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,780
- just with some rice.
- Tell me about it.

1867
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,610
I do feel hungry.

1868
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,279
- I'll show you what a big eater is.
- I should've gone with this.

1869
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,920
- Really?
- I can eat pork belly endlessly.

1870
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,990
Hoon just said this.

1871
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,159
He said he could eat pork belly endlessly,

1872
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,020
so he'd show everyone what a big eater was.

1873
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:53,290
Gosh, I should've gone with this.

1874
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,230
It must be really good.

1875
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,270
(After the side dishes were served...)

1876
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,530
This looks good too, right?

1877
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,800
It does look good. Try a piece of it first.

1878
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:04,609
Feel the heat.

1879
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,039
- Gosh.
- It's placed like this?

1880
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,469
If it's placed like this...

1881
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:10,209
How does the grill go on top?

1882
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,249
I'm curious too.

1883
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,749
How will the meat be grilled?

1884
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,820
He mentioned it earlier that the meat and charcoal are close.

1885
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,419
- What?
- Just like that?

1886
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,550
- It's placed just like that.
- Like that?

1887
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,190
It's placed like that right away.

1888
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,589
Just like that?

1889
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,590
(Fascinated)

1890
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,990
I will start with the top loin first.

1891
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,230
Is there a reason for starting with the top loin first?

1892
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,299
The pork neck...

1893
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,530
- has more fat.
- Right.

1894
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,700
It's to keep the stronger taste for later.

1895
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,670
Which part exactly is the top loin?

1896
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,940
It's also called the oyster blade.

1897
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,669
Stop asking him things when he's trying to grill the meat.

1898
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:40,940
- Oh, right.
- Right.

1899
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,539
- I'll start grilling the meat.
- My bad.

1900
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,980
(Let's taste the meat to find out.)

1901
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,050
(The meat finally gets to be placed on the grill.)

1902
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:53,650
(The first meat, top loin)

1903
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,029
It's really close to the charcoal, isn't it?

1904
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,089
It's very close.

1905
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:02,800
(The meat is almost touching the charcoal.)

1906
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,869
Who came up with the idea to keep it very close...

1907
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,069
to the charcoal?

1908
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,240
My father kept doing his research.

1909
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:13,940
He realized that the meat should be as close to the fire.

1910
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,610
He did a lot of research.

1911
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:21,180
I believe this to be a great expression of confidence.

1912
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,920
The meat has to be grilled with great care.

1913
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,619
This is like he's tickling the meat.

1914
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:30,460
You can tell he has the skills of an expert as he grills the meat.

1915
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,360
He keeps moving them around while checking on them.

1916
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,500
(The juice gets kept inside with great care.)

1917
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,700
(The meat is then cut into bite-sized pieces.)

1918
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,340
I think it will taste amazing.

1919
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,070
- Gosh.
- Check out the cutting sound.

1920
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,640
- The scissors are sharp.
- It's snipped nicely.

1921
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,279
You must need a lot of practice to do that.

1922
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,779
This is why I think it will taste really good.

1923
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,009
The smoke covers the meat as it goes up.

1924
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,279
- Right.
- Does that make it taste better?

1925
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,519
It will smoke up the meat really well.

1926
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,320
(The meat naturally gets smoked from the charcoal.)

1927
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,589
It's ready. You can eat it now.

1928
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,089
- Give it a try, Ju Hyun.
- Gosh!

1929
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,189
Gosh, that looks good.

1930
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,700
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

1931
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,659
Ju Hyun must feel great.

1932
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,830
My mouth is watering.

1933
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,100
- Gosh.
- That looks amazing.

1934
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,500
- That's too much wasabi.
- No.

1935
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,909
I'm dying.

1936
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,779
(It's hot.)

1937
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,809
How is it?

1938
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:27,049
(Hoon takes a bite as well.)

1939
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,119
I'm dying.

1940
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,550
(Frowning)

1941
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,120
How is it?

1942
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,249
(Tasting the meat)

1943
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,060
How is it?

1944
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,560
It's so good!

1945
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,989
The scent of charcoal is really strong.

1946
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:41,059
- It's really strong.
- The scent of charcoal is insane.

1947
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,600
- It's really tender.
- It can't avoid the charcoal.

1948
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:46,100
The scent of the charcoal is going wild inside.

1949
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,039
I swallowed the meat, but the scent is still there.

1950
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,240
(The scent of the charcoal fills the mouth.)

1951
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:52,869
It must be so good. What do I do?

1952
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,309
I made a big mistake.

1953
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,380
(Regretting for the 5th time)

1954
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,010
This is so good.

1955
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:03,349
(Picking up the next piece right away)

1956
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,950
But the scent is still there.

1957
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,690
(He frowns again.)

1958
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,429
(Yi Kyung takes a bite after serving the guests first.)

1959
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,530
It must be tried right now.

1960
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,130
(Amazed)

1961
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:21,400
(Seung Ho takes a bite too.)

1962
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:25,210
(Touched)

1963
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,940
- Gosh, it's so good.
- Thank you.

1964
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,809
I think this is the best pork belly I've ever had.

1965
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,710
- Really?
- Yes.

1966
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,350
(He takes another bite while talking.)

1967
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,249
This isn't just a decision I don't regret making.

1968
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,819
I would've been in big trouble if I didn't choose this place.

1969
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,419
(It's a loss if you don't try the meat here.)

1970
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,320
This will go in endlessly.

1971
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,730
- I've already been here before.
- Two portions are gone already?

1972
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,530
- No. There's more meat.
- That was two portions?

1973
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,570
There shouldn't be a break in between.

1974
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,169
I've seen a lot of those.

1975
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,239
Check out the color of the pork neck.

1976
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,870
I've never seen such thick cuts.

1977
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,740
But that cut has more fat than what we just had.

1978
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,609
- It's so good.
- Is it not hot?

1979
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,810
- Is it not hot?
- I'm fine.

1980
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,580
- The grill is changed right away?
- Yes.

1981
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:07,949
- What?
- What?

1982
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,079
Hold on! What?

1983
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,179
- What?
- New charcoal is used?

1984
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,919
- Why?
- Yes.

1985
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,120
Is it because it has become weak?

1986
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,820
Is the grill changed after getting used once?

1987
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,260
My father said that the charcoal was the most important.

1988
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,460
He told me to be generous with the charcoal.

1989
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,929
"The charcoal is the most important. Be generous with it."

1990
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,369
He's keeping his original intention.

1991
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,899
This cut is the pork neck.

1992
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,700
(The next cut gets placed on the generous amount of charcoal.)

1993
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,519
(Second meat, pork neck)

1994
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,649
Shouldn't we order more while the pork neck is grilled?

1995
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,090
- Please.
- Yes.

1996
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,059
If we want to eat...

1997
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,320
a lot of meat,

1998
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,089
the fatty cuts should be saved...

1999
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,260
for later.

2000
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,670
Isn't it over if you eat pork neck?

2001
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,029
- What?
- What are you talking about?

2002
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,200
- Pork neck...
- "What are you talking about?"

2003
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,900
I mean...

2004
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,069
- It's a fatty cut.
- I think...

2005
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:08,179
he suppressed himself since Ju Hyun was older.

2006
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,240
(Laughing)

2007
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,050
- Pork neck is the fattiest.
- That's right.

2008
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,209
- Once you eat it, it's over.
- I see.

2009
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,619
- So you aren't done eating.
- No.

2010
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,179
Although we had met for the first time today,

2011
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,520
I almost told you not to cross the line.

2012
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,019
I almost spoke harshly.

2013
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,319
(Intimidated)

2014
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,420
It was scary.

2015
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,720
Firstly, I think...

2016
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,659
- we can order more top loin.
- Then...

2017
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,529
we should've had three more servings of top loin before this one.

2018
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,929
- No. After this one, - That's right.

2019
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,499
We'll put pork neck at the end and decide...

2020
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,299
- what will come in the middle.
- The middle.

2021
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,340
It could be pork belly or more top loin.

2022
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,239
Shall the order be top loin, pork belly, and pork neck?

2023
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

2024
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,710
It'll be delicious.

2025
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,340
It'll be delicious.

2026
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,610
Top loin.

2027
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,150
- This is insane.
- After top loin...

2028
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:49,819
(He checks if he can erase it well.)

2029
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,950
Perfect.

2030
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,950
Let's write it down. Here.

2031
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,250
They added top loin.

2032
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:58,290
That's right. They added top loin.

2033
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,430
- Top loin, pork neck...
- They had the charcoal.

2034
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,899
After this cut, they got new charcoal.

2035
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,229
- Charcoal.
- They got new charcoal.

2036
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:08,029
They added pork neck.

2037
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,069
(Pork neck)

2038
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,769
It'll go in between. The last cut will be...

2039
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,140
somewhere here.

2040
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,710
It's expected to be pork neck.

2041
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,579
- No.
- Will the charcoal...

2042
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,409
- No.
- What? Is it wrong?

2043
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,410
- Two servings?
- As for top loin,

2044
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,580
we'll have three servings.

2045
01:09:21,581 --> 01:09:23,219
Then this one is undecided.

2046
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,549
I wrote a question mark.

2047
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,920
It's a question mark.

2048
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,219
Between these two cuts,

2049
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,660
they might have top loin...

2050
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,559
or pork belly.

2051
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,830
We'll see about that.

2052
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,430
(Now, 2 servings of pork neck Next, 3 servings of top loin)

2053
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,700
(Meanwhile, the pork neck is done.)

2054
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,939
- Hurry up and eat.
- Hurry up and eat.

2055
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,270
- Go ahead.
- Hurry up and eat.

2056
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:50,540
(It's time to enjoy pork neck.)

2057
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,550
(He furrows his brows again.)

2058
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,650
(Taking 1 bite and furrowing his brows 2 times)

2059
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,920
(Impressed)

2060
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,959
(He quietly takes another bite.)

2061
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,889
It's a basic cut. Here comes the pork neck.

2062
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,600
(Kang Hoon eats well despite keeping quiet.)

2063
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:13,570
(Seung Ho just eats well.)

2064
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,240
Pork neck!

2065
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,840
(Yi Kyung enjoys a piece like a eating show YouTuber.)

2066
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,139
It's so nice.

2067
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,879
(Chewing)

2068
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,879
(He suddenly gives an ASMR show.)

2069
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,210
It sounded like I had a frog chirping in my mouth.

2070
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,779
The texture is insane.

2071
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,280
(The texture is insane.)

2072
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:38,290
(The firm texture is the charm of pork neck.)

2073
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:43,830
(Ju Hyun enjoys the texture right away.)

2074
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,670
The pork neck is...

2075
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,569
so firm.

2076
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,239
- It sounds delicious.
- So firm.

2077
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,939
Please reply to her.

2078
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,940
- It sounds delicious.
- He refuses to look.

2079
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,879
It sounds delicious.

2080
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,650
Not many places serve such thick pieces of pork neck.

2081
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,719
It isn't as fatty as the ones you get in other restaurants.

2082
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,320
Yes. The texture must be insane.

2083
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,250
I see why pork neck is the signature menu.

2084
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:08,090
Pork neck is the signature menu.

2085
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,089
Shall we solve a quiz then?

2086
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,990
- No.
- It's about time for a quiz.

2087
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,389
- Sang Uk?
- Yes?

2088
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,489
(Sang Uk?)

2089
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,630
Wait.

2090
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,430
Please eat it with salted clams.

2091
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,829
- I like salted clams.
- You're eating it well.

2092
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,430
You're putting them together.

2093
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,100
It's almost a wrap.

2094
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,769
Here!

2095
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,740
(Here! Open wide.)

2096
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:29,309
- Will you really give it to me?
- Yes.

2097
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,679
Gosh, Chief gets...

2098
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,010
(Of course not.)

2099
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:33,680
Gosh, Chief gets...

2100
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,250
(Chuckling)

2101
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,120
(My goodness)

2102
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,350
Tae Hyun said, "Chief gets a special treatment."

2103
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,119
- It's so tasty.
- Dong Hyun is suffering...

2104
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,590
in many ways.

2105
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,229
Ju Hyun knows...

2106
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,489
- how to make fun of her chief.
- He opened his mouth so wide.

2107
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:47,829
Dong Hyun is well-known...

2108
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,159
for not touching gloves.

2109
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,459
- I got knocked out.
- Just now,

2110
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,069
- he went along with it.
- He almost threw a punch.

2111
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,769
(Meanwhile, they finish eating pork neck.)

2112
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,839
Thank you.

2113
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,269
Please grill all of the meat at once.

2114
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,669
(3 more servings of top loin appear.)

2115
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,509
Let's order the next one right away.

2116
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,539
Okay.

2117
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,880
- Which one...
- Shall we order pork belly?

2118
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,480
Will you order pork belly?

2119
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,649
- What should we do?
- I'm curious about pork belly.

2120
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,880
We should try the most basic cut.

2121
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,979
- Two servings of pork belly.
- Two servings of pork belly.

2122
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,250
They ordered two servings of pork belly.

2123
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,160
Two servings of pork belly. My goodness.

2124
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,820
Gosh, this is...

2125
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,529
the match of the century.

2126
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,530
(Now, 3 servings of top loin Next, 2 servings of pork belly)

2127
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,929
I seriously hope...

2128
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,769
- you'll get the quiz right...
- Yes.

2129
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,229
- and try the meat.
- Seriously.

2130
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:28,440
- Please.
- Shall we move on to the quiz?

2131
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,869
In that case,

2132
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,039
- grilling will take some time.
- He looks so desperate.

2133
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,439
The three of you should play a game.

2134
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,639
- That sounds nice.
- That sounds nice.

2135
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,210
- For a freeloading chance.
- Two pieces.

2136
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,479
- We love that idea.
- It's nice, right?

2137
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,179
- That's incredible.
- One piece won't be enough.

2138
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,649
- We love that idea.
- I agree. It'll be too cruel.

2139
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,019
Shall we play a game?

2140
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,280
I'm down with anything.

2141
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,350
Flick a paper cup from here.

2142
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,819
If it falls off, you're out.

2143
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,890
- The closest one to the line.
- Okay.

2144
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,159
You can take out...

2145
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,230
- another person's cup.
- Of course.

2146
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,260
Will Sang Uk go first?

2147
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,699
(Pretty close)

2148
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,870
I should've sent it to the camera so that no one could take it out.

2149
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,109
- Should I hit his cup?
- You could do that.

2150
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,710
If it's the closest to the edge, you'll win.

2151
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,140
(Pushing)

2152
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,509
(It isn't even close.)

2153
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,980
It worked well when I did it earlier.

2154
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,050
(Player 3, Kim Dong Hyun)

2155
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,749
(He aims for Sang Uk's cup.)

2156
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,850
(Aiming carefully)

2157
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,760
- Bye.
- Oh, no!

2158
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,690
(Flying off)

2159
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,660
(Bye, everyone.)

2160
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,429
Weren't you aiming for my cup so obviously?

2161
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:32,529
You were so greedy.

2162
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,729
- Sang Uk, enjoy the first piece.
- Which side dish...

2163
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:35,899
Which side dish would you like?

2164
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,439
- Would you like this one?
- I'll eat kimchi.

2165
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,710
- Here's kimchi.
- Kimchi.

2166
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,010
You just came back from Madrid.

2167
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,640
- It looks so tasty.
- It does.

2168
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,110
- Will you give it to me?
- Yes.

2169
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,579
(It's so fun to tease Dong Hyun.)

2170
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,749
It looks so tasty.

2171
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,989
- It's tasty, right?
- Kimchi is so fascinating.

2172
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,090
It's so...

2173
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,919
It's so tender.

2174
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,560
Juice comes out when you chew it.

2175
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,389
(I'm jealous.)

2176
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,390
Sang Uk,

2177
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:01,529
I'll give you a big piece.

2178
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:02,799
(Sang Uk, here's the other piece we promised.)

2179
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,560
The amount of kimchi isn't excessive.

2180
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,770
- You might think that's a lot.
- That's right.

2181
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,070
That's right. This kimchi is so fascinating.

2182
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,709
It must be a delicious bite.

2183
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:13,839
(He makes sure to look at Dong Hyun.)

2184
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,239
Sang Uk is very smug.

2185
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,340
Green onion kimchi is the best.

2186
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,610
- Green onion kimchi?
- Thank goodness we came here.

2187
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,680
Seriously, the meat is...

2188
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,449
- chewy.
- I always make...

2189
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,850
the wrong decision.

2190
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,349
(Top loin disappears quickly as well.)

2191
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,420
Seriously.

2192
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,119
- It's here.
- Meat.

2193
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,689
- Isn't it pork belly?
- Pork belly.

2194
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:33,590
(Now, 2 servings of pork belly)

2195
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,329
- What should be the next cut?
- Well...

2196
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:38,770
- Don't talk to me.
- The taste...

2197
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:40,069
- "Don't talk to me." - "Don't talk to me."

2198
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,129
(She's the type to attack instead of strategizing.)

2199
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,769
- She's so wise.
- Ju Hyun is...

2200
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,699
serious when it comes to meat.

2201
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,770
That's right.

2202
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,470
The noise-cancelling mode came on when more meat got served.

2203
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,509
(While the offensive player destroys pork belly)

2204
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:55,880
Pork belly is so...

2205
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,079
Kang Hoon, shall we order more pork neck?

2206
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,290
Shall we do that?

2207
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,990
- Will you go back to pork neck?
- Sir,

2208
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,219
please give us four servings...

2209
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,390
- of pork neck.
- Four servings!

2210
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,630
They suddenly ordered four servings of pork neck.

2211
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,590
- Four servings of pork neck?
- Four.

2212
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,859
- Thank you.
- Pork neck.

2213
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,929
Two servings.

2214
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,260
It's so tasty.

2215
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,699
I'd wait to eat at this place.

2216
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,700
Pork neck is really tasty.

2217
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,999
- Meat disappears so quickly.
- There's no more.

2218
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,039
It's so tasty.

2219
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,369
Sir, we'd like to order more top loin.

2220
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:21,939
- Weren't you guys done?
- Then top loin will be...

2221
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,279
the last cut. Let's order four servings.

2222
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,479
Please give us four more servings of top loin.

2223
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,579
- What?
- Four servings?

2224
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,809
- Weren't you guys done?
- It'll be the last one.

2225
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,150
- Four servings of top loin.
- Four servings of top loin.

2226
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,419
- This is...
- It'll be the last one.

2227
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,019
- Will you guys eat 16 servings?
- I'm impressed...

2228
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,550
that Kang Hoon is okay with it.

2229
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,150
I'm okay with it.

2230
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,860
The total is 17 servings.

2231
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,730
They're cool. Seriously,

2232
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,689
- I'm honored to be with you guys.
- It's tasty.

2233
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,059
(I'm honored to be with you guys.)

2234
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,000
You guys are incredible.

2235
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,700
I hope they'll coat it and preserve it.

2236
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,069
- "Please give us that order." - If they ask for the menu...

2237
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,099
Perfect.

2238
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,070
- "Handsome Guys were here." - Yes.

2239
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:55,040
I wanted to choose this menu,

2240
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,880
- I brought up pork belly first.
- That's right.

2241
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,150
- We have a suggestion.
- Okay.

2242
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,620
- Listen.
- It's for pork neck.

2243
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,419
The winner will get two pieces.

2244
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,119
- Two pieces of pork neck.
- You need to place first.

2245
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,249
- Seriously, this is...
- I'll tell you...

2246
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,550
which game you'll play,

2247
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,689
- One Syllable 369 Game...
- The 369 Game.

2248
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,060
That starts from 20.

2249
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,160
- All right.
- Okay.

2250
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,160
- Focus.
- I'm confident.

2251
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:16,259
It's mental training.

2252
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,559
The order will be Sang Uk, Dong Hyun, and Tae Hyun.

2253
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,329
- In the reverse order? Okay.
- Yes.

2254
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,369
You start from 20.

2255
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:22,939
- I'm good with this direction.
- Okay.

2256
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:25,070
- Three, six, nine.
- Three, six, nine.

2257
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,369
- Twen.
- Ty.

2258
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,410
One.

2259
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,679
(Twen, ty, twen, ty, one, twen, ty, two)

2260
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,109
(One!)

2261
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:35,750
Twen, ty, twen, ty, one, twen, ty, two.

2262
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,789
- I mean...
- We can't excuse that.

2263
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,249
- No.
- We can't excuse that.

2264
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,360
No way.

2265
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,659
It's so hard when it goes from 20.

2266
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,689
You guys should do it.

2267
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,260
- For 2 pieces.
- It's so hard when it goes from 20.

2268
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,659
Start from 20.

2269
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,030
- Three, six, nine.
- Three, six, nine.

2270
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,699
(Twen, ty, twen, ty, one, )

2271
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,870
(Twen, ty, two)

2272
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,099
They're good.

2273
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:01,940
(Twen, ty, four, twen, ty, fi, Ve, twen, ty, si, x)

2274
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,209
(The match drags on.)

2275
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:09,150
(Twen, ty, ni, ne)

2276
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,880
What's this?

2277
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,889
(From 30 to 39, all syllables are done in claps.)

2278
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,050
What's this?

2279
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:16,260
Are they doing it right?

2280
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,130
Aren't they just clapping?

2281
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,490
How does this make sense?

2282
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,900
How does this make sense?

2283
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,029
Are they doing it right?

2284
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,270
(The insane relay of claps continues on.)

2285
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,400
Are they doing it right?

2286
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,540
- For.
- Sang Uk is right!

2287
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,070
- For.
- Sang Uk is right!

2288
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,609
- What?
- You're right.

2289
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,749
- Sang Uk is right.
- Dong Hyun is wrong.

2290
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,380
- It's "For." - That's right.

2291
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,020
- My goodness.
- I did it correctly.

2292
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:43,649
Sang Uk is incredible.

2293
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,689
- Sang Uk said, "For." - "For."

2294
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,449
You need to stay alert to win.

2295
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,719
In the middle of the game...

2296
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,989
(The world's number 1 fencer has the strongest mentality.)

2297
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,929
In the middle of the game, I got confused...

2298
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,859
and began clapping haphazardly.

2299
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,029
(He just went with the rhythm.)

2300
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:59,469
That's right. I had a feeling that was what you were doing.

2301
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:00,829
- Sang Uk.
- I got confused.

2302
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,240
Nothing is impossible when you're desperate.

2303
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,670
I can't believe it.

2304
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,299
Sang Uk, take two pieces.

2305
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,809
- Thank you for the food.
- The pieces are so big.

2306
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,170
I'll take the two at the end.

2307
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,579
(My goodness)

2308
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,979
- Seriously.
- Two pieces.

2309
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,149
Enjoy the meat.

2310
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,380
Would you give me a piece of green onion kimchi?

2311
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,310
He'll only add green onion kimchi.

2312
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:17,079
(He gets green onion kimchi this time as well.)

2313
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,189
- Thank you, - He loves green onion kimchi.

2314
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,290
You should give him a lot of green onion kimchi.

2315
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,420
How many servings did they eat? Did they eat 20 servings?

2316
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,829
(He had a freeloading chance 2 times in a row.)

2317
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:26,930
My goodness.

2318
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:30,229
- We have the bill.
- Yes.

2319
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,760
It's time to pay.

2320
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,829
My goodness.

2321
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:35,869
My guess is 400 dollars.

2322
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,670
Although they ate so much... Your guess was correct.

2323
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,669
The total is 403 dollars.

2324
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:43,039
(Total: 403 dollars)

2325
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,839
Each member ate 100 dollars' worth of meat.

2326
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,880
It was worth the money.

2327
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,709
For 403 dollars,

2328
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:49,879
let's have a quiz.

2329
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,749
Let's do a cheer.

2330
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,820
Let's get it right.

2331
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,119
"One, two, three, fight on." One, two, three.

2332
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,160
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

2333
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,290
Pork belly or samgyeopsal was called "Three-layer meat" in the past.

2334
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,590
It's an easy one.

2335
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,029
- There he goes again.
- It's about pork belly.

2336
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,629
One of the reasons why "Samgyeopsal" became...

2337
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,940
the common name of the cut...

2338
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:10,939
is thought to come from Kaesong.

2339
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,709
- What?
- It's thought to come from Kaesong.

2340
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,839
Kaesong?

2341
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,679
For the taste of the meat, people of Kaesong...

2342
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,310
fed "Blank" to the pigs.

2343
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:23,479
Thus, the name of the cut became "Samgyeopsal."

2344
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,920
- It's easy.
- What goes in the blank?

2345
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,190
We need to think hard.

2346
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:30,360
Is it an easy question?

2347
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,359
Is it a twisted one?

2348
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,560
(It seems like Seung Ho has an answer in mind.)

2349
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:35,959
(Oh, my!)

2350
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,229
- No way.
- What is it?

2351
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,230
What?

2352
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,929
Isn't it ginseng since it's called "Sam?"

2353
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:42,670
(They think of a plausible answer.)

2354
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,199
What do you think it is?

2355
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,569
- Ginseng since it's called "Sam." - Same here.

2356
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:46,810
- My guess was ginseng.
- Same here.

2357
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,369
Ginseng or wild ginseng.

2358
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,910
- Ginseng.
- No way.

2359
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:52,310
It can't be the answer you can think of in one second.

2360
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,450
- Will it be that easy?
- Is there no bone?

2361
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,620
What should we do?

2362
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,250
- Shall we give it a go?
- I can't think of anything else.

2363
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,090
That's right, Yi Kyung.

2364
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,719
If ginseng turns out to be incorrect,

2365
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,860
we'll have the least amount of regret.

2366
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,629
- If we give another answer...
- That's right.

2367
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,229
- and it turns out to be ginseng, - It'll drive us mad.

2368
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,130
We'll dream about it tonight.

2369
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,929
- Ju Hyun, go ahead.
- Let me answer.

2370
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:13,730
- Okay.
- Ginseng.

2371
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,170
- Ginseng.
- Six, nine.

2372
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,500
I don't think it's correct.

2373
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,770
It must be correct.

2374
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,339
- It can't be.
- I think it's correct.

2375
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,639
If ginseng is correct, I'll say that the question is...

2376
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,910
- It's too easy.
- It's too simple.

2377
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,150
- No way.
- I think it's correct.

2378
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,749
- There's no other possible answer.
- It'll be nice if it's correct.

2379
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,750
It's correct.

2380
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:35,020
Is it really correct?

2381
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,459
- I mean...
- There was no other choice.

2382
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,129
- This is incredible.
- Simple is the best.

2383
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,990
- It was the only choice.
- Thank you for the food.

2384
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,860
- Was it a trick question?
- Was there no twist?

2385
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,759
For 400 dollars,

2386
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,069
- you'll need to solve a quiz.
- That's right.

2387
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:47,270
- Shall we begin?
- A 400-dollar quiz.

2388
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,040
For the first time in a long while, it's a big bill.

2389
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:50,870
Sang Uk won't pay right after coming back, right?

2390
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,009
I think Dong Hyun will pay today.

2391
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,540
Dong Hyun isn't very lucky today.

2392
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,709
- The three members.
- Don't say that.

2393
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,709
- I'm okay with paying.
- That's right.

2394
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:01,080
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Will we take turns?

2395
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,749
- It must be an easy one.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2396
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,820
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2397
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,150
Rock-paper-scissors.

2398
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,090
You never know.

2399
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,089
One of the cuts of pork...

2400
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,029
that are sold in this restaurant is top loin.

2401
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,429
I have no idea.

2402
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,600
- Top loin.
- It has many names.

2403
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,470
From the following, choose the correct name for top loin.

2404
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,640
Which one will it be?

2405
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:26,640
Number one, king meat.

2406
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:29,179
- It's king meat.
- I have no idea.

2407
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,809
Number two, loin layer meat.

2408
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:32,479
- It's that one.
- It's loin layer meat.

2409
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,779
It comes from loin.

2410
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,380
It's "Gabri" in English.

2411
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,580
Number three, chewy meat.

2412
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:39,120
Chewy meat! Dong Hyun, it's chewy meat.

2413
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:41,420
- It's "Gabri" in English.
- I don't think it's that one.

2414
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,259
- Chewy meat.
- Isn't there another name?

2415
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,060
- This is...
- This one is harder.

2416
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:48,129
Seung Ho asked about the cut earlier.

2417
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,799
- I should've listened.
- What did he say?

2418
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,359
Can I share what I heard earlier?

2419
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,600
It's up to you.

2420
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:54,169
Seung Ho asked, "Where does this cut come from?"

2421
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,869
He said that it came from loin.

2422
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,439
- Loin.
- It's a part of the loin.

2423
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,409
- A part of the loin.
- It's a part of the loin,

2424
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:01,610
so I'll go with the loin layer meat.

2425
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,279
- Number two, loin layer meat.
- This is hard.

2426
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,750
- I don't know about this one.
- Another name for top loin.

2427
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,649
- All right.
- It's correct.

2428
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:10,120
Did you tell me right away?

2429
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:13,820
(Dong Hyun is exempt.)

2430
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:15,090
It's his first time getting exempt today.

2431
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,759
- Seriously.
- He's exempt.

2432
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
He put an end to his bad luck.

2433
01:22:18,761 --> 01:22:20,559
You told me right away. I thought I had to wait.

2434
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,959
So we're left with chewy meat and king meat.

2435
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,600
- Now, you never know.
- Chewy meat and king meat.

2436
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,670
Isn't chewy meat a different cut?

2437
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:28,699
I feel like...

2438
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,539
- Both are possible.
- I feel like it's king meat.

2439
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,769
You never know.

2440
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:33,969
Is it because you're thinking about Gabriel?

2441
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:36,009
Why is it called "Gabrisal" in Korean?

2442
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,839
- Gabriel.
- I feel like top loin...

2443
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,009
I think I know that situation I'm in.

2444
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:41,079
What is it?

2445
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,249
- I had a very bad hunch.
- What?

2446
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,349
Do you want to pay?

2447
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,789
Sang Uk, what do you think it is?

2448
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,089
- Tae Hyun will let you go first.
- King meat.

2449
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,620
- You too?
- King meat.

2450
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,519
(You too?)

2451
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,360
I feel like chewy meat is a name for a different cut.

2452
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:55,699
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

2453
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,759
In that case, I'll go with king meat.

2454
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,100
- Sang Uk will go with chewy meat.
- Chewy meat.

2455
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,869
King meat as another name for top loin?

2456
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:06,739
(Number 1, king meat Number 2, chewy meat)

2457
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,740
Correct.

2458
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:12,380
- Hey, you...
- You should've chosen it.

2459
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,809
You were so close, Sang Uk.

2460
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:15,819
(Grabbing)

2461
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,979
We left some meat, Sang Uk.

2462
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,179
Eat the meat on this side.

2463
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,750
- Eat the meat on this side.
- He's eating since he's paying.

2464
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,950
Gosh.

2465
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:22,859
(I'm paying for this.)

2466
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,590
Why? Why is it called king meat?

2467
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,530
Which cut chewy meat?

2468
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:29,729
The back of the pig's head is called chewy meat.

2469
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:30,799
- That makes sense.
- Yes.

2470
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,570
(Eating)

2471
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:35,029
(Dejected)

2472
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,200
We really enjoyed the food.

2473
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,039
Sang Uk, thank you for the food.

2474
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,410
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2475
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:42,110
Let's go to the budae stew restaurant.

2476
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,639
- I'm so full.
- The total is 403 dollars.

2477
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,909
(To celebrate his return, he pays 400 dollars.)

2478
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,879
Here you go. Thank you.

2479
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,420
(To celebrate his return, he pays 400 dollars.)

2480
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,950
(Shall we go and eat DMR 2, budae stew?)

2481
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,259
Isn't the atmosphere nice?

2482
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,329
- The weather is so nice.
- The weather.

2483
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:02,630
- The weather.
- It's so cool and nice.

2484
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,059
- I don't want it to get hotter.
- There is one.

2485
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,499
It has been a while...

2486
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,540
since I walked down a street like this one.

2487
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,179
(What's the next dinner menu they're excited about?)

2488
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:18,639
Every restaurant has so many customers.

2489
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,709
- It's this way.
- It specializes in steak...

2490
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,749
and budae stew.

2491
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,750
It must be over there.

2492
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:23,620
- It must be this one.
- Every place sells steak.

2493
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,320
- It's the Steak Street.
- Really?

2494
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,649
(Steak)

2495
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:34,859
(Steak and budae stew places stand out.)

2496
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,329
(Steakhouse)

2497
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,959
Hold on. A 50-year-old restaurant that sells steak.

2498
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,069
- It's this one.
- It's this one.

2499
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,269
(They arrive at today's DMR restaurant.)

2500
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:43,439
- If it goes back 50 years...
- Today...

2501
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,639
- What? He was here.
- The owner is a hairy man.

2502
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,740
Hur Young Man has been to this restaurant.

2503
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,309
The owner is so hairy.

2504
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:52,449
(Feeling very curious, they enter the restaurant!)

2505
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:54,510
- Is he inside?
- Hello.

2506
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:57,120
(The moment you enter the restaurant, )

2507
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:03,860
(you can feel the American vibe in the nooks and crannies.)

2508
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:08,389
(Tastes of the past come alive on the grill.)

2509
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:11,429
(The heartwarming and spicy taste has been preserved...)

2510
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,870
(for half a century!)

2511
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:18,640
(DMR 2, budae stew and steak)

2512
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,170
I mean, the owner... Look here. Look at the autographs.

2513
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:23,879
Many people visited the place.

2514
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,079
(There are so many autographs.)

2515
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,350
Many people visited the place.

2516
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,719
Tae Hyun, there is Hong Kyung Min's autograph.

2517
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,050
There is Hong Kyung Min's autograph.

2518
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:33,649
- Here it is.
- It's Kyung Min's autograph.

2519
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,650
(Tae Hyun's friend, Kyung Min's autograph)

2520
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,119
- Lee Ki Hae.
- Lee Ki Hae.

2521
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,120
An Jae Mo.

2522
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:38,820
Do Ji Won.

2523
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:41,589
- It's from 1998. No way.
- My goodness.

2524
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,099
(There are many traces of celebrities.)

2525
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,229
- It's history.
- Yes.

2526
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,370
It's from nearly 30 years ago.

2527
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,400
Is the hairy owner here?

2528
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,770
- Sir.
- Welcome.

2529
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,080
- What would you like?
- Ma'am.

2530
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,909
Who is the hairy man in the photo?

2531
01:25:58,910 --> 01:25:59,910
He's my husband.

2532
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:02,649
Did he go home?

2533
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,219
- He's home. He's old.
- I see.

2534
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,289
(You came again today. Thank you.)

2535
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,149
(I'm absent.)

2536
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:12,559
It's fascinating that this is a street for budae stew and steak.

2537
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,760
- Is it because of the US army base?
- Yes.

2538
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,229
- Back in the day, - The US army base.

2539
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,900
There were over 30 such restaurants.

2540
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,800
- Budae stew restaurants.
- Many of them disappeared.

2541
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:28,710
(Right next to the Steak Street of Namyeong-dong)

2542
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,640
(US government property, no trespassing)

2543
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:35,580
(Back in the 1960s, the US army base was situated in Yongsan.)

2544
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,980
(Foreign ingredients entered naturally.)

2545
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:43,089
(As nearby restaurants began to use them, )

2546
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:46,830
(the Budae Stew and Steak Street was formed.)

2547
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,389
A lot of ham came from the army base.

2548
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:49,399
(That was the reason.)

2549
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,600
Thus came the budae stew.

2550
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,169
Has the restaurant stayed here for 50 years?

2551
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:54,470
Yes, it has.

2552
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,670
- It opened in 1968.
- Yes.

2553
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:06,379
(The restaurant has been running since the 1960s.)

2554
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:09,379
The three of us will eat.

2555
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,450
What should we order?

2556
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,449
Large-sized steak and two servings of stew.

2557
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:15,749
- Two servings of stew?
- Three servings?

2558
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,420
Those two eat a lot.

2559
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:19,629
- Then go with three servings.
- Three servings?

2560
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,959
Three servings of stew and large-sized steak.

2561
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,159
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

2562
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,500
- That'll be our order.
- Okay.

2563
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,360
This place is charismatic.

2564
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,699
(Also)

2565
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,700
(Glancing over)

2566
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,370
(Glancing over)

2567
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,740
(Something has caught Dong Hyun's eyes.)

2568
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,479
(She cooks steak on the spot.)

2569
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,810
No way! It's actual steak.

2570
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,109
What? It's the kind of steak...

2571
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:43,479
we usually grill.

2572
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,549
Where?

2573
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,649
- It isn't what we imagined.
- No.

2574
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,249
I thought the dish would contain seasoned meat and ham.

2575
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,960
- But it's a chunk of meat.
- She sliced it.

2576
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:54,159
(It isn't chopped steak that gets stir-fried!)

2577
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,530
(Thick, cubed steak)

2578
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:03,040
(Firm sausages)

2579
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:07,840
(Then three types of ham get added!)

2580
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:11,080
(They get plated nicely.)

2581
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,610
(Then they go on top of the aluminum foil.)

2582
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,120
(They're ready to be grilled.)

2583
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,749
(It catches their attention.)

2584
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,690
- You know, - Seasoning.

2585
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:24,319
We grill thinly-sliced pork belly on aluminum foil.

2586
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,259
- She's using aluminum foil.
- With vegetables.

2587
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:27,689
(Laser-focused on steak)

2588
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,690
(Sprinkling secret powder)

2589
01:28:28,691 --> 01:28:30,130
- It's cubed steak.
- Yes.

2590
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,700
There's secret powder.

2591
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:35,830
- She works fast.
- I can smell it.

2592
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,409
She's grilling it.

2593
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,509
(The steak gets cooked nicely to satisfy their expectations.)

2594
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,140
It smells like seasoned beef.

2595
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:45,339
I think Dong Hyun will like this.

2596
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:47,110
- I love it.
- It's proper steak.

2597
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,210
Ma'am, is it beef?

2598
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,980
Yes, it's beef. There are five ingredients.

2599
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,450
What are the ingredients?

2600
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:55,719
Steak, sausage, bacon, and ham.

2601
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,619
(Steak, sausage, bacon, ham, and vegetables)

2602
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,029
- It's like budae stew.
- Dong Hyun loves beef.

2603
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:01,790
- Steak.
- Steak.

2604
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,860
It smells so nice.

2605
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,769
What? It's huge!

2606
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:09,229
(The dish finally enters.)

2607
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:10,999
So this is steak.

2608
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,300
I haven't seen it before.

2609
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,240
Start with onion.

2610
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,379
(Gosh, it's tasty.)

2611
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,679
- Tae Hyun.
- Excuse me.

2612
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,410
(Budae stew enters right away.)

2613
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:21,579
- Turn on the stove now.
- Okay.

2614
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:22,950
(He smells the dish amidst confusion.)

2615
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:25,619
(It goes straight into his mouth.)

2616
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,119
(My goodness)

2617
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,120
Even the onion is tasty.

2618
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,560
(Glancing over)

2619
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,230
Let's cook it further and eat it together, please.

2620
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,000
I'm waiting since I like my steak well done.

2621
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,839
(They've already begun.)

2622
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,200
(Humming in approval)

2623
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,539
Now is the time to eat.

2624
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,240
- Sang Uk likes it.
- Right, Sang Uk?

2625
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,339
- Now is the time to eat.
- It's good. It should be eaten now.

2626
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,910
Ham and such...

2627
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,720
(Even the member he believed in, Tae Hyun is eating hurriedly.)

2628
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,949
(Eating a piece of ham)

2629
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:02,420
Let's cook it further and eat it together.

2630
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,390
- Beef doesn't disappoint.
- You know...

2631
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,290
I had pork earlier.

2632
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:11,659
- I remember this from the past.
- Is it a taste in your memories?

2633
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:14,070
It's the sauce for budae stew.

2634
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:15,769
- You know...
- The combination...

2635
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:17,000
(Tae Hyun tries the mixture of hot sauce and mustard.)

2636
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,200
I had pork earlier.

2637
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,009
People who have visited this restaurant for many years...

2638
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:24,609
will miss it because of this sauce.

2639
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:27,780
(The sweet and salty taste of the past)

2640
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,579
(The man who likes his steak well done, )

2641
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,619
(Dong Hyun fidgets with the meat for a while.)

2642
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,620
(He finally takes a bite.)

2643
01:30:33,621 --> 01:30:34,919
- Is it good?
- It's so tasty.

2644
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,989
Gosh, it's nice.

2645
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:37,520
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2646
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,159
Beef doesn't disappoint, right?

2647
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,460
Seriously. The meat is so tender.

2648
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,559
(Hurry up and eat.)

2649
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,600
Also,

2650
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,069
there are sauce, ham, and sausage.

2651
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,370
I like how the flavors come together.

2652
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:57,140
(The flavors of meat upgrade the taste of the dish.)

2653
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,639
Gosh, this is...

2654
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,610
- The eggplant will be tasty.
- Really?

2655
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:03,749
You should eat the beef now.

2656
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,380
- It needs to be cooked further.
- Yes.

2657
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:06,719
The vegetables are so tasty.

2658
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,849
(Thanks to the assistance, they eat with ease.)

2659
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:08,950
It's so tasty.

2660
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,120
- The sauce is so special.
- Can we order more beef?

2661
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,990
(Can we order more beef?)

2662
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:15,190
(Startled)

2663
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,429
Why don't we order more beef?

2664
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:17,630
(Shall we order more beef?)

2665
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,529
- It's so tasty.
- It's a lot.

2666
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:21,599
- It's butter.
- My goodness.

2667
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,470
(An additional serving of beef gets served right away.)

2668
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,270
It's so tasty. I don't know what to do.

2669
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,240
The sauce contains Tabasco.

2670
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,810
The three of them are eating well.

2671
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,809
This is the taste Tae Hyun likes.

2672
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:35,409
(Even the picky eater takes a big bite.)

2673
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:39,790
(I love meat.)

2674
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:41,789
Sang Uk, I know that you weren't on a vacation, but...

2675
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,090
Does this alleviate the fatigue from your overseas trip?

2676
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,329
I'll need to eat budae stew first.

2677
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:48,930
- Budae stew.
- You can eat steak abroad.

2678
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,700
- It's so tasty.
- Once I eat budae stew,

2679
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,870
- my fatigue will be gone.
- It's so tasty. What should I do?

2680
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:02,879
(Ham and sausage, gather around in the pot!)

2681
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,679
(Cheese and baked beans infiltrate the pot as allies!)

2682
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,080
(Then the pot gets loaded with ox bone broth!)

2683
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:10,250
(Ignite the fire!)

2684
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:14,790
(The ingredients boil and give off umami.)

2685
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:22,330
(The dish that has half a century of history, budae stew)

2686
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,260
This budae stew seems a bit different.

2687
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:27,799
- Butter.
- Does anyone like...

2688
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,800
their noodles firm?

2689
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:31,739
- What? I like them!
- I love them so much.

2690
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,799
Tae Hyun...

2691
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,209
(What? I like them!)

2692
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,839
He loves noodles Now is the time to eat.

2693
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,840
(Firm noodles, come on.)

2694
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:39,579
The noodles will become soggy if you wait.

2695
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,580
(I want firm noodles as well.)

2696
01:32:40,581 --> 01:32:41,749
That's enough.

2697
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:45,150
When you eat budae stew, you can add noodles endlessly.

2698
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:46,789
(Loading the ramyeon noodles)

2699
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:49,390
(Inhaling the ramyeon noodles)

2700
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,920
- Tae Hyun is obsessed.
- Sang Uk, hurry up and eat.

2701
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,430
The red flavor of Korea.

2702
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,129
Tae Hyun likes pho too.

2703
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,859
(He missed the spicy flavor.)

2704
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,599
- Thank you.
- The red flavor of Korea.

2705
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,800
Seriously, this is the real deal.

2706
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,729
I missed spicy food so much!

2707
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:05,000
(I missed spicy food so much!)

2708
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,139
(Slurping the noodles...)

2709
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,380
(without hesitation)

2710
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:11,910
It's so tasty.

2711
01:33:11,911 --> 01:33:13,250
(Dong Hyun orders a bowl of rice!)

2712
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:17,550
When I ate budae stew for the first time,

2713
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,719
it was at a franchised restaurant.

2714
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,489
It's my first time eating the dish...

2715
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,220
at a restaurant that specializes in it.

2716
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,729
This dish is much milder.

2717
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:28,590
- Yes, it's much milder.
- It's good. I can eat it endlessly.

2718
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:30,629
Sang Uk is eating it properly.

2719
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,300
He's the same.

2720
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,739
- It's a bit...
- It's the taste I like.

2721
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,039
I can't explain.

2722
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,710
I want to focus on eating.

2723
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,639
Those who want to eat...

2724
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,179
(He enjoys the red flavor to his heart's content.)

2725
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,740
His sweat is pouring out.

2726
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,409
(Gosh, it's hot!)

2727
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:47,779
He's sweating...

2728
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,449
- It's hot.
- since he's enjoying the dish.

2729
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,479
(Still, it's tasty.)

2730
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,389
- Look at Sang Uk's sweat.
- He isn't sweating.

2731
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:54,990
Today is the best day for Korean food.

2732
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:56,890
You're eating it properly.

2733
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:59,059
- This is the best.
- It looks delicious.

2734
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,859
- This is the beginning.
- I want to eat.

2735
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:02,059
(They begin to inhale the budae stew in earnest!)

2736
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,859
It's tasty as well.

2737
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:08,070
(They begin to inhale the budae stew in earnest!)

2738
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,339
- That's right.
- This is...

2739
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,870
(Staring)

2740
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:16,140
Aren't the three of you going to talk?

2741
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,040
- Aren't you guys going to talk?
- Are they strangers?

2742
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:21,679
- I mean...
- Please describe...

2743
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,910
- the flavors.
- The thing is...

2744
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:24,879
- I'm obsessed.
- I want a piece of beef.

2745
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,880
Really?

2746
01:34:25,881 --> 01:34:27,550
Can't we have a quiz for the freeloaders?

2747
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,350
I really want to eat.

2748
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,360
- Didn't you guys have dinner?
- Stew is a different matter.

2749
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,229
(Stew is a different matter!)

2750
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:35,429
- Please give us a quiz.
- We want a ladleful of the stew.

2751
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,599
We can do that.

2752
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,929
One person can eat.

2753
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,400
- Let's go.
- Who wants to eat?

2754
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,069
(The 1st raised hand)

2755
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:42,070
(The 2nd raised hand)

2756
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:43,299
(The 3rd raised hand)

2757
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,540
(The 4th raised hand)

2758
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,409
He has a child's tastes.

2759
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,539
(All of them raised their hands.)

2760
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,269
All of them raised their hands.

2761
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,579
(The sinners who had 17 servings of food)

2762
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:51,810
Gosh, this is hard.

2763
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:55,109
- I'll participate in it.
- What's going on?

2764
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,619
Although I destroyed 17 servings of meat,

2765
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,320
I'll participate in the quiz.

2766
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,449
- All right.
- They should decide on the game.

2767
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:01,720
Which game should we play?

2768
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,389
We picked the game earlier.

2769
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,790
Shall we make them play that game?

2770
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,530
- Game of Wits?
- One.

2771
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,130
One.

2772
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:14,229
- But if we play that game...
- Did I do it wrong?

2773
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,769
If we play this game, who will get to eat?

2774
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,439
That's my question as well. Who will get to eat?

2775
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,499
- You're right.
- Who...

2776
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,740
Go ahead and eat. You stood up.

2777
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:22,009
- She stood up.
- So that was the game.

2778
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,509
It was the Game of Wits. She yelled, "One!"

2779
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:24,840
The first one to stand up is the winner.

2780
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,649
One. Okay.

2781
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:28,379
She was the most quick-witted.

2782
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,709
- Seriously.
- I didn't know that.

2783
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:31,649
- I've always been quick-witted.
- Food goes to the one...

2784
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:33,020
who is the most desperate to eat.

2785
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,519
Had two people gotten up at once, they would've been eliminated.

2786
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,459
- Well done.
- I have no wits whatsoever.

2787
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,290
I'm very quick-witted.

2788
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,860
I had no idea.

2789
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:42,329
She was quick.

2790
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:45,399
(She tries the budae stew in the speed of her wits.)

2791
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,529
I have a runny nose.

2792
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:48,269
(She furrows her brows because it's so tasty.)

2793
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:49,470
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

2794
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,969
- Seriously.
- It's very savory.

2795
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:53,910
(She quickly takes another spoonful.)

2796
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,239
It isn't the budae stew I know.

2797
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,509
- I see.
- That's right.

2798
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:00,180
It's so tasty. It's too bad that there are no noodles.

2799
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,950
It isn't spicy. It's savory.

2800
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,449
- You can eat it endlessly.
- I can't handle spicy food,

2801
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,519
but this isn't spicy.

2802
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,890
- It isn't spicy at all.
- The combination is good.

2803
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,219
It was a proper meal.

2804
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:11,919
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

2805
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,789
It passed like a storm.

2806
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,289
It's rare for Tae Hyun to eat with so much gusto.

2807
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:17,729
Shall we ask for the bill?

2808
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,730
The total is so clean.

2809
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,900
I poured out 120 dollars' worth of sweat.

2810
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,199
- Seriously.
- Okay.

2811
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,200
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

2812
01:36:26,201 --> 01:36:27,610
- The question.
- It must be about budae stew.

2813
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:29,710
In Namyeong-dong,

2814
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,350
there is Seongnam Theater that opened in 1941.

2815
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,409
- What?
- In 1941?

2816
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:37,550
It'll be hard.

2817
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:40,190
Back in the day, people painted the signboards for the theater.

2818
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,849
The size of the characters...

2819
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:44,390
were made different in accordance with the importance.

2820
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,419
The colors and atmosphere were adjusted...

2821
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:48,690
to suit the genre of the movie.

2822
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:51,859
For Genre A, intense primary colors...

2823
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,930
such as red were used.

2824
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:57,139
For Genre B, pink colors...

2825
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,040
were used.

2826
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,540
In that case, which movie genres are A and B?

2827
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,410
Do we need to get both of them?

2828
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,380
- You guys have Tae Hyun.
- Isn't it easy?

2829
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:10,149
- It's easy.
- In my opinion,

2830
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:11,850
pink was for romance.

2831
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,220
- Was red for erotica?
- Was it for erotica?

2832
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,689
- Red was for erotica.
- I didn't think of that.

2833
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,520
Aren't romance and erotica similar?

2834
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:20,289
The lines are blurred between erotica and romance.

2835
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:23,600
I think red was for action.

2836
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:25,099
(Shaking his head)

2837
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,800
- No, it was for erotica.
- Red was for erotica.

2838
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,100
Is there a phone chance?

2839
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,829
My dad painted signboards when he was young.

2840
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,299
- Really?
- Really?

2841
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,239
My dad was a painter.

2842
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,339
- Go ahead then.
- Hurry up and call him.

2843
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,969
End the call in 30 seconds...

2844
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,009
- once he picks up the phone.
- In 30 seconds?

2845
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:38,079
- Okay.
- Okay.

2846
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,049
- I'll time it.
- It shouldn't drag on.

2847
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:41,849
- I'll call him.
- Thirty seconds once he picks up.

2848
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:43,079
- Okay?
- Okay. Thirty seconds.

2849
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,849
- Okay. We'll begin once he answers.
- Thirty seconds once he picks up.

2850
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,150
- While his dad...
- He might not know.

2851
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,150
Painted the signboards...

2852
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,660
It's 9:30pm. He goes to bed early.

2853
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:55,430
- My son.
- Dad.

2854
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,730
- Hey.
- Weren't you sleeping?

2855
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,759
- No, I was just lying down.
- Hurry up.

2856
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,169
- Dad, we're...
- Hurry up.

2857
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,000
We're solving a quiz while filming a show.

2858
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:05,069
- Okay.
- When you were young,

2859
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:06,669
you painted signboards for theaters.

2860
01:38:06,670 --> 01:38:07,709
Yes.

2861
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:11,980
The red and pink backgrounds...

2862
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,650
represented genres,

2863
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,509
apparently. Do you know what they were?

2864
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:19,350
Eight, seven, six...

2865
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:20,389
You need to hurry, Dad.

2866
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:22,019
- I used...
- Four,

2867
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,989
- three, two, - red oil paint.

2868
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:25,459
- one.
- Yes. So the genre could be...

2869
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,590
- Time's up!
- teen film.

2870
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,460
It could be romance.

2871
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,330
- Time's up!
- Give me ten more seconds.

2872
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:32,059
Teen film.

2873
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:33,200
- Red?
- Was that what red meant?

2874
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,029
- Red was used...
- Okay.

2875
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:37,599
For teen film.

2876
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,970
How about pink?

2877
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,610
As for pink...

2878
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,939
(Dad, please speak faster.)

2879
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,240
It was all the same.

2880
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:48,780
Perhaps the genre was action.

2881
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:51,019
- As for action...
- My goodness.

2882
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,289
(Red was for action.)

2883
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,720
Dad, you need to be precise.

2884
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,320
You don't remember exactly, do you?

2885
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,419
(I need to think about sad things.)

2886
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,459
Well...

2887
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,160
Please give me 1 of the 2 at the very least.

2888
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:04,900
Pink color? What?

2889
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:07,129
- Pink color represented...
- Okay.

2890
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:09,799
- blues.
- Blues.

2891
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,299
- He's talking about romance.
- Blues.

2892
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,439
- Romance.
- How about red?

2893
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:13,640
Melodrama.

2894
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:15,869
Red represented...

2895
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,939
intimacy.

2896
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:19,279
- Intimacy?
- Intimacy?

2897
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,509
Dad doesn't remember.

2898
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,680
- May I say hello?
- Dad, hold on.

2899
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:25,619
Hello, sir. We apologize for calling at such a late hour.

2900
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:29,349
My name is Lee Yi Kyung and I'm filming a show with Dong Hyun.

2901
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:30,819
It's nice to talk to you.

2902
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,459
What kind of a son was Dong Hyun...

2903
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,260
when he was young?

2904
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:36,559
Well, he was a bit like that.

2905
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,330
(Well, he was a bit like that.)

2906
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:40,929
You were a bit like that.

2907
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:41,969
What was he like?

2908
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,170
What kind of a son was he in particular?

2909
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:45,839
He was a bit of a klutz.

2910
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,710
(He was a bit of a klutz.)

2911
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:50,609
Dad! Let's end the call.

2912
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:51,639
- "He was a bit of a klutz." - "He was a bit of a klutz."

2913
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,039
- I see.
- My goodness.

2914
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,149
"He was a bit of a klutz."

2915
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,719
Now, he has many children.

2916
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,320
He's growing into a really nice dad.

2917
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:01,790
Yes, he's an adult now.

2918
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,759
Do you have...

2919
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,060
any wish for your son, Dong Hyun?

2920
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:09,759
(Well)

2921
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,530
He should stop having children.

2922
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:15,100
- I see. Okay.
- My goodness.

2923
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:17,639
- Thank you.
- Please hold on.

2924
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:20,040
Dad, okay.

2925
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,870
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

2926
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,080
- All signboards were red.
- Red has to be...

2927
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,339
I'm certain about red.

2928
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,179
- Red sticker and such...
- That's right.

2929
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:30,349
- Red sticker, red video...
- Red video.

2930
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:32,149
I'm certain red represented...

2931
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:34,049
- erotica.
- Dong Hyun disagrees.

2932
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:37,460
Tae Hyun, there has to be romance.

2933
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,860
There has to be erotica or romance.

2934
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:40,429
- But one of them...
- Will they answer together?

2935
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:43,629
Has to be a different genre such as horror or action.

2936
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,199
- For red?
- For any one of them.

2937
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,899
That's what I think.

2938
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,199
Romance, erotica, and teen film fall into the same category.

2939
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,240
Then pink represented for teen melodrama.

2940
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,969
Teen romance.

2941
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:54,169
Did red represent action?

2942
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:56,069
- I don't know.
- Horror or action.

2943
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:57,809
You need to get a hunch.

2944
01:40:57,810 --> 01:40:59,379
(They decide to believe in the eldest one's hunch.)

2945
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,450
Okay.

2946
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:02,079
- Let me answer.
- Okay. Let's go.

2947
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,279
Erotica, romance.

2948
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,089
(Red for erotica and pink for romance)

2949
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:08,689
- Erotica, romance.
- Go with what you want.

2950
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:10,320
- I don't know. All right.
- I think he's right.

2951
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,089
- Take a wild guess.
- I think Tae Hyun is right.

2952
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:13,759
(Red for erotica and pink for romance)

2953
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,459
It's incorrect.

2954
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:18,059
(Incorrect)

2955
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:19,330
- What's the answer?
- It isn't action, is it?

2956
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:21,429
- What's the answer?
- It isn't action, is it?

2957
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,730
- You need to guess now.
- Let me answer.

2958
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,240
- Listen.
- Can we answer?

2959
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,640
Pink...

2960
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,909
represented romance.

2961
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:29,039
- See?
- It's incorrect.

2962
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,779
- I told you that it was action.
- Let me answer.

2963
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,409
- Now, it's an individual match.
- Is it an individual match?

2964
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:33,909
- Let me answer.
- Hold on.

2965
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:35,579
- It's an individual match.
- Hurry up.

2966
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:36,819
- Let me answer.
- Come on.

2967
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,020
Action.

2968
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,320
Action?

2969
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,019
- Those movies have blood.
- Correct.

2970
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:42,249
- That's right.
- Correct.

2971
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,759
- That's right.
- I told you, didn't I?

2972
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,560
I kept telling you guys that it was action.

2973
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,560
- Dong Hyun...
- This one...

2974
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,729
- Dong Hyun was correct.
- You should've pushed through.

2975
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:51,159
- I...
- I knew that it was action.

2976
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,430
I said it until the end.

2977
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:55,329
But Tae Hyun went with the ones he thought were correct.

2978
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:58,370
How could you not use red for erotica?

2979
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:02,939
(To represent a movie correctly in one sighboard, )

2980
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:06,079
(action movies used red.)

2981
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,950
(Romance movies used pink.)

2982
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:14,320
(Sad movies used blue. Mystery movies used dark colors.)

2983
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:17,289
- It was speedy.
- One of the two will pay.

2984
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:19,260
If Dong Hyun gets chosen, he would've paid three times.

2985
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,929
- Is it the third time?
- This one is.

2986
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,330
- It's the third time of the day.
- Okay.

2987
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:24,099
Here comes the last question that will determine...

2988
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,330
- who pays.
- Okay.

2989
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,269
In the past, you had to be careful about striking a certain pose...

2990
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,270
when you took photos with Vietnamese people.

2991
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:34,869
You never touched this body part since Vietnamese people believed...

2992
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:38,109
that the guardian spirit resided in it.

2993
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,109
- The body part?
- Which pose was it?

2994
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:41,950
Let me answer.

2995
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,519
Kim Dong Hyun.

2996
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,720
Putting your hand on the shoulder.

2997
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,119
- The shoulder.
- That was my guess.

2998
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,949
If you press this part...

2999
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,019
of the shoulder,

3000
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,360
- your strength falls.
- This part?

3001
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,919
- That's it.
- There aren't many options.

3002
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,059
- That's it.
- My goodness.

3003
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,460
In the end, I'll pay.

3004
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,659
It's correct.

3005
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:59,959
(Answer: Putting your hand on the shoulder)

3006
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,230
What's on the shoulder?

3007
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,800
Dong Hyun answered correctly in the end.

3008
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,039
- Energy.
- Yes.

3009
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,299
All day long,

3010
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,010
that team paid for the meals.

3011
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,139
Really?

3012
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,339
- You're right.
- You're right.

3013
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:12,110
- It happened all day long.
- You're right.

3014
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,109
Namyeong-dong was a charming neighborhood.

3015
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:16,149
Now,

3016
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,849
it's time to hear from Ju Hyun and Hoon.

3017
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:23,959
It has been a while since I went on a tour of nice restaurants.

3018
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,489
I rarely go to places to eat tasty food.

3019
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:29,390
Thanks to the show, I had my fill.

3020
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:33,729
I had a comfortable shoot for the first time in a while.

3021
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:35,369
- I think I'll sleep well at home.
- That's good.

3022
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:37,869
- You have a shoot tomorrow.
- Yes.

3023
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:40,140
In any case, I came here to promote the drama.

3024
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:42,109
Please watch the drama.

3025
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:43,409
- "Hunter with a Scalpel." - "Hunter..."

3026
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:44,879
- "with a Scalpel" - Please watch it.

3027
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,839
- "Hunter with a Scalpel." - "Hunter with a Scalpel."

3028
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,550
- I hope it becomes a big hit.
- Good luck.

3029
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,649
Thank you for the food.

3030
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,679
Thank you for the food.

3031
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,680
(Tae Hyun pays for the meal.)

3032
01:43:52,681 --> 01:43:54,090
I can't believe it wasn't erotica.

3033
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,990
It's too bad.

3034
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,620
Thank you for the food.

3035
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:02,660
(They enjoyed their meals in Namyeong-dong.)

3036
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:03,930
(Pork belly: The side dishes and meat were the best.)

3037
01:44:03,931 --> 01:44:05,229
(The smell of charcoal was great. It was the number 1 pork!)

3038
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:06,559
(You have to try it. It'll be your loss if you don't.)

3039
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,899
(Budae stew: The taste of the past will bring back memories.)

3040
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:08,930
(This budae stew is new! It's the red flavor of Korea!)

3041
01:44:09,275 --> 01:44:13,214
("In Pyeongchang-dong" by Handsome Guys)

3042
01:44:13,215 --> 01:44:19,024
(Se Yoon visited Handsome Guys)

3043
01:44:19,025 --> 01:44:20,954
(Se Yoon visited Handsome Guys to eat)

3044
01:44:20,955 --> 01:44:24,964
(The table is overflowing with food)

3045
01:44:24,965 --> 01:44:27,835
(It's very tasty)

3046
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:30,604
(Welcome to the Moon Se Yoon Show...)

3047
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:32,705
(in Pyeongchang-dong.)

3048
01:44:33,505 --> 01:44:36,735
(Se Yoon's a lot of rice)

3049
01:44:37,445 --> 01:44:41,674
(Se Yoon's cow sound)

3050
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:42,814
Hello, Kim Ji Yoon.

3051
01:44:42,815 --> 01:44:45,014
(Se Yoon's...)

3052
01:44:45,015 --> 01:44:49,115
(introduction to his fat friends)

3053
01:44:53,485 --> 01:44:58,064
(The Handsome Guys members will show their utmost energy...)

3054
01:44:58,065 --> 01:45:02,165
(for the Moon Se Yoon Show.)

3055
01:45:02,335 --> 01:45:04,665
(It suits their tastes.)

3056
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:06,105
Good food,

3057
01:45:06,235 --> 01:45:07,605
good people,

3058
01:45:07,805 --> 01:45:09,475
and fun stories.

3059
01:45:09,875 --> 01:45:11,604
When those three components are present,

3060
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,475
it's bound to be fun.
