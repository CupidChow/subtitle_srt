1
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,711
(For a higher leap, )

2
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:35,342
(Woo Sang Hyeok is here!)

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,411
(Today's theme is people born in the Year of the Snake.)

4
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:40,480
(Jeon So Mi, Son Hyun Joo, Kim Woo Bin, So Ji Sub)

5
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:41,620
(Handsome Theme)

6
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,152
(Meet celebrities born in the Year of the Snake.)

7
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:45,492
(Do we have to search for them?)

8
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,362
(They must invite stars born in the Year of the Snake.)

9
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,831
(Is this possible?)

10
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,690
(Of course.)

11
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,461
(It's definitely possible.)

12
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,601
(From Kim Woo Bin born in 1989...)

13
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,532
(to Rhymer born in 1977)

14
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,072
(Can we go see you?)

15
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,112
(Team Handsome invites people easily.)

16
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,611
(It'd be great to meet Dae Hwi as well.)

17
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,771
(From the same agency)

18
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,941
(They get a chance to win two squares at once.)

19
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,012
(Rhymer born in 1977)

20
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,352
(Lee Dae Hwi born in 2001)

21
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,251
(I was born in early 2001.)

22
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,292
(Wasn't I born in the Year of the Dragon?)

23
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:19,921
What?

24
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,792
(Things don't go the way they expected.)

25
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,532
(I've lived my whole life as the Snake.)

26
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,330
(In the midst of controversy about being fake Snake)

27
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,162
(Someone born in the Year of the Snake appears.)

28
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:31,670
(My greetings in the Year of the Snake)

29
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,231
(This is Jun Hyo Seong.)

30
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:35,670
(She's really born in the Year of the Snake.)

31
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,542
(She has blind faith in tarot reading.)

32
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,980
(Thanks to Fanatic Hyo Seong, )

33
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,481
(Team Guys ties the score.)

34
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,080
(Team Handsome's weapon that remains)

35
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,682
(Kim Woo Bin born in 1989)

36
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:48,652
(Yi Kyung and Woo Bin are friends.)

37
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,881
You told me earlier...

38
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:53,352
(Woo Bin lied to be on Tae Hyun's side.)

39
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,662
(Could you bet on yourself?)

40
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,030
(With Kim Woo Bin, )

41
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,101
(their Handsome Race resumes.)

42
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,761
It'd be amazing if you could answer it.

43
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,101
If Woo Bin answers it...

44
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,632
- We should answer it together.
- Right.

45
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,272
- Here's the quiz.
- Please.

46
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,311
Until the 1980s,

47
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:14,012
this was possible with restrictions.

48
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:17,081
As the size of the Korean economy increased,

49
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,081
and the standard of living improved,

50
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:22,881
restrictions were removed...

51
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,621
starting from January 1, 1989.

52
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:26,721
What could this be?

53
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,721
- In 1989?
- Yes.

54
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,330
All restrictions were removed?

55
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:32,331
Yes.

56
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,631
- You don't know, do you?
- Not at all.

57
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:36,032
(I have no idea.)

58
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,671
Could it be curfew?

59
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:39,972
In 1989?

60
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,441
(No more curfew?)

61
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,900
Wasn't there a curfew until then?

62
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,312
I was in elementary school then.

63
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:46,271
When you were in middle school...

64
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,640
- Were you in high school?
- Curfew...

65
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,981
- Were you in college in 1989?
- in 1989?

66
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,411
- Were you in college?
- I was in middle school.

67
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:52,450
I was probably...

68
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:54,550
- in seventh grade.
- Was there any curfew?

69
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,151
I don't think there was a curfew.

70
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,092
Could it be no restrictions on hairstyle?

71
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,351
(Will you keep cornering me like that?)

72
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:00,450
It can't be about hairstyle.

73
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,990
When I was in middle school,

74
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,061
I was required to cut my hair short.

75
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,330
It can't be removing restrictions on hairstyle.

76
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:06,460
- I also had to get a buzz cut.
- Right.

77
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,501
When I was in middle school,

78
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:09,330
- there were hairstyle restrictions.
- Right.

79
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:11,831
That can't be the answer.

80
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,071
- I have an idea.
- What?

81
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:16,872
Removing all restrictions on traveling abroad.

82
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:21,342
Removing restrictions on traveling abroad in 1989?

83
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:23,382
Wasn't it done earlier?

84
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:25,352
That's possible.

85
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,520
How about this one?

86
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,920
The use of imported goods.

87
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,951
Weren't there restrictions on buying imported cars or home appliances?

88
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:38,162
Since then, were all restrictions removed?

89
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,561
On buying goods from abroad?

90
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:40,592
Isn't that the answer?

91
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,201
Without multiple choices...

92
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,971
Instead of your suggestion,

93
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:48,270
isn't removing restrictions from traveling abroad better?

94
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,841
- It's because...
- Unless it was a business trip...

95
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:52,670
Traveling abroad was limited...

96
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,941
to business purposes.

97
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,611
- Right.
- We had to get permission.

98
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,180
- I think it's correct.
- Here's why.

99
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:02,180
The Seoul Summer Games were in 1988.

100
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,351
Since the 1988 Seoul Summer Games,

101
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,490
- Korea started to develop.
- That's true.

102
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,960
It seems like after the Seoul Summer Games,

103
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,390
all restrictions were removed...

104
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,960
I think it's traveling abroad.

105
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,960
- Right? Traveling abroad is right.
- Traveling abroad?

106
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,001
Don't you think so?

107
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,131
We should trust his snake energy.

108
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,300
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

109
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,531
What Rhymer said was wrong, and he was born in 1977.

110
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:21,770
He was totally wrong.

111
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:23,001
(Rhymer born in 1977 said the wrong answer.)

112
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,241
I have a good feeling about it.

113
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:26,841
Let's go with traveling abroad.

114
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:28,681
- Here's the answer.
- I'd like to get one right.

115
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,741
Okay.

116
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,381
- Answer.
- The answer is traveling abroad.

117
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:33,650
(Traveling abroad)

118
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,580
- Please.
- All restrictions were removed...

119
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,021
since January 1, 1989.

120
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,291
Traveling abroad?

121
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,520
No way.

122
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,562
Traveling abroad.

123
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:43,262
That's correct.

124
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,290
(This is exciting.)

125
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,031
- Amazing.
- That's amazing.

126
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:50,400
This is really amazing.

127
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:51,431
Listen.

128
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:53,172
Let me explain why this is amazing.

129
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,640
We have a reattempt card, but we answered it correctly...

130
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,802
for the first time without using it.

131
00:04:57,612 --> 00:05:00,611
Traveling abroad had restrictions until the early 1980s.

132
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,280
After that, anyone could travel abroad.

133
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,411
The year 1989 seems much later than I thought.

134
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:07,080
That's fascinating.

135
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:09,321
In the past, there was curfew.

136
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,422
- Right.
- This is incredible.

137
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,751
- I can't believe it.
- This is amazing.

138
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:15,591
- Woo Bin, this is amazing.
- Seriously.

139
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,361
- It was a hard question.
- You did it as fast as possible.

140
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,960
Find someone born in 1953.

141
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,461
Once we get that, we win.

142
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,830
(With the correct answer with a man born in 1989)

143
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,541
(They're short on one square before completing the bingo.)

144
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,872
- It's kimchi stew.
- That sounds good.

145
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:32,312
We can eat kimchi stew.

146
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,140
- That's substantial.
- Do they decide your menu?

147
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,681
Let's give him a fortune cookie.

148
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,151
Please pick a fortune cookie.

149
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,311
Try it.

150
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:41,881
Do I just pick one?

151
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:42,951
Yes, pick one.

152
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:44,650
And break it.

153
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,651
(Checking his fortune with a fortune cookie)

154
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,192
- Something should be inside.
- Shall I break it?

155
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:53,091
- You can eat it.
- It's edible.

156
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,232
"Your luck increases by being with someone who helps you."

157
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:59,632
"The one who helps you is wearing yellow."

158
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:01,640
"Always look around carefully."

159
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,941
(Yellow?)

160
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:04,970
(Where is yellow?)

161
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,612
(I'd like to be someone who helps him.)

162
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,841
I'm not wearing yellow.

163
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,141
Are you wearing yellow?

164
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:12,150
(Oh, right!)

165
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:13,511
Hey, that's not true.

166
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:14,581
Hold on.

167
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,551
We brought something yellow.

168
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,790
Did you bring that?

169
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,251
- We brought something yellow.
- This is accurate.

170
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:20,650
- Hey.
- We brought something yellow.

171
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,821
We brought something yellow.

172
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,861
- All of them are yellow.
- All of them.

173
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:26,891
- We brought egg tarts.
- All egg tarts are yellow.

174
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:28,432
All of them are yellow.

175
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,101
This is great.

176
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,232
- This is good.
- We're here to help.

177
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,700
- Gosh.
- We bought some help.

178
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,101
Exactly. This is unbelievable.

179
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,182
- Yes.
- Yes.

180
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:42,742
Woo Bin is the best.

181
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,651
(1989, Male)

182
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,151
(It's time for Woo Bin to go to work.)

183
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,122
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Sure.

184
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,692
- I want to tell Sang Uk...
- Goodness.

185
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:58,731
(He can't miss a selfie with Woo Bin.)

186
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,890
Thank you.

187
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,600
- Take one with Sang Hyeok.
- Can you take our photo?

188
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:02,831
I'll take it for you.

189
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,030
(Tossing it naturally)

190
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,201
Sure.

191
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,901
You're too close. Why is it so close?

192
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,742
One, two, three. Okay.

193
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,770
Let's go.

194
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:14,172
- Is it zoomed in?
- Yes.

195
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:17,112
Yes.

196
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,511
- See you, Woo Bin.
- Bye.

197
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,621
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Thank you.

198
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:22,850
Thank you.

199
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,291
(While Team Handsome won their second square)

200
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:27,221
(Team Guys)

201
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:33,262
(Thanks to Hyo Seong, they won a precious square.)

202
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:35,400
There's no solution.

203
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,771
(They don't have anyone to meet anymore.)

204
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,301
(The other team won two squares.)

205
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:43,200
We have no chance of winning today.

206
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,012
We should play as much as possible.

207
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:50,081
- I'll search through my contacts...
- Yi Kyung.

208
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,651
I got a message from Cha Jun Hwan.

209
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,011
He was born in 2001.

210
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,681
Do you know him or his friend?

211
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,621
- I messaged him earlier.
- Gosh.

212
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,691
I am...

213
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:01,220
- Both of you are national athletes.
- I know him through my friends.

214
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,390
He definitely has dohwasal.

215
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,491
He messaged me back right away.

216
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:06,261
Can you explain the situation to him?

217
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,302
Or ask for his number. Calling would be the best.

218
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,401
Okay, I'll respond right away.

219
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,701
It'd be amazing if we could meet Cha Jun Hwan.

220
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,301
If we get someone...

221
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,901
born in 2001 and 2013, we'd complete the bingo.

222
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,770
If we find someone born in 2001,

223
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,441
the other team will be in a hurry.

224
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:22,442
(The tables may turn.)

225
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,682
It's the New Year. We should have some dumpling soup with rice cake.

226
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,221
Let's move.

227
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:29,752
Geumnam Market.

228
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,921
- Hello.
- Hello.

229
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,951
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:37,220
Sir, can we get three orders of dumpling soup with rice cake?

231
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,590
- Welcome.
- Here's the menu.

232
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:40,692
You want to order more?

233
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,460
- Sure.
- The side dishes...

234
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:43,461
You both eat a lot.

235
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:44,631
Did we leave our board?

236
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,100
(Seung Ho starts to analyze the menu.)

237
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,140
Just concentrate on him for the year 2001.

238
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:49,701
I'll find someone born in 2013.

239
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,311
He responded as soon as I messaged him,

240
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,741
but I responded so late.

241
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,140
(Feeling bad)

242
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,311
I was busy doing something else.

243
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,081
We had no choice.

244
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,352
Pyeonyuk sounds delicious.

245
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:02,081
Pyeonyuk...

246
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,082
(Naturally bringing up pyeonyuk)

247
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,222
Two orders of pyeonuk and...

248
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,251
How about one bibim naengmyeon?

249
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:08,261
Then three...

250
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,421
We already ordered three dumpling soup with rice cake.

251
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,862
We're 3, but you want 6 orders?

252
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,232
Three people... What?

253
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,670
One person gets dumpling soup with rice cake with pyeonuk.

254
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,832
That's enough food for one person.

255
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,101
- But he wants to order two...
- Dumpling soup with rice cake...

256
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,441
and pyeonuk are for one person.

257
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,141
Aren't we going to search those born in the Year of the Snake?

258
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,841
- Year of the Snake...
- Go ahead and order.

259
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:29,941
We'll just order quickly.

260
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,581
- A regular size.
- One regular bibim naengmyeon?

261
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:32,852
Thank you.

262
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,981
Shall we search now?

263
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,381
(I'll search for those born in the Year of the Snake.)

264
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,122
A figure skater on the national team...

265
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,462
Male born in 1989.

266
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,221
There is no way out.

267
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:45,592
It can't be helped.

268
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,660
We have no chance.

269
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:52,202
(Now, they're faced with the bingo crisis.)

270
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,742
A celebrity born in 2013...

271
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,242
(Food to comfort them arrives.)

272
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,410
- What's this?
- Wrap it.

273
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:03,582
Okay.

274
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,582
(Here is light pyeonuk.)

275
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,982
(Chewy)

276
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:12,952
It's homemade kimchi.

277
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,622
(Salivating)

278
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:21,232
(Shall we try the pyeonuk?)

279
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,771
(However, Yi Kyung isn't interested.)

280
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,800
Which celebrities were born in 2013?

281
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,301
I'm thinking of calling their agency.

282
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,311
Is that what you were thinking about?

283
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:35,111
I can't find celebrities born in 2013. Who are they?

284
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,180
Let's search for those born in the Year of the Snake.

285
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:38,252
(They postpone their eating.)

286
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:41,920
- Gosh, it's served already.
- Thank you.

287
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,180
I like how fast it is.

288
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

289
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:45,851
(Bibim naengmyeon)

290
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:47,320
It has the vibe of a market.

291
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,362
(Mixing without hesitating)

292
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,020
It smells really good.

293
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:53,291
(The appetizing smell of savory sesame oil)

294
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,930
It looks very chewy.

295
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,301
(It truly looks appetizing.)

296
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,930
Yi Kyung, please eat.

297
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,401
(He doesn't move.)

298
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:02,940
Have a bite.

299
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,941
No, you guys go ahead.

300
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:08,382
- Thank you.
- I'll keep searching.

301
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:13,452
(Starting with pyeonuk)

302
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,520
We need to narrow it down.

303
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:16,780
Where should we go?

304
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:17,921
(Wrapping it neatly with kimchi and taking a bite)

305
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:19,891
(Humming)

306
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:24,191
(Seung Ho also takes a bite of the pyeonuk.)

307
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,931
By the way, it's delicious.

308
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,601
How can kimchi be...

309
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,660
(In awe with the homemade kimchi)

310
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:31,732
this excellent?

311
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:34,471
(He's still searching.)

312
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,742
(Glancing)

313
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,310
(They're starting to be tactless.)

314
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:40,911
Do you know any...

315
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,781
(His true feeling explodes.)

316
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,410
(Try bibim naengmyeon.)

317
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,281
(Okay)

318
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,291
(Taking a bite of bibim naengmyeon carefully)

319
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:56,891
(While the two younger members devour bibim naengmyeon quietly, )

320
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:01,501
(he's strictly searching those born in the Year of the Snake.)

321
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:04,160
- Hello, Yi Kyung.
- Sir, we're shooting right now.

322
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,670
- Yes?
- In the entertainment industry,

323
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:09,300
do you know anyone...

324
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:12,940
who was born in 2013?

325
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,881
Can you call their agency?

326
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:18,150
An actor born in 2013? How old is he this year?

327
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,951
Would he be 12?

328
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,081
- In 6th grade.
- In 6th grade.

329
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,180
- He's 13.
- Or 12...

330
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,181
(Sighing)

331
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,122
He'd be around that age.

332
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,390
I'll look it up and call you back.

333
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:28,962
- Okay.
- Bye.

334
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,962
I even called the CEO of an agency.

335
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:35,232
They only need to find someone born in 1953.

336
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:39,301
After realizing that, I gave up for a while.

337
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,571
I'll get back on my feet after eating this.

338
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,940
If we lose again, then the three of us will lose...

339
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,211
for two consecutive weeks.

340
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,611
(Losing 2 consecutive weeks with the same team)

341
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,311
(Feeling guilty)

342
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,111
Still, we were happy.

343
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:52,151
(Staying mentally strong)

344
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:54,651
You guys are...

345
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,151
more optimistic than I thought.

346
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,621
(We will destroy them after eating.)

347
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,621
- Your dumpling soup with rice cake.
- Thank you.

348
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,030
- That was served so fast.
- Goodness.

349
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:07,832
- Thank you.
- It's faster than microwaving it.

350
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:12,732
(Dumpling soup with rice cake you must have for the New Year)

351
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,570
(Hot)

352
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,440
You need to try this.

353
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:24,082
- Okay.
- Try a piece of pyeonuk.

354
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:25,911
What kind of place is this?

355
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,082
- Yi Kyung, it's amazing.
- Thank you.

356
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,452
I like eating, too.

357
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,421
It's because...

358
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,721
It's delicious, but...

359
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,261
(He's searching again.)

360
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:40,261
Short track speed skater, Lee Yu Bin.

361
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:41,530
She was born in 2001.

362
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,601
(Lee Yu Bin, a short track speed skater born in 2001)

363
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,602
Really?

364
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,371
If I can't get a hold of him, I'll call her right away.

365
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,531
Do you know her?

366
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,401
She's on YouTube with Yoon Gy all the time.

367
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:50,901
Really?

368
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,270
I searched for her before, but she didn't come up.

369
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,712
(She didn't come up before.)

370
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,481
(He eats some dumpling soup with rice cake first.)

371
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:59,751
How can kimchi be this excellent?

372
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,081
(He's searching again.)

373
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,921
For the actor born in 2013, I got his mother's number.

374
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:06,020
Isn't it bingo once we find...

375
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,221
- someone born in 2001?
- Yes.

376
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,561
- Gosh.
- It's possible.

377
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:11,261
Mister.

378
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:12,561
Yes?

379
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,361
- Isn't it delicious? Yes.
- Is it delicious?

380
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:16,601
Mister.

381
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,571
(The dumpling soup with rice cake is delicious here.)

382
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,501
(Yi Kyung calls her right away.)

383
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:23,741
Hello?

384
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,170
Hello, you must be Jae Min's mother.

385
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:27,310
- This is Actor Lee Yi Kyung.
- Yes.

386
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:28,810
Hello.

387
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:30,910
Let me briefly explain the situation.

388
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,780
- Could we talk for a minute?
- Yes.

389
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:37,621
We're visiting celebrities born in the Year of the Snake.

390
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:39,890
We wish them Happy New Year and give them presents.

391
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,091
I see.

392
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,160
Was Jae Min born in the Year of the Snake?

393
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:45,161
That's right.

394
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:47,131
- He was born in 2013.
- Yes.

395
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:50,632
Would it be possible to meet him today?

396
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:53,502
- One moment, please.
- Sure.

397
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,671
She sounds very calm.

398
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:58,712
It's Lee Yi Kyung on the phone.

399
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,471
Why aren't you eating your dumplings?

400
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,241
I didn't have a chance to eat it.

401
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:03,681
- Do you want some?
- No.

402
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,382
Seeing you not eating...

403
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,781
- Here you go.
- Seeing you not eating...

404
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,382
Have one more.

405
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,881
Then I'll eat it.

406
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:11,952
(Gosh, then I'll eat it.)

407
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,492
Have one more.

408
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,221
Goodness.

409
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,391
(Mother Bird Yi Kyung takes care of the younger ones.)

410
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:22,161
(Huge)

411
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:27,332
(Eating without hesitating)

412
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:35,082
(He adds kimchi to it and stuffs himself.)

413
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:37,012
(Humming)

414
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,081
All right. It's possible.

415
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,951
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

416
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:46,390
Okay, we'll come around 4pm.

417
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:47,920
- Okay.
- Thank you.

418
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:48,921
Okay.

419
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:50,461
(Today's schedule: Lunch at 2pm, Meeting with the actor at 4pm)

420
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:51,732
We can go there right after eating.

421
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:54,801
I can finally eat. Goodness.

422
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:58,201
- Bibim naengmyeon...
- Without knowing where to go,

423
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,070
I don't know how you could eat so much.

424
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:01,202
(I respect you for eating without caring.)

425
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,541
Can you eat without knowing where to go next?

426
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,011
- That was delicious.
- We can't do anything when hungry.

427
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,441
(They pretend not to hear him.)

428
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,211
Don't give up on Cha Jun Hwan.

429
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,081
- He's supposed to contact you.
- For now,

430
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,810
- I got her number.
- Cha Jun Hwan's number?

431
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:16,081
- No, Lee Yu Bin's.
- Then call her now.

432
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:17,721
- What do I say?
- What do you say?

433
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,390
- What time should we meet her?
- Don't you know what we're doing?

434
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:20,591
What time should we meet her?

435
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,021
Around 6pm would be good.

436
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,222
Ask her where she lives. I mean...

437
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,461
Ask her where she lives. I mean...

438
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,300
(He calls her rapidly before he gets scolded more.)

439
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,002
Say that you're Oh Sang Uk.

440
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,400
Tell her politely...

441
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,801
that you have a lot of dohwasal.

442
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,140
(Laughing)

443
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,541
Good job.

444
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:39,170
- Hello?
- Hello.

445
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,341
This is Fencer Oh Sang Uk.

446
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:44,040
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

447
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:48,082
- Yes?
- We're shooting a variety show.

448
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:49,581
You were born in the Year of the Snake.

449
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:50,721
Yes.

450
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,591
Why is he stating the obvious?

451
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,051
(Laughing)

452
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,560
Do you like presents?

453
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,560
(Laughing)

454
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,591
Of course I do.

455
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:01,531
When is your training today?

456
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:05,332
I don't have any training in the afternoon,

457
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:08,800
but I still have to work out.

458
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:09,971
What time do you finish?

459
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,342
It's up to me to decide.

460
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,180
Hello, this is Actor Lee Yi Kyung.

461
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,711
Hello.

462
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:20,112
Thank you for listening to him ramble.

463
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,680
- Sure.
- By the way,

464
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,351
could we meet you at 6pm?

465
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,691
Yes, that works.

466
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,222
Does that work for you?

467
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,962
Yes, it works.

468
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,861
Gosh, thank you so much.

469
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:36,100
We'll see you there around 6pm. If there's any change,

470
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,001
we'll let you know in advance.

471
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,472
- Okay, see you soon.
- Thank you.

472
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:43,241
You should lead the conversation like this.

473
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,702
Talking out of the blue...

474
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,541
That's how athletes talk.

475
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:48,110
"Can you do it or not?"

476
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,181
(Getting straight to the point)

477
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,381
Isn't it your first time calling her?

478
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,652
- I'm glad.
- You know what's funny?

479
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:55,481
Let's go to karaoke or coin karaoke.

480
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,421
- Finish those 30 minutes.
- That sounds good.

481
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,320
After meeting Jae Min,

482
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,151
we'll meet Yu Bin right away.

483
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,791
That's it for today.

484
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:05,262
- We got it planned out.
- The game is set.

485
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,201
How could we find anyone born in 2013? That's ridiculous.

486
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:09,432
(They still have a chance to complete the bingo.)

487
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:12,070
(Team Handsome)

488
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,501
(Home-style Korean food restaurant)

489
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:17,171
- Over here.
- Shall we sit like this?

490
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:18,471
Order something.

491
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,941
Don't we just need kimchi stew?

492
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:20,971
No, we need protein.

493
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,512
I'm fine, but Sang Hyeok...

494
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,411
We need some salted mackerel.

495
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,310
Order whatever you want. We don't mind.

496
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:29,851
There are pork cutlet and steamed eggs.

497
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:33,691
Pork cutlet doesn't go well with kimchi stew.

498
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,520
- How about rolled omelet?
- That sounds good.

499
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,590
- That's good with kimchi stew.
- Kimchi stew, rolled omelet,

500
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,361
- and mackerel. Those three?
- That sounds good.

501
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:43,261
- Order them.
- You don't like bulgogi?

502
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:44,301
Goodness.

503
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:46,732
Just in case.

504
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,441
We have good teamwork today.

505
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:50,941
Thanks to someone old,

506
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:52,810
he knows about restrictions on traveling abroad.

507
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:54,610
Thanks to someone young,

508
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:58,182
Google Woo finds everything.

509
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:00,511
What's "Google Woo?"

510
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,781
(What's "Google Woo?")

511
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:05,252
(Did you ask what Google Woo is?)

512
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:07,691
(Whenever the members have questions)

513
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,091
(Searching)

514
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:14,860
(He got the list in an instant.)

515
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,831
(Google Woo, tell me how to get there.)

516
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,301
It came up.

517
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,871
- Is it in Apgujeong?
- Yes.

518
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,171
(Google Woo found the route.)

519
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,442
What's this? Is it chocolate?

520
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,571
I think that's apple cinnamon.

521
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:29,482
How do you know? How did you find out?

522
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,152
- I saw the photo.
- Google Woo is amazing.

523
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,081
(Google Woo is ready to search anytime.)

524
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,151
You call someone who's good at searching "Google."

525
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:39,892
Since he's Woo Sang Hyeok, he's Google Woo.

526
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,762
We have to explain to him because he's old.

527
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:44,060
(An old person)

528
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:45,191
He's old.

529
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,531
Jun Hyun Moo called me back right now.

530
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,201
(Hyun Moo?)

531
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:51,672
(They try calling him.)

532
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,131
- Hello, Dong Hyun.
- Hello, Hyun Moo.

533
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,841
- Gosh.
- Happy New Year.

534
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,141
Happy New Year to you too. I need to box.

535
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:00,770
You should come to box.

536
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:02,681
You only asked without ever coming.

537
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:03,742
(Please come starting this year.)

538
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,681
I apologize for sending you a text message...

539
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:09,151
suddenly and early in the morning.

540
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,350
It's okay. Why are you being so polite?

541
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,691
It's because we're on TV.

542
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,392
Hyun Moo, this is Tae Hyun.

543
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,661
- Gosh, Tae Hyun.
- Goodness.

544
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:18,961
From the way you were speaking, I knew you were being filmed.

545
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,691
(From the way you were speaking, I knew you were being filmed.)

546
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:25,070
Today, we have to find celebrities born in the Year of the Snake.

547
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:28,130
We get their fortunes read.

548
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,901
- I'd like that.
- By the way,

549
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:35,641
we didn't think you'd be available due to a shoot.

550
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,941
We contacted Rhymer...

551
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:40,481
and finished what we had to do.

552
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,020
- We already met...
- Yes?

553
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,621
A male born in 1977.

554
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,422
The time I was born must be different.

555
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:48,891
I mean...

556
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:51,061
We'll have your fortune read.

557
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,060
Could you send...

558
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:55,902
your information to Dong Hyun?

559
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,431
- Then I should call my mom.
- Okay.

560
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:02,642
Do you have Tae Jin Ah's phone number?

561
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,171
I probably have his old phone number.

562
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,971
Could you send that to Dong Hyun?

563
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:09,911
- Sure.
- Thank you.

564
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,810
Thank you so much.

565
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,451
- Hyun Moo. It's okay.
- I'm sorry for missing your call.

566
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:17,351
You must come to the gym. It's New Year 2025.

567
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:19,791
The way you're talking makes me want to vomit.

568
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:22,861
This is how I usually talk.

569
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,661
- All right.
- Okay, Hyun Moo.

570
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:25,731
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

571
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:27,231
- Thank you.
- Bye.

572
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:28,290
(Kimchi stew is served at the right time.)

573
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,261
You'll get one each, so please wait.

574
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:31,401
It looks amazing.

575
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:34,571
(The taste you never get tired of every time you eat it)

576
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:39,071
(Comfort food for Koreans, spicy kimchi stew)

577
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,412
(And what complements kimchi stew)

578
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:46,051
(Pan-fry the egg mixture until it turns golden.)

579
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:50,050
(Soft and moist rolled omelet)

580
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:53,091
(Protein for Sang Hyeok picked by Dong Hyun)

581
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:57,162
(Grilled mackerel that's light and whets the appetite)

582
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,431
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy.

583
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:00,992
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

584
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,001
(Goodness)

585
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:06,270
It goes well with rice.

586
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:07,731
(It goes well with rice.)

587
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:09,041
It's a tasty restaurant.

588
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,271
In that case...

589
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:16,081
(Sang Hyeok takes a big bite of his meal ordered by Dong Hyun.)

590
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:19,151
- Can we order more mackerel?
- I'll give you more.

591
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm okay, but Sang Hyeok...

592
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:22,581
I'm okay.

593
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,682
You always do that.

594
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,550
You're going to eat it anyway.

595
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:30,361
I'm okay, but athletes need protein.

596
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:31,761
Right.

597
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:35,585
(Eating eggs to supplement on protein)

598
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,570
(They nourish themselves in their own ways.)

599
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:42,741
For now...

600
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:48,442
(They nourish themselves in their own ways.)

601
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:50,682
It's delicious.

602
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,080
Did Hyun Moo send you the number?

603
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,251
(How about Tae Jin Ah's phone number?)

604
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,850
Didn't he say...

605
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,751
that he knows Tae Jin Ah's number?

606
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,692
(Once they meet Tae Jin Ah, they can complete the bingo.)

607
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:03,521
(Chuckling)

608
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:04,991
"I don't have his number."

609
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,761
(I'm sorry.)

610
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,261
(Feeling bitter)

611
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,100
Didn't you say that you can contact everyone through their friends?

612
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,271
(His dream of leaving work on time disappears.)

613
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,831
- Let's go. We don't have time.
- Okay.

614
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,301
Do you want one more egg tart?

615
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:17,972
You want to eat more?

616
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,810
- Isn't there any in the car?
- There is.

617
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,070
- No, there isn't.
- We finished it.

618
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,441
We did?

619
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,242
- Of course.
- Egg tarts...

620
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,151
(The members are searching again...)

621
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,081
(for those born in the Year of the Snake.)

622
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,081
It's 3pm right now.

623
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:31,952
What time will we get there?

624
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:35,091
(Tae Hyun gets a phone call.)

625
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:38,052
- Hello, Tae Hyun.
- CEO Rhymer.

626
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,423
Hello.

627
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,992
We'll get there in about 20 minutes.

628
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,892
- Okay.
- We're on our way.

629
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:45,893
Okay.

630
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:48,662
Things are going so smoothly.

631
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:49,762
(Why are they seeing Rhymer again?)

632
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,962
(Today morning)

633
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,202
(Rhymer invited Dae Hwi born in 2001.)

634
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,902
(Dae Hwi claims to have lived as the Snake.)

635
00:23:58,903 --> 00:23:59,903
(It turns out...)

636
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:03,173
(that he was born in the Year of the Dragon.)

637
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,482
(They got information on someone else born in 2001.)

638
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,282
(We'll reserve him.)

639
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,422
Here we go.

640
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:13,583
(That's why they're going back to CEO Rhymer's office.)

641
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,522
Who has that card?

642
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:21,291
"By taking photos of any of the members with the characters,"

643
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:23,032
"complete the phrase."

644
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,402
"Year of the Snake" and "Happy New Year."

645
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:26,932
- We need to find these, too.
- Yes.

646
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:27,961
(We will find them.)

647
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:29,402
(Wide-eyed)

648
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:31,332
There is "Happy New Year."

649
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,702
- Where? Take a photo.
- Over there.

650
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,072
- It's over there.
- That's amazing.

651
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,143
It's over there.

652
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:36,612
- It's over there.
- Where?

653
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,772
New Year Greetings.

654
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:40,612
Gosh, you're amazing.

655
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,712
(Google Woo's strange searching ability)

656
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,652
That's amazing.

657
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:46,153
(I can't believe things are going so smoothly.)

658
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:48,992
Did you take a photo?

659
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:50,623
Sang Hyeok is amazing.

660
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:53,492
We got it.

661
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:55,363
Okay.

662
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:56,962
It's right here.

663
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,701
(How did he spot that?)

664
00:24:58,702 --> 00:24:59,962
Unbelievable.

665
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,832
(This card will become powerless soon.)

666
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,833
That's impressive.

667
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:04,801
Now,

668
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:07,002
we only need "Year of the Snake" and "Handsome Guys."

669
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:08,741
(Wishing happy new year card's current status)

670
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:09,842
(With)

671
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,472
(Happy New Year)

672
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:14,512
(Soon, they arrive at a familiar place.)

673
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,353
We're here.

674
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,721
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

675
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:22,252
(When Team Handsome arrives to meet someone born in 2001)

676
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,021
(Team Guys)

677
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,561
They definitely won't stay still.

678
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,423
They don't have to clear any missions today.

679
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,262
They have to take selfies.

680
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,602
If I were them...

681
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:34,062
(If I were them...)

682
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,032
I'd have gone to an Internet cafe.

683
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:38,643
- And?
- I'd have printed it.

684
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,442
The written phrase.

685
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:44,073
(Print the written phrase)

686
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,242
That's probably not allowed.

687
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:47,782
I'd have insisted.

688
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:49,652
There are no such rules.

689
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:50,853
(Insistent)

690
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:52,481
That only works for you.

691
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:53,751
It is...

692
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,653
one of your strengths.

693
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:57,222
Still, that's rude.

694
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:01,623
As an entertainer...

695
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:05,662
- We're on the signboard.
- Right.

696
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,132
I saw it on my way here.

697
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,562
On Handsome Guys...

698
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:10,832
My dream was having my photo up there.

699
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,241
- There's a signboard.
- What?

700
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:13,373
(Really?)

701
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:16,872
(I should save this.)

702
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,572
- I took a photo of it.
- You did?

703
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:19,642
I should send it to our group chat room.

704
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,042
Don't send it yet.

705
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:22,912
They're good with directions, and they know where it is.

706
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,552
Even I would recognize it.

707
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,823
How could you think of sending it to our group chat room?

708
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,623
You're rude too.

709
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,153
You were being rude to our team.

710
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:34,762
(They pass the Han River with two rude members.)

711
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,731
(Soon, they arrive at the next location.)

712
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:39,902
(Karaoke)

713
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,102
We just need to fill the time.

714
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:42,771
(30-minute karaoke time card)

715
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:44,201
Let's get off work on time today.

716
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,572
("Leave Work on Time" by Lee Yi Kyung)

717
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:46,603
Please.

718
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:49,342
Our team can't lose again.

719
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,742
Please, let our team...

720
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:54,082
(I want to leave work)

721
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,882
(I hate working overtime)

722
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,782
(I really want to leave work on time)

723
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:06,323
(We can't lose 2 weeks in a row.)

724
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,092
(I agree.)

725
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,262
Let's leave work on time today.

726
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:13,202
I like this song.

727
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,301
It's offensive to hear it when you're losing.

728
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,673
Let's leave work on time today.

729
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:22,742
("I Am Firefly" by LUNCH)

730
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:24,542
Sang Uk is a good singer.

731
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:29,083
(He's good at singing.)

732
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,282
(It pangs the listener's heart.)

733
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:39,863
(The husky voice of a fencer on the national team)

734
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:46,961
("Confession" by Deli Spice)

735
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:47,962
I love it.

736
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,031
- However - I love your voice.

737
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,872
- I'm sorry - Seung Ho!

738
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,642
Deep in my heart

739
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:56,041
- This is great.
- Someone else

740
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,772
He has a great voice.

741
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,712
His tone is wonderful.

742
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,412
He's also a gangster.

743
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,153
(He's also a gangster.)

744
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,322
He was a gangster when he was acting.

745
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:07,751
(Great tone, acting, and facial expressions)

746
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,951
His tone is wonderful.

747
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,292
(Shin Seung Ho, 29 years old)

748
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:13,322
Even if we lose, let's enjoy ourselves.

749
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:15,962
(Even if we lose, let's enjoy ourselves.)

750
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:18,193
How many minutes do we have?

751
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,032
We have time to sing one more.

752
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,001
This isn't easy. When taking a nap for 30 minutes,

753
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,772
- Right.
- you don't have to move.

754
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,702
Do you know this song?

755
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:28,173
It has high notes.

756
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,772
- DK?
- Gosh.

757
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:35,342
(He set up the microphone stand.)

758
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,912
- Here he is.
- Thank you.

759
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,052
(He turns into a singer.)

760
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,221
This will increase his dohwasal.

761
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:42,222
Dohwasal.

762
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:46,222
(His dohwasal is on.)

(Feeling pleased and proud of him)

765
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:00,843
All right.

766
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:02,842
- Let's go, Sang Uk.
- Yes.

767
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,742
(The emotional and high chorus is the highlight.)

768
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,452
Thirty minutes are up.

769
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:11,752
(Singing)

770
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:13,281
Thirty minutes are up.

771
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:14,551
It just ended.

772
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,451
- It's been exactly 30 minutes.
- Gosh.

773
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:19,291
- We have to go and meet him.
- Let's go.

774
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,623
- Let's go.
- We have to go.

Three weeks ago,

777
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,833
he got over ten million views.

778
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:28,162
- Ten million views?
- Only...

779
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:29,602
we didn't know.

780
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,172
He must be very famous.

781
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,542
(Reading about the one born in 2001 before meeting him)

782
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,673
These guys are incredible.

783
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,912
(Appearing while expressing disgust)

784
00:29:37,913 --> 00:29:38,913
What's wrong?

785
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,412
Goodness.

786
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,113
- Again...
- Seriously.

787
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,712
We're changing places in the office...

788
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,852
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

789
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,182
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

790
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:49,291
Here's our main guest.

791
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,522
I brought the one born in the Year of the Snake.

792
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:53,193
He's our savior...

793
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:54,961
and our treasure.

794
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,832
It's EUNHO born in 2001.

795
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,562
- Yes.
- Hello.

796
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:02,833
(The year of 2001)

797
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:04,771
(Handsome Snake 4)

798
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:06,001
(EUNHO, Rhymer's treasure)

799
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,872
Please say hello to the camera.

800
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:08,972
Yes, EUNHO.

801
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:12,172
Hello, I'm the main vocalist of YOUNITE.

802
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,643
I'm EUNHO. Nice to meet you.

803
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,383
He's the main vocalist?

804
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,123
(His dancing is both powerful and soft.)

805
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:23,492
(Outstanding singing skills as the main vocalist)

806
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:25,492
(Charming in every way)

807
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,962
(The leader of YOUNITE)

808
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,432
He's the main vocalist?

809
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:31,433
- Right.
- The main vocalist?

810
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:32,932
- Isn't he the leader?
- He is the leader,

811
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,761
main vocalist, and the eldest.

812
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,433
He's the eldest with his amazing looks.

813
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:38,833
(Feeling shy)

814
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,771
You're quite young.

815
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:44,542
Have you gotten your fortune read?

816
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:47,211
Yes, recently in the dormitory with my mobile phone.

817
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,782
You've never gotten your fortune read by a fortune-teller?

818
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:52,211
No, I haven't.

819
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:54,182
Today, we're traveling...

820
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,422
- with one.
- Really?

821
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,521
A real fortune-teller.

822
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,653
He's incredible.

823
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,322
- Would you like to try?
- Sure.

824
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:02,163
(Would you like to try?)

825
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,731
I brought someone who was actually born...

826
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:04,991
- in the Year of the Snake.
- He's real this time.

827
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:06,031
He's the real Snake.

828
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,663
He's the real Snake born in 2001.

829
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:10,902
- I'm real.
- He's the real Snake born in 2001.

830
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,002
I'm the real Snake.

831
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,541
If you tell me your birthday,

832
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,741
I'll read your fortune.

833
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,413
I was born...

834
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,443
on March 25, 2001.

835
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,683
In March? That's for sure.

836
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,613
I read your fortune.

837
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,282
Your fortune made me think of this.

838
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,352
If I have a child of my own in the future,

839
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:31,792
I hope that he'd have the same fortune.

840
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,163
(Listening intently)

841
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:35,292
There are three things.

842
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,433
First, you're ambitious.

843
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,162
- Right.
- You aren't lazy.

844
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,432
You have...

845
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,472
clear goals in mind.

846
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:44,173
Yes, that's true.

847
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:47,402
Second, you have many talents.

848
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:49,173
- Thank you.
- I'm serious.

849
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:51,041
Usually, talents are called...

850
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,241
dohwa.

851
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:55,811
In your case, your dohwa is...

852
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,182
attracting fans.

853
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,652
You know how to make people side with you.

854
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,451
I didn't know such things existed in fortune-telling.

855
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:03,521
(Listening carefully)

856
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,623
Third, many people help you in life.

857
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,492
- I see.
- Many people help you.

858
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,692
(Am I one of them?)

859
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,333
Is CEO Rhymer one of them who will help him?

860
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,132
What's the compatibility between me and him?

861
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,031
- Our compatibility...
- They have to be compatible.

862
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:18,073
If not, he should change the agency.

863
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:21,642
I mean,

864
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,241
you seem compatible.

865
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,412
Here's why.

866
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:25,883
He harbors a lot of fire,

867
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:27,583
- and fire is what you need.
- Right.

868
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,981
In that sense, you are compatible.

869
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,353
He can be of help to you.

870
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:34,452
However, in your boss' case...

871
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:37,123
In Rhymer's case, you...

872
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:40,762
Well, it's good.

873
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,393
- What's wrong?
- It's a good relationship...

874
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,732
since EUNHO will make money for him.

875
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,172
(He's the pot of honey and Employee of the Year.)

876
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:50,672
- Good money?
- Right.

877
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:52,702
They'll create a much-needed flow.

878
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,402
You've only be telling us the good things.

879
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:56,872
Is there anything we should be wary about?

880
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:58,112
This year?

881
00:32:58,113 --> 00:32:59,182
I think...

882
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:02,113
the year 2024 wasn't that good for EUNHO.

883
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:03,613
Is that so?

884
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,051
- I think so.
- In 2024...

885
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,682
A lot happened in 2024.

886
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,393
- It was a tough year for him.
- Right.

887
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:11,822
If 2024 was a tough year, 2025 will be a year...

888
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,362
for you to do a lot of things...

889
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:14,822
that'll help you overcome it.

890
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:18,393
I see an upward trajectory in your path in 2026.

891
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,232
Can't he get there sooner?

892
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,001
- You sound urgent.
- Right.

893
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:29,613
Taking too long to reach a certain level...

894
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:31,471
- won't be good for me.
- Right.

895
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,811
For EUNHO, it'll be May, June, July.

896
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,351
Can't he find luck in March?

897
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,251
- March?
- Be patient, Rhymer.

898
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:39,883
It'll happen in May.

899
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,322
March isn't a bad month for him, but...

900
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:44,392
- What about late March?
- Well...

901
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:45,621
(He's trying to decide when to release the album.)

902
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:46,762
- Hold on.
- Now,

903
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,622
you're a true believer of fortune telling.

904
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:50,792
You're asking him when to release the album.

905
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:54,532
- Please give him some good energy.
- Sure.

906
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,672
EUNHO, let's squeeze his hand.

907
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:58,931
- We'll take his hand.
- Unbelievable.

908
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:00,803
He said he didn't believe in fortune telling.

909
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:03,642
Now, they're true believers.

910
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,342
Please give us good energy.

911
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:07,343
(Late March will be good for us, right?)

912
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:08,343
Nice.

913
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:09,552
(Don't blindly believe.)

914
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:11,283
I feel like energy is being sucked out of me.

915
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,922
Here's your quiz.

916
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:19,093
(Time for Quiz)

917
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:20,193
I hope EUNHO...

918
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:21,622
- can answer this correctly.
- Exactly.

919
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,032
He's someone we consider as special.

920
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,432
(Will he help Team Handsome until the very end?)

921
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:28,061
The year 2001...

922
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:32,032
was the golden age of Korean movies with the number of tickets sold...

923
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,501
for Korean movies exceeding that for foreign movies.

924
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:35,943
- The year 2001?
- Yes.

925
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:38,372
The movie "My Sassy Girl..."

926
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,513
hit the theaters in 2001.

927
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:42,782
That was a great movie.

928
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,282
- Do you know the movie?
- Yes, I saw it.

929
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,382
What a relief.

930
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,981
How did you see it when you were born in 2001?

931
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:48,182
It's a masterpiece.

932
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,653
Thanks.

933
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,522
So did "Kick the Moon."

934
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,062
I saw them both.

935
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:58,133
- "Friend." - Yes, "Friend."

936
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:00,033
"My Wife Is a Gangster."

937
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:02,331
Line up the movies...

938
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:06,473
in the order of how well they did at the box office.

939
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,272
You'll know.

940
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:09,912
You were in one.

941
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:11,343
I only know how well my movie did.

942
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,642
You must've compared the scores.

943
00:35:13,142 --> 00:35:15,081
Did "My Sassy Girl" sell over ten million tickets?

944
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:17,283
It didn't. I bet "Friend" did the best.

945
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,383
I remember "Friend" selling over seven million tickets.

946
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:23,251
"My Sassy Girl" sold about five million tickets.

947
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:26,092
- "Friend" definitely did better.
- Close to eight million.

948
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,291
It sold over seven million tickets.

949
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,592
What about "My Wife Is a Gangster?"

950
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,862
I remember...

951
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:33,362
that movie being the biggest hit at the time.

952
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:36,002
I don't trust him at all.

953
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:40,502
You saw how good I was earlier on.

954
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,211
(He said Jang Yun Jung entered the Campus Music Festival.)

955
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:46,783
(Incorrect)

956
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,141
(She must've entered the Riverside Song Festival.)

957
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:51,812
(He's quick to change his words.)

958
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:54,681
- I won't trust him.
- You saw me earlier.

959
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:55,722
(Distrust)

960
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:58,892
This is what I personally think.

961
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,722
First place, second place.

962
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:02,731
(1st place: "Friend," 2nd place: "Kick the Moon")

963
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,093
Third place, and fourth place.

964
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:06,033
For some reason, that's what I think.

965
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:08,032
"Kick the Moon..."

966
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,161
(Tae Hyun's guess)

967
00:36:09,162 --> 00:36:10,203
This is tough.

968
00:36:10,673 --> 00:36:11,831
Let's get the energy of the snake.

969
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,702
- Yes, EUNHO.
- What do you think?

970
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:14,771
Did you see all the movies?

971
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,311
The only movies I know...

972
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:18,243
- are "My Sassy Girl" and "Friend." - Right.

973
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:19,982
This is what I think.

974
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,152
First, second,

975
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:24,783
- third, and fourth.
- How?

976
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,952
- His answer is similar to mine.
- Really?

977
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,652
Here's what I think.

978
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,953
They're all famous,

979
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:33,521
but the movies that are still talked about are...

980
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,961
"My Sassy Girl" was a huge hit...

981
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,633
and "Friend" as well.

982
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:39,902
That's why there could be a complete twist...

983
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,732
with "My Wife Is a Gangster" in first place.

984
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,331
- He...
- No?

985
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:44,473
(Quiz roadblock, be quiet.)

986
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,601
I'd trust you if I had just met you.

987
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:47,871
But what happened yesterday...

988
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,412
(They were vaccinated the day before.)

989
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:52,513
I doubt that's it.

990
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,382
Which movie won awards at the year-end award ceremony?

991
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:56,752
"Friend," of course.

992
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,552
- Then that's in first place.
- "Friend" dominated.

993
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,922
What about your movie?

994
00:37:00,923 --> 00:37:02,382
We were both rookies,

995
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:04,222
so we took home Best Rookie Actor and Actress.

996
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,161
Even though we get it wrong, it'd be nice for Tae Hyun to put...

997
00:37:07,162 --> 00:37:08,692
- "My Sassy Girl" in second place.
- Right.

998
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,732
- I...
- Tae Hyun.

999
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:11,931
I think "Kick the Moon" was tough to beat.

1000
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,001
Sure. Decide on that, then.

1001
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:16,702
Did "Kick the Moon" also win a lot of awards that year?

1002
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,702
It was talked about a lot...

1003
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,842
even for years to come.

1004
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,673
- Do you want to trust me?
- We should.

1005
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:23,911
We'll decide on that.

1006
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:25,141
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

1007
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,541
Please name the movies in order.

1008
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,082
- "Friend." - "Friend."

1009
00:37:29,182 --> 00:37:31,082
- "Kick the Moon." - In second place.

1010
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,082
"My Sassy Girl" and then "My Wife Is a Gangster."

1011
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:36,291
The order you gave me...

1012
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,192
(Was it the correct answer?)

1013
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:40,162
is incorrect.

1014
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,132
("Friend," "Kick the Moon,")

1015
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,461
("My Sassy Girl," "My Wife Is a Gangster")

1016
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:46,802
That was too tough to answer.

1017
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:48,402
It was tougher than a short-answer question.

1018
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:50,102
How can one guess the correct order?

1019
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:52,672
(Acting weird from the shock of getting it wrong)

1020
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,573
- What's the correct answer then?
- We could get it right...

1021
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:58,673
We could get it right if you told us what came last.

1022
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:00,783
Should we spend ours together?

1023
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,442
- We should.
- Of course.

1024
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:03,811
When will we get this chance again?

1025
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:05,113
Let this be the last time we team up.

1026
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:07,182
Hold on. But I want to be on your team again.

1027
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:08,851
Let's be teammates again.

1028
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:09,952
No. There will be no other chance.

1029
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,122
Let's get this over with.

1030
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,322
Come on. We need to cash this in.

1031
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:14,992
We can't afford to get this wrong.

1032
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,693
(Reattempt card: You may try again after receiving a clue.)

1033
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:21,363
Here's your clue. I'll tell you what you got right.

1034
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,703
- Really?
- Here you go.

1035
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,672
It'll still be tough.

1036
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:25,972
You were right about "Friend..."

1037
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,303
- being in first place.
- Okay.

1038
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:30,271
"My Wife Is a Gangster..."

1039
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:31,342
is in fourth place.

1040
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,082
We only have to swap those two.

1041
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,812
EUNHO and I were right!

1042
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:40,552
Why did you look down on your own movie like that?

1043
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:41,923
Unbelievable.

1044
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:43,851
I guess it's my fault.

1045
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:44,852
EUNHO was right.

1046
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:46,192
(I didn't think too much about my own movie.)

1047
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,692
- EUNHO, you say it.
- Sure.

1048
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,532
- EUNHO will say it.
- You'll get another chance...

1049
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:50,562
to answer it.

1050
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:51,891
(What a bummer.)

1051
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,202
- He got it right.
- EUNHO was right.

1052
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:56,133
Name the four movies in the correct order...

1053
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,802
according to how well it did at the box office.

1054
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,572
"Friend" is in first place. "My Sassy Girl" is in second.

1055
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,271
"Kick the Moon" is in third place...

1056
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:05,942
and "My Wife Is a Gangster" is in fourth place.

1057
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,142
That is correct.

1058
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:10,383
- EUNHO was right all along.
- EUNHO was right.

1059
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:12,922
If only we had gotten it right without using the reattempt card.

1060
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:15,782
Something happens to me every time I'm at Brand New Music.

1061
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:18,493
- I can't believe I couldn't get it.
- Goodness.

1062
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:19,992
If we had listened to him...

1063
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,291
EUNHO, you're a man...

1064
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,562
- Thanks.
- of luck this year.

1065
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,062
Anyway, good job, everyone.

1066
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:27,661
- Good job.
- Thanks. EUNHO, thank you.

1067
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:28,931
It was my pleasure.

1068
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,203
All right.

1069
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:31,371
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1070
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:32,673
Go, EUNHO.

1071
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,802
(1989: Female, 1977: Male, 1989: Male)

1072
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:38,113
(Year 2001)

1073
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,542
(Team Guys)

1074
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,251
(On their way to meet someone born in 2013)

1075
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,422
(Cuckoo)

1076
00:39:46,423 --> 00:39:47,653
Year 2001.

1077
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,053
- Year 2001?
- Year 2001?

1078
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,692
(Startled)

1079
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:52,322
- Year 2001.
- Year 2001.

1080
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,392
(They needed that square in order to complete a line.)

1081
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:56,763
Who was born in 2001?

1082
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:58,093
It's about occupying more squares now.

1083
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,162
I should give her a call.

1084
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:06,303
(He immediately calls Lee Yu Bin.)

1085
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:09,271
- Hello?
- Hello?

1086
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:11,242
Yu Bin, I'm so sorry.

1087
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,742
- It's all right.
- We can't occupy the square...

1088
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,242
on the bingo board...

1089
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,742
once our opponent takes it.

1090
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:16,982
It's all right.

1091
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,081
- Just a second.
- Sure.

1092
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:20,121
Yu Bin, hi.

1093
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:21,652
I wasn't able to greet you earlier.

1094
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,722
I'm actor Shin Seung Ho.

1095
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:24,992
Hello.

1096
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:27,661
Right. I'm so sorry about this.

1097
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,222
It's all right.

1098
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:31,161
Hang in there.

1099
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,762
I'll be rooting for you.

1100
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,862
Gosh, thanks. I think we already lost,

1101
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:37,501
but we'll keep up the spirit to honor your words.

1102
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,001
Happy New Year.

1103
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,641
Beware of any injuries and stay strong.

1104
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:41,673
I'll be rooting for you.

1105
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:44,512
- Thanks for that.
- Thank you.

1106
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:48,481
I promise to treat you to something delicious.

1107
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:50,453
Sure thing.

1108
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:52,251
I feel guilty for doing this.

1109
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:53,953
(It wasn't enough, but they deliver their apology.)

1110
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:57,251
The game isn't over yet. We're here to see Hong Jae Min...

1111
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:58,352
and his mother.

1112
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:00,051
They're here.

1113
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:01,490
- Really?
- Goodness.

1114
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,550
- Hello.
- Hi.

1115
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:03,960
Hello, ma'am.

1116
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

1117
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,861
How about a fist bump?

1118
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,159
- Hi.
- Hi.

1119
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,530
- He's adorable.
- Let's greet the mother.

1120
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:11,960
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

1121
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:13,869
Thank you for sparing your time for us.

1122
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,499
- I'm Oh Sang Uk.
- It's good to see you.

1123
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,740
Didn't you think we were scammers?

1124
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,210
I recognized the friendly voice immediately.

1125
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,470
- My voice?
- Yes.

1126
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:23,179
Anyway, we apologize for asking you here...

1127
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,341
- out of the blue.
- First...

1128
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,211
- Jae Min, will you sit here?
- Okay.

1129
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,679
(He shyly takes a seat.)

1130
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,051
Hello.

1131
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,349
I'm a child actor,

1132
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,150
Hong Jae Min, and I'm 12 years old.

1133
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,019
Nice to meet you, Jae Min.

1134
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,290
(Adorable)

1135
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,729
You're curious about what's going on, aren't you?

1136
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,030
- Yes.
- Well.

1137
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:44,900
- You know bingo, right?
- Yes.

1138
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:47,130
- This is you, Jae Min.
- Jae Min.

1139
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:49,540
- Were you born in 2013?
- Yes.

1140
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:50,941
In the Year of...

1141
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,511
- In the Year of the Snake.
- That's right.

1142
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:55,511
That's why we've come to see you.

1143
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,341
I see.

1144
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,079
(2013, The Year of the Black Snake)

1145
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,280
(Handsome Snake 5: Cuteness overload, Hong Jae Min)

1146
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:06,920
Can you tell us about the shows you have worked on?

1147
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,290
"Under the Queen's Umbrella."

1148
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:11,321
- "Under the Queen's Umbrella?" - The one with Kim Hye Soo.

1149
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:14,490
An epic series, "Korea–Khitan War."

1150
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:15,960
The one with Choi Soo Jong...

1151
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,430
- and Kim Dong Jun.
- Yes.

1152
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,670
A daily drama, "Meant to Be."

1153
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:22,671
- You shot that too?
- Yes.

1154
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,901
Hello, Brother.

1155
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:29,711
(With a cute appearance that captivated online aunties...)

1156
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,551
(and great acting skills, )

1157
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:38,151
(Jae Min has starred in many big dramas.)

1158
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,920
You've done a lot.

1159
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:43,321
- He did more big ones than us.
- That's right.

1160
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:46,990
- He was in masterpieces.
- Right.

1161
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:49,730
(The two actors cringe.)

1162
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,630
(Smiling)

1163
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:55,470
Jae Min, do you know...

1164
00:42:55,471 --> 00:42:56,841
who we are?

1165
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,070
Can you say who we are one by one?

1166
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:01,210
(Well...)

1167
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,909
Don't be nervous. It's okay not to know us.

1168
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,539
- Lee Yi Kyung.
- Lee Yi Kyung.

1169
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,809
And...

1170
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,211
I think I saw you in "Alchemy of Souls."

1171
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:10,721
- You're right.
- "Alchemy of Souls?"

1172
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,249
You're right.

1173
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,420
- And...
- What about him?

1174
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:14,721
(Hesitating)

1175
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:17,490
(Thinking)

1176
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:19,190
- What does he do?
- What do I do?

1177
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:21,159
What do you think his job is?

1178
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,691
I think he's an actor.

1179
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:24,630
How did you know?

1180
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:26,131
(Mischievous uncle)

1181
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,370
I thought so because you were with other actors.

1182
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,071
I'm an actor.

1183
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,240
(I'm playing the role of a handsome actor in Handsome Guys.)

1184
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:35,740
The guy over here...

1185
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,110
- is Oh Sang Uk.
- Okay.

1186
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,150
Of the sports,

1187
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:41,679
do you know fencing where they fight with the swords...

1188
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,221
- like D'Artagnan?
- Yes.

1189
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,220
He is the number one in fencing in the world.

1190
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:48,249
(Surprised)

1191
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,120
I'm an athlete, a fencer.

1192
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,821
(Amazed)

1193
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:53,929
- You're surprised to see a fencer.
- Yes.

1194
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,730
He's number one on the planet.

1195
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,660
Momentarily. It's only for a moment.

1196
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,270
Momentarily.

1197
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,100
I think you're nervous.

1198
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,741
- You're sweating.
- Is he sweating?

1199
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:06,370
Goodness.

1200
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,440
- Do you want a glass of water?
- Yes.

1201
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:09,841
Okay. I know it's nervous.

1202
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:11,511
You can take the jacket off.

1203
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,711
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

1204
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:15,511
- Good.
- Okay.

1205
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,750
(Wiping)

1206
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,990
They are the actors...

1207
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:24,821
- with more experience.
- Yes.

1208
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,060
Is there anything you want to ask them?

1209
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,131
- There is.
- Is there?

1210
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,260
What?

1211
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:31,761
- You can ask us anything.
- Okay.

1212
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:35,230
I get nervous when I'm shooting.

1213
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,941
I want to know how you relax yourselves.

1214
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,270
(How do you relax yourselves?)

1215
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:42,841
I've never had this question before.

1216
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,579
When I was about your age,

1217
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,849
I started playing soccer as a soccer player.

1218
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,990
I was nervous back then, and I'm nervous when I act today.

1219
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,491
This is the method I use.

1220
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,821
When I get nervous,

1221
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:02,261
I think it's a matter of course that I get nervous.

1222
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,660
The nervousness I'm feeling...

1223
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,530
Is it too hard to understand?

1224
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:07,830
That was awful, wasn't it?

1225
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,430
No.

1226
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,570
It sounded awful to me too.

1227
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:13,510
(Joining in)

1228
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:16,269
I need to answer so you can understand.

1229
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,780
It's hard.

1230
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,651
- As for me, - Yes.

1231
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,580
I don't really get nervous.

1232
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:26,449
- But in a nervous situation, - Yes.

1233
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,450
I appreciate it.

1234
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:30,619
(I see.)

1235
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,031
I think his answer was more awful than mine.

1236
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:35,990
(Embarrassed for some reason)

1237
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:38,361
They were all good answers.

1238
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,229
(Sorry. The uncles must have been nervous.)

1239
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,830
Jae Min already...

1240
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,940
has a good attitude.

1241
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:46,200
Exactly.

1242
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,079
Is there anything that worries you recently?

1243
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,741
It doesn't have to be about acting.

1244
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,380
(Thinking)

1245
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:55,111
I want to lose weight.

1246
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,720
(Eating a cookie)

1247
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,680
(Halting)

1248
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,720
Why? Did someone say something?

1249
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,421
- No, that's not it.
- I see.

1250
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,461
To continue acting in the future,

1251
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:10,901
I want to do it after losing weight.

1252
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,970
At your age, you shouldn't...

1253
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,999
be stressed about weight.

1254
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,171
- He shouldn't.
- You won't get tall.

1255
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,079
With a lack of nutrition, you won't get tall.

1256
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,140
Look at him. He's still eating.

1257
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,249
He is...

1258
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,580
How tall were you? Was it 190-something?

1259
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,651
- It's 192.
- He's 192cm tall.

1260
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,990
(He's tall!)

1261
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,250
You have to eat a lot now to be tall.

1262
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:39,090
Like Yi Kyung said, now,

1263
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:41,531
you have to listen to your mom and eat everything you want.

1264
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:44,199
- You look adorable right now.
- Okay.

1265
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,659
When I was in a higher grade in elementary school,

1266
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,970
(While the experienced actors consult him, )

1267
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,301
I was really fat.

1268
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,369
(he takes a bite.)

1269
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,870
(Another bite)

1270
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:54,510
(Sang Uk shows how to be tall himself.)

1271
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,171
I think it'll be all right.

1272
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,910
Well...

1273
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,909
Stop eating.

1274
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,380
(Me?)

1275
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,979
- No.
- You can eat, Jae Min.

1276
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,179
I was talking about this.

1277
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,220
I was talking to Sang Uk. You can keep eating, Jae Min.

1278
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:10,960
They are all yours.

1279
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,361
(Chewing)

1280
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:16,091
You can take your time. I'll read the question slowly.

1281
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:17,361
I was...

1282
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:19,360
We're at a good spot.

1283
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:20,530
(Team Handsome)

1284
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,229
I know that area through and through.

1285
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,300
(They're heading to Dong Hyun's gym to meet the next Snake.)

1286
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:24,540
It's garosu-gil.

1287
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,640
(Touching)

1288
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,671
- Su Jin.
- Yes?

1289
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,579
- Are you home?
- Yes.

1290
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,880
When do you go to study?

1291
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:34,511
- Before 6:30pm.
- I see.

1292
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,519
Can you...

1293
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,151
check if there's a calendar for the year 2025?

1294
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,949
A 2025 calendar?

1295
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,590
(Why is he asking for a calendar all of a sudden?)

1296
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:44,720
We have one.

1297
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:46,320
On that calendar,

1298
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,961
does it say, "The Year of The Blue Snake?"

1299
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,460
"The Year of The Blue Snake?"

1300
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:52,200
If so, what do I do?

1301
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:55,230
If so, I'll go and pick it up.

1302
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,740
Hold on.

1303
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,369
- It's okay if it doesn't say it.
- I found it!

1304
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,570
- What?
- The Year of the Blue Snake.

1305
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:00,840
It's in Chinese characters.

1306
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,971
- It's in Chinese characters?
- Yes.

1307
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:04,909
- In Chinese characters.
- Yes.

1308
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,910
It might not be okay. It should be in Korean.

1309
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,249
Okay. It might not work if it's in Chinese characters.

1310
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,920
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sorry.

1311
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,550
(Unfortunately, he has to end the call.)

1312
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:14,150
That's... No.

1313
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:15,920
Tae Hyun, I'm sure...

1314
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:18,289
Will they say something about it? Right. It was written there.

1315
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,229
It wasn't in Chinese characters.

1316
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,429
You're right.

1317
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,560
I hate when they complain when I'm done with it.

1318
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,530
You've arrived at your destination.

1319
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:27,531
(They arrive in front of Dong Hyun's gym.)

1320
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:29,971
Real estate agencies usually have many calendars.

1321
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,139
- Do they?
- Yes.

1322
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,340
Should I go and ask?

1323
00:48:32,341 --> 00:48:33,941
- I know a guy there.
- The agents...

1324
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,570
(Team Handsome goes the real estate agency by the gym.)

1325
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:36,809
- Hello.
- Yes.

1326
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,809
Do you have a calendar for the year 2025?

1327
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,110
The 2025 calendar.

1328
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:43,321
- That's it. It's over. Come.
- Why?

1329
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:44,950
- You got it?
- Tae Hyun.

1330
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:47,120
- Does it say, "Year?" - "Year."

1331
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:48,850
- It says the Year of 2022.
- Year.

1332
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:50,890
It's over.

1333
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,229
- It's done.
- Thank you.

1334
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,861
We got "Year."

1335
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:56,429
(They're about to enter the gym.)

1336
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,760
(Scanning)

1337
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:58,929
Is it on the second floor?

1338
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,070
Blue.

1339
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,130
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

1340
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:02,600
- I'll take another photo.
- Okay.

1341
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,769
"Blue."

1342
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,110
(He gets the "Blue" of the Year of the Blue Snake.)

1343
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,610
We're getting it one by one.

1344
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:11,741
(They enter Dong Hyun's gym while collecting letter by letter.)

1345
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,250
Look at the shoes.

1346
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,850
(Filled with the traces of the UFC-ranking Dong Hyun)

1347
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:21,019
(It's Dong Hyun's gym on garosu-gil.)

1348
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,491
- This is my gym.
- Okay.

1349
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,261
It's where the fighters work out.

1350
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,390
(Pushing down)

1351
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:26,860
Wasn't it on the basement level?

1352
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:29,490
We have tough training in the morning here.

1353
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:32,131
We have a shower room, a resting area, and everything.

1354
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:33,729
It's nice here.

1355
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,430
It's a place they can enjoy freely.

1356
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:37,100
As for us, we do...

1357
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:38,869
(He sits on the workout equipment.)

1358
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,310
this in the morning.

1359
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,409
For example,

1360
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,410
we ride this for a minute,

1361
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,111
then we go off and do the other one.

1362
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,380
Do it.

1363
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:50,881
(The demo starts.)

1364
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,820
(As he pedals faster, )

1365
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:54,551
(the sound gets louder.)

1366
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,159
And that is...

1367
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,220
(Now that I showed them how to do it...)

1368
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:00,230
- Me?
- Try it now.

1369
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,600
Where is the wind coming from?

1370
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:06,000
Do it faster.

1371
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:08,031
Step it much harder so that it'll make noise.

1372
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,070
- Harder. What's with the wind?
- Goodness.

1373
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:11,800
Aim to reach 100rpm.

1374
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,869
(He pedals hard until his hair flies.)

1375
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,539
- Harder.
- Harder.

1376
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,140
The sound is so weak.

1377
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,640
Harder.

1378
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,950
It's hard.

1379
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:25,051
- You have to make that big noise.
- Manually.

1380
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,651
(Sang Hyeok is the second one to try it.)

1381
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,760
(Though he looks awkward, )

1382
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,920
Good.

1383
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:34,130
(it makes an incredible noise from start.)

1384
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,260
Back and forth.

1385
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:37,300
(The rpm keeps increasing.)

1386
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,900
Good. Keep going.

1387
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:41,230
Let's get the gold medal. Let's go.

1388
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,941
Harder. A little more.

1389
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:45,500
Let's go. Two.

1390
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,970
You burnt 22kcal.

1391
00:50:48,971 --> 00:50:50,111
(Trainer Kim is satisfied.)

1392
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,741
- Amazing.
- Are you okay?

1393
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:53,040
- Was it hard?
- No.

1394
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,980
- It wouldn't be hard for him.
- No.

1395
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:58,449
What is that? Look.

1396
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,250
- Is that for this?
- For pull-ups.

1397
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:02,119
Amazing.

1398
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,250
(I should demonstrate it for them.)

1399
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:07,329
(Easy)

1400
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,389
Gosh. This is like...

1401
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,131
a playground for you.

1402
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,599
It's my favorite playground.

1403
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,700
(He does pull-ups in perfect posture.)

1404
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,131
Gosh. I love it.

1405
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,341
I'm feeling great all of a sudden.

1406
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:19,841
I didn't work out today.

1407
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:21,840
I love it.

1408
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:23,910
You can do it after taking a short break.

1409
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:26,441
Gosh. You can reach it?

1410
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,949
(Showing an amazing height)

1411
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,051
Be careful with your ring.

1412
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,619
(Pull-ups 101)

1413
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,761
You do many pull-ups.

1414
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:39,321
I can tell by his posture.

1415
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:41,830
- He does a lot of them.
- He's good.

1416
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:44,401
I always have six packs.

1417
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,300
(Amazed)

1418
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,301
It's real muscle from training.

1419
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:50,139
I can tell you do lots of pull-ups.

1420
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,840
(A national athlete excels at everything.)

1421
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:55,409
Actually, when Sang Hyeok is playing the game,

1422
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,680
he has a certain look and pose before he runs.

1423
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,380
He does this while smiling.

1424
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:00,510
Why do you do this?

1425
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:02,310
- Like this.
- He does this.

1426
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:04,651
(Shaking)

1427
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,920
(With a roaring cheer, )

1428
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:07,921
(Shaking)

1429
00:52:07,922 --> 00:52:09,250
(he does the well-known move.)

1430
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:11,120
- Like this.
- My shoulder can't turn.

1431
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:12,920
- Okay.
- It can't turn...

1432
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,160
counterclockwise.

1433
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,889
- You're holding it down?
- Right.

1434
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,229
When I step and turn counterclockwise,

1435
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,531
- Like this.
- then I'll fly away.

1436
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,400
You mean you end up turning too much.

1437
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,841
Because of our body structure,

1438
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:28,010
with the torque after we run,

1439
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,710
- our shoulders...
- Aren't you panting so hard?

1440
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:31,010
If my shoulder turns...

1441
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:32,441
You're out of breath.

1442
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,350
- Aren't you panting so hard?
- If my shoulder turns...

1443
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,780
- You end up like this.
- Yes.

1444
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,220
When I do this,

1445
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,720
my body remembers which way to go.

1446
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:44,389
I can go higher vertically that way.

1447
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,760
Exactly. You always do this before you run.

1448
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:47,130
- Like this.
- Right.

1449
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,930
- With a smile.
- Yes. There's something to it.

1450
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:52,801
Now, you talked with us today.

1451
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,999
- We solve a quiz here.
- Do you like quizzes?

1452
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,300
- Do you want to do it together?
- Yes.

1453
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,539
Okay. Good.

1454
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,241
We'll solve a quiz with Jae Min today.

1455
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,810
Give us the quiz.

1456
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:07,010
In 2013, kimchi-making was selected as UNESCO's...

1457
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,950
Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

1458
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,979
It was the first time...

1459
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,821
that Korean food culture to be selected for it.

1460
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,790
The reason they chose kimchi-making, instead of kimchi,

1461
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,160
because they viewed the significance of this highly.

1462
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,190
What is this significance?

1463
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:24,460
(The reason they chose kimchi-making, instead of kimchi, )

1464
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:25,801
(because they take this significance highly. What is this?)

1465
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,800
Kimchi-making is...

1466
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,199
(Thinking hard)

1467
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,741
Have you made kimchi before?

1468
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,539
- I saw people making kimchi.
- You did.

1469
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,540
(Unfamiliar)

1470
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,010
I think...

1471
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,679
(Uncle Seung Ho starts guessing first.)

1472
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,110
Usually, we exchange labor of kimchi-making.

1473
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:45,421
- I thought of it too.
- It's the concept of collaboration.

1474
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:47,421
Or the process of aging it?

1475
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:49,691
Fermentation?

1476
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,691
That's more of...

1477
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,031
Some kimchi...

1478
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,961
doesn't require fermentation.

1479
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,499
(Glancing)

1480
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,071
Since we've been doing it for a long time,

1481
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:06,700
it includes our national spirit, doesn't it?

1482
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,111
He said the most plausible sentence among us.

1483
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:13,011
(Demonstrating intelligence)

1484
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,409
What are the criteria for becoming the UNESCO's Masterpieces...

1485
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,151
of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity?

1486
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,949
It must be something...

1487
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,250
that shocks the world.

1488
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:24,091
It's a dish we have at home...

1489
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:28,090
and it's something we make together and share it.

1490
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:29,829
Would they find that interesting?

1491
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,200
That was what I was thinking.

1492
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,800
In the foreigners' eyes,

1493
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:33,970
(The other difference of kimchi-making is...)

1494
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,300
Korean affection might be interesting.

1495
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:36,301
(Korean affection?)

1496
00:54:36,302 --> 00:54:39,171
Korean affection? That makes sense.

1497
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,670
It's about that relationship.

1498
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:41,671
(Based on that relationship)

1499
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:43,341
Family and collaboration.

1500
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:45,741
I think it's about sharing too.

1501
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:48,110
They all sound right to me.

1502
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:49,449
- Right?
- It's hard.

1503
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,381
I think we're on the same track.

1504
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,651
In that case, kimchi-making is...

1505
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:58,790
about everyone getting together to make kimchi.

1506
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,390
They provide labor for one another.

1507
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,229
And they share the kimchi.

1508
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,301
They exchange and share love.

1509
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,300
Did you hear that?

1510
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:09,571
That was our answer.

1511
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,970
- We're listening.
- He said it.

1512
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:14,510
They found it amazing and valued highly of that act of kimchi-making.

1513
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,410
That is why they chose it.

1514
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:19,011
The very long answer you had...

1515
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,480
(Nervous)

1516
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:28,091
is correct.

1517
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,860
Jae Min.

1518
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,159
- Good job.
- Nicely done.

1519
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,060
We got it, thanks to you.

1520
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:37,761
Let's hold hands together.

1521
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,671
The game will end soon.

1522
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,699
(Chanting)

1523
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,801
That's it.

1524
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,441
Jae Min, will you put the seal here?

1525
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,970
Jae Min has good energy.

1526
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:49,071
(Jae Min puts on the sticker with his good energy.)

1527
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,611
Two, three.

1528
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,480
- Hong Jae Min.
- Hong Jae Min.

1529
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:54,580
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1530
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:01,389
Do you know what a fortune cookie is?

1531
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,691
- Yes.
- Good.

1532
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,290
- Please pick one yourself.
- It's random.

1533
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:08,691
You have to be careful because there might be an awful one.

1534
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:10,860
Come on.

1535
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:12,530
(Careful)

1536
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:14,500
He picked carefully.

1537
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,270
(Excited)

1538
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:20,611
There's the paper.

1539
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,840
"This year,"

1540
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:25,479
"you can achieve everything..."

1541
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,111
"in whatever challenge you put yourself up to."

1542
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,211
"Don't hesitate. Just go for it."

1543
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,580
You picked a good one among everything.

1544
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,249
(Excited)

1545
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,059
He was shy when he spoke to us.

1546
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,890
But you have a really good vocal even though you're young.

1547
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,060
Is there something you want to say?

1548
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,360
In 2025, I hope all the viewers and actors...

1549
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:49,071
will have nothing but happy moments.

1550
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,901
I'll pray for it.

1551
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,741
- Thank you.
- Gosh. Thank you.

1552
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:57,539
Jae Min, good job.

1553
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,241
- Well done. Seriously.
- Good job.

1554
00:56:59,881 --> 00:57:01,449
- Okay.
- We'll talk a bit here.

1555
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,450
Okay.

1556
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:05,120
- Jae Min, don't forget your jacket.
- Right.

1557
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:06,650
- Yes.
- You'll get cold...

1558
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:07,820
when the sweat cools down.

1559
00:57:07,821 --> 00:57:08,890
(Right. My jacket.)

1560
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:11,059
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1561
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,860
Okay. Thank you, Jae Min.

1562
00:57:12,861 --> 00:57:13,889
Okay. Good luck.

1563
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:14,890
- Happy New Year.
- Good job.

1564
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:17,160
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Happy New Year.

1565
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,200
(Team Handsome)

1566
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,401
Sang Hyeok, do you use something like this too?

1567
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,970
- Me?
- This is something...

1568
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:27,510
(Cuckoo)

1569
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:28,671
Year 2013.

1570
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:30,010
- Year 2013?
- Year 2013?

1571
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,241
How did they find them?

1572
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,480
Who was born in 2013?

1573
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:36,211
They must have met with a child actor.

1574
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,380
Year 2013?

1575
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:39,179
(Puzzled)

1576
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,820
It'll be a problem if we don't get it with Ho Il.

1577
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:43,019
We're tied. We never know.

1578
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,119
We can't let our guard down.

1579
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,720
I've never let my guard down. We just got the question wrong.

1580
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:48,289
(Sulky)

1581
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,591
It isn't easy.

1582
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,100
(At that moment...)

1583
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:55,301
Hey.

1584
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:58,640
(He's here.)

1585
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,370
For goodness' sake.

1586
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:02,409
- Hello.
- Gosh. Hi.

1587
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,179
You've come to my humble place. Hello.

1588
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,039
- Hello.
- Happy New Year.

1589
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,480
- Hello.
- Gosh. Hello.

1590
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,580
(He burst onto the music industry in the 1990s.)

1591
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,749
(With a mega-hit of the 3rd album...)

1592
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,119
("Very Old Couples" in 1992,)

1593
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,861
(he established himself as the idol of the Generation X.)

1594
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:21,929
(In 1993, with "Love of a New Generation,")

1595
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,801
(he swept the end-of-year awards.)

1596
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,631
(Three albums became million-sellers consecutively.)

1597
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:35,640
(Jang Ho Il, the guitarist of 015B, the icon of the Generation X)

1598
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:38,140
Hey. I have Ho Il's number.

1599
00:58:38,611 --> 00:58:40,409
- Hello?
- Ho Il.

1600
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,979
(They reached Ho Il, who was born in 1965.)

1601
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,550
If you're available today,

1602
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:46,020
- we can meet up.
- Right.

1603
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:49,449
I have an appointment, so until 3pm to 4pm,

1604
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,620
- I can't go anywhere.
- Is that so?

1605
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,720
It'd be easier for me to go there.

1606
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:54,789
Really?

1607
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:58,100
I'll text you the location.

1608
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,471
Okay. For now, it's all right.

1609
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,999
Hello.

1610
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,870
I'm Jang Ho Il of 015B.

1611
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:06,341
- Yes.
- He's our hope.

1612
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,909
In the morning,

1613
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,909
I didn't know I'd be here in the afternoon.

1614
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,909
- Exactly.
- Where were you before this?

1615
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,479
I was getting ready to go out for an appointment.

1616
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,050
I suddenly got a call from him,

1617
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:19,220
telling me to come in a hurry. So, here I am now,

1618
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:21,421
- but I don't know what's going on.
- Right.

1619
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,320
I think I called you like this...

1620
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:25,119
- a few years ago.
- A couple of years ago.

1621
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,820
A couple of years ago,

1622
00:59:26,821 --> 00:59:28,329
Tae Hyun was shooting for a drama.

1623
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,861
He called me all out of the blue...

1624
00:59:30,091 --> 00:59:31,499
and asked me to be in the drama...

1625
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,401
as a special guest.

1626
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,970
I said I'd do it happily.

1627
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,199
But the first thing he said was...

1628
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,441
"But you'll die as soon as you appear."

1629
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:40,341
(Shall we watch the scene together?)

1630
00:59:40,342 --> 00:59:41,511
In the first episode...

1631
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:45,610
(Ho Il made an appearance in a drama...)

1632
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:47,651
(as a guitarist of a popular band.)

1633
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:55,151
(But in just 5 minutes after he made an appearance, )

1634
00:59:56,221 --> 01:00:00,320
(he faces a tragic end.)

1635
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:02,889
- It was a sudden appearance...
- It was about two years ago.

1636
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,530
And a sudden death.

1637
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:06,900
- I got a sudden call again today.
- Right. Again today.

1638
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:09,301
Then he told me to come to a gym.

1639
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:11,539
"Is he going to treat me harshly again?"

1640
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,270
- "Am I going to die again?" - I see.

1641
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,809
(I won't hurt you.)

1642
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,039
Recently, I shot a drama again.

1643
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,110
Which one?

1644
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:20,579
It's even hard for the actors...

1645
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,249
- to find a job these days.
- I know.

1646
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,949
- It's all thanks to...
- Did the acting back then...

1647
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,179
- help you get it?
- Of course.

1648
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,880
- It sparked everything.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1649
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:28,390
Which role did you play this time?

1650
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:31,159
I'm one of the presidents of a company.

1651
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
- I see.
- It suits you well.

1652
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,890
Hence, the hairstyle.

1653
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,860
- He suits the role well.
- This time,

1654
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:37,600
do you die quickly again?

1655
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,829
No, it's a proper role this time.

1656
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,801
- So, it's until the end.
- I'll be in it until the end.

1657
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,270
- Actually...
- It's all thanks to Tae Hyun.

1658
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:46,370
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1659
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:48,310
I heard a new song recently.

1660
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:51,941
We... You might not believe it,

1661
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,381
- but we release a song every month.
- You're right.

1662
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:56,310
- Like Yoon Jong Shin.
- Yes.

1663
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,949
(While collaborating with young musicians...)

1664
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,191
(such as O.WHEN and Band Nah, )

1665
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:08,591
(Band 015B has been releasing a song every month since 2018.)

1666
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,261
Do you have a particular goal for this year?

1667
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,171
- I always have a simple wish.
- Yes.

1668
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:17,369
I hope I can keep doing...

1669
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,539
the music I love continuously and well...

1670
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,170
- without any problem.
- That's right.

1671
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:23,309
I hope to perform too.

1672
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:27,210
Let's see if you won't have any problems this year.

1673
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:28,611
- Okay.
- A fortune-teller will join us.

1674
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:32,079
Let's hear from him right away.

1675
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,620
- My heart is fluttering.
- It's so...

1676
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,461
(Time for Fortune Reading)

1677
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:40,590
- He's Jang Ho Il.
- Hello.

1678
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:41,930
- It's nice to meet you.
- Have you heard of 015B?

1679
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,900
When I went to the karaoke in elementary school,

1680
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,929
the list of popular songs...

1681
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,900
- always had 015B.
- That's right.

1682
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:51,699
We're confident...

1683
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,510
because we have a song that transcends generations,

1684
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,511
- "Goodbye Now." - That's right.

1685
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,840
("Goodbye Now" by 015B)

1686
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:06,150
(It's the national song of farewell that's still played at graduations.)

1687
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:07,590
It's a song even kindergarteners know.

1688
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:09,190
"Goodbye Now" is like that.

1689
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:11,690
- So we can confidently ask, - That's right.

1690
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:12,821
"You know that song, right?"

1691
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,630
It's such a great song. The band was the best...

1692
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,789
back in our time.

1693
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,860
May I do the fortune read for you?

1694
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,330
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

1695
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,970
When is your birthday?

1696
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,599
It's September 10, 1965.

1697
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,610
I'll do the reading with your birthday.

1698
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,139
- I was born at noon.
- Noon.

1699
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,979
- Ho Il, - Okay.

1700
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,941
You were born as fire. You have the strong wood element.

1701
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,110
People with the strong wood element...

1702
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:40,050
have young looks. They live young...

1703
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,349
- compared to their age.
- It's true.

1704
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,849
He does live young.

1705
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,020
You're actually a scholarly type.

1706
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:48,190
He has always been good at studying.

1707
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,430
He went to a prestigious university.

1708
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,400
Which university did you go to?

1709
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,929
I went to S University.

1710
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,070
- Seoul National University?
- Yes.

1711
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,530
- Didn't you know?
- I didn't know.

1712
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:58,341
(Ho Il was a good student.)

1713
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:01,139
I know someone famous who has a similar fate as yours.

1714
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,909
He works in the creative field.

1715
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,441
He works in an advertising company.

1716
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,979
I worked in an advertising company.

1717
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,080
What?

1718
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:09,150
I worked in an advertising company.

1719
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:12,420
I made music as 015B and worked in an advertising company at 1st.

1720
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,449
(Ho Il made music and worked in a company at first.)

1721
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,551
That's incredible.

1722
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,820
I worked there for about three years.

1723
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:19,059
The company gave me an early promotion.

1724
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,460
They made me an assistant manager in two years.

1725
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,461
I was a promising employee.

1726
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:23,190
(He was a promising employee at an advertising company.)

1727
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:25,560
But I began getting more work at the company...

1728
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:29,030
while gaining more attention as 015B.

1729
01:03:29,031 --> 01:03:31,440
I was at the crossroads, so I thought hard about...

1730
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,400
what I needed to do in life.

1731
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:36,111
I turned in my resignation letter and chose a career in music.

1732
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:37,711
You chose well.

1733
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,039
I was anxious back then,

1734
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,910
- but things worked out well.
- Seriously.

1735
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,510
That's so fascinating.

1736
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:45,180
(They heard about his life before 015B by chance.)

1737
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:47,249
That's incredible.

1738
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,551
So that's one aspect of your life.

1739
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:53,221
In your later years... Especially next year, your fortune will change.

1740
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,691
(Wasn't he very different just a moment ago?)

1741
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,530
The artistic world...

1742
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:01,801
you have will deepen.

1743
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:04,099
You'll continue to do what others don't do.

1744
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,699
But it'll become a genre of its own.

1745
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,869
A genre of its own.

1746
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,470
- Do you have something in mind?
- No.

1747
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,910
I don't know what it is.

1748
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,280
Your characters tell me that you'll continue to do...

1749
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:17,620
creative work in your later years.

1750
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,079
You'll be even more successful in your later years.

1751
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,679
(Ho Il's musical life has a bright future.)

1752
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,349
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

1753
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,290
I'm so glad that I came here today.

1754
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:25,721
I'm so happy.

1755
01:04:25,721 --> 01:04:26,721
(Happy)

1756
01:04:26,722 --> 01:04:28,330
I think I found my fate.

1757
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,900
Thank you.

1758
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,830
The fortune-teller is the best.

1759
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,770
My goodness.

1760
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:37,540
- For years...
- Hey, Seung Ho.

1761
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,870
Tae Hyun.

1762
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:40,270
What is it?

1763
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:42,910
Where are you going?

1764
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:45,079
It's none of your business.

1765
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,281
(There's no way he'll tell them so easily.)

1766
01:04:46,881 --> 01:04:49,980
We called to use a verifying the truth card.

1767
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,381
So you have that card.

1768
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:54,651
I forgot about the new card.

1769
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,020
Send me a screenshot of your bank balance.

1770
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:00,660
That's good. I'm curious as well.

1771
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,590
There isn't anything interesting about my bank balance.

1772
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:05,360
Here's what we want to ask.

1773
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:07,530
We had agreed to meet up with someone who was born in 2001.

1774
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:09,099
That person was waiting.

1775
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,229
You should've moved faster.

1776
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,571
(Being annoying)

1777
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,241
- I'm sorry, but...
- He's so aggravating.

1778
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:15,440
All right.

1779
01:05:15,441 --> 01:05:18,840
In any case, we want to know which square you're working on next.

1780
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:21,180
Then we'll exclude that square when we look for someone.

1781
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:24,050
Is that your question for the verifying the truth card?

1782
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:25,151
Yes, it is.

1783
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:27,520
Then we'll put him on the phone.

1784
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:29,990
They met someone.

1785
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:31,321
(Nodding)

1786
01:05:31,491 --> 01:05:32,760
Hello.

1787
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:33,860
(Whose voice is it?)

1788
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:35,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

1789
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,100
I'm a member of 015B,

1790
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:39,929
Jang Ho Il.

1791
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:40,999
(I see.)

1792
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,800
Ho Il, I love your songs.

1793
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:43,929
It's nice to talk to you.

1794
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,670
Did Tae Hyun recruit you?

1795
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:47,869
Yes, I came out suddenly upon receiving his call.

1796
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,940
I was in Gyeonggi Province,

1797
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:50,979
but I came all the way to Seoul.

1798
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,309
Are you in Gangnam, Seoul?

1799
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,479
(He asks about the current location.)

1800
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,150
- Ho Il, stop right there.
- Okay.

1801
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:58,420
You should tell us where you're at.

1802
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,950
What? Aren't you asking too many questions?

1803
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,550
Then send us a screenshot of your bank balance.

1804
01:06:03,551 --> 01:06:05,760
- We'll ignore what you said.
- My goodness.

1805
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,160
We're in Gangnam.

1806
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,929
- I see that they didn't move today.
- They met everyone in Gangnam.

1807
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,630
We could meet everyone in Gangnam.

1808
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,800
We got lucky.

1809
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:16,170
Did the information help?

1810
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:19,269
The remaining squares are 1941...

1811
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,640
and 1953.

1812
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,441
Please introduce us to Uhm Young Soo.

1813
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,110
Uhm Young Soo?

1814
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:29,010
(We don't know Uhm Young Soo very well.)

1815
01:06:29,011 --> 01:06:31,179
There are also Tae Jin Ah and...

1816
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,880
That's right. That's a good option.

1817
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:35,190
Kim Hye Ja. Please give us their phone numbers.

1818
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,289
I'm hanging up now.

1819
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,160
- Okay.
- Eat something tasty.

1820
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,660
- Okay.
- All right.

1821
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,029
(Sighing)

1822
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,430
A member of 015B.

1823
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:44,631
It's something Tae Hyun can do.

1824
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:49,671
Even if we do our absolute best and get a square, it'll be 4 to 3.

1825
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:53,240
I want to go to one more place, but our options are...

1826
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,540
Our options are limited.

1827
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,739
- Let's wrap it up nicely.
- Is it time for a quiz?

1828
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,681
Ho Il, it'll be the best if you can answer the question.

1829
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,819
What kind of a quiz do you usually get?

1830
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,619
- The quiz is a bit hard.
- is it hard?

1831
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,921
We got this question earlier.

1832
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,720
Until the 1980s...

1833
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:12,319
- There were limitations.
- There were limitations.

1834
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,421
Limitations?

1835
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,359
- When the economy improved, - When it improved...

1836
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,600
a ban on something was lifted in 1989.

1837
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:19,830
Then people could enjoy it freely.

1838
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,399
It marked the liberalization of the nation.

1839
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,439
- Overseas travel?
- That's it!

1840
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,471
Overseas travel?

1841
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,739
- That's it!
- I see.

1842
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,939
Overseas travel.

1843
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,770
- I answered correctly.
- I see.

1844
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:33,440
- You guys are from that era.
- That's right.

1845
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,480
You might get a question like that.

1846
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:37,720
That happened in our time.

1847
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,119
- The ban got lifted.
- That's right.

1848
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,150
The lyrics of 015B's song reflected that.

1849
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:43,989
In the middle of "Essay and Vehicle..."

1850
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,020
Is it in that song?

1851
01:07:45,021 --> 01:07:46,689
("Essay and Vehicle" is a song from 015B's 3rd album...)

1852
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,530
(which described the changed lives in the 1990s.)

1853
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:54,260
(Overseas travel)

1854
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:59,801
(Whether or not you've done it is considered important)

1855
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:02,909
Rich people traveled overseas early on...

1856
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,641
- and bragged about it.
- They bragged about it.

1857
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,380
"Have you traveled abroad? Haven't you done it yet?"

1858
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,579
I could answer a quiz like that.

1859
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,020
It's related to the era.

1860
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,350
- Is it related to the era?
- Yes.

1861
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,851
We got such questions.

1862
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:19,359
(Time for Quiz)

1863
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,060
In 1965, a drawing about the various aspects...

1864
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:27,560
of people's lives in the 2000s was printed...

1865
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,499
- in a newspaper.
- I know what it is.

1866
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,670
Some parts of the drawing were accurate predictions...

1867
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:35,040
while other parts weren't.

1868
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:37,640
What goes in the "Blank..."

1869
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:39,909
of the drawing?

1870
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:40,980
My goodness.

1871
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:42,279
I think I've seen this drawing.

1872
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,409
Me too.

1873
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,020
"Various aspects of the daily life. In 35 years,"

1874
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,289
"how much will our lives change?"

1875
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,989
Thirty-five years later...

1876
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,119
- The 2000s.
- The 2000s.

1877
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,420
They made this prediction in 1965.

1878
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,560
(How did people predict the future in 1965?)

1879
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:54,761
A small TV.

1880
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,160
It was actually made.

1881
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:59,261
- There are no moving roads.
- They exist at airports.

1882
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:01,431
- There are escalators too.
- You mean the moving walkways.

1883
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:02,670
The moving walkways.

1884
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,439
- "Study at home." - We do study at home.

1885
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,999
- Electric cars.
- There are electric cars.

1886
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,039
"I can do the cleaning." There are robot vacuums.

1887
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,140
- Robot vacuums.
- We have everything.

1888
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:12,539
People thought that these imaginations were absurd.

1889
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,341
But most of them came true.

1890
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,449
(Among them)

1891
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:20,981
(A question from 1965)

1892
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:24,350
- Is it going to the moon?
- Yes.

1893
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,689
It's going to the moon.

1894
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,159
"Space travel?"

1895
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,859
People say that space travel will be possible.

1896
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,930
Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.

1897
01:09:31,931 --> 01:09:33,301
(Is it about a trip to a planet like Mars?)

1898
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,869
Maybe it's about Chuseok or Jeongwol Daeboreum.

1899
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,340
"Ride this to see the full moon!"

1900
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,539
Chuseok.

1901
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,670
He's going to the moon.

1902
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,210
The destination has been decided.

1903
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,270
He's going to the moon.

1904
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:44,680
- That's right.
- But...

1905
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,039
I don't think it's "Overseas travel."

1906
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,680
If it's "Space travel..."

1907
01:09:48,681 --> 01:09:50,680
"Ride this for space travel" would be too obvious.

1908
01:09:50,681 --> 01:09:52,351
Right? It'd be too obvious.

1909
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,920
He's going to the moon.

1910
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:56,850
It's really funny.

1911
01:09:56,851 --> 01:09:58,220
- Hold on.
- It's...

1912
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:00,489
- I think it's a trip.
- Okay.

1913
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,789
I just thought of something.

1914
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:03,189
- He looks like a student.
- Okay.

1915
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:08,171
Maybe it's "Ride this for a school trip!"

1916
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,240
"A school trip" is a good guess.

1917
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:14,970
- It's too long to be "A picnic." - It's too long.

1918
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:16,239
"Ride this for a picnic."

1919
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,310
(Considering the size of the blank, "A picnic" is too short.)

1920
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:19,739
Four characters are this long, right?

1921
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,279
Four characters.

1922
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,011
- The size is the same.
- There are four characters.

1923
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,221
You measured the length with precision.

1924
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:27,680
- I think there are 4 characters.
- I think there are 4 characters.

1925
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,290
It's "A school trip." I think Ho Il will be a hero.

1926
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,620
It'll be embarrassing if my answer is incorrect.

1927
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,829
"Ride this for a school trip!"

1928
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,131
(Answer: Ride this for a school trip!)

1929
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:38,730
"A school trip."

1930
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:40,899
(Desperate)

1931
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,999
(Please)

1932
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,841
- "Ride this for a school trip!" - "Ride this for a school trip!"

1933
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:51,740
(Team Guys)

1934
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:54,210
(The food they acquired)

1935
01:10:54,211 --> 01:10:56,551
(Burger)

1936
01:10:57,311 --> 01:11:01,190
(Team Guys is moving to eat burgers.)

1937
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,091
(One thought comes to mind.)

1938
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:07,521
They got the quiz wrong.

1939
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,360
- What?
- They got the quiz wrong...

1940
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:13,060
for the 1965 square.

1941
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,159
(It has been a while, but they haven't heard the alarm.)

1942
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,271
We haven't heard the alarm.

1943
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,671
That means we can go for the 1965 square.

1944
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:21,311
That's right. I think we should find someone in Sangam-dong.

1945
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,340
(They arrive at a drive-thru with hopeful thoughts.)

1946
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:26,010
We arrived at a drive-thru.

1947
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:27,079
Shubi dubap

1948
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,680
(They order quickly.)

1949
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:30,511
One large set and...

1950
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,580
Thank you. All right.

1951
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,021
I think they failed the quiz for the 1965 square.

1952
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:37,289
Did they fail the quiz?

1953
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,890
Otherwise...

1954
01:11:38,891 --> 01:11:41,329
We can't go for the 1953 square.

1955
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,659
(Cuckoo)

1956
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,290
Year 1965.

1957
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:49,829
(Laughing)

1958
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,199
Now,

1959
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,770
- we can just enjoy the burger.
- Yes.

1960
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:54,771
(We can just enjoy the burger.)

1961
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:57,070
I suddenly lost...

1962
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,981
my appetite for a burger.

1963
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,780
I say that, but I'll enjoy the food.

1964
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:07,250
(He's enjoying the food already.)

1965
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,220
It's still tasty.

1966
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:10,690
(It's still tasty.)

1967
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:11,990
Enjoy the food.

1968
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:13,359
(Eating)

1969
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,961
My voracious juniors.

1970
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,061
It's tasty.

1971
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,301
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1972
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,170
We're quite cheerful.

1973
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,200
(We're quite cheerful.)

1974
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,700
(Seung Ho takes a bite as well.)

1975
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,481
(While having a tearful eating show, )

1976
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:34,779
(they return to the base.)

1977
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,181
It'll be embarrassing if my answer is incorrect.

1978
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,320
"Ride this for a school trip!"

1979
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,249
It's correct.

1980
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,921
(Answer: Ride this for a school trip!)

1981
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,720
(Ho Il, you're the best.)

1982
01:12:46,721 --> 01:12:47,820
That's right.

1983
01:12:48,891 --> 01:12:50,860
I think I've seen it before.

1984
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,131
You know, he didn't disappoint.

1985
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,530
(Ride this for a school trip!)

1986
01:12:57,631 --> 01:12:59,500
I got lucky and answered correctly.

1987
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,569
He's a hero.

1988
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,311
I have no regrets today.

1989
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,981
- You'll be successful this year.
- Thank you.

1990
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,579
I'll work hard so that my music becomes a genre of its own.

1991
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1992
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,021
- Let's go, 015B!
- Let's go, 015B!

1993
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,320
This is incredible.

1994
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:22,529
It's bulgogi. How will we eat this?

1995
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,560
Seriously.

1996
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:25,899
We haven't even eaten instant tteokbokki before you came.

1997
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,601
- We need to eat both dishes.
- I see.

1998
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,570
(They got instant tteokbokki for the 2001 square.)

1999
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,869
Dong Hyun, let's go and wait.

2000
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,141
Afterward...

2001
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:37,340
Let's go there.

2002
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:39,409
We don't want to make Ho Il wait.

2003
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,481
(They decided to eat after meeting up with Ho Il!)

2004
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,579
(Failure to eat the food after getting the quiz right...)

2005
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,020
(will make them lose the squares they acquired...)

2006
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,421
(and the score will go back to 2 to 2!)

2007
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:50,489
(Current time, 6:30pm)

2008
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,660
Hey,

2009
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,421
- we should hurry up.
- Yes.

2010
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,561
- Let's hurry up.
- This isn't easy.

2011
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,489
We need to hurry up.

2012
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,060
(Team Handsome hurriedly heads over to the assembly location.)

2013
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,560
We just need to get "Handsome Guys," right?

2014
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,830
- Yes. "Handsome Guys." - Now...

2015
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,529
Let's put in our order at the tteokbokki place...

2016
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:06,101
and eat as soon as we enter.

2017
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:08,811
Then I can run over and order bulgogi.

2018
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,340
What's the time of arrival?

2019
01:14:10,341 --> 01:14:11,579
It was 7:10pm.

2020
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,409
I think it got pushed to 7:20pm.

2021
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,710
(If the time of arrival is 7:20pm...)

2022
01:14:15,711 --> 01:14:16,711
(The race ends at 8pm.)

2023
01:14:16,712 --> 01:14:18,180
(They need to finish the task for a wishing happy new year card, )

2024
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:22,390
(eat instant tteokbokki, and eat bulgogi in 40 minutes.)

2025
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,489
Let's put in an order on our way there...

2026
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,060
- and eat hurriedly.
- Someone should eat.

2027
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,319
Other members should get the characters for "Handsome Guys."

2028
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,591
We just need to take photos for "Handsome Guys."

2029
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,830
It'll be okay as soon as we get "Some."

2030
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:35,130
- Is there a way we can find it?
- "Some?"

2031
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:36,301
Google Woo.

2032
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:37,700
"Some."

2033
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,410
The beauty store has a cosmetics brand called Some Blossom.

2034
01:14:44,641 --> 01:14:47,440
- Google Woo is the best.
- Some Blossom.

2035
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:49,550
- Some Blossom.
- Yes.

2036
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:50,880
Google Woo.

2037
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:52,820
- Google Woo is incredible.
- He's incredible.

2038
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:55,649
- There must be many products.
- Shall we go?

2039
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:57,221
(With overflowing confidence, Sang Hyeok leaves the car.)

2040
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,090
(Current time, 7:20pm)

2041
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:01,890
(Will they be able to complete the mission?)

2042
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:03,529
That team...

2043
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,931
has various tasks to finish.

2044
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:09,301
If they missed any one of them...

2045
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,699
or did them strangely...

2046
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,899
Then they need a scolding.

2047
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,869
In that case, I think 1 or 2 members...

2048
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,140
- should join the individual match.
- That's right.

2049
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:17,640
- That's right.
- They should play with us.

2050
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:19,439
Let's call and ask.

2051
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,780
(They call Team Handsome right away.)

2052
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,011
- Hello.
- Where are you?

2053
01:15:24,711 --> 01:15:25,749
- Us?
- Yes.

2054
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,980
We have some remaining homework.

2055
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,989
Do you mean the selfie?

2056
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,819
- Really?
- Yes.

2057
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,489
You need to hurry up and complete it.

2058
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,290
We need to hurry up and find it, so please hang up.

2059
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,760
We're very busy.

2060
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,029
Are you finding it in Sangam?

2061
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:41,029
No, we're... Hello?

2062
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,500
Hello?

2063
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,830
Dong Hyun.

2064
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:45,900
His acting doesn't improve.

2065
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:48,170
When I asked him if he was in Sangam,

2066
01:15:48,171 --> 01:15:50,171
he went, "Hello?"

2067
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,710
- I think he's nearby.
- He must be nearby.

2068
01:15:52,711 --> 01:15:54,711
- Then...
- He must be nearby.

2069
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,051
(Base Camp, Sangam-dong)

2070
01:15:57,211 --> 01:15:59,381
They didn't have Some Blossom.

2071
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,449
Which characters remain?

2072
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,090
- "Hand" and "Some." - I will look for them.

2073
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,150
We need them.

2074
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,721
Which way is the tteokbokki place?

2075
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:08,591
- We need to hurry up.
- Shall we go?

2076
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:10,390
The "With" we have is small,

2077
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:12,301
so it'll be nice to find a bigger one.

2078
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:14,730
Okay.

2079
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:15,870
(Team Handsome hurriedly looks for a tteokbokki place.)

2080
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:18,899
They're looking for something.

2081
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,440
(The chasers appear.)

2082
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:22,739
They didn't see us.

2083
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:23,771
(Whispering)

2084
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:25,840
(Team Guys closes in on them.)

2085
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:26,981
Why...

2086
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:28,450
You haven't have found many characters.

2087
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,450
You haven't have found many characters.

2088
01:16:30,811 --> 01:16:32,021
Seriously.

2089
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,280
Why did you guys follow us here?

2090
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:36,021
- Are you guys going somewhere?
- What?

2091
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,249
Where are you guys going?

2092
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,989
The menu is instant tteokbokki. Do you want to eat it?

2093
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,819
- Instant tteokbokki?
- Yes.

2094
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,290
It does sound delicious.

2095
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:44,930
- Do you want to eat?
- We just ate a burger.

2096
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:46,529
We don't have much time. We need to hurry up.

2097
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,530
(They have 30 minutes before the game ends.)

2098
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:52,700
(Team Guys accompanies them to the instant tteokbokki place.)

2099
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,239
They're quite busy.

2100
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,671
It looks like...

2101
01:16:55,771 --> 01:16:58,040
they're solving a puzzle.

2102
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,109
Okay.

2103
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:01,811
Which dishes did you get?

2104
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,779
Instant tteokbokki.

2105
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,351
You guys got bulgogi too.

2106
01:17:06,351 --> 01:17:07,619
Anything.

2107
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,190
- Was there "Anything?" - Was there "Anything?"

2108
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:11,050
What did you eat?

2109
01:17:11,051 --> 01:17:12,490
- Egg tarts.
- Egg tarts.

2110
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,420
It was Tae Hyun's idea, right?

2111
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,690
That was the only thing we ate until 2pm or 3pm.

2112
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,529
Dong Hyun...

2113
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:22,530
would've gone to eat beef if it weren't for Tae Hyun.

2114
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,171
That's right.

2115
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:27,140
- Did we put in an order?
- Excuse me.

2116
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:30,410
You can take the ingredients you want.

2117
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,280
- You need to eat for the square.
- That's right.

2118
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,579
We almost failed.

2119
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,279
You guys came here to distract us, right?

2120
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,650
No. We didn't know either.

2121
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,720
We almost failed.

2122
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:43,289
(25 minutes remain.)

2123
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,489
What's this?

2124
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,789
(While the younger members make tteokbokki)

2125
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,920
That was funny.

2126
01:17:47,921 --> 01:17:51,091
(Tae Hyun continues to organize something.)

2127
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,360
(Let's see.)

2128
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:58,070
(Team Guys members gang up on him like hyenas.)

2129
01:17:58,171 --> 01:18:01,670
(Are you ready? Shall we go?)

2130
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:05,881
(It's time to check.)

2131
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,981
Happy New Year...

2132
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,520
It's long indeed.

2133
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,490
With Handsome Guys...

2134
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:20,021
on...

2135
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,990
the Year of the Snake.

2136
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:24,231
We did it.

2137
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,359
(Happy New Year with Handsome Guys on the Year of the Snake.)

2138
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,899
The Year of the Snake. We did it.

2139
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,970
(They completed it.)

2140
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,100
It's too...

2141
01:18:32,101 --> 01:18:33,240
We did it.

2142
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,069
We were bound to find it.

2143
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,370
(They completed the mission for a wishing happy new year card.)

2144
01:18:36,471 --> 01:18:38,280
Were you guys done when I messaged you?

2145
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:40,680
- When you messaged us?
- We weren't done then.

2146
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:41,851
- No?
- We finished it here.

2147
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,851
It was a lie.

2148
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:46,381
He replied in three seconds.

2149
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,891
That means he lied without hesitation.

2150
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,220
Don't you know that athletes are agile?

2151
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:52,221
Of course.

2152
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:53,721
They're true friends.

2153
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,530
(Instant tteokbokki is done.)

2154
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:01,870
(He blows on a sausage and puts it in his mouth.)

2155
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:06,471
(Tae Hyun, the picky eater, gets a dumpling.)

2156
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,410
(Dong Hyun eats tteokbokki quickly.)

2157
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,710
We ate tteokbokki.

2158
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:13,840
Thank you.

2159
01:19:13,841 --> 01:19:16,409
(The final score is 3 to 2.)

2160
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,380
(Team Handsome won.)

2161
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:20,750
- I want to ask you this.
- Okay.

2162
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:23,490
We heard the cuckoo sound 4 times, so why do you only have 3 squares?

2163
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:26,290
We had to eat 4 dishes for 4 squares,

2164
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:27,560
but we didn't have enough time.

2165
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:29,430
Didn't you eat one dish?

2166
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,261
It doesn't matter. We won with a score of 3 to 2.

2167
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,630
- You guys only had two squares.
- But...

2168
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,670
we came here since you guys had four squares.

2169
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,800
- We had time for one more person.
- It was 6:30pm.

2170
01:19:37,801 --> 01:19:40,369
Had the score been 3 to 2, we would've gone for another square.

2171
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,340
But since the score was 4 to 2, we gave up.

2172
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:44,869
It wasn't our intention to do this.

2173
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,439
If things are going to be this way, we'll push off food until later.

2174
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,310
Sang Uk and I can eat 4 to 5 meals in a single seating.

2175
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:51,819
Seriously.

2176
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,080
Okay. Shoot your shot then. What should we do?

2177
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,890
One of the three members should join the individual match!

2178
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,091
(One of the three members should join the individual match!)

2179
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,890
- Seriously.
- We don't want anything else.

2180
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:02,560
- We gave up on the last attempt.
- One of the three members.

2181
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:04,329
We got here at 6:30pm.

2182
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,600
You should do that much.

2183
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,060
So that's the conclusion.

2184
01:20:07,061 --> 01:20:08,670
(Laughing)

2185
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,870
One of the three members should join the individual match.

2186
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:13,370
- Tae Hyun, - Will it be okay?

2187
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,210
I can sense the flow of the match.

2188
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,510
If one of us joins the match,

2189
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:17,910
- that person will go hiking.
- He will go hiking.

2190
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:19,340
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

2191
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:21,439
- It's like that. It's strange.
- We shouldn't agree to it.

2192
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,221
Is there someone you guys want in particular?

2193
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:26,721
I won't join.

2194
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:28,820
I won't join.

2195
01:20:28,851 --> 01:20:30,249
Why would you make that decision?

2196
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,860
I'll never join.

2197
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,060
(We want you to join.)

2198
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,489
- I'll never join.
- If you guys refuse to join...

2199
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:36,760
the match,

2200
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:39,131
I won't have more to say.

2201
01:20:39,231 --> 01:20:41,430
But here's what upsets me.

2202
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:44,030
This will become a bigger issue later on.

2203
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,999
"Let's get 4 squares 1st and eat 4 meals afterward."

2204
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,841
- We'll think that.
- That's right.

2205
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,671
What's five?

2206
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,341
What?

2207
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,680
(You fool!)

2208
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:56,350
- Tae Hyun.
- My goodness.

2209
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,850
- Dong Hyun is a fool.
- Tae Hyun.

2210
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:00,221
- What? What's this?
- For goodness' sake.

2211
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:03,421
- Tae Hyun.
- You need to understand the signal.

2212
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:05,561
(I need an explanation.)

2213
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:08,789
(Sang Hyeok understands it before Dong Hyun does.)

2214
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:09,960
I see.

2215
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:11,131
He's a fool.

2216
01:21:11,561 --> 01:21:12,899
(You guys are something else!)

2217
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,631
- Seriously.
- You guys are something else!

2218
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:17,069
(I didn't expect them to scheme behind my back.)

2219
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,770
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

2220
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:20,670
Why didn't you understand?

2221
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:22,511
The three of us should play rock-paper-scissors?

2222
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:25,181
- I didn't know.
- Dong Hyun...

2223
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:27,580
"What is five?"

2224
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:29,051
"What is five?"

2225
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,711
You should've told me about it in advance.

2226
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:32,580
(Laughing)

2227
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,590
We should carry on with it though.

2228
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:37,021
We should.

2229
01:21:37,221 --> 01:21:38,921
Then we should do this. Actually,

2230
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,020
we were going to answer the third question...

2231
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,731
- and get some tteokbokki.
- Right.

2232
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:45,500
Tae Hyun called Jang Ho Il.

2233
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:47,460
- He already called him.
- Right.

2234
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:49,130
Tae Hyun asked to meet up with him.

2235
01:21:49,131 --> 01:21:50,670
I think you can be the one that can take responsibility for that.

2236
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:51,671
Gosh.

2237
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:53,471
- He should be the one to go?
- Right.

2238
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:55,470
(He betrayed him right away.)

2239
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:57,109
Up until he came here,

2240
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:59,481
he said that he was going to be with me to the end.

2241
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,141
He's amazing.

2242
01:22:01,381 --> 01:22:03,610
You're on fire today, so you won't get caught.

2243
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,079
You've been in a lot of competitions.

2244
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,480
You know if things will turn out well.

2245
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:07,720
- Will he get caught today?
- He won't.

2246
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:09,220
(He won't get caught.)

2247
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:10,520
Will I get caught if I go?

2248
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:12,460
Look at me. Will I get caught if I go?

2249
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:13,660
- You will.
- Right?

2250
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:16,359
Weren't you okay about it though?

2251
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,689
About hiking in the morning.

2252
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:18,931
I have a training session tomorrow.

2253
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,271
There's a certain feeling about it.

2254
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,730
I'll trust you.

2255
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:25,101
You said that I wouldn't get caught if I went.

2256
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:27,800
- Be certain.
- You won't get caught.

2257
01:22:27,801 --> 01:22:28,940
- Really?
- You really won't get caught.

2258
01:22:29,271 --> 01:22:30,341
Okay. I'm down for it.

2259
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:33,079
- You're amazing, Tae Hyun.
- I think I won't get caught.

2260
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,080
You're amazing.

2261
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:35,140
I will get caught 100 percent if I go.

2262
01:22:35,141 --> 01:22:36,810
- It should've been Dong Hyun.
- Good luck, Tae Hyun.

2263
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:38,511
It all comes down to this.

2264
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,619
I'll be clear about this.

2265
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,920
When I get caught here,

2266
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:43,989
- I'll take one of them with me.
- Okay.

2267
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:45,090
(He suddenly announces to take someone with him.)

2268
01:22:45,091 --> 01:22:46,359
- They will be loyal.
- Right.

2269
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,090
- You said he wouldn't get caught.
- What?

2270
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:49,860
I will take someone with me if I get caught.

2271
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:51,961
- You won't get caught.
- You won't get caught.

2272
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,030
Here is the first question for exemption.

2273
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,030
Up until 1953,

2274
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:00,600
this was brought only through importation in Korea.

2275
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,870
This was finally produced for the first time in Korea in 1953.

2276
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,609
After that, the amount of this that was brought in...

2277
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:06,841
during the holidays...

2278
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:09,909
was known to represent the social status of a family.

2279
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,481
That was how popular it was.

2280
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,221
What could this be?

2281
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,580
- Me.
- Me.

2282
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:16,421
Cooking oil.

2283
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:18,420
Cooking oil? Incorrect.

2284
01:23:18,421 --> 01:23:19,560
So it was something...

2285
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:20,689
- that was only imported.
- If it's 1953,

2286
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,931
you should know about it.

2287
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:23,359
Of course. He was in elementary school.

2288
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,360
Tae Hyun...

2289
01:23:24,361 --> 01:23:25,860
- What are you saying?
- You know this!

2290
01:23:25,961 --> 01:23:27,029
- Me.
- But...

2291
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,131
- Never mind.
- Bananas.

2292
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,471
- Incorrect.
- Me. Chocolate.

2293
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:31,970
That's incorrect.

2294
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:33,699
- Flour.
- Incorrect.

2295
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,740
No?

2296
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:36,311
What could it be?

2297
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,511
- Me.
- Seung Ho.

2298
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,740
- Beer.
- Incorrect.

2299
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,280
- That sounded like a good guess.
- His answers sound plausible.

2300
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,221
If you hear the answer, you will be confused.

2301
01:23:47,551 --> 01:23:49,020
- Do you know the answer?
- Yes.

2302
01:23:49,021 --> 01:23:50,789
Google Woo searched it up right away.

2303
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:52,261
(Dong Hyun checked the answer through Google Woo.)

2304
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,761
This is really common now.

2305
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,561
- What?
- Ramyeon.

2306
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,330
- Incorrect.
- I thought of ramyeon too.

2307
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:00,631
Me.

2308
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:03,231
- Get it right.
- Apples.

2309
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:04,671
That is incorrect.

2310
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:07,200
- Melons?
- That is incorrect.

2311
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:09,671
We'll be mentioning the dragon fruit at this rate.

2312
01:24:10,971 --> 01:24:11,980
This is hard.

2313
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:13,841
- What could be really common now?
- It's really common.

2314
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,881
Shall we start getting hints then?

2315
01:24:16,981 --> 01:24:18,079
It starts with S.

2316
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,681
(It starts with S.)

2317
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:21,051
- You got something different?
- It's something else.

2318
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:22,591
- It's different?
- What's wrong with him?

2319
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,721
- It's different.
- It must be something else.

2320
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,760
Me. Salt.

2321
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:29,790
- What?
- Salt.

2322
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,360
That is incorrect.

2323
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:33,261
Me. Sugar.

2324
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,399
Sugar is correct.

2325
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
Okay!

2326
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,699
- It was sugar?
- Gosh.

2327
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,970
That makes sense...

2328
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:41,271
if you think of those times.

2329
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,540
You're really good at avoiding the penalties.

2330
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:45,239
Right.

2331
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,579
You and I were the only ones that didn't get caught.

2332
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,239
I have to get myself out of this too.

2333
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,681
Please make sure to make Tae Hyun get caught.

2334
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:52,480
- I'll do my best.
- Sang Uk.

2335
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:53,720
- Sang Uk.
- Yes?

2336
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,820
- Let's get Tae Hyun.
- Let's make it happen.

2337
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:57,249
Let's go.

2338
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,819
- This question is about 1941.
- About 1941?

2339
01:24:58,820 --> 01:24:59,820
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2340
01:24:59,821 --> 01:25:02,330
In 1941,

2341
01:25:02,461 --> 01:25:05,260
Japan started a policy of subjecting to Japan...

2342
01:25:05,261 --> 01:25:08,400
and tried to annihilate our country's identity.

2343
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:12,399
As a part of that policy, the name of an educational institution...

2344
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,141
has been changed to mean "Japanese Loyal Subject."

2345
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,409
What is the changed name?

2346
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:18,440
National school.

2347
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,040
Correct.

2348
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,711
(Yi Kyung is correct.)

2349
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:23,980
(Ta-da!)

2350
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:24,981
You got it right away?

2351
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:26,381
(You got it right away?)

2352
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:28,079
(Team Guys gets a question right.)

2353
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,149
(Tae Hyun is on the edge of the cliff now.)

2354
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:30,650
Hold on. Things are becoming strange now.

2355
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:32,421
Wait for me.

2356
01:25:32,422 --> 01:25:33,920
(We'll be going together.)

2357
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,660
- Wait for me.
- Tae Hyun!

2358
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,260
You guys said I wouldn't get caught!

2359
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,460
Sang Uk has to win.

2360
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:41,660
- Get yourself together, Sang Uk.
- Let's make it happen.

2361
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:43,930
- Please, Sang Uk!
- It's the last question.

2362
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,200
- It's the last question.
- Go for it.

2363
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:47,101
- All right.
- I can get the answer.

2364
01:25:47,841 --> 01:25:50,540
In 1976,

2365
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:53,740
this was developed in Korea for the first time in the world.

2366
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:55,950
It was salted?

2367
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,810
- "Developed." - "Developed."

2368
01:25:57,811 --> 01:25:59,980
Oh, right. I misheard it.

2369
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,481
"Salted?"

2370
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,590
Like salted shrimp.

2371
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:06,560
- "Salted?" - Gosh.

2372
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,890
Right.

2373
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:09,659
Okay. I'll read the question again.

2374
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,529
In 1976,

2375
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:14,231
this was developed in Korea for the first time in the world.

2376
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,300
This was assessed to have been developed...

2377
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:18,369
by the culture of Koreans who have to get...

2378
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,439
anything done really quickly.

2379
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,570
Really quickly?

2380
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:23,771
These days, this food product is really popular abroad.

2381
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,180
What could this be?

2382
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,811
- Me. Ramyeon.
- Ramyeon?

2383
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:29,650
That is incorrect.

2384
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:31,711
(I thought that was the answer.)

2385
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,381
Me. Instant rice.

2386
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,080
That is incorrect.

2387
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:37,290
Me. Canned tuna.

2388
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,990
Incorrect.

2389
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,190
In 1976?

2390
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:44,360
Me. Instant coffee?

2391
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,699
Correct.

2392
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,859
(Instant coffee)

2393
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,930
Correct.

2394
01:26:48,931 --> 01:26:50,231
(Sighing)

2395
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:52,399
(Team Handsome and Team Guys share different emotions.)

2396
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,400
Really?

2397
01:26:55,301 --> 01:26:56,540
Yes!

2398
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,340
(We believed in you, Tae Hyun.)

2399
01:26:59,341 --> 01:27:00,540
This feels even better.

2400
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,181
Go away!

2401
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,681
He came back alive from the underworld.

2402
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,481
- He got it right away.
- Gosh.

2403
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:07,680
I couldn't think of anything.

2404
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:08,851
(Sang Uk will be serving for two weeks straight.)

2405
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:11,619
- We trusted in you.
- Right.

2406
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,159
You were right about me not getting caught.

2407
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,359
Right.

2408
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,730
- That was amazing.
- Gosh. I'm crying.

2409
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:16,829
We needed a miracle to happen.

2410
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,260
(The person that feels the unhappiest)

2411
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:19,329
That was amazing.

2412
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,500
The instant coffee is popular. That's right.

2413
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,171
(The next day before dawn breaks)

2414
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,570
(Sunrise location: Mount Nam, the center of Seoul)

2415
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,270
Gosh, it's cold.

2416
01:27:31,271 --> 01:27:32,480
(Sang Uk appears for the activity for two weeks straight.)

2417
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:33,681
The weather is great.

2418
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:36,481
Do I go up all the way?

2419
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,150
All the way up to the top?

2420
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:40,249
I'm just doing what I have been doing everyday.

2421
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,851
I'm just doing my morning workout.

2422
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:44,220
The sun can't be up.

2423
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:45,421
I have to see the sunrise from the top.

2424
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,221
I can walk quickly, right?

2425
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,561
(Unlike his upper body that looks relaxed, )

2426
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:53,700
(he takes quick steps.)

2427
01:27:54,101 --> 01:27:56,671
(His lower body moves aggressively.)

2428
01:27:58,271 --> 01:27:59,271
It's cold.

2429
01:27:59,272 --> 01:28:01,500
(When compared with a regular person, )

2430
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:06,811
(the athlete hikes up a lot quicker.)

2431
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:10,181
It's nice and refreshing.

2432
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:12,011
(He walks through the fresh morning air.)

2433
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:14,481
I feel great.

2434
01:28:14,482 --> 01:28:16,091
(Sang Uk hikes up at his own pace.)

2435
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:17,891
You're all doing okay, right?

2436
01:28:19,891 --> 01:28:22,231
(We're not doing okay.)

2437
01:28:22,591 --> 01:28:24,091
Goodbye, everyone!

2438
01:28:24,391 --> 01:28:25,960
This is nothing.

2439
01:28:25,961 --> 01:28:27,360
I should actually be running up.

2440
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,431
The sun is rising.

2441
01:28:32,301 --> 01:28:33,471
The sun can't be up yet.

2442
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:36,211
I can see it.

2443
01:28:38,641 --> 01:28:39,641
I made it!

2444
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,950
The view is amazing.

2445
01:28:43,981 --> 01:28:45,211
I can see all of Seoul.

2446
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,391
I should have a drink here.

2447
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,221
(Rummaging)

2448
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:57,390
I'm here because of this.

2449
01:28:57,391 --> 01:28:59,060
(The instant coffee that secured his loss appears.)

2450
01:28:59,061 --> 01:29:00,860
The first thing that was done in the athletic club...

2451
01:29:01,431 --> 01:29:02,900
was to make some coffee for the coach.

2452
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,070
I'm doing this after 14 years.

2453
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,841
(How does the instant coffee that secured his loss taste?)

2454
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,711
Gosh, it's nice.

2455
01:29:14,681 --> 01:29:15,750
I saw the head!

2456
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,449
I should make a wish.

2457
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:18,609
(The sun comes up over the ridge of the mountain.)

2458
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,181
My first New Year's wish...

2459
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:24,721
is to get good results as an athlete.

2460
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,790
My second wish is for our show to get good viewer ratings...

2461
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:31,490
and become a big hit.

2462
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:33,930
My next wish...

2463
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:35,499
(The last desperate wish)

2464
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,931
is for Tae Hyun to get caught.

2465
01:29:38,301 --> 01:29:40,540
If I think about it, Seung Ho should get caught too.

2466
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,140
The instant coffee developed in 1976.

2467
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,510
(We hope you will win next time.)

2468
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:46,641
I will never forget that.

2469

2470
01:29:51,528 --> 01:29:52,698

2472
01:29:55,827 --> 01:29:56,897
(The arrival of Yurimping that took over...)

2473
01:29:56,898 --> 01:29:57,967
("The Trauma Code: Heroes On Call")

2474
01:29:58,068 --> 01:29:59,467
Hello. It's great to see you.

2475

2480
01:30:09,978 --> 01:30:11,308
(However...)

2481
01:30:11,608 --> 01:30:14,116
(This man's clumsiness...)

2482
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:15,778
(slowly gets revealed.)

2483
01:30:16,117 --> 01:30:19,318
(I don't know anymore.)

2484
01:30:19,558 --> 01:30:22,627
(Another point to focus on)

2485
01:30:23,058 --> 01:30:24,827
(Sang Uk has changed.)

2486
01:30:25,257 --> 01:30:27,256
(He'll finally show his talent...)

2487
01:30:27,257 --> 01:30:29,398
(as a game changer.)

2488
01:30:29,728 --> 01:30:31,698

(They complete unexpected missions...)

2493
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:42,707
(and experience various contents.)

2494
01:30:43,007 --> 01:30:44,777
(A trip to the world of creators)

2495
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:48,716
- Handsome Guys - Okay.

2496
01:30:48,717 --> 01:30:51,987
