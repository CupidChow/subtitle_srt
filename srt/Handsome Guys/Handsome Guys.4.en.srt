(The center always has an advantage in bingo.)

9
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:52,535
(Both teams sprint to Gangjin.)

10
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,416
(Please put the other team to sleep.)

11
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,505
(By using the nap card, )

12
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,646
(Team Guys got ahead.)

13
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:01,616
(With their strong spirit, they won Gangjin.)

18
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,256
(Current score: 1 to 1)

19
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,105
(Team Guys arrived at Yeongam first.)

00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,466

00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:28,405
(They turned the tables by winning Yeongam.)

(Team Guys)

27
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:35,516
Goodness.

28
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:37,675
We should have won Yeongam instead.

29
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:38,845
(After failing in Yeongam, they head to Haenam.)

30
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:40,445
If we did, the game would be over.

31
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:44,184
Since the other team went to Yeongam,

32
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,655
- we are...
- We must block them.

33
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,925
The odds are stacked against us.

34
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:51,865
We lost two reattempt cards.

35
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:54,126
We also have to go to karaoke.

36
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:58,206
If we win today, it will be a major reversal.

37
00:01:58,465 --> 00:01:59,565
- Right.
- Yes.

38
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,536
- We're at a disadvantage now.
- We're losing.

39
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,705
- Let's forget about the past.
- Okay.

40
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,104
Just think about our accomplishments.

41
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:07,575
- We'll go to Haenam and win.
- Yes.

42
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,286
- Yes.
- Let's see.

43
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:13,816
This time, it's makgeolli.

44
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,685

- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

51
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,236
Nice to meet you. Hello.

52
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,676
What kind of place is it that you won the Grand Award?

53
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,305
Please come in.

54
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:42,145
Gosh, you traveled far.

55
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,874
It was worth the trip. What a nice place.

56
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,956
(Food is welcoming Team Guys.)

57
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:53,086
(Welcome, it's makgeolli this time.)

58
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:57,425
This is Samsan-myeon, Haenam in South Jeolla Province.

59
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,994
- Samsan-myeon?
- Samsan-myeon.

60
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,895
In Haenam,

61
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,964
the most famous mountain is called Mount Duryun.

62
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:06,765
(Mount Duryun, the most famous mountain in Haenam)

63
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:09,005
Underneath Mount Duryun...

64
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:12,274
is 1,000-year-old Daeheungsa Temple,

65
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,546
which is listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site.

66
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:17,314
The place is visited the most...

67
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:20,045
by tourists in Haenam.

68
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,185
That's where our brewery is located.

69
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,724
I cannot tell you the exact year,

70
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,856
but according to the elder local residents,

71
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:32,865
this brewery started...

72
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,195
in the 20s or 30s.

73
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,266
It means that it's been almost 100 years.

74
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:41,874
As for my family, my grandfather...

75
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,774
started operating this brewery in 1950.

76
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,446
- Was that your grandfather?
- Yes.

77
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,745
Then my parents took charge of the brewery.

78
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:55,214
After working in the city, I left work...

79
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,714
to run this brewery.

80
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:00,085
You're running it with your nephew who is the fourth generation.

81
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,125
Yes.

82
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:04,154
If the children of the family are interested in working here,

83
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:06,594
it must mean that the business is going well.

84
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,934
- Right.
- Exactly.

85
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,094
Behind you,

86
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,934
- there's a drawing.
- That drawing.

87
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:14,434
It was drawn in 2019 by an artist...

88
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:16,706
who was a big fan of our makgeolli.

89
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:20,874
My parents ran the brewery when it looked like that.

90
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,575
You can feel affection in the drawing.

91
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,474
In order to continue running...

92
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:28,155
the brewery for four generations,

93
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:31,554
the facility was too old.

94
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,455
That's why we modernized...

95
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,224
- You modernized it?
- and renovated the facility.

96
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,024
- In the same place?
- Yes, exactly the same.

97
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,296
I see.

98
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,734
You should taste some first...

99
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:44,441
- Sure.
- before I introduce our makgeolli.

100
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,635
We'll serve you.

101
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:46,636
Goodness.

102
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:47,805
- Is this first?
- Yes.

103
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:49,136
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

104
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,674
- I feel nervous.
- That's good.

105
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,706
Thank you.

106
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,275
(What's the alcohol content?)

107
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,875
- It's six percent.
- Six percent?

108
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,945
Yes, it's six percent.

109
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,086
This makgeolli's alcohol content is six percent.

110
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:02,214
For the production of our makgeolli,

111
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:06,154
we have never changed...

112
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:09,294
my parents' recipe.

113
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,396
- So this is the original.
- In this region,

114
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,835
this is the farmers' favorite in Haenam.

115
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,436
- It's loved by many people.
- They drink it for snacks.

116
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:22,375
Compared to regular makgeolli, you'll notice that...

117
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:24,005
it has an unusual flavor.

118
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,404
- Right.
- Is it ginseng flavor?

119
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,844
I tasted some ginseng.

120
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,714
- Many people taste...
- Wild ginseng.

121
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,174
Ginseng or wild ginseng...

122
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,344
- in the makgeolli.
- Right.

123
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,785
Actually, it's not ginseng, but dong quai.

124
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,415
- I see.
- Dong quai?

125
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:39,125
(Dong quai?)

126
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:42,195
There's a story behind why we added dong quai.

127
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:45,165
My parents used to deliver makgeolli...

128
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:47,294
in containers on their bikes.

129
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:49,734
Their customers kept making this request.

130
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:52,534
"Please make regional makgeolli..."

131
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:56,135
"with a distinguishing taste."

132
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,305
- They wanted it customized.
- Right.

133
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,674
My parents added various ingredients to experiment.

134
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:03,175
Among them, dong quai gave...

135
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,785
a subtle flavor.

136
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,484
It also neutralized...

137
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:11,015
the sweet flavor in makgeolli that could be unpleasant.

138
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:13,484
That's why for the makgeolli with six percent alcohol,

139
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,794
we follow my parents' recipe even now.

140
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,664
- It's quite unique.
- Yes.

141
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,126
There's something different about it.

142
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:26,006
After making this makgeolli for years,

143
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,104
I thought of making alcohol that fits the trend.

144
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,234
- Right.
- By using glutinous rice...

145
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,975
and non-glutinous rice grown in this region,

146
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:38,415
we increased the concentration without artificial sweeteners.

147
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:41,186
With rich flavors from the ingredients,

148
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:43,536
we made makgeolli with nine percent alcohol content.

149
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,585
- What's this?
- The concentration...

150
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,425
It's clearly different.

151
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,925
It's much thicker.

152
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,595
You're right.

153
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:57,396
(How does the makgeolli taste with 9 percent alcohol content?)

154
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:00,305
- Hey.
- Yes?

155
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:02,475
It's definitely different.

156
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,735
What does it taste like?

157
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,506
- I'm sorry, but...
- It's very different.

158
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,974
I apologize to your parents, but this is better.

159
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,315
(I'm sorry, but I like this more.)

160
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:13,016
The family recipe is good, but...

161
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:16,555
People these days might prefer this.

162
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,724
You can see from the glasses that it's thicker.

163
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,594
Wait, the taste is...

164
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,525
It's simply delicious.

165
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,696
- To be honest...
- I bet it sells well.

166
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,734
(Now that they did some tasting...)

167
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,265
It's time for our quiz.

168
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,436
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

169
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,674
Let's get it right. Seriously.

170
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,345
Let's do it this time.

171
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,376
(Cuckoo)

172
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:42,816
Yeongam.

173
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:43,945
- Okay, we got it.
- They won Yeongam?

174
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,914
- Didn't I tell you before?
- Yes.

175
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,245
What time is it exactly?

176
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:48,255
(Yeongam, Gangjin, Jangheung)

177
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:51,415
Between 2:30pm and 3pm...

178
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,085
We'll finish...

179
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,896
answering the quiz by 2:40pm.

180
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:57,924
If they win Yeongam,

181
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,665
we'll hear the cuckoo sound before we answer the quiz.

182
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,335
We can feel positive about this...

183
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,794
because they took longer than we expected.

184
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:06,565
We need to win this. Otherwise, we're doomed.

185
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,005
- Then it's over for us.
- If we get it wrong,

186
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,174
- The game is over.
- we'll surrender.

187
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,175
Surrender?

188
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:11,622
(He declares to surrender if they fail.)

189
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,344
- We have to surrender.
- Right.

190
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:14,404
(There's nowhere to back down.)

191
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,974
- Here's your quiz.
- Please.

192
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,586
(It's time to answer the quiz.)

193
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,515
What goes inside the makgeolli...

194
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:24,256
with six percent alcohol that you just tasted?

195
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,556
- Dong quai.
- Dong quai.

196
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:27,256
Correct, dong quai is added.

197
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:29,855
In the past, women packed dong quai...

198
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:34,266
for their husbands on their way to join the war.

199
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:39,806
Please describe the meaning of dong quai's Chinese characters.

200
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:42,306
(Sighing)

201
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:44,774
- Are you kidding me?
- Let's give it a try.

202
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,146
We just need to know the Chinese characters for dong quai.

203
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,674
It was given to husbands on their way to war.

204
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:52,215
It probably meant, "Come back home alive."

205
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,185
"Come back home alive."

206
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:56,016
What's wrong? Have you given up?

207
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,585
I'm thinking.

208
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,026
Wait, could you say the question again?

209
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,325
In the past, women packed dong quai...

210
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,425
for their husbands on their way to join the war.

211
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,826
- They gave them dong quai.
- It's where it comes from.

212
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,796
Come back home alive.

213
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:13,735
Quai must mean "return."

214
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,305
What could "dong" mean?

215
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,035
Come back safely.

216
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,344
What could "dong" mean?

217
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,744
What are some Chinese characters for "dong?"

218
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,114
(The meaning of "dong")

219
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:23,175
Darling?

220
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,385
(The meaning of "dong" is darling?)

221
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:27,484
(Darling?)

222
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,715
Darling, you're cute.

223
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,254
(Laughing)

224
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,286
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,355
Does it come from "no doubt?"

226
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,094
Of course, you have to come back?

227
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,426
Say words that start with "dong."

228
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,134
- Carrots.
- Carrots.

229
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:44,264
- No doubt.
- No doubt.

230
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,535
Phrases like "no doubt."

231
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:47,234
- That's what I thought.
- No doubt.

232
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,906
- Right away?
- Right away.

233
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,635
Return right away?

234
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,406
Is it "darling, come home?"

235
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,276
- Darling, you're cute.
- I mean...

236
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,075
(There he goes again.)

237
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,214
Darling, you're cute.

238
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:01,045
He can't let go of "cute."

239
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,315
He's obsessed with "cute."

240
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,384
Let's think of it this way.

241
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,456
Maybe it's related to safety.

242
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,755
- I'll be the wife.
- Going to the war.

243
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,975
- You will be...
- This is dong quai.

244
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:13,601
(Husband Yi Kyung on his way to war and Wife Seung Ho who sees him off)

245
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,725
I'm leaving.

246
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:17,365
Honey.

247
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,426
I can't think of anything but "darling, you're cute."

248
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,706
I can't think of anything else.

249
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,605
I'll stay out of it.

250
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,514
I'll just think alone.

251
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,416
I can't think of anything but "darling, you're cute."

252
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,586
To your husband on his way to war, "darling, you're cute?"

253
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,855
- You're so cute.
- Like a toy?

254
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,124
This is a tragic situation.

255
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,695
I might not come back from the war.

256
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:42,826
It could be our last time.

257
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,065
"Please take care."

258
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,695
- "Just come back alive." - Right, that's what it means.

259
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:49,295
- That's what I would say.
- Me too.

260
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:52,965
- I'll trust Tae Hyun this time.
- Okay.

261
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,305
Last time, Seung Ho answered. Tae Hyun should answer this time.

262
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,435
I'll answer the next one.

263
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:58,744
(Suddenly, the quiz is assigned.)

264
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,505
I'll just... Here I go.

265
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,576
Come back without a doubt.

266
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:05,686
Come back without a doubt.

267
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:08,415
- If I'm wrong...
- Dong quai...

268
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,456
given to their husbands on their way to war.

269
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:13,355
Does dong quai mean "come back without a doubt" in Chinese?

270
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:19,566
(A feeling of anxiety sweeps over them.)

271
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:20,895
If it's wrong...

272
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:21,895
(They must guess correctly this time.)

273
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,176
I don't think that it's correct.

274
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:27,336
(What will happen to Team Guys?)

275
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:28,735
Correct.

276
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,436
(Correct!)

277
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:31,676
Correct.

278
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,306
Correct.

279
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:38,946
(Tae Hyun's answer brought back hope.)

280
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,685
What does "dong" mean?

281
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,815
Dong quai means "returning naturally."

282
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,254
- That's what it means.
- "Naturally?"

283
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,394
- Is that what "dong" means?
- Return without a doubt.

284
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:49,826
Does it mean "naturally?"

285
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,455
For their husbands...

286
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,394
to return home without a doubt from the war,

287
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,264
they gave them dong quai.

288
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,035
- I mean...
- It also meant...

289
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,935
something that gave you energy...

290
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,206
when you're exhausted.

291
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,885
- Darling, you're cute.
- Darling, you're cute.

292
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,576
(Haenam B, Makgeolli)

293
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:08,545
Now that we're full, let's go to a sauna.

294
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:09,576
(Exclaiming)

295
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:10,844
That sounds perfect.

296
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,945
- It's a routine for athletes.
- Routine.

297
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:15,426
Speaking of which, there's a public bath right in front of us.

298
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:16,615
(Lucky Team Handsome)

299
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:17,714
It's unbelievable.

300
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,586
- Here's a public bath.
- Here it is.

301
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,355
It's written "sauna."

302
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,195
(Cuckoo)

303
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:25,326
Haenam B.

304
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:26,925
(Haenam B, Makgeolli)

305
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,065
Haenam B? That's where they went.

306
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,634
They went there to block us.

307
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:30,835
They'll probably head to Suncheon next.

308
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,365
It means that they used their GPS.

309
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:33,935
- Right.
- They used it.

310
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,104
Should we head to Naju right away?

311
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,405
I think we should.

312
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,405
- Then let's go.
- Shall we?

313
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:40,676
We came all the way here.

314
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,375
We should have heard "Naju."

315
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:45,745
What would be better than blocking Suncheon?

316
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,416
While they eat, should we block Suncheon?

317
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,885
Or should we complete ours quickly?

318
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:53,984
If we block Suncheon,

319
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,326
the number of wins will matter, and we would still win.

320
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,825
That's true.

321
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,025
Let's go there.

322
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,264
- Should we go to Suncheon?
- Let's go to Suncheon.

323
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,464
- Let's go to Suncheon.
- They probably took off already.

324
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,134
- It'll take an hour.
- No.

325
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,565
They must still be eating.

326
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,835
- Right.
- Tae Hyun would refuse to eat.

327
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,382
Still, we'll arrive around the same time.

328
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,634
We'll head to Suncheon.

329
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:11,635
(In a hurry, they set off to Suncheon.)

330
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:13,975
We wanted to avoid Suncheon, but we end up going there.

331
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:15,915
(From Yeongam to Suncheon)

332
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,515
(It'll take 1 hour and 10 minutes.)

333
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,615
(They hurry in order to win Suncheon first.)

334
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,725
(On their way, they volunteer to take a nap.)

335
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,285
(Team Guys)

336
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:29,625
Nothing is in moderation here.

337
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:32,465
They prepared us a feast.

338
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:37,135
(Haenam, wild vegetables set menu)

339
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,105
(A table full of food)

340
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,605
There's so much good food.

341
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,874
Isn't this yellow croaker?

342
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,906
It looks so plump.

343
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,344
Kimchi and salted seafood.

344
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,105
(Delicious seasoned vegetables with seafood)

345
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:53,316
(Shall we eat with makgeolli flavored with dong quai?)

346
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:56,286
- Darling, you're cute.
- Darling, you're cute.

347
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,095
- Either way...
- It tastes good.

348
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,125
They were notified.

349
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,634
We will depart at 4pm.

350
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:09,735
- At 4pm?
- Yes.

351
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,665
This fish looks amazing.

352
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,864
What's this anyway?

353
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,536
Isn't this yellow croaker?

354
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:16,576
It looks delicious.

355
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,806
(Taking a bite of the plump fish)

356
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:24,975
(It's good.)

357
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,046
Look at the deodeok.

358
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,086
Deodeok with makgeolli...

359
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:31,115
- That's all you need.
- Darling, you're cute.

360
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:33,186
The skate looks cute too.

361
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:36,955
(Seung Ho devours skate first.)

362
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,495
It could cause big trouble.

363
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,166
This is amazing.

364
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,165
(Between two members with a big appetite)

365
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,635
Is there a store that makes this japchae?

366
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,175
(Tae Hyun with a small appetite)

367
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,745
They must serve everything with ginseng.

368
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,144
(He eats...)

369
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,916
(and eats.)

370
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:00,985
On our way back...

371
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,854
(Tae Hyun's chopsticks move endlessly.)

372
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,656
I'm sure that they'll eat together.

373
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,086
This is amazing.

374
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,395
I'm eating.

375
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,956
(Humming)

376
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,395
(Humming)

377
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:14,725
It's delicious.

378
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,635
- What did you eat?
- Oysters.

379
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,795
Oysters?

380
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,905
It's my first time hearing him hum after eating.

381
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,005
(Look at this.)

382
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,275
You're eating with such gusto.

383
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,356
(Delicious food pairing that increases the appetite)

384
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,845
This is healthy.

385
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:29,345
Why aren't they calling us?

386
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,916
Shouldn't we tell them that we'll finish in Suncheon?

387
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,086
Yi Kyung is calling me.

388
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,186
(Interested)

389
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,055
(Focused)

390
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,456
- He's calling you?
- Hello?

391
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,855
- Tae Hyun.
- Hey.

392
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:47,666
You used the GPS at the right time.

393
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,865
How do you know that?

394
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:51,764
It's obvious.

395
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,335
You don't know.

396
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,706
You could have gone to Jindo or Naju,

397
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,945
but you went straight to Haenam.

398
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:03,075
You probably realized that we went to Yeongam from the GPS.

399
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:06,214
Instead of going to the bakery in Yeongam,

400
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,375
didn't you go somewhere else?

401
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:08,715
Yes.

402
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:11,816
The owner told us.

403
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:13,586
How did you find out?

404
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,455
He told us that you stopped by.

405
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:16,655
Do you have his phone number?

406
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,095
He told us that you stopped by.

407
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,665
(What?)

408
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,835
Dong Hyun, let me tell you one thing.

409
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:25,365
We didn't use the GPS. We saw you.

410
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,264
You saw us?

411
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,206
Yes, we saw you in Yeongam.

412
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:30,435
Really?

413
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:32,705
We'll go to Suncheon and finish the game.

414
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,344
Just stay warm in the sauna.

415
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,045
Let's see who gets there faster.

416
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:38,614
We're approaching Naju right now.

417
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:39,785
All right.

418
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,185
- Bye.
- Talk to you later.

419
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:43,556
(He hangs up quickly after a war of nerves.)

420
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,385
They're heading to Suncheon after all.

421
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:47,854
They want to see who gets there faster.

422
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,395
(Their plan worked.)

423
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,555
He simply told us.

424
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:52,871
(Information about the opponents is easy to find out.)

425
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,426
Today,

426
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:58,095
we'll go with Seung Ho's strategy.

427
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:00,505
We won't complete the bingo today.

428
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,874
Until 8pm tonight,

429
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,275
we'll keep winning the squares.

430
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:05,906
We're serious.

431
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,816
(Inside the van on their way to Haenam B)

432
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:11,275
(Seung Ho noticed something on the karaoke card.)

433
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,345
It says here on the karaoke card.

434
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:16,915
Instead of completing the bingo,

435
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,585
if we decide to keep winning the squares,

436
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:19,855
we won't have to use this card.

437
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,354
(It must be used before completing the bingo.)

438
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,425
(Seung Ho interpreted the card logically.)

439
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:28,166
Why you... Seung Ho finished adapting to the show.

440
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,336
Please keep it a secret.

441
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:35,335
Directors, please keep this promise.

442
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,506
You can't call them.

443
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:37,806
Seriously.

444
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,976
Where are we going next?

445
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,551
Let's go to Haenam A.

446
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,016
(Haenam A, makgeolli)

447
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:46,463
We'll be in big trouble if they arrive before us.

448
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:47,702
- In Suncheon?
- Yes.

449
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,341
We'll probably get there first.

450
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,342
- We'll get there first.
- Right.

451
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:55,553
(Naganeupseong Folk Village in Suncheon)

452
00:17:56,753 --> 00:18:00,583
(Next to Naganeupseong fortress walls that are well preserved)

453
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:09,063
(There's a brewery that makes a traditional taste.)

454
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:10,891
(Takju)

455
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,263
I think we got here first.

456
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:15,472
It looks very traditional here.

457
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:16,503
It looks beautiful.

458
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:18,303
It looks traditional.

459
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,341
(What kind of traditional liquor will they find in Suncheon?)

460
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,911
It looks amazing.

461
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:24,013
This is someone's house.

462
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:25,681
Right.

463
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:27,583
- Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:28,951
- Welcome.
- Hello.

465
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:31,512
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

466
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,381
- I'm Oh Sang Uk.
- Hello.

467
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,223
Nice to meet you.

468
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:37,852
Please have a seat before the introduction.

469
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:40,862
We're three big men.

470
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,262
The wooden bench is small...

471
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,862
for men with big builds.

472
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:46,901
When it comes to Korean alcohol,

473
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,533
most people only know about makgeolli, dongdongju, and soju.

474
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:53,543
Actually, makgeolli is one of various types of takju.

475
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,272
We repeat the process of making...

476
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,772
in order to increase the taste and the alcohol content.

477
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,212
As a result, there are many types of takju.

478
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,242
(Various types of takju can be made.)

479
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:04,553
At my brewery, we repeat the process three times.

480
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,922
It's called Samyangju.

481
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:09,522
"Sam" means three, "yang" means to make, and "ju" is alcohol.

482
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,563
In other words, it was made by fermenting it three times.

483
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,792
- So it has a high alcohol content.
- I see.

484
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,292
It's about 15 percent.

485
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,802
- That's as much as wine.
- Wine?

486
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:22,601
When alcohol is fermented several times,

487
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:26,341
you can taste various flavors of fruit or flowers.

488
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:28,202
- You'll find out soon.
- Okay.

489
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,572
Takju should be shaken before drinking.

490
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:31,641
That's right.

491
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,082
When you shake makgeolli,

492
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,782
- most people...
- Doesn't it explode?

493
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,813
He didn't get scared.

494
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,482
Please be careful.

495
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:39,452
He could react to your movement.

496
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:41,951
- I would react out of habit.
- Out of habit.

497
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:42,952
Please be careful.

498
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,253
If not, you might get hurt.

499
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,763
Even if you shake this,

500
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,661
- it won't overflow at all.
- You're right.

501
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:49,732
(Takju doesn't overflow.)

502
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,131
- Is it makgeolli without gas?
- There's no gas in it.

503
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:53,132
- All the makgeolli...
- Why is that?

504
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,901
That we tasted today was carbonated.

505
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,201
Sometimes, carbon dioxide that's formed is...

506
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,503
- kept in the bottle.
- Right?

507
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,701
Do you get rid of the carbon dioxide?

508
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,171
Carbon dioxide disappears naturally when it's fermented for a long time.

509
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:04,743
It disappears into the air.

510
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:07,111
- Would you like to try some?
- Yes.

511
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,152
- I'll serve Sung Hoon first.
- Thank you.

512
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:10,712
I can tell that he likes makgeolli.

513
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:12,053
He's a big fan.

514
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,023
- Thank you.
- He's someone with depth.

515
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,382
Thank you.

516
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,022
Here you go.

517
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,891
(All of them are served thick-looking takju.)

518
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:19,892
Thank you.

519
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:21,161
(Sung Hoon smells it first.)

520
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:23,263
- Thank you.
- It smells like makgeolli.

521
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:24,391
Thank you for the drink.

522
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:25,632
Please try it.

523
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,901
It's quite strong.

524
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,743
Yes, it has a high alcohol content.

525
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,743
- This tastes good.
- It tastes sweet to me.

526
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:39,989
- I like when it's sweet.
- There's a strong aftertaste.

527
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:42,482
It's made only with rice, traditional nuruk,

528
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,713
- and underground bedrock water.
- I see.

529
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:46,752
The sweet taste comes...

530
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,792
from the natural sweetness of rice.

531
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,621
We went around all day today to taste makgeolli.

532
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,262
I didn't know that it could be this good.

533
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,661
- Makgeolli tastes so good.
- It's delicious.

534
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,392
It's good enough to sell abroad.

535
00:20:57,793 --> 00:21:00,101
I agree. Can we try other alcohol?

536
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:01,861
This is cheongju.

537
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,732
It's alcohol that's transparent.

538
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,773
I'll serve the one whose glass is empty.

539
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,341
Thank you.

540
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:10,473
(Sung Hoon savors the drink slowly.)

541
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,382
(How does cheongju taste?)

542
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,013
Gosh.

543
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,253
It tastes good.

544
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,752
This tastes really good.

545
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:19,952
This tastes much better.

546
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:23,351
Many people would drink this because they like the flavor.

547
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,652
You know what it tastes like?

548
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,421
Orange or yuzu.

549
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:28,822
- Or tangerine.
- You have a keen sense of taste.

550
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,532
It's like wine flavored with tangerine.

551
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,701
Of all that we tasted today,

552
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:33,982
- this is my favorite.
- Really?

553
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,503
It was fermented by nuruk.

554
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:39,302
There are different types of yeast inside the nuruk.

555
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:41,543
As they interact,

556
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:45,572
they create delicious flavors that are different every time.

557
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:46,682
It's a natural product.

558
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,642
I see.

559
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:52,152
(Thanks to nature)

560
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,881
After Korea gained independence,

561
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,421
making alcohol without a license was prohibited.

562
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,752
We weren't allowed to make alcohol at home.

563
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:57,951
Do you know why?

564
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,661
It was called the Grain Management Act.

565
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:01,861
As people didn't have enough rice to eat,

566
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,132
we weren't allowed to waste rice on making alcohol.

567
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:05,362
(Exclaiming)

568
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,732
- We couldn't answer that.
- We should've come here first.

569
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,432
- I know.
- We should've come here first.

570
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,502
(Regretful)

571
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:13,902
- Was that your quiz?
- Yes.

572
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:15,402
You told us so naturally.

573
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,372
We should've come here first. You're right.

574
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:19,743
Instead of eating, they made alcohol with rice.

575
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,841
(They regret on the timing.)

576
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,151
You offered us good alcohol.

577
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:25,212
- It was a great experience.
- Thank you.

578
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,851
Please support Korean alcohol.

579
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:29,493
- Of course.
- Thank you.

580
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,851
(Team Guys)

581
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,993
The wind is strong, and I'm full.

582
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:35,891
- I can't believe that we're here.
- This place...

583
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,232
(Haenam A, makgeolli)

584
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,202
- We came to the famous brewery.
- Unbelievable.

585
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:45,201
(Next to the wide field in Haenam)

586
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:47,341
(A simple brewery is located.)

587
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:50,872
(They're leading the enhancement of Korean traditional liquor.)

588
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:52,881
(Brewery with a beautiful garden, 1927)

589
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:55,543
(What kind of story will they hear at this place?)

590
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:58,681
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

591
00:22:58,682 --> 00:23:00,252
- Hello.
- Welcome.

592
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,023
I recognize you.

593
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:04,053
- Hello.
- He's also dressed.

594
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,723
Welcome.

595
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,062
I know the brand because it's so famous.

596
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:09,962
- It's impossible to visit here.
- Right.

597
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:11,963
Now that you're here today,

598
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:14,333
please enjoy 100 years of history.

599
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,702
- And taste our products.
- That's nice.

600
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,832
We'll enjoy 100 years of history.

601
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,072
A hundred years of history.

602
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,743
(We will enjoy 100 years of history.)

603
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,812
It looks different up close.

604
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,341
(Impressed)

605
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,381
Look at this tree.

606
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:29,043
All the trees look old.

607
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,282
Look at this tree. It looks amazing.

608
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:35,083
(When you follow Team Guys and go inside the brewery, )

609
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:40,793
(you find yourself in a beautiful garden.)

610
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:45,392
(Various trees each with history of its own)

611
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:50,003
(Meow)

612
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:53,602
This is a crape myrtle.

613
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:57,671
- You can tell that it's very old.
- Right.

614
00:23:57,672 --> 00:23:59,072
The tree isn't dead, right?

615
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,743
Right, it's about 800 years old.

616
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:02,851
This is unbelievable.

617
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:03,911
(A crape myrtle that's about 800 years old)

618
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:06,182
Do the flowers bloom in the spring?

619
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,652
Flowers bloom when we plant rice seedlings.

620
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:12,421
Flowers stay alive for 100 days until rice gets harvested.

621
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:13,962
- That's where the name comes from?
- Yes.

622
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:15,462
(Crape myrtle, flowers bloom around July.)

623
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:16,833
This tree is also...

624
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:20,131
Every tree at this place is like treasure.

625
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,402
(Every tree at this place is like treasure.)

626
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,872
Goodness, the cats look adorable.

627
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:26,941
Kittens.

628
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:29,171
(Cats run around freely in the brewery.)

629
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:30,812
Did these cats come from...

630
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:32,272
They were born here.

631
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,942
Were they born here?

632
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:35,841
I feed them.

633
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,983
I take care of them and take them to the doctor.

634
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,222
(Amazing)

635
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,052
What's that?

636
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:43,651
This is...

637
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,823
a brewery where we make alcohol.

638
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:48,322
- To pay respect to the deity...
- Deity?

639
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:51,293
(There's a mysterious bell on one side of the garden.)

640
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:54,032
I ring the bell every morning and night before praying.

641
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,232
(He prays and rings the bell for the alcohol to taste good.)

642
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,578
When you ring the bell three times,

643
00:24:57,602 --> 00:25:00,642
the deity will give you health and luck.

644
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,712
Please help Handsome Guys be successful.

645
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,441
(Please help Handsome Guys be successful.)

646
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:07,742
Please make Team Handsome fail.

647
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,141
(Laughing)

648
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:11,312
Please help us get off work first.

649
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,682
(He doesn't forget to wish for getting off work.)

650
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:15,922
My wishes will come true.

651
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,323
(Will they?)

652
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:21,822
(Team Guys spots something.)

653
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,533
Take a look at how we make hard rice.

654
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,533
I've never seen anyone make hard rice.

655
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:30,003
(White steam rises from a huge container.)

656
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:34,503
(Hard rice is getting cooked.)

657
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:36,911
It smells like rice.

658
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,112
So this is how it's done.

659
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,742
- Did the steam make it expand?
- Yes.

660
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:42,482
How does this work?

661
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:44,483
- It's being cooked with steam.
- Steam?

662
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:45,752
Is it how it's made?

663
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,023
Hard rice shouldn't be overly cooked.

664
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:50,252
- It should be nice and firm.
- Right.

665
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:51,552
(Fascinating)

666
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:54,921
How much rice is inside?

667
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,762
I would say...

668
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,892
about 400kg.

669
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,562
(No way.)

670
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:02,901
- It's cooking 400kg of rice.
- Yes.

671
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:06,372
(With organic glutinous rice that's milled once in two days)

672
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:10,172
(Nice and firm hard rice is cooked.)

673
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:13,612
- You should taste some.
- Yes.

674
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,941
You came a long way.

675
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,181
We have three different types.

676
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,052
It has 9, 12, and 18 percent alcohol.

677
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,181
- They have 18 percent.
- You have 18 percent?

678
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:23,391
That's right.

679
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:25,023
I'll serve the one in the middle.

680
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,162
- Thank you.
- He's the eldest among us.

681
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:29,691
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

682
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:30,692
(Thank you.)

683
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:33,802
This is...

684
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,502
makgeolli with guts.

685
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:36,702
(Makgeolli with guts)

686
00:26:36,902 --> 00:26:38,671
- This makes me happy.
- Thank you.

687
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:39,972
- I'll drink some with you.
- Sure.

688
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,942
- You should serve him a drink.
- I'll serve you.

689
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,641
Its alcohol content is nine percent,

690
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,582
- but it's very thick.
- It's really thick.

691
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,942
- Thank you for inviting us.
- Thank you.

692
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:55,382
(Smiling)

693
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,253
(Nodding)

694
00:26:58,392 --> 00:26:59,662
It's incredible.

695
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:01,022
This is...

696
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,292
I've had this often.

697
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:04,562
(Smiling big)

698
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:05,631
It's good.

699
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:07,232
I might be imagining it,

700
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,993
- but drinking it at its brewery...
- Right.

701
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:11,832
- It has 12 percent.
- Will you open it right away?

702
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,872
Yes.

703
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,272
He's nice and speedy.

704
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:17,172
- You'll open it now?
- Goodness.

705
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:19,243
He seems to understand...

706
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,382
our situation very well.

707
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:22,852
It's called supposition.

708
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:25,552
(The feeling of incorrect answer still lingers.)

709
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:28,253
I'd like to ask before getting too drunk.

710
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:31,252
How did you start this brewery?

711
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:33,722
- I'd like to hear your story.
- It's nothing special.

712
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:36,562
I came to visit here 20 years ago.

713
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:40,063
I loved the makgeolli so much that I often got it delivered.

714
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,062
That's how I got to know the owner.

715
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:43,833
He didn't have a successor,

716
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,701
so he asked me to do it.

717
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:47,441
It's been 20 years since I moved here.

718
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:49,142
- Were you a frequent customer?
- Yes.

719
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,473
You must have loved makgeolli a lot.

720
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:54,111
It was possible because he was a frequent customer.

721
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:55,912
Life happens according to your relationships.

722
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,052
You must love drinking.

723
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,373
You're truly a frequent customer.

724
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:00,921
That's why.

725
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:02,282
- Let's drink some.
- Hey.

726
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:03,851
What are you looking at?

727
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,222
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

728
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:07,091
The brewery owner is...

729
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:08,772
(We should taste the one with 12 percent.)

730
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,832
The packaging...

731
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:14,431
- of this bottle is golden.
- It's the bottle cap.

732
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,171
It's the limited edition.

733
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,333
Thank you.

734
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:18,702
Thank you.

735
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:22,973
(They also try makgeolli with 18 percent alcohol.)

736
00:28:24,142 --> 00:28:25,641
It tastes better and better.

737
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:26,812
- Right.
- My goodness.

738
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,982
Why doesn't it taste stronger?

739
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,782
When you drink this...

740
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,052
It's only for tasting.

741
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,573
Do you have an appointment after this?

742
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:35,582
We haven't finished this one.

743
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,322
This isn't bad. Don't stop him.

744
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,621
Yes, but it has 65 percent alcohol.

745
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,591
- We are...
- He's being understanding.

746
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,262
He's being very generous.

747
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,492
Gosh, what's that?

748
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:46,613
- It's a golden shot glass.
- Where did it come from?

749
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:48,161
(Laughing)

750
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:49,701
Where did that come from?

751
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:50,832
Have a drink.

752
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,701
In a golden glass?

753
00:28:52,702 --> 00:28:54,502
(Try the hard liquor in a golden shot glass.)

754
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:56,911
This tastes good because it's made with love.

755
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,743
Doesn't the 65 percent taste smooth?

756
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,341
I might not finish it.

757
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:03,911
(The thick concentration makes him dizzy.)

758
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:06,151
It tastes really good.

759
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:08,323
It tastes good and strong.

760
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,622
Gosh.

761
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:12,753
This is fascinating. My throat feels okay,

762
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:15,122
- but my chest...
- It burns inside.

763
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,293
I don't feel cold anymore.

764
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,661
Right.

765
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:22,502
(The vibe gets friendly instantly.)

766
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:24,171
(Moving about)

767
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:25,772
Keep it hidden from him.

768
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:26,901
(He hid the golden shot glass.)

769
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:28,473
If that disappears...

770
00:29:29,442 --> 00:29:31,773
(Something falls into it.)

771
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,743
It fell so beautifully.

772
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:36,713
Could you get a close shot of this?

773
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:39,983
A leaf fell into it right now.

774
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:41,823
Doesn't it look pretty?

775
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,292
People who like to drink would know.

776
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:44,293
(Well, it looks okay.)

777
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,222
People call your makgeolli...

778
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:48,493
the best makgeolli of all.

779
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,762
Is there a reason why you do this?

780
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,293
Do you have a goal?

781
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:56,063
Alcohol isn't necessarily healthy,

782
00:29:57,102 --> 00:30:00,202
but life is a series of stresses.

783
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:03,542
Instead of living under stress for five years without drinking,

784
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:04,812
I'd rather live ten years while drinking good alcohol.

785
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,141
I believe that it's a contribution to the country.

786
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:08,582
(Living happily for a long time while drinking good alcohol)

787
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,351
- Making good alcohol is your goal?
- Right.

788
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,582
(His goal is to make good alcohol.)

789
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,553
I'd like to make alcohol that makes us healthy.

790
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:17,091
This wasn't just about makgeolli.

791
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,823
We got a glimpse of the brewery owner's...

792
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:22,192
- sense of romance and life.
- Right.

793
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,492
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

794
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:24,832
Thank you very much for inviting us.

795
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,161
- I'll take the glasses back.
- The glasses?

796
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:28,332
Goodness.

797
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,573
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

798
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,102
That was amazing.

799
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,841
- Now...
- While being joyful,

800
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:34,941
shall we answer the quiz?

801
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,073
- Okay.
- Let's focus.

802
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:37,841
Let's try...

803
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:40,312
to freshen up from our last mistake.

804
00:30:40,313 --> 00:30:41,611
- Please.
- Here's your quiz.

805
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:42,612
- Okay.
- Okay.

806
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:45,783
In "Kojiki" that records Japanese ancient history...

807
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,783
Oh, my goodness.

808
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:50,192
A man named Susuheori from Baekjae came over...

809
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:51,822
and transferred...

810
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,522
a new method of making alcohol with this.

811
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:58,833
Since then, he was respected as a deity of alcohol by the Japanese.

812
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:01,161
What could this be?

813
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,572
(He transferred a new method of making alcohol with this.)

814
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:04,702
Hold on.

815
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:08,142
- What is it?
- Didn't you read it a moment ago?

816
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,171
(What do you mean?)

817
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:12,442
You're right.

818
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:15,083
We read it before ringing the bell.

819
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:16,651
I didn't read it myself,

820
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:17,912
so I'm asking you now.

821
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,723
I was in the back...

822
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:23,121
I was looking at the falling leaves in the back.

823
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:24,252
(Seung Ho in the past, why did you do that?)

824
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:25,421
"Why didn't I read it?"

825
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,891
(30 minutes ago)

826
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:29,222
(The brewing master in Baekjae called Susubori)

827
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,233
(The older members were reading the passage.)

828
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,602
(Enjoying the foliage and relaxing)

829
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,502
- Wait.
- Why didn't I read that?

830
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:39,671
Was it a candid camera?

831
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,572
Wait, newly harvested rice, glutinous rice...

832
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:42,941
If his name is Susubori, isn't it barley?

833
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,942
(Simple)

834
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,972
That's just his name.

835
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,742
In the question, his name was Susuheori.

836
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:49,543
- It was written "Susubori." - Susubori.

837
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:53,023
I don't think his name is important.

838
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,672
It's asking what it was made with, so it must be an ingredient.

839
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:59,152
What we learned so far for Korean traditional liquor...

840
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:00,523
Newly harvested rice.

841
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,263
- Glutinous rice.
- Glutinous rice.

842
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:04,662
Wasn't the alcohol made with barley?

843
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:07,002
- Isn't it barley?
- When I read that,

844
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:09,063
did I say the word "glutinous rice?"

845
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:11,533
I definitely read that out loud.

846
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:13,772
(Frustrated)

847
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,442
I read that...

848
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,671
out loud like this.

849
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:18,672
I didn't expect...

850
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,483
(Tae Hyun read it diligently.)

851
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:22,141
We won't win like this.

852
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:25,682
Why don't we narrow down the answer?

853
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,552
Newly harvested rice, glutinous rice, and barley. That's all.

854
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,323
- Is there more?
- Nuruk.

855
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,852
Nuruk?

856
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:35,391
Why does "wheat" pop up in my head?

857
00:32:35,392 --> 00:32:39,732
Like an arrow into my brain, "wheat" came up on my mind,

858
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:40,901
but I don't know why.

859
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:42,733
I just remember his name, Susubori.

860
00:32:43,202 --> 00:32:44,772
I probably read it a moment ago.

861
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,032
I might remember it.

862
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,872
If we fail this quiz...

863
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,472
What was it?

864
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:52,111
Or we can get it wrong and head to Jindo now.

865
00:32:52,112 --> 00:32:53,112
Shall we?

866
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:55,341
That sounds more realistic.

867
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,381
Shall we?

868
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:57,782
- Let's pick a good one.
- Yi Kyung.

869
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,463
- Each of you, say one answer.
- Yi Kyung.

870
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:01,882
Say one answer each.

871
00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:04,391
If I get it wrong again, I have no right to say anything,

872
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,192
- but I think that it's nuruk.
- Nuruk?

873
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:07,361
What about you, Tae Hyun?

874
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,391
(Nuruk?)

875
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:11,032
I'm so sorry, but I don't remember reading nuruk.

876
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,273
- I don't think that it's nuruk.
- Newly harvested rice?

877
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:14,502
I can't read that.

878
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:16,062
- How did I skip just that word?
- We can't read that.

879
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,371
It's too far,

880
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,572
but I read it a moment ago.

881
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,842
I even read it out loud.

882
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,702
- We read it together.
- But...

883
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:26,073
It's either newly harvested rice or non-glutinous rice?

884
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,641
Newly harvested rice?

885
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,381
I don't think that I read non-glutinous rice.

886
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,782
Don't you think that it was newly harvested rice?

887
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:31,852
What do you think it is?

888
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,653
It's either glutinous rice or nuruk.

889
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,523
Are you convinced about nuruk?

890
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:39,793
All the makgeolli we tasted had nuruk.

891
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:41,853
It feels like I read it somewhere else.

892
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,463
Makgeolli is made with nuruk.

893
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:47,702
Isn't nuruk what remains?

894
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:49,302
Listen, Yi Kyung.

895
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:52,173
There's a lot of transparent alcohol in Japan.

896
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:55,443
- But...
- What's wrong with you?

897
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,213
You still can't see it.

898
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,812
There's a lot of transparent alcohol in Japan.

899
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:01,642
But...

900
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,351
(What is he doing?)

901
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:04,653
You still can't see it.

902
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,253
Not being able to see it makes me crazy.

903
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:09,752
- Goodness.
- I can't see anything!

904
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:10,951
You're acting like you're drunk.

905
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:11,951
- No.
- What is this?

906
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:14,692
Yi Kyung, think about it this way.

907
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:17,491
In Japan, whether it's glutinous rice or newly harvested rice,

908
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:19,292
they must have had alcohol made with rice...

909
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,732
before Susuheori arrived in Japan.

910
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:24,833
Do you really think that they didn't have such alcohol?

911
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,602
I bet that they did.

912
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:28,372
Why?

913
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,542
I think your answer is right.

914
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,742
- In Korea...
- He probably discovered nuruk.

915
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,312
I trust you.

916
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:36,142
Don't you think nuruk was a starter?

917
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:39,252
When you add it, it explodes.

918
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:42,221
(Exhaling deeply)

919
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,592
My answer is nuruk. We have to hurry and go.

920
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:45,652
Then I'm out.

921
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:47,122
I don't think that it's right.

922
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:48,692
Either way, we have to hurry.

923
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:49,991
- Leave me out of it.
- We have no choice.

924
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:51,661
- Answer whatever you want.
- No.

925
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,092
- I can't do this.
- You answer it.

926
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:56,101
I can't answer it. I can't do it anymore.

927
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:59,102
If I answer wrong again...

928
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,442
(Scared)

929
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:01,801
- Tae Hyun.
- Then I'll say it.

930
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,312
- I know the answer.
- Wait.

931
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:05,842
- We need to go now.
- Come back, Yi Kyung.

932
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:07,542
We need to leave.

933
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,942
Just go with nuruk.

934
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,882
- Say it.
- I have no idea.

935
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:11,883
Just say it.

936
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:13,153
- Is that your answer?
- Yes.

937
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,982
- I have no idea.
- Please say your answer.

938
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,391
- Okay.
- The answer is nuruk.

939
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:19,422
(Answer: Nuruk)

940
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,891
What Susuheori spread in Japan.

941
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:22,962
(No, no)

942
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:23,963
Is it nuruk?

943
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,402
(I can't watch this.)

944
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:29,801
(Nervous)

945
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,832
(Answer: Nuruk)

946
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:31,833
That's correct.

947
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,442
(Screaming)

948
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:36,241
(What?)

949
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,242
(Shouting)

950
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:38,943
I told you. Nuruk...

951
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,382
(Nuruk men run out right away.)

952
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:41,412
Hey.

953
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:44,451
- Where is it?
- Nuruk.

954
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:47,522
"The brewing master taught how to make alcohol with nuruk."

955
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:48,552
It's nuruk.

956
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,122
Seung Ho.

957
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:51,693
How did you know? Did you read it?

958
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:52,952
No.

959
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:54,922
- I didn't read it.
- I hugged him like this last week.

960
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:56,322
I really didn't read it.

961
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,931
I hugged Seung Ho just like this last week.

962
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,402
(According to "Kojiki")

963
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:02,431
Seung Ho, that was amazing.

964
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,432
- This is...
- Tae Hyun.

965
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,502
How did you know? Did you feel something?

966
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:07,773
(It's considered an important incident in Japan.)

967
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:09,242
Did you feel it?

968
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:12,443
There was always nuruk in every alcohol that we learned today.

969
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,943
There was always nuruk.

970
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:15,983
- Today is Seung Ho's day.
- Nuruk.

971
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:17,883
Both of them insisted on it.

972
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,322
- We got it.
- This is amazing.

973
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:21,923
- Nuruk.
- Nuruk.

974
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:25,851
(Haenam A, makgeolli)

975
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,891
Something important awaits us.

976
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,093
- For us?
- Yes.

977
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:31,832
(Cuckoo)

978
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:32,891
- What?
- Gosh.

979
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,503
Haenam A.

980
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,773
They won both Haenam.

981
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:38,832
- They went to this one.
- This is what they got.

982
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,943
They're trying to win more than us.

983
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:43,173
We traveled far for nothing.

984
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,263
We came here because we expected them here.

985
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:47,343
Gosh.

986
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:49,342
They knew that we'd come here...

987
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,712
and went somewhere else.

988
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:53,451
Team Guys are really quick.

989
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:54,983
On top of that, they got it right.

990
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:56,891
Something seems strange.

991
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:58,392
They're up to something.

992
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:02,423
Here's your quiz in Suncheon.

993
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,531
Among famous tourist spots in Suncheon,

994
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:07,003
there's a place called Suncheon Bay National Garden.

995
00:37:07,403 --> 00:37:09,232
- Suncheon Bay National Garden?
- I don't know what it is.

996
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,233
(Confident)

997
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,173
- In Suncheon?
- It's a big garden.

998
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:14,542
When the garden was created,

999
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:18,471
the first thing they planted was a pine tree.

1000
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:22,182
That tree is about 15m long, and it weighs about 5t.

1001
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,752
When they were transferring the pine tree,

1002
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,221
the helicopter wasn't able to lift the tree at all.

1003
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:29,752
While everyone was worried,

1004
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,153
the head manager who planted this tree suggested...

1005
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,863
pouring this to the tree before lifting it.

1006
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,833
Only then, the tree could be lifted.

1007
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,233
What could this be?

1008
00:37:40,403 --> 00:37:41,863
He poured something on it?

1009
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,372
Makgeolli?

1010
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,702
Dong Hyun, no way.

1011
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:49,042
Sung Hoon, please say something.

1012
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:50,112
- It's very hard.
- Please.

1013
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:51,912
The question is really hard.

1014
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,343
Could it be oil?

1015
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,741
- Oil? Why oil?
- It can't be, right?

1016
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:58,011
When the roots absorb the oil,

1017
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,758
- It can be lifted easily?
- pulling it out is easier.

1018
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:01,383
Why not pesticides instead?

1019
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:04,092
To melt all the roots.

1020
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,193
The tree should slip out of the ground.

1021
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,992
We learned about alcohol throughout the day.

1022
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,383
What does alcohol have anything to do with this?

1023
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:13,801
We should've gone to the sauna instead.

1024
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,563
- Goodness.
- You're right.

1025
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:16,871
Going to the sauna and eating skate...

1026
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:18,932
- would have been perfect.
- We lost anyway.

1027
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,872
Sung Hoon, please answer it at least once.

1028
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,512
You have years of experience.

1029
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,412
- Sung Hoon.
- Sesame oil?

1030
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:27,741
- No, that's not right.
- Sesame oil?

1031
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:31,153
That's not it. Please, Sung Hoon.

1032
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,423
Could it be arrowroot juice?

1033
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:36,022
- Arrowroot juice?
- I have no idea.

1034
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,653
Wouldn't it be better to say a type of alcohol?

1035
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,392
Makgeolli.

1036
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:43,093
- Right, makgeolli or...
- Could it be makgeolli?

1037
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:44,391
The answer can't be makgeolli...

1038
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:46,333
when we had some. That's too easy.

1039
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:49,403
But alcohol...

1040
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,772
has energy.

1041
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,871
- I think that it's oil.
- Oil?

1042
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:55,943
(Supporter of oil)

1043
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:57,942
- Oil?
- Tears?

1044
00:38:57,943 --> 00:38:58,971
(Supporter of tears)

1045
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:00,313
Maybe he cried.

1046
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:01,813
(Laughing)

1047
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,281
- After crying...
- Dong Hyun.

1048
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:05,012
Go away.

1049
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:07,682
When he cried, the tree came out.

1050
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:08,882
(Gosh, where are you going?)

1051
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,991
- On top of it.
- By saying it was good.

1052
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:12,922
Since the old days, there was that power...

1053
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:14,092
- to liquor.
- Exactly.

1054
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:15,362
- I agree.
- I'm sure of it.

1055
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,391
When there was an event of some sort,

1056
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:18,732
- liquor had to be poured.
- Exactly.

1057
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,062
A lot of the time,

1058
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:22,201
the answer is the opposite of what I think.

1059
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:23,722
- The opposite?
- I think it's liquor.

1060
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:24,932
Darn.

1061
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,101
You think it's liquor?

1062
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:29,142
- Really?
- I mostly guess the opposite.

1063
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:30,411
- Darn.
- And I think it's liquor.

1064
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:31,813
It can't be liquor, then.

1065
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,583
It could be the right answer.

1066
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:34,813
I'm sure it's liquor.

1067
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,511
We have time to go to one more place.

1068
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:38,652
We should at least aim for a tie.

1069
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,483
If we get this wrong, we'll go and eat.

1070
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,621
We'll guess liquor and leave if we get it wrong.

1071
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:43,992
- Sure.
- Sung Hoon, go ahead.

1072
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:46,492
The answer is...

1073
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,321
I learned a lot from liquor today...

1074
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,492
which I appreciate.

1075
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:51,432
The answer is liquor.

1076
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:53,161
You guessed liquor.

1077
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:55,403
Please let us get one right.

1078
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:57,572
- Please let us get one right.
- Please.

1079
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,443
What kind of liquor?

1080
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:04,312
- What did I tell you?
- We guessed correctly.

1081
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:06,813
- It's liquor.
- We were right.

1082
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:09,242
Sung Hoon, it has to be makgeolli.

1083
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,982
Remember what we're here for.

1084
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,051
- Makgeolli.
- Makgeolli, right?

1085
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:15,152
- Right.
- Makgeolli.

1086
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:16,681
- We must guess makgeolli.
- Makgeolli.

1087
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,192
- It has to be makgeolli.
- Makgeolli.

1088
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,673
- Makgeolli?
- Makgeolli, the liquor.

1089
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:21,821
- It has to be right.
- Yes, makgeolli.

1090
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:24,532
(Answer: Makgeolli)

1091
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:25,962
- We got it right.
- We got one right!

1092
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:26,963
That's a first.

1093
00:40:27,262 --> 00:40:29,833
- My gosh.
- Oil, did you say?

1094
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:32,572
Why would anyone pour oil?

1095
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,741
(Yes!)

1096
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:35,871
- My gosh.
- You're the best.

1097
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:38,272
- You at least got one right.
- Exactly.

1098
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:39,543
I admit you did good.

1099
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:41,812
No way.

1100
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:43,043
- Yes!
- Yes!

1101
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:44,282
Makgeolli.

1102

(Waiting for the food)

1108
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:00,833
We need to eat and hurry along.

1109
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:02,833
What could be tastier?

1110
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,871
- Our dinner?
- The skate combo is good.

1111
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:05,971
Yes, the skate combo is better.

1112
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:07,572
- Let's go to Naju.
- We're off to Naju.

1113
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,543
- We have only until 8pm.
- Right.

1114
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,071
- It's 6pm.
- That's when we have...

1115
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:14,141
to be in the parking lot.

1116
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,182
That's right.

1117
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:17,282
We have 20 minutes to eat.

1118
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,952
Right. Let's eat and hurry along.

1119
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,583
(Goodness)

1120
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:24,292
(The cockle set menu is served in no time.)

1121
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:25,322
This is incredible.

1124
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:31,991
No way.

1125
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,432
- Is this spicy cockle salad?
- Yes.

1126
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,801
Everything's so pretty. How pretty is this?

1127
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:37,972
(Cockle set menu in Suncheon)

1128
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,741
- This is a lot.
- They serve a feast.

1129
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:41,942
(The feast didn't disappoint.)

1130
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,511
This is a first for me.

1131
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:47,682
- What's this for?
- You open the cockle with it.

1132
00:41:50,483 --> 00:41:51,682
How does one use this?

1133
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:54,852
(He just takes it to his mouth.)

1134
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:56,992
- Have one each.
- The cockle...

1135
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:00,293
First, grab it by the top and bottom.

1136
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:01,863
Then, slide this in.

1137
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:04,161
- In the other direction?
- It's in the other direction.

1138
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:05,233
Okay.

1139
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,863
- Squeeze to open.
- Goodness.

1140
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:09,302
(How to shuck a cockle: 3. Open shell from behind.)

1141
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:10,702
I'll enjoy it.

00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,872
(Clip!)

1143
00:42:14,503 --> 00:42:15,842
(See?)

1144
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:18,072
(Easy, isn't it?)

1145
00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:19,542
It's good.

1146
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:20,903
(Now that they obtained the skill)

1147
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:22,681
Should we have some makgeolli?

1148
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,752
Sure.

1149
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:25,483
- Sounds good.
- Here you go.

1150
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:27,122
- Goodness.
- Thanks.

1151
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:29,182
(A refreshing glass of makgeolli)

1152
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:30,593
Gosh, that's good.

1153
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:32,622
- That's clean.
- That tastes great.

1154
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:36,193
(How is the spicy cockle salad?)

1155
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:37,463
Like this.

1156
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:38,862
(A heap of the spicy cockle salad is added to steamed white rice.)

1157
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:40,031
Add like so.

1158
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:41,278
I can't believe all these cockles.

1159
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:42,503
That's crazy.

1160
00:42:46,602 --> 00:42:47,602
(Humming in approval)

1161
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,503
This calls for rice.

1162
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,543
(The flavors are crazy.)

1163
00:42:58,182 --> 00:43:01,051
(It doesn't need an explanation.)

1164
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,822
- Isn't it good?
- It's to die for.

1165
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:04,951
I wasn't that hungry.

1166
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:07,292
- This increases my appetite.
- Don't I know it.

1167
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,593
Shouldn't we get going? Are we good on time?

1168
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:10,833
We need to check the clock.

1169
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:12,932
(In they go.)

1170
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:16,003
Who invented this?

1171
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:18,173
- Isn't this protein?
- Music to my ears.

1172
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:21,572
How is it this good?

1173
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,681
We need to leave within ten minutes.

1174
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:28,912
(What?)

1175
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,912
- We have eight minutes left.
- Really?

1176
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:32,153
We'll be done in no time.

1177
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:35,582
It's a bummer that we don't have enough time.

1178
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:37,051
Let's eat what we can.

1179
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:40,322
(Trust ourselves.)

1180
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:43,198
I've got the hang of this and can shuck it in seconds.

1181
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:44,363
(Snap)

1182
00:43:44,563 --> 00:43:45,662
There you go.

(4 minutes left, 6:16pm)

1184
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:51,733
This is as good as medicine.

1185
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:56,403
(They devour the food like it's a competition.)

1186
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,282
This is nice.

1187
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:06,813
We must go.

1188
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:10,022
- My temperature is rising again.
- What?

1189
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,693
It has gotten hot.

1190
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:14,391
- I want one more bite.
- It's hot.

1191
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:15,462
We need to go. I mean it.

1192
00:44:15,463 --> 00:44:17,022
I'm going to the restroom to wash my hands.

1193
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,563
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

1194
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:20,531
(The two get up despite wanting to stay.)

1195
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,632
- What a bummer.
- I'm going to the restroom too.

1196
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:23,633
Sure.

1197
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:25,602
This is good.

1198
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,872
(The baby brother can't stop eating again.)

1199
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:30,242
Goodness.

1200
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:33,642
I'm done.

1201
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,083
Let's go.

1202
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:40,922
We need to go. We're out of time.

1203
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:41,951
(Current time: 6:20pm)

1204
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:43,951
Guessing nuruk as the answer? That was the bomb.

1205
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:45,952
Nuruk? I would've never guessed it.

1206
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,362
(Cuckoo)

1207
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:49,422
- They got one right.
- Suncheon.

1208
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:51,063
- Okay.
- They went to Suncheon.

1209
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,062
We guessed they'd go to Suncheon.

1210
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:54,202
They went to Suncheon.

1211
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:57,273
After dinner, we'll be in the end game.

1212
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:01,642
(Haenam: Raw Spanish mackerel)

00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:04,313
(Enjoy shiny raw Spanish mackerel.)

1214
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:07,082
- Eat up, guys. We'll then move.
- Sure.

1215
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,042
Look at how plump the raw Spanish mackerel is.

1216
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:11,852
(Thick)

1217
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,252
Do you wrap the raw fish in that?

1218
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,922
Have it with the dried laver.

1219
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,951
- With this?
- Here you go.

1220
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,122
(That's new.)

00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:23,621
(Raw Spanish mackerel)

1224
00:45:23,622 --> 00:45:24,661

(Stack them carefully.)

1228
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,301
Look at how thick they are.

1229
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:34,641
(Make a wrap and enjoy!)

1230
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:35,742
I'll enjoy.

1231
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:37,312
- You like vinegar gochujang.
- Yes.

1235
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:46,552
(Wait, these flavors...)

1236
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:47,722
The raw Spanish mackerel.

1237
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:51,192
It melts in your mouth as is.

1238
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,852
I know. It's quite nutty as well.

1239
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:56,222
This is what raw Spanish mackerel is like.

1240
00:45:56,722 --> 00:45:57,832
Look at how thick it is.

1241
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,093
(They love it.)

1242
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:01,761
Tae Hyun, look at you eat.

1243
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:02,862
This is delicious.

1244
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,301
You eat in a way that makes the food look tasty.

1245
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:06,302
(Laughing)

1246
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,371
The final battle will take place at the next location.

1247
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:10,372
- Let's go to Jindo.
- Let's go.

1248
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:11,411
We're off to Jindo.

1249
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,442
To Jindo.

1250
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:13,843
(They head out to go to Jindo.)

1251
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:17,142
(The current race so far)

1252
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:19,511
(Team Guys, Gangjin, Soju)

1253
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:22,851
(Team Guys are geniuses when it comes to the quiz.)

1254
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,092
We did it.

1255
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:25,991
(Another correct answer!)

1256
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,721
(Team Guys, Haenam (B), Makgeolli)

1257
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:28,722
(Team Guys, Haenam (A), Makgeolli)

1258
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:30,833
(The team of actors let their brains guide them.)

1259
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:32,932
(Meanwhile)

1260
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,661
(Incorrect!)

1261
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,632
(They immediately used their reattempt card.)

1262
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:40,942
(Team Handsome, Jangheung, Dongdongju)

1263
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:43,371
(Team Handsome, Yeongam, Yakju)

1264
00:46:43,372 --> 00:46:45,471
(Team Handsome, Reattempt card)

1265
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,781
(They managed to stay in the game thanks to their lucky cards.)

1266
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:49,842
(Team Handsome, Suncheon, Takju)

1267
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:53,753
(Team Handsome is on a roll!)

1268
00:46:54,153 --> 00:46:56,552
(Current score 3:3)

1269
00:46:57,693 --> 00:47:01,293
(They must answer the next one correctly to win.)

1270
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:05,392
(7:30pm, Jindo, South Jeolla Province)

1271
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:09,032
(Jindo, Hongju)

1272
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:11,632
We ended up coming to Jindo.

1273
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,072
The hongju of Jindo.

1274
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:14,741
- Hello.
- Hello.

1275
00:47:14,742 --> 00:47:16,871
- The wait was long.
- Hi.

1276
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:18,411
- We're here in Jindo.
- Hello.

1277
00:47:18,412 --> 00:47:20,012
We're in Jindo.

1278
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:24,582
I'm the CEO of the brewery that makes Jindo's hongju.

1279
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,851
Hong in hongju means "red" which is why everything is in red.

1280
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:30,551
Right. Hongju of Jindo is made with rice...

1281
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:32,422
and an herb called red gromwell which is red.

1282
00:47:32,423 --> 00:47:34,122
- It's made with an herb.
- That's right.

1283
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,562
- That's why it's red.
- Exactly.

1284
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:42,262
(Jindo's hongju is known for its scarlet color.)

1285
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:46,032
(Red gromwell: An herb with red roots that grows in Korea)

1286
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:49,673
(Infusing red gromwell in soju)

1287
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,843
(Our traditional liquor of a long history with unique aroma)

1288
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:57,511
You're not coloring the liquor in any way.

1289
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:59,582
It's red because of the color of the roots.

1290
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,653
- That's right.
- I see.

1291
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:03,552
Rice and barley, a ratio of 7 to 3.

1292
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:06,452
- Nuruk is used once again.
- Right.

1293
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:09,962
How did Jindo come to brew hongju?

1294
00:48:09,963 --> 00:48:12,862
Since Goryeo Dynasty, Jindo was a place for exile...

1295
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:14,032
due to it being an island.

1296
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:17,871
(Being an isolate island, Jindo was a place for exile.)

1297
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:20,201
Those who were exiled...

1298
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:21,502
were usually scholars.

1299
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,343
(Many intellectuals who were exiled in Joseon)

1300
00:48:23,673 --> 00:48:25,343
They knew how to make liquor...

1301
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:27,412
which is how it came to this.

1302
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:30,511
(In "Sejong Chronicles," it was called a red soju.)

1303
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:32,812
(In "Seongjong Chronicles," it is recorded...)

1304
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:35,253
(that 10 bottles of red soju were gifted to a Chinese envoy.)

1305
00:48:35,523 --> 00:48:37,321
(Back then and even now, )

1306
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:42,892
(many breweries in Jindo are making hongju.)

1307
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:49,661
(There's a new way of sipping this traditional liquor.)

1308
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:50,971
Would you like to try it?

1309
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,802
- The liquor itself is too strong.
- I see.

1310
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:56,371
So I'll make you a cocktail with some soda.

1311
00:48:56,372 --> 00:48:58,313
(Soda is poured into a clear glass first.)

1312
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:00,273
This is 60-percent ABV.

1313
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:05,782
It's called The Sunset.

1314
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:08,083
- The Sunset!
- The Sunset?

1315
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:10,483
That's a pretty name. The Sunset.

1316
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,451
- Gosh. The color is...
- Goodness.

1317
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,132
- It divides into layers.
- It's splendid.

1318
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:15,592
(Staring)

1319
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,023
It's so pretty.

1320
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:19,192
The Sunset.

1321
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:20,702
(Yi Kyung tastes it first.)

1322
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,332
- It's amazing. Look.
- Gosh.

1323
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:28,072
- It smells like the 60 percent.
- Look.

1324
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:30,003
Really? Does it still smell like it?

1325
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:32,613
It tastes good.

1326
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,142
- That's true.
- Tae Hyun, it tastes nice.

1327
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:36,412
Does it taste nice?

1328
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:37,582
It doesn't taste strong.

1329
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,459
It's so interesting. It smells strong, but it's not.

1330
00:49:39,483 --> 00:49:41,321
It smells strong, but it doesn't taste strong.

1331
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:44,422
Now, it's mixed to suit its name.

1332
00:49:44,423 --> 00:49:45,423
(Electrifying)

1333
00:49:46,093 --> 00:49:48,722
You had the strong liquor first.

1334
00:49:49,093 --> 00:49:50,222
You had the undiluted part.

1335
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:52,792
(He hurries to try the one that's more diluted.)

1336
00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:53,873
That one's pretty good too.

1337
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,833
It's the same.

1338
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,273
(The tasting is tough for Tae Hyun.)

1339
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:01,943
Ma'am, today,

1340
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:04,343
we've been tasting liquors since 9am.

1341
00:50:05,173 --> 00:50:07,141
Honestly, I think this one is the strongest.

1342
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:08,618
(Honestly, I think this one is the strongest.)

1343
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:10,812
- It's the strongest.
- This one's ABV is 60 percent.

1344
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:12,781
- It's stronger, right?
- Yes. It's different from others.

1345
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:14,922
Compared to the others, ours is...

1346
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,882
- Is there a milder hongju?
- This is 40 percent.

1347
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,593
We should have tried that one first.

1348
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:21,222
We chugged the 60-percent one first.

1349
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:23,463
Ma'am, at this place,

1350
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,093
do you go downward?

1351
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:28,302
We usually went upward.

1352
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:30,431
For a second, I thought,

1353
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:31,872
"They must be all 60 percent ABV."

1354
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,943
"We can probably light one of them."

1355
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:37,173
We can light this one.

1356
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:40,072
(Don't worry!)

1357
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:42,082
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

1358
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,042
We appreciate your poetic description.

1359
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:46,383
Thank you for coming here.

1360
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,821
(Hongju, Time for Quiz)

1361
00:50:48,822 --> 00:50:49,983
It's a tight game.

1362
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:52,652
Gosh. We've come all the way to Jindo from Haenam.

1363
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:54,122
Okay. The quiz for Jindo.

1364
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:58,532
There's a story about a white Jindo dog...

1365
00:50:58,662 --> 00:51:00,333
that ran over 300km for 7 months...

1366
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,661
and came home after it was sold...

1367
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:05,801
to a family in Daejeon in 1993.

1368
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:07,031
Have you heard of the story?

1369
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:08,343
I think I've heard of it.

1370
00:51:08,403 --> 00:51:11,172
- It was the dog...
- I saw it on TV or something.

1371
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:13,312
(This quiz is on video.)

1372
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:16,442
(Today's video quiz)

(Running 300km to find its owner, A story of a Jindo dog)

1374
00:51:19,552 --> 00:51:21,952
It's a true story about a Jindo dog...

1375
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:24,173
that leaves to find its owner after it was sold.

1376
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:25,552
It's an ad.

1377
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:28,662
The longing it can't get rid of in its lifetime.

1378
00:51:29,563 --> 00:51:33,162
How touching is it to see...

1379
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:35,802
how it serves only one person in its life?

1380
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:39,733
Once an owner, you'll forever be the owner.

1381
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:43,142
Is this the dog?

1382
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:45,011
Is it over?

1383
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:46,072
Yes.

1384
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,182
Here is the question.

1385
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:51,452
You just watched an ad.

1386
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:56,452
What product is the ad selling?

1387
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:59,391
That ad...

1388
00:51:59,392 --> 00:52:00,752
(He can't go on.)

1389
00:52:00,753 --> 00:52:01,891
Let's write down whatever comes to our minds.

1390
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:05,132
The ad was aired in 1996.

1391
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,633
How old were you in 1996?

1392
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:08,802
Maybe a few months old.

1393
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:10,833
I was born in November, 1995.

1394
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:12,903
Were you born in 1996?

1395
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,071
I wasn't even one year old yet.

1396
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:18,212
Gosh. Tae Hyun, you're our only hope. I...

1397
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:20,042
I was an elementary school student, but...

1398
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:21,812
- This is so...
- I...

1399
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:23,313
That song.

1400
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:25,351
Yes. It sounds familiar.

1401
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:26,411
(To the one born in 1989, the melody sounds so familiar.)

1402
00:52:26,412 --> 00:52:27,412
As soon as I heard it...

1403
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:29,422
Many telecom companies used such a tune.

1404
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:30,582
In 1996,

1405
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,852
they did have cellphones,

1406
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:34,562
- but they were...
- They weren't Anycall?

1407
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,193
Anycall...

1408
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:38,092
I shot the ad for it.

1409
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:39,132
That came out...

1410
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:41,403
- much later than 2000.
- That came out later?

1411
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,403
(Smiling)

1412
00:52:44,472 --> 00:52:47,472
(Tae Hyun was quite bright back then.)

1413
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:52,343
(It's been a while, but this was from 2002!)

1414
00:52:52,843 --> 00:52:56,182
It's either an internet ad of the time or...

1415
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:58,212
They had a portal site called Chollian.

1416
00:52:58,213 --> 00:52:59,313
I know.

1417
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:01,451
- It could be internet-related.
- It could be a telecom company.

1418
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:03,583
Yes. It's either internet service or...

1419
00:53:04,122 --> 00:53:05,292
Back then...

1420
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,851
(I have no idea.)

1421
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:08,991
- I think...
- Can we hear it again?

1422
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:10,562
Of course. We can play it as much as you want.

1423
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,292
(They need to hear it again.)

1424
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:13,991
That song became really popular.

1425
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:15,232
It's a true story about a Jindo dog...

1426
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,971
that leaves to find its owner after it was sold.

1427
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,333
We have to be immersed in the ad.

1428
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:22,472
See? It finds its owner.

1429
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,112
It's a true story about finding its owner.

1430
00:53:25,113 --> 00:53:26,213
Help me infer it.

1431
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,142
You can't get rid of it.

1432
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:32,112
How touching is it to see...

1433
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:33,411
how it serves only one person in its life?

1434
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,153
How touching it is?

1435
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:37,523
(Woof)

1436
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:40,793
Once an owner, you'll forever be the owner.

1437
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:42,692
That's the key.

1438
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:44,333
(They grasp the ad through the feelings.)

1439
00:53:44,593 --> 00:53:47,531
(Thinking anguishedly)

1440
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:49,692
There used to be a computer called Jindo Dog Computer.

1441
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:53,431
If it's a computer...

1442
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:56,902
Does a story of a Jindo dog coming back to me...

1443
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,773
- makes sense?
- There was Jindo Dog Computer.

1444
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:01,043
There was Jindo Dog Computer or something.

1445
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:02,782
No?

1446
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:04,852
You've lived longer than me.

1447
00:54:05,653 --> 00:54:08,352
Even so, does it make sense?

1448
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,182
I think a car makes the most sense.

1449
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:14,293
We usually drive one car brand without changing it.

1450
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:16,762
That's true when choosing cars.

1451
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,133
- But...
- I...

1452
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:20,161
When he said Jindo Computer,

1453
00:54:20,162 --> 00:54:21,761
why do I feel like I've heard it somewhere?

1454
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,702
- There were many computer brands.
- I think...

1455
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:26,971
Why have I heard of it?

1456
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,842
- Where did I hear it?
- Is that a real one?

1457
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:31,972
Maybe I was gaslit by you, or...

1458
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:35,411
Maybe they did have a computer called Jindo Computer.

1459
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:38,051
I have good memories. Where is that memory from?

1460
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:40,051
(For a guy born in 1976, the memory of the time is blurry.)

1461
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:42,482
Okay. We'll hear it again twice.

1462
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:44,281
(He hears the question again out of frustration.)

1463
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:45,322
Okay.

1464
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:51,931
(Will the memory that left the house come back?)

1465
00:54:51,932 --> 00:54:55,102
(Team Guys' fate depends on it.)

1466
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:57,832
(Current time: 19:40, Team Handsome)

1467
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,032
For goodness' sake.

1468
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:01,953
Does it make sense the alarm didn't go off until now?

1469
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:05,113
They were so good, but did they get it wrong in Jindo?

1470
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:07,472
- Last week, - Yes.

1471
00:55:07,943 --> 00:55:09,382
We got the question long before,

1472
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:11,483
- but we hid until you came.
- Yes.

1473
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:13,912
Are they hiding somewhere right now?

1474
00:55:14,012 --> 00:55:15,181
In Naju.

1475
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:16,281
(Are they hiding in Naju after winning the game?)

1476
00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:18,352
- Last the last time?
- Yes.

1477
00:55:19,392 --> 00:55:21,962
- We're here.
- We're here for now.

1478
00:55:21,963 --> 00:55:23,292
Let's check the cars.

1479
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,539
(Team Handsome arrives in Naju while feeling anxious.)

1480
00:55:24,563 --> 00:55:27,192
- It feels fishy.
- It's fishy.

1481
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,462
They are busy.

1482
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,733
There are many cars too.

1483
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:33,531
But we did our best today, didn't we?

1484
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:34,742
- Come on.
- No?

1485
00:55:34,872 --> 00:55:36,542
I won't be fooled twice.

1486
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:38,411
- This doesn't feel right.
- Come on.

1487
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:40,011
- They must be hiding somewhere.
- Hello.

1488
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:41,712
(They go into the mart in a resigned manner.)

1489
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,741
I'm honored.

1490
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:44,652
- Gosh. There are so many cameras.
- Hello.

1491
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:45,781
There are so many.

1492
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:47,083
- Come on.
- Nice to meet you.

1493
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:49,051
(Suspicious)

1494
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:50,682
Did someone come before us?

1495
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:52,193
Yes, they did.

1496
00:55:52,222 --> 00:55:54,193
- What? Did they?
- They came.

1497
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:56,922
- Did someone come before us?
- Pardon?

1498
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:58,292
Honorable guests paid a visit,

1499
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:00,262
so we had an event here.

1500
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:01,502
- An event?
- Yes.

1501
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:03,161
- With who?
- It was a big event.

1502
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:05,732
We shot "Unexpected Business 2" here.

1503
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:08,601
- "Unexpected Business." - They shot it for ten days.

1504
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:09,773
- A while ago.
- Yes.

1505
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:12,712
(Actually, this place is...)

1506
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,182
They have a barcode reader and everything.

1507
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:17,781
(the place Tae Hyun worked as a boss for ten days...)

1508
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:18,812
(for "Unexpected Business.")

1509
00:56:18,813 --> 00:56:20,812
This is not a supermarket.

1510
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:21,952
Are we...

1511
00:56:22,322 --> 00:56:24,452
This is too much.

1512
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:26,351
We do everything ourselves like this.

1513
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:28,392
(So, Tae Hyun was here!)

1514
00:56:28,563 --> 00:56:30,162
- It's been three years.
- I see.

1515
00:56:30,322 --> 00:56:31,332
- What about today?
- What about today?

1516
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,562
No one came today.

1517
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:33,632
- No?
- You're the first to come.

1518
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:36,003
- Tae Hyun wasn't here yet?
- No.

1519
00:56:36,702 --> 00:56:37,801
Really?

1520
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:39,173
You came here first.

1521
00:56:39,403 --> 00:56:40,532
It's awesome.

1522
00:56:41,343 --> 00:56:43,241
- Hello.
- Hi.

1523
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:44,571
(Which traditional liquor will they experience here?)

1524
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:48,312
We've been brewing makgeolli in Noan, Naju for two generations.

1525
00:56:48,313 --> 00:56:49,542
I'm Jeong Nae Jin.

1526
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:50,942
I see. Nice to meet you.

1527
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,882
All of the owners...

1528
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:54,821
- say they "brew" it.
- Yes.

1529
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:56,422
They don't say that they make it.

1530
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:57,652
They say they brew makgeolli.

1531
00:56:57,653 --> 00:56:59,451
- Gosh. That's cool.
- So,

1532
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,161
you brew makgeolli...

1533
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:04,991
and supply the makgeolli you brewed to this mart?

1534
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:08,562
Yes. We brew it ourselves and supply it too.

1535
00:57:08,563 --> 00:57:10,523
(He supplies the liquor he made to local places.)

1536
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:15,601
(Handsome Heritage 8: Our liquor by our side)

1537
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:17,843
It'd be nice if you introduced the liquor to us.

1538
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:20,072
This product...

1539
00:57:20,343 --> 00:57:22,313
- is called dongdongju.
- Right.

1540
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:24,011
I assume...

1541
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:26,652
- you've had makgeolli many times.
- Yes.

1542
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:29,582
Dongdongju got its name...

1543
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,652
- because the rice grains...
- I see.

1544
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:32,852
Float on most of it.

1545
00:57:33,822 --> 00:57:35,693
When I pour it, you'll see...

1546
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:38,262
- They do have rice grains.
- Yes.

1547
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:41,133
- Gosh. Really?
- There are many rice like sikhye.

1548
00:57:43,162 --> 00:57:45,201
(The rice floats as soon as he pours it.)

1549
00:57:45,202 --> 00:57:47,472
I've never had makgeolli with rice grains in it.

1550
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,442
Let's try it.

1551
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:52,012
(It's a dongdongju-tasting time.)

1552
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:55,682
It smells like the ones sold in the markets.

1553
00:57:58,182 --> 00:57:59,452
It's good.

1554
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:04,022
The rice grains melt.

1555
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,391
I've never had makgeolli with rice in it.

1556
00:58:05,392 --> 00:58:06,652
It tastes so comfortable.

1557
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,121
- It's relaxing.
- It's so soft.

1558
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,293
The rice doesn't stick in your mouth.

1559
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:13,092
- The Japanese would like this.
- Really?

1560
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:15,232
- Are you going to sell it?
- Exactly.

1561
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:16,562
"Exactly."

1562
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:18,431
- We've learned a lot today.
- Yes.

1563
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:21,102
Of everything we had, this is really interesting.

1564
00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:23,342
Each liquor is different.

1565
00:58:23,343 --> 00:58:24,772
It's nicely carbonated too.

1566
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:26,343
- Slightly.
- It's good.

1567
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:28,542
- It's tasty.
- I'm curious about this one too.

1568
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:29,943
Will you introduce it to us?

1569
00:58:30,613 --> 00:58:35,181
It takes about 100 days to make this.

1570
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,582
What comes to your mind when you think of "Naju?"

1571
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,891
- Naju?
- Gomtang, the beef-bone soup.

1572
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:39,922
- Pears.
- Yes.

1573
00:58:39,923 --> 00:58:41,762
Right. We used pears from Naju.

1574
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:44,491
It amplifies the scent of pears.

1575
00:58:44,492 --> 00:58:47,293
- They have pears in it?
- They have pears in it?

1576
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:50,362
- Generally, - Thank you.

1577
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,172
- you can enjoy its scent better...
- We can enjoy its scent...

1578
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:54,672
when you chill it like white wine.

1579
00:58:54,673 --> 00:58:55,673
It looks like white wine.

1580
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:58,173
- Gosh. This is nice.
- It doesn't smell strong.

1581
00:58:58,543 --> 00:58:59,641
- It's not that strong.
- Is ABV 15 percent?

1582
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:01,043
- Yes.
- Is it 15 percent?

1583
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,883
- I can't tell by the smell.
- The smell... Right.

1584
00:59:04,952 --> 00:59:07,672
It's because your nose is broken after getting beaten up many times.

1585
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,983
(Here he goes again.)

1586
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:12,923
- I can't tell by the smell.
- The smell.. Right.

1587
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:15,622
- It tastes just like pears.
- Yes.

1588
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:17,762
Seriously.

1589
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:20,592
It's so good.

1590
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:23,801
It's as sweet as dessert wine.

1591
00:59:23,802 --> 00:59:24,833
Seriously.

1592
00:59:25,602 --> 00:59:27,633
- Sir.
- Yes.

1593
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,342
Do you sell these two products...

1594
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:32,772
- in your mart too?
- That's right.

1595
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:34,712
How do people like it?

1596
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:36,583
Do the locals here like it?

1597
00:59:37,613 --> 00:59:38,912
They love it.

1598
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:42,782
They buy several bottles, saying it tastes so good.

1599
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,821
They enjoy it a lot.

1600
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:45,822
- Really?
- Yes.

1601
00:59:47,122 --> 00:59:48,923
(Where is makgeolli?)

1602
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:53,932
(Our traditional liquor is beloved in our everyday life.)

1603
00:59:55,463 --> 00:59:59,333
(Thanks to many people's efforts, )

1604
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:06,212
(it's being protected and developed even today.)

1605
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:08,681
(Team Guys in the meantime)

1606
01:00:08,682 --> 01:00:11,242
Should we say it's for a computer? Do you think it's a computer?

1607
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:12,551
There's nothing else.

1608
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:13,911
(They're still discussing whether it's for a computer or not.)

1609
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:15,952
- It's for a car, right?
- Then...

1610
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:19,552
Listen. J, I, N, D, O.

1611
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:23,162
Why do I feel like I saw that somewhere?

1612
01:00:24,063 --> 01:00:25,692
J, I, N, D, O.

1613
01:00:25,693 --> 01:00:26,693
Jindo.

1614
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:28,532
You've seen Jindo before?

1615
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:32,402
Yes. Where and why did I see it?

1616
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,133
There wasn't a car model named Jindo.

1617
01:00:35,543 --> 01:00:37,872
It must be correct if you say so.

1618
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,912
- Let's do it.
- We have the answer.

1619
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:42,043
- Computer?
- Computer?

1620
01:00:42,383 --> 01:00:43,583
- Should we go for it?
- Okay.

1621
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:45,511
Seung Ho wants to go for it.

1622
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:47,152
- Let's follow him today.
- Yes. Seung Ho...

1623
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:49,622
- saw it somewhere.
- He's okay with it.

1624
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:51,792
- We got it.
- One, two, three.

1625
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:52,873
- A computer.
- A computer.

1626
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:55,261
You said a computer for the answer.

1627
01:00:55,262 --> 01:00:57,522
Let's check the answer through a video.

1628
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,792
(They check the answer in a desperate manner.)

1629
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:03,102
How touching is it to see...

1630
01:01:03,432 --> 01:01:05,673
how it serves only one person in its life?

1631
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:08,071
- Once an owner, - I think we were wrong.

1632
01:01:08,072 --> 01:01:09,472
You'll forever be the owner.

1633
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:11,972
- A lifetime warranty.
- There you go.

1634
01:01:12,613 --> 01:01:15,011
(A lifetime warranty)

1635
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:16,741
- Gosh. We're right.
- Sejin.

1636
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:17,782
There you go.

1637
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:21,451
- We're right.
- Sejin.

1638
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:23,082
- Sejin.
- That's right.

1639
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:25,452
Why? What does it have to do with the Jindo dog?

1640
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:27,428
What does a Jindo dog have to do with Sejin?

1641
01:01:27,452 --> 01:01:29,022
Sejin Computer Land...

1642
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:31,692
did have a computer named Jindo back then.

1643
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:32,833
(It does exist.)

1644
01:01:34,463 --> 01:01:36,733
You're amazing.

1645
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:39,272
How did you know about Jindo Computer?

1646
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:40,993
Look what I wrote. Do you want to see them?

1647
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:42,772
Is there such a thing as Jindo Computer?

1648
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:44,843
Jindo Dog Computer.

1649
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:47,443
Jindo. The year 1996. I kept writing it.

1650
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:49,511
Jindo dog!

1651
01:01:49,512 --> 01:01:52,382
(Jindo: Hongju, North Jeolla Province set menu)

1652
01:01:52,383 --> 01:01:53,912
Gosh. That was crazy.

1653
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,023
Now.

1654
01:01:56,682 --> 01:01:58,722
We'll give you the quiz.

1655
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,463
The last one will be easy.

1656
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:03,593
- Jindo!
- What?

1657
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:05,392
Jinho?

1658
01:02:05,693 --> 01:02:06,863
Jindo?

1659
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,602
- Jindo?
- Jindo?

1660
01:02:08,762 --> 01:02:11,201
(Current time: 8:15pm)

1661
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:12,442
Did they get it right in Jindo?

1662
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:15,673
So, they did go to Jindo. Gosh.

1663
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,871
- Why does the alarm go off so late?
- Why does it go off now?

1664
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:19,042
(That makes it 3 versus 4.)

1665
01:02:19,043 --> 01:02:21,411
- They just got it.
- Really?

1666
01:02:21,412 --> 01:02:22,442
Darn it.

1667
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:23,681
(The pressure builds up.)

1668
01:02:23,682 --> 01:02:24,911
We have to get it right, then.

1669
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,682
We have to occupy this site.

1670
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:29,052
We have to occupy it to...

1671
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:30,121
(If they get it wrong, they'll lose.)

1672
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:31,351
But we did a good job.

1673
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:32,851
- We made the best choices we could.
- Right.

1674
01:02:32,852 --> 01:02:33,891
You're right.

1675
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:35,023
- Okay.
- Please.

1676
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,391
Here's the last question of the day.

1677
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:38,192
- Please.
- I bet it'll be a hard one.

1678
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,492
(Time for Quiz)

1679
01:02:39,863 --> 01:02:42,702
This is an old name...

1680
01:02:42,932 --> 01:02:46,302
for dongdongju that you just had.

1681
01:02:47,673 --> 01:02:49,903
It used to be called buuiju.

1682
01:02:50,072 --> 01:02:51,572
- Buuiju?
- Buuiju?

1683
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:52,871
- Buuiju?
- Okay.

1684
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:53,911
(It sounds unfamiliar.)

1685
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:56,412
The fermented rice grains after the fermentation process...

1686
01:02:56,912 --> 01:02:58,212
are floating...

1687
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:02,051
like these fell into the water. That was where the name came from.

1688
01:03:02,052 --> 01:03:03,052
Okay.

1689
01:03:03,053 --> 01:03:04,652
(The old name for dongdongju is buuiju.)

1690
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,693
What are these...

1691
01:03:06,793 --> 01:03:08,023
that fall into the water?

1692
01:03:09,063 --> 01:03:10,391
- Buuiju...
- Yes.

1693
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:13,261
Means these floating on water?

1694
01:03:13,262 --> 01:03:14,833
- That's what "buui" means?
- Yes.

1695
01:03:15,032 --> 01:03:16,732
- I'll show you the Chinese letter.
- Okay.

1696
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:18,002
Buuiju is...

1697
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,683
Do we have to know the Chinese characters?

1698
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,933
The Chinese characters for buuiju are...

1699
01:03:22,072 --> 01:03:24,402
- Is that "ui?" - Is the first letter "bu?"

1700
01:03:24,403 --> 01:03:25,471
(They have no idea even if they see it.)

1701
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,272
This is "ui" of buuiju.

1702
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,612
It's such a difficult letter.

1703
01:03:28,613 --> 01:03:30,241
It's a difficult one, indeed.

1704
01:03:30,242 --> 01:03:31,511
But do you remember it?

1705
01:03:31,512 --> 01:03:33,011
(I might remember it while writing it.)

1706
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:37,182
First, it's something related to insects.

1707
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:39,321
There are different Chinese characters.

1708
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:41,693
I think that one is for ants.

1709
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:43,662
It's an ant.

1710
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:45,562
Ant?

1711
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:47,031
(Does he really know it?)

1712
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,601
That is a Chinese letter for an ant.

1713
01:03:48,602 --> 01:03:49,802
(He is certain.)

1714
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:52,871
Sung Hoon, if it's correct, that'll be crazy.

1715
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,202
(Desperate)

1716
01:03:54,432 --> 01:03:55,772
- What?
- Wait.

1717
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:57,542
Aren't they really the ants that fell into the water?

1718
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,442
Do the ants in water look like that? It's possible.

1719
01:03:59,443 --> 01:04:00,712
- That makes sense.
- Right.

1720
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,343
- Look.
- The color is different, but...

1721
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:04,312
when the ants fall into the water, they look like that.

1722
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:06,282
There are white ants too.

1723
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,281
- Yes.
- Guys. This...

1724
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:09,422
Maggots?

1725
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:10,522
(Or can they be maggots?)

1726
01:04:10,523 --> 01:04:12,951
- Aren't maggots bigger?
- They are ants.

1727
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:14,153
(I think the answer is ants.)

1728
01:04:15,293 --> 01:04:16,963
- It's the ants.
- The ants in the water.

1729
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,162
- Sung Hoon, you are correct.
- In the water...

1730
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:20,563
How is it correct?

1731
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:21,832
- It has to be the answer.
- Really?

1732
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,431
When you held it, I thought they were ants.

1733
01:04:23,432 --> 01:04:25,871
Really? They don't look like ants.

1734
01:04:25,872 --> 01:04:28,802
Sung Hoon, if we get this wrong, we have to work tomorrow.

1735
01:04:29,102 --> 01:04:30,871
They look forward to that.

1736
01:04:30,872 --> 01:04:31,872
- Right.
- Yes.

1737
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:34,672
Sung Hoon, our fate depends on you.

1738
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:36,411
Okay. I'm here as a guest.

1739
01:04:36,412 --> 01:04:39,482
So, I should get it right in the end.

1740
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:40,512
- Yes.
- That's right.

1741
01:04:41,282 --> 01:04:42,852
Gosh. Please.

1742
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,552
The answer is ants.

1743
01:04:44,852 --> 01:04:47,093
- Please.
- Ants.

1744
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:48,962
If it's correct, you're a legend.

1745
01:04:48,963 --> 01:04:50,323
- It'll be legendary.
- Seriously.

1746
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:52,761
- You did it all.
- If you get it right...

1747
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:54,662
If you are right... Please.

1748
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:57,063
Dongdongju is also called buuiju.

1749
01:04:58,503 --> 01:04:59,503
So...

1750
01:04:59,503 --> 01:05:00,503
(Will it be correct?)

1751
01:05:00,504 --> 01:05:02,543
They look like ants in the water.

1752
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:04,241
(Answer: Ants)

1753
01:05:04,242 --> 01:05:05,242
Correct.

1754
01:05:06,713 --> 01:05:10,343
(Cheering)

1755
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:12,411
(The game ends as a tie.)

1756
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,882
See? We did it!

1757
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:15,482
(This is the spirit of the athletes.)

1758
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:16,682
- Don't do it.
- Sung Hoon.

1759
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:18,623
- Sung Hoon.
- Sung Hoon. What?

1760
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:20,252
They were the ants.

1761
01:05:20,253 --> 01:05:21,551
(Brother Choo did it.)

1762
01:05:21,552 --> 01:05:23,423
Sung Hoon.

1763
01:05:23,822 --> 01:05:24,863
- Gosh.
- Bring it on.

1764
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:28,633
Of our six members, he'd be the only one who knows this.

1765
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:30,333
It's crazy that he got it.

1766
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,472
How can he think of the ants while looking at this?

1767
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,042
Does "ui" mean ants, then?

1768
01:05:36,043 --> 01:05:38,273
- Yes. Ui for the ants.
- There's no way.

1769
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:39,371
- Is that the Chinese character?
- Yes.

1770
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:40,641
It's ui for ants?

1771
01:05:40,642 --> 01:05:43,583
How did you know this letter?

1772
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:45,883
- Why do you know it?
- I don't know.

1773
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,452
I have no idea.

1774
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,922
- It's crazy.
- It was the last one.

1775
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:52,552
We got it right at 8:25pm.

1776
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,321
We made it. We're safe now.

1777
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:57,523
- It's our lucky day.
- Exactly.

1778
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,832
In that case, it's a tie now.

1779
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,562
- It's a tie.
- We occupied Naju.

1780
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:04,162
- Gosh. It's crazy.
- Gosh.

1781
01:06:04,532 --> 01:06:05,532
It's a tie.

1782
01:06:05,533 --> 01:06:07,201
- That makes it a tie.
- It's a tie.

1783
01:06:07,202 --> 01:06:08,403
What happens now?

1784
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:11,242
Is there a one last fight?

1785
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:12,842
You want to fight for it?

1786
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,342
He wants to fight. Let's win it by force.

1787
01:06:14,343 --> 01:06:16,042
- Yes.
- Let's fight for the win.

1788
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:18,551
- It'll be quick.
- Yes.

1789
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:20,713
- Yes. We'll only use one hand.
- Exactly.

1790
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,969
We won with Sung Hoon's energy.

1791
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,039
- That's right.
- Right.

1792
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,439
Getting the ants right was a big one.

1793
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,350
The other team would never guess it right.

1794
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:33,418
If they say the ants for the dongdongju question,

1795
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:34,619
do you want to say that we lost?

1796
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,489
- We can do that.
- I'm totally up for it.

1797
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,619
- They won't know it.
- We can show the Chinese letter.

1798
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,790
That is a hard letter.

1799
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:40,859
- That's a good idea.
- Right?

1800
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,389
- That's fun.
- They'd never guess it right.

1801
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:43,989
I like that idea.

1802
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:47,030
(Team Guys arrives in Naju.)

1803
01:06:49,629 --> 01:06:50,900
Hey. I love that we're here.

1804
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:54,868
Hey. This is the G Mart!

1805
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:56,038
(He's happy to see it!)

1806
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,578
(Tae Hyun recognizes the mart.)

1807
01:06:58,579 --> 01:06:59,610
My goodness.

1808
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:02,378
It's where "Unexpected Business" was shot.

1809
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,208
- Gosh.
- It's been a while.

1810
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:06,020
(He's happy to see him.)

1811
01:07:06,379 --> 01:07:08,548
- I can't believe it.
- It's been three years, I think.

1812
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:09,748
(Reuniting with the boss of the mart...)

1813
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,149
(after a long time of three years.)

1814
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:14,159
They shot "Unexpected Business" here.

1815
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:16,890
- I can't believe it.
- How have you been?

1816
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,530
Goodness.

1817
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,100
- Gosh. I'll be darned.
- I know. How long has it been?

1818
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,999
Everyone he met is here.

1819
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,169
The show aired three years ago.

1820
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:30,409
A lot has changed, though.

1821
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,510
- Did you eat a lot?
- I ate a lot.

1822
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,509
We really did eat a lot.

1823
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,350
- That's good.
- Well done.

1824
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,378
Why are you so good with the quiz?

1825
01:07:38,379 --> 01:07:40,019
You didn't have any hints.

1826
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,378
- In the end, - They are so hard.

1827
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:42,918
- Seung Ho nailed it.
- Did you really get them right?

1828
01:07:42,919 --> 01:07:44,189
Did you say Seung Ho nailed it?

1829
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,288
- Yes.
- I think he's drunk.

1830
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:46,759
- I...
- They're surprised to hear it.

1831
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,319
Since last December...

1832
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,989
Why didn't you play the bingo?

1833
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,699
- Today... You go on and tell them.
- Yes.

1834
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,400
We got the quiz wrong in Yeongam-gun, right?

1835
01:07:57,669 --> 01:08:00,838
When we lost Yeongam-gun, it became hard for us to win.

1836
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:01,909
Really?

1837
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:03,908
The 30-minute karaoke time card.

1838
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:06,810
That was the new card that came up today.

1839
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,350
The card looked like this,

1840
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,010
so I covered the top.

1841
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Like this.

1842
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,819
It said,

1843
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,219
"You must use it before completing the bingo."

1844
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,958
So we had no intention to complete the bingo.

1845
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:23,129
He said, "Let's not complete the bingo."

1846
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,029
They didn't go for the bingo.

1847
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,599
- They went for the number.
- We didn't go for the bingo.

1848
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,599
- Then they didn't have to use it.
- We went for the number.

1849
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,999
Despite everything,

1850
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,838
- we didn't want to lose.
- Weren't you flustered...

1851
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,198
- because we went someplace strange?
- Yes, we were.

1852
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,969
As for us, Sung Hoon made...

1853
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,139
most of the decisions today.

1854
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,368
I said this.

1855
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:38,939
- He kept going...
- "Let's eat something tasty."

1856
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,009
- Seriously.
- So you couldn't foresee our moves.

1857
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,878
- Sung Hoon.
- That wasn't a strategy.

1858
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,448
- We didn't have a strategy.
- Had we fallen...

1859
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:49,189
into Sung Hoon's trap belatedly,

1860
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,618
the tables would've been turned on us.

1861
01:08:50,619 --> 01:08:51,989
We didn't use our brains.

1862
01:08:52,659 --> 01:08:54,418
Do you know which question we got in Jindo?

1863
01:08:54,419 --> 01:08:56,859
- What?
- We had to identify a commercial...

1864
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,989
with a Jindo dog.

1865
01:08:58,089 --> 01:08:59,760
I think I know what it is.

1866
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:01,659
- What is it?
- Sejin Computer.

1867
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,299
How do you know that?

1868
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:05,999
- See?
- This is unbelievable.

1869
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:07,199
(It's a big twist.)

1870
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,009
People who used computers a lot definitely know the commercial.

1871
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:11,439
When I was young, Sejin Computer had a commercial with a Jindo dog.

1872
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,038
I must've watched it.

1873
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,439
- The Jindo dog commercial.
- I...

1874
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,180
Gosh, there was a question I could answer.

1875
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:18,980
That's right. There was.

1876
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,418
So here's the thing.

1877
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:23,488
- You know...
- The score is a tie.

1878
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:25,319
So... You can explain.

1879
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,088
As for the last question...

1880
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:30,588
- "Why don't we do this?" - We answered it by chance.

1881
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:31,788
- So...
- You answered it by chance.

1882
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:34,600
We asked the production how they'd choose the winner.

1883
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,199
They didn't have an idea. So we said,

1884
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:41,470
"We got the answer by chance. Will they be able to get it?"

1885
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,569
I jokingly said,

1886
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,879
"They won't be able to get the correct answer."

1887
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,849
"If they do get it, we'll say that we lost."

1888
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:51,078
- What are you talking about?
- Our quiz.

1889
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:52,748
- Our quiz.
- No one understood.

1890
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:54,248
Can't you explain it properly?

1891
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:56,088
- No one understood.
- By Dong Hyun's words...

1892
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:58,219
- No one understood.
- By Dong Hyun's words,

1893
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,389
we have a chance...

1894
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:00,659
I'll wrap it up.

1895
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,829
The makgeolli brewery you'll visit tomorrow to work is too cramped.

1896
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,328
Thus, only one person will go.

1897
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:08,328
(Only 1 person will receive the penalty.)

1898
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,769
- It's too cramped.
- So we had originally planned...

1899
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,869
to have an individual match.

1900
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,639
It was supposed to be Anyone But Me.

1901
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,339
- I like that idea.
- Seriously.

1902
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:17,009
Okay.

1903
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,209
Let's put our bags here.

1904
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,708
- That was the original plan.
- Listen.

1905
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,850
But Team Handsome has a suggestion.

1906
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,009
A team match?

1907
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,749
If the three members of Team Guys answer the question correctly,

1908
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:30,118
Team Handsome will lose.

1909
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:32,220
Then one of them will receive the penalty.

1910
01:10:32,589 --> 01:10:35,189
- Okay. If we fail...
- If you fail...

1911
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,389
- One of us will go.
- One of you guys will go.

1912
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:37,788
- One of you guys will go.
- Only one person will go.

1913
01:10:37,789 --> 01:10:39,529
Isn't an individual match better?

1914
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:43,328
Listen. You answered four questions correctly.

1915
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:45,469
So you have a big chance of getting this question right.

1916
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,538
It isn't too hard.

1917
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:48,379
- We got it right.
- The fact you said that...

1918
01:10:48,669 --> 01:10:50,238
We won't fall for that trap.

1919
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:53,010
It's a 50-50 chance.

1920
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,708
- That much is certain.
- Why would we take that risk?

1921
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,048
While we're curious,

1922
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,878
we won't fall for Dong Hyun's trap.

1923
01:10:59,879 --> 01:11:02,520
- We don't want to do that.
- Gosh, live a little.

1924
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:05,819
Seung Ho, didn't you do well today?

1925
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,020
I got it right.

1926
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:08,289
(Laughing)

1927
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,659
Are you running away?

1928
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:11,958
I got it right too.

1929
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:13,359
- Come on.
- His behavior makes me certain.

1930
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,600
Are you scared?

1931
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,498
- "Are you scared?" - We're scared.

1932
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:18,029
For goodness' sake.

1933
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,668
- We're scared.
- Really?

1934
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:22,309
Instead of making the offer in a polite way,

1935
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,939
he went, "Are you scared?"

1936
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,838
- Our day of effort was wasted.
- Excuse me.

1937
01:11:25,839 --> 01:11:27,309
Please accept the offer just once.

1938
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:29,048
(Gentle)

1939
01:11:29,049 --> 01:11:31,109
I think it'll be a funny situation.

1940
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,349
- No.
- Please accept it just once.

1941
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,248
You need to think about the viewers.

1942
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,249
(A piece of advice)

1943
01:11:38,049 --> 01:11:39,418
Don't think only about yourself.

1944
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:41,319
- Let it be an individual match.
- An individual match.

1945
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,529
- All right.
- An individual match.

1946
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,158
If it's an individual match,

1947
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,298
- I can't write well.
- Sung Hoon has a disadvantage.

1948
01:11:46,299 --> 01:11:49,769
- That's right. Sung Hoon is...
- That's a bit of a problem.

1949
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,498
Will it make the individual match funny?

1950
01:11:51,499 --> 01:11:52,838
- An individual match.
- It can't be helped.

1951
01:11:52,839 --> 01:11:53,998
- Okay.
- All right.

1952
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:55,599
- Okay.
- Let's go. An individual match.

1953
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:56,769
An individual match. Okay.

1954
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,780
Only one person will remain.

1955
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,139
Here's the first question. Today,

1956
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,548
you guys visited eight places.

1957
01:12:03,549 --> 01:12:06,618
- You only missed a place in Yeosu.
- It's the Yeosu question.

1958
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:08,948
- The Yeosu question.
- I'll give the Yeosu question.

1959
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:10,589
I knew that we'd have that question.

1960
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:14,760
(At a beautiful island in Yeosu, Nangdo, )

1961
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:18,359
(there's a brewery that has been in operation for 4 generations...)

1962
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,430
(for 114 years.)

1963
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,059
(Nangdo, an island where water is scarce, has seven springs.)

1964
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,469
(One of them is called Milk Spring.)

1965
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,198
(It got its name from making the mothers get more breastmilk.)

1966
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:26,569
(Makgeolli that's made with this spring water...)

1967
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,210
(has been passed down for 4 generations.)

1968
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:37,709
(It's a great liquor that's made in a strictly traditional way!)

1969
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,088
When you go to Yeosu,

1970
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:44,389
there is a small island that's beautiful in a picturesque way...

1971
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,119
and its famous makgeolli.

1972
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,859
The name of this island is Nangdo.

1973
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,088
- Nangdo?
- Nangdo.

1974
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:52,400
Nangdo.

1975
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,999
The island got its name, Nangdo,

1976
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:59,570
because the shape resembled a certain animal.

1977
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:02,668
What's this animal?

1978
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:04,739
- "Nang" refers to this animal.
- Yes.

1979
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,680
Does it come from a Chinese character?

1980
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,700
- "Nang" is the matter.
- I don't know that one.

1981
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:11,708
(He figures it out in 1 second.)

1982
01:13:11,709 --> 01:13:13,279
He got it from the Chinese character.

1983
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,918
He shouldn't have gotten the Chinese character.

1984
01:13:14,919 --> 01:13:16,019
(A big twist)

1985
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,618
- I told you so.
- The Chinese character...

1986
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:18,859
It's game over.

1987
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,488
- I told you so.
- This is... Hold on.

1988
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:22,020
This is meaningless.

1989
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:23,589
This isn't right.

1990
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:24,750
Thank you for your hard work.

1991
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,359
That was why I wanted to take up on the offer.

1992
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,069
Do you want to answer last?

1993
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,169
- But...
- Let us each take a turn.

1994
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:33,539
(It's fun to watch.)

1995
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,868
What do you want to do?

1996
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,168
Instead of answering this question,

1997
01:13:36,169 --> 01:13:38,609
- do you want to accept our offer?
- Let us each take a turn.

1998
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:40,179
No. Listen.

1999
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,479
- I can answer this question.
- That's right.

2000
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,878
But instead of answering this question...

2001
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,118
- There was a question we answered.
- Yes.

2002
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:49,689
If the three of you answer it correctly,

2003
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,619
we'll stay here.

2004
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:52,958
How about that?

2005
01:13:52,959 --> 01:13:54,059
He's looking after the two juniors.

2006
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,658
- I'm looking after them.
- That's right.

2007
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:56,659
Sung Hoon.

2008
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,859
- How about that?
- Even if Sung Hoon gets it right...

2009
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,059
- and leaves, - Okay.

2010
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,298
- five members remain.
- Yes.

2011
01:14:01,299 --> 01:14:02,599
Still, the probability is 1-5th.

2012
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,299
- That's right.
- You think you can beat Dong Hyun.

2013
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,570
- You're certain.
- You put him...

2014
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:07,769
- below you.
- Make a choice.

2015
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:10,838
- Is that it?
- Let me put it precisely. Hold on.

2016
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,709
I can beat those two.

2017
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,809
Listen.

2018
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,179
- All right.
- Listen.

2019
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,118
I have knowledge too.

2020
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,680
- I know that.
- I got Sejin Computer right.

2021
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:24,488
Just you watch.

2022
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:26,219
- Now...
- Today, Seung Ho will remain.

2023
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,118
- Be careful.
- Okay. We got it.

2024
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:29,159
So what will it be?

2025
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,828
- We won't accept the offer.
- No?

2026
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:33,128
- Let's have an individual match.
- An individual match.

2027
01:14:33,129 --> 01:14:34,435
You can answer correctly and go home.

2028
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:36,168
Sung Hoon, you got it right.

2029
01:14:36,169 --> 01:14:37,498
That's good. I'm glad.

2030
01:14:37,499 --> 01:14:38,499
Sung Hoon, go.

2031
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,899
- I...
- You need to get it right.

2032
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,538
He hasn't turned in his answer.

2033
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:43,609
I haven't turned in my answer.

2034
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:46,279
- What?
- I need to look it up in Korean.

2035
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,280
You can't do that!

2036
01:14:48,379 --> 01:14:50,748
(Stop right there.)

2037
01:14:50,749 --> 01:14:51,749
You can't do that!

2038
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,378
That was what I wanted to say.

2039
01:14:54,379 --> 01:14:56,289
If Sung Hoon doesn't know...

2040
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,319
- He doesn't know Korean.
- He doesn't know.

2041
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,366
If he doesn't know it in Korean, he can't get the answer right.

2042
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,229
Come here.

2043
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,828
Hold on. Time out.

2044
01:15:03,829 --> 01:15:05,336
I can look up what it is in Korean! Why?

2045
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,699
- Time out.
- I can look it up!

2046
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,599
Then I should be able to look up the Chinese character.

2047
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,128
I should be able to do that. That's nonsense.

2048
01:15:11,129 --> 01:15:12,569
He just knows the Chinese character.

2049
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,769
- How is this possible?
- It's...

2050
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,739
It's such a big twist.

2051
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:18,980
Sung Hoon is so funny.

2052
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,279
Time out.

2053
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,979
(I know the animal!)

2054
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,878
Did you try to make them accept the offer...

2055
01:15:23,879 --> 01:15:25,849
- without knowing the answer?
- No, I know the answer.

2056
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,679
- Okay. It's game over.
- Sung Hoon.

2057
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,889
Sung Hoon, hurry up and answer. Say it in Korean.

2058
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,949
- Sung Hoon...
- Wolf.

2059
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:33,319
- Wolf.
- Wolf?

2060
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,419
Wolf? Say it in Korean.

2061
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:36,989
Say it in Korean.

2062
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,488
Say it in Korean?

2063
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:41,399
This is sudden. I made an offer in order to look after you.

2064
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,599
- This is sudden.
- Sung Hoon,

2065
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,198
you'd know the answer in Korean.

2066
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:46,070
They say that all men are this animal.

2067
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:50,109
- So parents with daughters say, - That's right.

2068
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,509
- "All men are 'Blank.'" - Jindo dog.

2069
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,810
Jindo dog, my foot.

2070
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,749
He is scary.

2071
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,208
Hey.

2072
01:15:57,209 --> 01:15:59,019
(Defending himself)

2073
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,578
You're the worst.

2074
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:02,748
- Wolf.
- Wolf.

2075
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:04,289
- Wolf.
- Yes.

2076
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,389
- Correct.
- That's right.

2077
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,918
It was very easy.

2078
01:16:07,919 --> 01:16:09,328
- The Chinese character...
- It was given to us.

2079
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:11,429
Would you have known after a round?

2080
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,729
- No.
- I wouldn't have known.

2081
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,498
Sung Hoon, you can't go home yet.

2082
01:16:14,499 --> 01:16:16,769
- Why are you sitting there?
- I want to sit here.

2083
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:17,998
(I won't sit with them.)

2084
01:16:17,999 --> 01:16:19,399
This is a good seat.

2085
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,999
Their offer must've come with a catch.

2086
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:23,109
- Now, five people remain.
- Okay.

2087
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,430
- Here comes the second question.
- Four questions remain.

2088
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,779
When you have a get-together, people raise their glasses...

2089
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,009
and give a toast before drinking.

2090
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,079
- Okay.
- You know many such toasts, right?

2091
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,779
- D.D.S.
- D.D.S.?

2092
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:37,248
This question is totally unrelated.

2093
01:16:37,249 --> 01:16:38,418
Where did D.D.S. come from?

2094
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:40,220
"Don't be disheartened,"

2095
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,189
- "don't complain," - This is insane.

2096
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,689
"and spread your chest." D.D.S. is the short form.

2097
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:44,890
This is insane.

2098
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,600
In that case,

2099
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,399
- what does a toast, "119" mean?
- Did you say "119?"

2100
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,769
- One, one...
- One, one, nine?

2101
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:53,368
One, one, nine.

2102
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:54,769
(A toast, "119")

2103
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:57,310
(Dazed)

2104
01:16:57,539 --> 01:16:59,009
I'll give it a go.

2105
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,170
(He decides to give it a go.)

2106
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:01,979
One bottle per day until 9pm.

2107
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,109
(One bottle per day until 9pm)

2108
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,979
"One bottle per day until 9pm?" Hold on.

2109
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,520
We could steal the answer.

2110
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,448
- We could steal the answer.
- Incorrect.

2111
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:11,720
- That's right.
- It's something along the line.

2112
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,519
- Did I get one component right?
- Yes.

2113
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,958
That's right. The three of us have a chance.

2114
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:16,159
Let me answer.

2115
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,230
A Gen Zer will get it right.

2116
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,599
One cart per day until 9pm.

2117
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,699
One cart?

2118
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:23,599
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

2119
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,600
(This Gen Zer's standards are something else.)

2120
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,270
I think I've given away too much.

2121
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,899
- Let me answer.
- "Let's go home before 9pm."

2122
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,708
- It's "Before 9pm." - Let me answer.

2123
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:31,868
Let me answer.

2124
01:17:31,869 --> 01:17:34,069
- So that part was correct.
- Seung Ho was the fastest.

2125
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,979
One bottle per person...

2126
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,379
before 9pm.

2127
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
- Incorrect.
- Didn't he say that?

2128
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,119
No, it's my turn. Let me answer.

2129
01:17:42,249 --> 01:17:44,088
One bottle in the 1st round until 9pm.

2130
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:45,820
(The 2nd try)

2131
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,360
You got another component right.

2132
01:17:47,589 --> 01:17:49,089
Come on!

2133
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:53,459
- I keep getting a component right.
- Seriously.

2134
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,569
It's a toast about changing the drinking culture...

2135
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:58,100
in a healthy way.

2136
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,199
- Dong Hyun.
- Dong Hyun.

2137
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:05,310
Let's drink 1 type of liquor in the 1st round and go home at 9pm.

2138
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:06,579
Correct.

2139
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,078
Correct.

2140
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:10,879
(Dong Hyun succeeded in stealing the answer.)

2141
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:17,449
(I practically spoonfed the answer.)

2142
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:21,088
(Making a big fuss)

2143
01:18:21,089 --> 01:18:22,828
One type of liquor.

2144
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,729
This is driving me crazy. I'm so upset.

2145
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,600
(I can't believe I lost to him!)

2146
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:28,400
Sung Hoon, I did it.

2147
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,470
We were certain that he wouldn't be able to answer.

2148
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,838
Seung Ho, what did you say earlier?

2149
01:18:32,839 --> 01:18:34,069
(Seung Ho, what did you say earlier?)

2150
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,338
You have my approval.

2151
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:36,470
(You have my approval.)

2152
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:39,208
Dong Hyun is the best when it comes to stealing answers.

2153
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:41,209
- Seriously.
- Sung Hoon, we're set.

2154
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,510
We won.

2155
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,149
- It's nice, right?
- I'm jealous.

2156
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,350
Give us the next question. Four members remain.

2157
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,850
- I'm jealous.
- How is it so hard?

2158
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,248
In our daily lives,

2159
01:18:51,249 --> 01:18:53,769
many four-character idioms that are related to liquor are used.

2160
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:56,958
What's the four-character idiom that's used...

2161
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:59,629
for someone who comes to a drinking party belatedly?

2162
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:02,730
Isn't it something like "Hurae three shots?"

2163
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,198
Is there a four-character idiom for someone who came late?

2164
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,399
- Yes.
- It's so hard.

2165
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,539
This four-character idiom actually exists.

2166
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:11,669
I think I know the 1st 3 syllables.

2167
01:19:11,839 --> 01:19:13,609
- Really?
- Can't you tell the rest...

2168
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,779
- if you know the 1st 3 syllables?
- Don't you know it?

2169
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,780
It's confusing.

2170
01:19:16,781 --> 01:19:18,685
It's my 1st time seeing someone who only knows 3...

2171
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:19,919
out of the four syllables.

2172
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:21,748
He doesn't know.

2173
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:22,989
(Teasing)

2174
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:25,288
- I'll try it.
- Please go ahead.

2175
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:26,690
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2176
01:19:26,919 --> 01:19:28,059
Hu...

2177
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,029
(Hu)

2178
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,390
- rae...
- Rae.

2179
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,958
No way.

2180
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:34,519
- Are you going to say that?
- Hurae...

2181
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,030
- Are you going to say that?
- Is that it?

2182
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:38,900
I thought of the same thing.

2183
01:19:39,299 --> 01:19:41,140
Is that really right?

2184
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,869
- Maybe not.
- Is that it?

2185
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,539
Huraejasik.

2186
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,839
- Let me answer.
- Incorrect.

2187
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,180
Let me answer.

2188
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,709
Hurae three shots.

2189
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,409
Incorrect.

2190
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:54,179
Hurae...

2191
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,289
- Is it really "Hurae?" - Is it really "Hurae?"

2192
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,589
Sambae.

2193
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,659
- It's right.
- Seriously.

2194
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:00,958
Sang Uk is correct.

2195
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:02,060
(Huraesambae is correct.)

2196
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,259
(Guys, I got it right!)

2197
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,299
What was it?

2198
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,560
(Confused)

2199
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:09,929
- What was it?
- What did he say?

2200
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,569
- What did he say?
- See? This was why I wanted it...

2201
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:13,168
- to be a team competition.
- It was right.

2202
01:20:13,169 --> 01:20:14,238
What did he say?

2203
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,298
What did he say?

2204
01:20:15,299 --> 01:20:16,838
(All the athletes escaped!)

2205
01:20:16,839 --> 01:20:17,868
What did he say?

2206
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:20,979
- Are you serious?
- What did you say?

2207
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,038
Huraesambae.

2208
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:23,379
- What?
- Huraesambae.

2209
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:25,548
- It was the one I knew.
- Huraesambae.

2210
01:20:25,549 --> 01:20:26,680
Yes.

2211
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,948
- Huraesambae.
- Is it huraesambae?

2212
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,189
It's in the dictionary.

2213
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,418
- Is it in the dictionary?
- Yes.

2214
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:35,319
(The idiom does exist in Korean dictionary.)

2215
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,959
I can't believe that this happened.

2216
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,529
- My brain froze.
- I know. My head went blank.

2217
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,969
It's shocking that three of us remain.

2218
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:44,799
You should've accepted it.

2219
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:48,338
You should've accepted our offer.

2220
01:20:48,339 --> 01:20:49,538
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2221
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:50,810
It can't be helped.

2222
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:53,009
Since things have come to this, give us that question.

2223
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,039
Things have come to this.

2224
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:56,408
- Give them that question.
- Things have come to this.

2225
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:58,379
- That's a good idea.
- All right.

2226
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:00,649
- Do you want the question?
- Yes.

2227
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,749
You're looking at dongdongju.

2228
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,959
Another name for dongdongju is buuiju.

2229
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,730
It's already complicated.

2230
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,059
(This is fun.)

2231
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,060
The three of us would've remained anyway.

2232
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:16,969
It's because rice grains float like "Blank" that fell into the water.

2233
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,270
What's "Blank?"

2234
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,440
What do they look like?

2235
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,139
What are you?

2236
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,500
- What do they look like?
- Nails?

2237
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:27,515
- Check out the Chinese character.
- Is there a Chinese character?

2238
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:30,139
- Check out the Chinese character.
- There's a Chinese character.

2239
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,810
What? Why is it so hard?

2240
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,810
- Is there such a Chinese character?
- Who knows?

2241
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:36,190
(What?)

2242
01:21:37,249 --> 01:21:38,349
I don't know it.

2243
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,319
(Tae Hyun is unfamiliar with the Chinese character.)

2244
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,159
Is that...

2245
01:21:42,829 --> 01:21:44,060
My goodness.

2246
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,559
It's an insect.

2247
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,998
(A hint)

2248
01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:49,230
- At this point...
- Should we be able to answer?

2249
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,868
Let me answer. Caterpillar.

2250
01:21:51,869 --> 01:21:53,070
Caterpillar is incorrect.

2251
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,798
Let me answer. Larva.

2252
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:56,039
Larva is incorrect.

2253
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:57,539
Let me answer. Silkworm.

2254
01:21:57,909 --> 01:21:59,039
Incorrect.

2255
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:00,538
Let me answer. Grasshopper.

2256
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:01,609
Incorrect.

2257
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:03,048
- Let me answer. Bush cricket.
- Bush cricket.

2258
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:04,109
Incorrect.

2259
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,830
- They'll get it now.
- They'll get it now.

2260
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:08,020
- I guess it's something like that.
- Mantis?

2261
01:22:08,879 --> 01:22:10,488
Let me answer. Longheaded grasshopper.

2262
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:12,390
- Incorrect.
- I won't answer anymore.

2263
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:14,559
(I won't be Fabre.)

2264
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,919
He tried so hard.

2265
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:17,890
Cricket.

2266
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,600
- Someone said it earlier.
- You guys are so close.

2267
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:23,299
Say what comes to your mind. Not many options remain.

2268
01:22:23,799 --> 01:22:24,900
Fly.

2269
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:26,699
Let me answer. Mosquito.

2270
01:22:27,999 --> 01:22:29,100
Let me answer.

2271
01:22:30,339 --> 01:22:31,838
- Ant.
- Correct.

2272
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:32,839
(Ant is correct.)

2273
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,209
(I did it.)

2274
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,609
(Insect Boy burned his passion.)

2275
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:38,850
I see.

2276
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:40,779
He got ant.

2277
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,579
Didn't I say "Ant" before?

2278
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:44,049
- Congratulations.
- Come here.

2279
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,988
See? Seung Ho did all the work.

2280
01:22:45,989 --> 01:22:48,389
- I couldn't think of it at first.
- You did well.

2281
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:50,089
- I'm sorry.
- It's like that.

2282
01:22:50,459 --> 01:22:54,158
This is the last question. One of you will get the penalty.

2283
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,959
- Okay.
- The brainy ones remain.

2284
01:22:56,829 --> 01:22:58,998
Chong In Ji is the man who wrote "Yongbieocheonga,"

2285
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:02,239
the first Hangul poem in the history of Korean literature.

2286
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:04,369
Okay.

2287
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:07,140
- He was known to enjoy drinking.
- I see. He enjoyed it.

2288
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:10,109
But every time he drank, he caused trouble...

2289
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,548
- because he had drunken habits.
- Gosh.

2290
01:23:11,549 --> 01:23:13,680
Is it about the trouble he caused?

2291
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:17,548
When King Sejo threw a banquet...

2292
01:23:17,549 --> 01:23:21,319
for the subjects who were over 60, he did something to the king.

2293
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,418
What did he do?

2294
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,059
What did he do?

2295
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,189
This is driving me crazy.

2296
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,959
- To the king? A casual tone.
- Yes.

2297
01:23:27,699 --> 01:23:28,798
He used a casual tone with the king.

2298
01:23:28,799 --> 01:23:29,900
Correct.

2299
01:23:31,369 --> 01:23:32,498
(Yes!)

2300
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:33,569
Are you serious?

2301
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:35,169
(Yes!)

2302
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:37,368
(Is it over?)

2303
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:38,538
Are you serious?

2304
01:23:38,539 --> 01:23:40,010
(Is it over?)

2305
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:41,879
- That was...
- That was...

2306
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,878
- That was unbelievable.
- That was...

2307
01:23:43,879 --> 01:23:45,779
Wasn't that a conversation?

2308
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,649
Tae Hyun.

2309
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,490
You answered correctly because you were drunk.

2310
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:51,949
- Being drunk helped.
- That's right.

2311
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,190
Since they were conversing, I wondered when I'd answer.

2312
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:57,828
They went back and forth.

2313
01:23:57,829 --> 01:23:59,189
(I don't know about that.)

2314
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:00,198
A casual tone.

2315
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:01,260
Let's go.

2316
01:24:01,999 --> 01:24:04,198
Do you use a casual tone when you're drunk?

2317
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:05,368
I use it often.

2318
01:24:05,369 --> 01:24:06,439
(Yi Kyung will get the penalty.)

2319
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,498
That's incredible.

2320
01:24:07,499 --> 01:24:08,499
- Dong Hyun.
- What?

2321
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,440
I feel so victimized to carry out the penalty.

2322
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:15,038
- Dong Hyun.
- What?

2323
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:16,349
Thank you for working hard until the late hour.

2324
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,610
Thank you.

2325
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,619
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

2326
01:24:20,379 --> 01:24:21,919
Go to Seoul.

2327
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:24,820
(What will he do the next day as the penalty?)

2328
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:28,619
(Early morning next day, Brewery)

2329
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,788
(People are working diligently...)

2330
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:35,400
(to make dongdongju.)

2331
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:38,999
In the heat of 40°C,

2332
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:44,239
they turn over the grains continuously.

2333
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:47,578
There are many steps that must be done manually.

2334
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:49,408
(It's the hardcore brewery that was on "Extreme Job.")

2335
01:24:49,409 --> 01:24:53,179
The process is as physically demanding...

2336
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,548
as that of a construction site.

2337
01:24:54,549 --> 01:24:56,549
Sometimes, I tell it that I love it...

2338
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,049
like a madman.

2339
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,129
(Who will make the beloved dongdongju with him?)

2340
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:06,829
(At 8am, Yi Kyung arrives at work to carry out the penalty.)

2341
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,329
My goodness.

2342
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

2343
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:14,299
- You'll need to work hard today.
- Okay.

2344
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,739
I'm here to do that.

2345
01:25:16,169 --> 01:25:17,909
Shall we get started?

2346
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:20,509
(Kneading and Steaming Station)

2347
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,990
(The first step of dongdongju-making)

2348
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:24,449
As if we were making baekseolgi,

2349
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:26,979
we're steaming rice for makgeolli.

2350
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,380
You're steaming rice for makgeolli.

2351
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:30,089
This is rice.

2352
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,150
- This is regular rice.
- Yes.

2353
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,220
- We soak it in water.
- It's soaked in water.

2354
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:37,890
We turn the soaked rice...

2355
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,798
- into powder.
- You ground it.

2356
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:41,298
- Yes.
- I see.

2357
01:25:41,299 --> 01:25:43,128
- Do you mix the two?
- Yes.

2358
01:25:43,129 --> 01:25:44,828
Today, you'll mix the two as they get steamed.

2359
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:46,539
The steaming process.

2360
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:52,439
(Rice, moisture, )

2361
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,909
(and rice powder)

2362
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,948
(When the rice is processed like baekseolgi, )

2363
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:01,519
(the liquor becomes full-bodied and gets the sweetness of rice.)

2364
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,919
(It becomes the buuiju they tasted yesterday.)

2365
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:09,158
Turn it over and break it like this.

2366
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:10,530
I'll shovel it toward you.

2367
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,760
- Like this?
- Yes.

2368
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:18,929
(There's so much steam that they can't see ahead.)

2369
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,699
(Yi Kyung)

2370
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:23,769
Scrape the bottom.

2371
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,470
- Okay. The bottom.
- Yes.

2372
01:26:26,169 --> 01:26:31,579
(It requires a lot of strength since the mixture is sticky.)

2373
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,248
(That way, )

2374
01:26:35,249 --> 01:26:38,619
(the three of them turn it over for a while.)

2375
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:40,760
(My goodness)

2376
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:44,989
(The hard turning process comes to an end.)

2377
01:26:45,989 --> 01:26:48,299
Now, it's over.

2378
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:49,669
Let's add more.

2379
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,798
You pour it again.

2380
01:26:52,799 --> 01:26:54,140
We need to steam all of this.

2381
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:56,169
- All of that?
- Yes.

2382
01:26:56,339 --> 01:26:58,070
- It'll fill up the container.
- Yes.

2383
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,079
How many kilograms of rice is this?

2384
01:27:03,249 --> 01:27:05,610
- We're steaming 320kg of rice.
- Did you say 320kg?

2385
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,879
(What he did so far was nothing.)

2386
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,118
(He can only exclaim.)

2387
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:13,959
You might not be able to film me due to steam.

2388
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,260
(My heart is cloudy like this steam.)

2389
01:27:24,799 --> 01:27:27,238
("Fog" by Jung Hoon Hee, labor by Lee Yi Kyung)

2390
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:28,400
Shall we get started?

2391
01:27:28,669 --> 01:27:30,339
It comes up like this.

2392
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:37,180
There's so much heat.

2393
01:27:42,749 --> 01:27:44,088
Go to Seoul.

2394
01:27:44,089 --> 01:27:49,389
(All alone)

2395
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:55,099
(I walk)

2396
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:59,899
(On this foggy street)

2397
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,668
You do this every day.

2398
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:03,270
Yes, we do this every day.

2399
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,339
Congratulations.

2400
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:06,609
(In the past, you showed me kindness)

2401
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:07,639
I'll work hard tomorrow.

2402
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:12,009
(In the past, you showed me kindness)

2403
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:15,149
(In the past, you showed me kindness)

2404
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:16,150
We did it!

2405
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:18,049
I can't go because I feel so upset.

2406
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:19,989
Dong Hyun!

2407
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:21,519
I got it right too!

2408
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:27,399
(Your shadow)

2409
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:32,529
(Thinking about them is meaningless)

2410
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:35,439
I think it will be so upsetting to let that team win.

2411
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,238
(The past memories)

2412
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:46,208
(But my heart)

2413
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:48,579
(Still longs for you)

2414
01:28:48,749 --> 01:28:49,820
Thank you.

2415
01:28:51,449 --> 01:28:53,159
- You will do it again.
- Okay.

2416
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:10,868
(Where has that person gone?)

2417
01:29:10,869 --> 01:29:13,409
Should I do it? Just this part.

2418
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:20,448
(He is back!)

2419
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:23,748
(The incarnation of revenge has returned with spite.)

2420
01:29:24,189 --> 01:29:26,917
(I will make all of you get punished.)

2421
01:29:26,918 --> 01:29:28,587
(Where will they go...)

2422
01:29:28,588 --> 01:29:30,788
(for the return match?)

2423

(Island of fantasies, Jeju)

2424
01:29:35,528 --> 01:29:39,098
(Looking for Jeju's special structures)

2425
01:29:39,099 --> 01:29:40,697
(Revenge is left behind.)

2426
01:29:40,698 --> 01:29:43,469
(Sightseeing mode is on.)

2427
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:45,108
(A race where anything can be done)

2428
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:46,438
(Do what you want to do.)

2429
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:48,809
(What do you want me to do?)

2430
01:29:49,278 --> 01:29:51,008
(We have no time to waste!)

2431
01:29:51,009 --> 01:29:54,479
(Team Guys is focused on the race.)

(Things are working for us today.)

2435

(We won.)
