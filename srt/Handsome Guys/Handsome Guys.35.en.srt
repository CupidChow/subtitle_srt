1
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,265
(Is it udon...)

2
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,735
(or soba?)

3
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:35,775
(Chicken skewers...)

4
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:38,135
(or lamb skewers?)

5
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:40,305
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,145
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,146
(and regret)

8
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:46,586
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:49,116
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,385
(For modern people
who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:56,355
(The menu conflict agents,
Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,126
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,726
(Seocho-gu)

14
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:06,336
(Montmartre Park)

15
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:11,935
(Handsome Guys are excited
from the start.)

16
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,976
What's this?

17
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,145
- Wait a minute.
- What's that?

18
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:16,346
- Isn't this a trampoline?
- Try it.

19
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,376
- It's what I think it is.
- Yes.

20
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,415
- Isn't this it?
- You can jump on it.

21
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,336
(Briefly returning to
the innocence of childhood)

22
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:28,226
(A place where artists
of the century watch you)

23
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,955
(Soon, a work of art
will be revealed.)

24
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,065
Last week,

25
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,195
Dong Hyun got the penalty.

26
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:35,225
That's correct.

27
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,095
Dong Hyun, hurry over here.
Now is a good time.

28
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,135
- Oh, my.
- Right now...

29
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,136
(All eyes are on him.)

30
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:40,365
He's also good at acting.

31
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,535
- He looks like a local here.
- Hello.

32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,476
- You look like a local here.
- Hello.

33
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,546
(A penalty makeup that looks
surprisingly natural)

34
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:48,946
You're someone famous.

35
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:50,615
- Hello.
- Hello.

36
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:51,816
What's on the back?

37
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,715
Someone wrote something on the back.

38
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:54,845
Isn't this funny?

39
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:57,116
It's like a serial number
on a robot.

40
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:58,826
Right.

41
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,386
Look at this. I have this too.

42
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:03,395
Dong Hyun colored his tooth himself.

43
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,596
He did it himself.

44
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:06,926
- Isn't there a remover for this?
- What?

45
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,695
It's impossible to remove it
without special chemicals.

46
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,235
Then you should go
and see a dentist.

47
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:11,335
- See a dentist?
- Get your tooth scaled.

48
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,405
Go to a car repair shop...

49
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:14,035
and rub a compound on it.

50
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,306
At a car repair shop.

51
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:16,676
- A compound?
- Yes.

52
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,605
I need a special remover for this.

53
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,076
We'll scrap it off for you
if you can't do it.

54
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:23,616
- Didn't you get back from the US?
- I got back at dawn today.

55
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:26,586
We're making videos
of the off-season training.

56
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:28,985
When things aren't going well
for my junior fighters,

57
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:30,715
I step up as their boss.

58
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:31,716
You step up as their boss?

59
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,125
It's funny to imagine you
as the boss...

60
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:34,155
with that makeup on you.

61
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,955
Can you show us the pose?

62
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,026
Like what?

63
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:38,395
Seriously?

64
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:39,396
(His serious mode is on.)

65
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,496
It looks good on him.

66
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:42,166
He keeps...

67
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,035
- He keeps...
- Dong Hyun forgot...

68
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:46,506
how to be serious.

69
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,405
He's good enough to go back
to being a mixed martial artist.

70
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,436
It's because...

71
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,775
Which one of you invited
today's guest?

72
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:55,815
I saw him a moment ago.

73
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,346
- Is it someone you know?
- Yes.

74
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:58,985
- I know him well.
- Really?

75
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,185
I saw him briefly a moment ago,

76
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:03,485
and he's gotten younger.
Suddenly, he...

77
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:04,515
There he is.

78
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,725
(Today's guest who's gotten younger)

79
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,785
It's Byung Eun.

80
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,856
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,255
I haven't seen you in a while.

82
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,596
Have you been well?

83
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,996
He rarely appears on variety shows.

84
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:19,306
(The man all the fish
in the world fear the most)

85
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,906
(In charge of the cutting board
on "Unexpected Business")

86
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:28,046
(Showcased Park Byung Eun's
subtle sense of humor)

87
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,275
(The talk hyena captured
the heart of all customers...)

88
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,316
(including the foreign ones.)

89
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:33,785
(When it comes to acting)

90
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:39,156
(From zombie movies
to historical dramas)

91
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,126
(Versatile in both
comedy and romance, )

92
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:45,996
(he portrays
a wide range of characters.)

93
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,295
(An actor we can trust)

94
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,165
(Park Byung Eun is
on Handsome Guys.)

95
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,566
Hello, I'm Actor Park Byung Eun.

96
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,235
Despite the damp weather,

97
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,235
I'm happy to meet you.

98
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,445
I hope that it will get better
at the end of our meeting.

99
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:01,605
Nice to meet you.

100
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,615
All right.

101
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,616
(Welcome)

102
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,127
He sounds like someone from
"Huh Young Man's Food Travel."

103
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,286
You sound like a professor.

104
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,855
(Please show a lot of interest
in Actor Park Byung Eun's...)

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,285
("Food Travel" that will start now.)

106
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,966
Whom did you meet
for the first time today?

107
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,125
Isn't it everyone except me?

108
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,825
- I met everyone for the first time.
- Same here.

109
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:18,096
- Nice to meet you too.
- You'll see Seung Ho often.

110
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,466
- He's very young.
- I see.

111
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,566
How old do you think he is?

112
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,666
Based on his hairstyle,
he seems quite old.

113
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,305
However, his face looks young.

114
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,175
- Byung Eun, I'm 38 years old.
- You're 38?

115
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,076
Then is he 35?

116
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,575
- I'm a little younger.
- What?

117
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,015
(Surprised)

118
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,946
- I'm a little younger than that.
- Are you 32?

119
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,546
A little younger.

120
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:41,316
(Intrigued)

121
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,655
- Please.
- Something seems wrong.

122
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:44,886
(Something seems wrong.)

123
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:47,255
- Are you teasing me?
- He's being serious.

124
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,296
I was born in 1995. I'm 30.

125
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,355
Congratulations.

126
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:52,525
"Congratulations?"

127
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,465
What about Sang Uk?

128
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,296
- He's the youngest.
- What?

129
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:58,935
(Who's the youngest?)

130
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,482
- What's the matter?
- He's the youngest.

131
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,305
They're on both sides.

132
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,405
Gosh. They're so tall.

133
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:05,675
(Byung Eun got surprised
several times from the start.)

134
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:07,605
- By the way...
- If you appear...

135
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:08,675
on a historical drama
like "Kingdom,"

136
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:09,816
you'd look amazing.

137
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,916
"Kingdom?" That's a huge compliment.

138
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,985
- Among historical drama actors,
- Right.

139
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,815
Someone who's tall like him is rare.

140
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,515
- He's good with swords.
- Exactly.

141
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:19,625
- He's an expert.
- He'd be amazing.

142
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,586
If we get to shoot
Season Three of "Kingdom,"

143
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,225
please consider him, director.

144
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:24,426
He's trying to cast him.

145
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,665
(Will Byung Eun's message
get delivered?)

146
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,135
We're in Bangbae-dong.

147
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:32,605
Since we're in Bangbae-dong today,

148
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:33,835
are we also visiting Seorae Village?

149
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,075
That's also in Bangbae-dong.

150
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,405
Didn't you live in Seorae Village?

151
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,876
I didn't live in Seorae Village.

152
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,775
I went to Seocho High School.

153
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:41,846
It's nearby.

154
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:43,515
He's a native of this place.

155
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,115
I used to live in Bangbae-dong.

156
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,185
You lived here too?

157
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,615
I lived in Seorae Village
for two years.

158
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:48,885
- You've lived everywhere.
- You lived in Seorae Village?

159
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,562
- In front of Seocho High School.
- That's amazing.

160
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:53,285
I lived in front
of Seocho High School.

161
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,762
(Where Yi Kyung, the wanderer
in Seoul, will guide them today)

162
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:58,525
Back in the day, "Bangbae" meant...

163
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,025
(Bangbae-dong,
the old town in Gangnam)

164
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,825
It's located at the edge of Seoul,

165
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,065
facing away from the Han River.

166
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,535
- Does "bang" mean the edge?
- That's right.

167
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,656
"Bae" must mean facing away.

168
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,366
It's known
for good school districts,

169
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,176
and it's a hub for education.

170
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:12,205
It's a residential area...

171
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,305
with more houses
than commercial buildings.

172
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:16,722
(A traditional high-class area
with fancy villas and houses)

173
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:20,085
When I was a child,
it was known for its cafe street.

174
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,086
That's right.

175
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,216
- The Bodyguard?
- The Oranges.

176
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:24,985
- Is this where that is?
- Isn't it Apgujeong?

177
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,325
- No.
- This was the starting point.

178
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:28,385
Really?

179
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:30,426
Is that so? Was it
when you were young?

180
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,125
(Including the famous cafe
that Byung Eun remembers)

181
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,426
(The Bodyguard)

182
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:35,165
(The original popular place...)

183
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,735
(where trendy hipsters gathered
in the 90s)

184
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,166
(Bangbae-dong Cafe Street)

185
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:46,176
(Now, it looks more modern
than before.)

186
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,705
(You can find...)

187
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:52,216
(various fusion restaurants
and tasty places in Bangbae-dong.)

188
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,516
Here's today's menu.

189
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:55,316
The first one is...

190
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,755
a dish from Gangwon Province.

191
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,585
- Gosh, that sounds good. Potatoes?
- From Gangwon Province?

192
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,855
- There are braised dishes.
- I love those.

193
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,695
- Braised assorted fish?
- That's delicious.

194
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:03,755
There's also meat.

195
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,025
- That's great.
- There's also meat.

196
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,666
It's a type of braised dish
from Gangwon Province.

197
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,366
The other dish is udon.

198
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,265
What?

199
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,505
- Udon?
- Is this your reaction?

200
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,835
- But the weather is hot.
- Udon, all of a sudden?

201
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,796
- At that restaurant...
- Will there be cold udon?

202
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,205
I think it's called bukkake.

203
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,375
- Right.
- Bukkake?

204
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:20,245
Bukkake udon is served
with pork cutlet.

205
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:21,375
You dip the noodles in the sauce.

206
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,592
(The second dish, bukkake udon)

207
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,775
Here are the choices.

208
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,445
Do we fight heat with heat...

209
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,785
and restore our energy...

210
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,245
- with braised dishes and meat?
- Right.

211
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,685
Or do we go for a light...

212
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:31,785
and refreshing bowl of udon?

213
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,056
Udon sounds good.

214
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,585
(Food from Gangwon Province
versus udon)

215
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,825
(The ultimate food battle
of hot and cold)

216
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:38,955
I made my choice right away.

217
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:39,965
- Which one?
- Yes?

218
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:40,966
What did you pick?

219
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,495
- I'll go for udon.
- Why?

220
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,935
But you like meat.

221
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,195
I like meat,

222
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:46,805
but I overdrank last night.

223
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:47,836
Then udon is perfect.

224
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:50,387
- As soon as you said that...
- You must crave some broth.

225
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:52,706
I like food from Gangwon Province.

226
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:53,845
I'll go for food from Gangwon.

227
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,275
Since he just came back from the US,

228
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,622
he's probably craving Korean food.

229
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:57,675
I'm craving it so much.

230
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,775
In that case,

231
00:07:58,776 --> 00:07:59,815
I pick udon.

232
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,245
We have two people for udon.

233
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,615
Byung Eun, go ahead and choose.

234
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,115
I pick food from Gangwon Province.

235
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,155
Is there a reason?

236
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,655
I'm a huge fan of food...

237
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,325
- from Gangwon Province.
- Me too.

238
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:10,155
You mentioned braised dishes.

239
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,995
- It could be braised assorted fish.
- Right.

240
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:13,395
Or a dish with roe.

241
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,795
- It sounds like such braised food.
- That sounds good.

242
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,465
When you eat some rice
mixed with the sauce,

243
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,206
the pleasure is immense.

244
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:22,806
He's eloquent with words.

245
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,175
"The pleasure is immense."

246
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,045
He sounds like a professor.

247
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,726
- He's eloquent with words.
- He's amazing.

248
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,975
- I prefer udon.
- Really?

249
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,145
Do you want to play
rock-paper-scissors?

250
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,485
- Is your choice udon too?
- It is.

251
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:33,545
You should play rock-paper-scissors.

252
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,715
I'm craving cold udon.

253
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,115
- Look how sweaty I am.
- Goodness.

254
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,416
I need some cold udon.

255
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,155
- Goodness.
- I need some cold udon.

256
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,525
Byung Eun said, "Goodness."

257
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,396
- His armpits look very sad.
- By the way...

258
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,365
Then you should get cold udon.

259
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:47,395
You shouldn't suffer like this.

260
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,865
What else can he do
when he's craving it?

261
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,372
Getting food from Gangwon Province
could be horrible for you.

262
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,596
Gosh, it's so hot.

263
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,965
It happened naturally.

264
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,606
The older members are
grouped together.

265
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,975
We're Old Boys.

266
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:58,175
- Old and young.
- OB?

267
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,305
- Naturally, our choices are...
- OB and YB.

268
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,575
The older members picked
the braised dish.

269
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,976
The younger members picked udon.

270
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,385
Which restaurant
are we going to first?

271
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,986
- Please.
- What's next on the itinerary?

272
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,556
The first restaurant will be...

273
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,315
food from Gangwon Province.

274
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,355
(The first LMR,
Gangwon Province cuisine)

275
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:14,056
Please. This is amazing.

276
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,255
I've been picking
the second restaurant...

277
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,695
for weeks now.

278
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:18,855
Let's cool down and take a break.

279
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:19,865
Okay.

280
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,526
I'm very excited.

281
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,635
Since it's very hot,

282
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,965
let's go inside
the air-conditioned restaurant.

283
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:24,995
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

284
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,105
Let's get going.

285
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,305
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

286
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,306
Let's go.

287
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,036
Let's go.

288
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,206
Goodness.

289
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:33,975
- Be careful, Dong Hyun.
- Gosh.

290
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,106
You could get hurt.

291
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,916
(LMR Number 1)

292
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,585
- The weather is...
- Right?

293
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:43,855
It's extremely hot.

294
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:46,725
I have to carry around
a parasol with me from now on.

295
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:47,786

296

(Exclaiming)

297
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,395
Sang Uk, is it your first time
wearing shorts on the show?

298
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,526
It's my first time.

299
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,196
Your calves look amazing.

300
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,495
Your calves...

301
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,136
They deserve a gold medal.

302
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:58,866
Look at his calves.

303
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,205
Dong Hyun, please come to the shoot
wearing only your fighting shorts.

304
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,265
He's right.

305
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:03,976
How could I do that?

306
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,205
That's the restaurant.

307
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,645
- Do you see this place?
- Gosh.

308
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,246
- Is this where we're going?
- Yes.

309
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:09,715
It looks delicious.

310
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:10,945
Isn't it called Gangwon something?

311
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,616
What is this place?

312
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,245
Sokcho half-dried pollack.

313
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,686
(Gangwon Province inside your mouth)

314
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,325
(With a wide range of dishes
from Gangwon Province)

315
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,295
(During lunchtime,
the restaurant is packed every day.)

316
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,255
I like braised half-dried pollack.

317
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,225
I also like braised ray.

318
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,965
It's very tender,
and the portions are generous.

319
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,965
The food is deliciously spicy,

320
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,936
so I come here frequently.

321
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:37,705
When I tried the food,
it was so delicious.

322
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,646
This is my 3rd time here in 2 weeks.

323
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,045
Even those who don't like seafood...

324
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,476
would like it here.

325
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,115
I live near Konkuk University.

326
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,062
I heard this place was good,
so I came to check it out.

327
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:49,885
The food is worth the trip,

328
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,556
so please come and check it out.

329
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,526
(LMR 1, dishes
from Gangwon Province)

330

(as soon as they sit, )

332

(Byung Eun observes something
carefully.)

333
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:05,495
Is this the vibe
of an old restaurant?

334
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,935
Since it's food
from Gangwon Province,

335
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:09,406
I was expecting a traditional vibe.

336
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:10,976
It looks like it opened yesterday.

337
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,806
The place looks new.

338
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,105
The restaurant is clean, isn't it?

339
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,345
Since the restaurant is clean...

340
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,645
It feels like...

341
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:18,252
- I'll start the inspection.
- We should try it first.

342
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,316
What about it?

343
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,616
The spoons and chopsticks are
still clean.

344
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:24,855
- If they're clean...
- They don't have bite marks.

345
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,402
Shouldn't the spoons and chopsticks
be clean?

346
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,685
You're quite picky.

347
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,255
Don't you know?

348
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,256
He's a gourmet.

349
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,856
That's true.

That's amazing.

351
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,625
Then what should we get?

352
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:36,235
- What would you like?
- Shall I call the restaurant owner?

353
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:37,866
- Pick what you want.
- Sir?

354
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,865
- He can pick for us.
- Hello.

00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,606
- Hello.
- The owner is very young.

356
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,505
- Are you the restaurant owner?
- Yes.

357
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:45,735
Have you taken over your family
business as the second generation?

358
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,476
I'm the third generation.

359
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,516
Don't you trust him much more now?

360
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:52,645
You're the third generation?

361
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,715
How shall I put this?

362
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,185
Usually,
a tasty restaurant looks old,

363
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:58,385
and it has a traditional vibe.

364
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,455
However,
your restaurant is so clean...

365
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,585
that we were slightly worried.

366
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,885
Did it open recently?

367
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,055
I can explain.

368
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,455
My grandmother ran...

369
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,296
a Gangwon Province cuisine
restaurant for a long time.

370
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,936
(The Gangwon Province restaurant
was started by his grandmother.)

371
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,135
My mother ran it for a long time...

372
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:15,766
in Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province.

373
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,835
Naturally, I learned how to cook...

374
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,406
- from my mother.
- You learned.

375
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,145
I opened a restaurant of my own.

376
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:23,115
Are the menus similar?

377
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,115
Or did you keep the same menu
for three generations?

378
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:26,315
As for the ray,

379
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:28,415
I incorporated it into the menu.

380
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,255
I specialize in ray dishes.

381
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,285
Since it's his signature dish,

382
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,325
- we should try it.
- We should try the ray.

383
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,656
What dishes have been passed down
for three generations?

384
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:36,855
Half-dried pollack.

385
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,995
- Half-dried pollack?
- We must try half-dried pollack.

386
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,065
We have to try it.

387
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,225
- I'm so hungry.
- We must try half-dried pollack.

388
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,465
Doesn't the half-dried
pollack dish...

389
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,165
include dried radish greens?

390
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,735
At this restaurant, you can order...

391
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,706
dried radish greens
as an extra topping.

392
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,635
We can order dried radish greens
as an extra topping.

393
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,435
- It's on the menu. I'm hungry.
- Yes.

394
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,575
We should add it
to half-dried pollack.

395
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:54,816
Please add dried radish greens
to the half-dried pollack.

396
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,816
Are we getting both braised dishes?

397
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:57,976
Shouldn't we?

398
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,516
We have to try the ray too.

399
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,946
Is it made with spicy seasoning?

400
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,855
Yes, we make it
with spicy seasoning.

401
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:05,455
Then we'd also like
to order fish roe.

402
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:08,155
There are fish roe
in spicy fish roe soup.

403
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,396
- Can you order this too?
- Squid sundae.

404
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:11,555
(Squid sundae)

405
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,065
- Squid sundae?
- You must order a squid sundae.

406
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,125
- We need squid sundae...
- You're at a Gangwon restaurant.

407
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,235
To give them a bite.

408
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,196
I don't need it,
but it's for the younger members.

409
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,365
We'll order those
and one squid sundae.

410
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,465
- Yes.
- That's perfect.

411
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,835
- This is good.
- It will be delicious.

412
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,375
Byung Eun knows a lot about fish.

413
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:26,775
What’s the longest time...

414
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,345
you’ve spent on fishing?

415
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,615
There's a place called Anjwa Island.

416
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:31,915
You can get there
on a boat from Mokpo.

417
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,046
I brought my car with me,
and I spent one month there.

418
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,845
All you did was fish for one month?

419
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,485
It was freshwater fishing.

420
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,425
(Fisherman Park
who went to the island)

421
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,225
When I was fishing,

422
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:42,525
the local elders came by.

423
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,525
They took the carp I caught.

424
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,396
They brought me apples
that they grew.

425
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,166
It's bartering.

426
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,365
While I was there,

427
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,695
I became close to one of the elders.

428
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,635
He said to me, "What are you doing?"

429
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,475
"You're a young man."

430
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,305
He suggested we eat
something delicious together.

431
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,046
We went to a nice
small octopus restaurant.

432
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:02,945
It was in the afternoon,
and he ordered a lot of food.

433
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,176
We had a small octopus and soup.

434
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,885
I felt so grateful to him,

435
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,286
so I went out secretly
to pay for the food.

436
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,755
He suddenly grabbed me and said,

437
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:13,126
"Hey, Byung Eun."

438
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,556
"If you do this,
you won't see me again."

439
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,996
I'm serious. It really happened.

440
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:20,186
- "Let me pay."
- It feels like he's here with us.

441
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,725
- Right.
- "Byung Eun,"

442
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,536
"you shouldn't do that."

443
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,336
I said okay.

444
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,535
I still didn't feel comfortable.

445
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:29,475
He was wearing rain boots.

446
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,276
He looked like a farmer.

447
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,305
I felt bad and promised myself
to pay next time.

448
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,576
I said to him, "Thank you
for the food. Get home safely."

449
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:38,876
In a brand-new Mercedes,

450
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,786
he left.

451
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,215
I was quite shocked.

452
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,456
He must be a rich farmer.

453
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:48,486
I found out that
he runs a huge fish farm.

454
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,396
He manages it.

455
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,966
I would've resented it
if I had paid at the restaurant.

456
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:54,465
"You won't see me."

457
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,926
(You won't see me.)

458
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,505
Food is here.
Squid sundae is served first.

459
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:00,605
Gosh, I'm hungry.

460
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,106
The squid sundae is big.

461
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:07,706
(Plump squid is generously stuffed
with chopped filling.)

462
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:11,145
(Once it's coated
with moist egg mixture, )

463
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:13,716
(it's grilled in the frying pan.)

464
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,585
(This is...)

465
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:18,855
(the pride of Gangwon Province,
squid sundae)

466
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,286
The squid sundae is big.

467
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,355
It has to be delicious.

468
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,656
Which sauce do we dip it in?

469
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,525
First, I'll try it without anything.

470
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,526
Me too.

471
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:27,865
I'll try it without anything.

472
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,225
(Tasting without any sauce)

473
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,296
The squid smell...

474
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,606
(Lost for words)

475
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,435
It's delicious.

476
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,206
The squid sundae looks tasty.

477
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,146
The meat is still juicy.

478
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,176
(Dong Hyun tries it
without any sauce.)

479
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:44,046
(All in one bite)

480
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,116
- Is it good?
- Gosh.

481
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,745
I'll dip it in the sauce.

482
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,456
(I'll dip it in the sauce.)

483
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,185
(Humming)

484
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:57,056
The squid sundae is huge
because of the rice.

485
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:58,895
What's in the filling?

486
00:15:58,896 --> 00:15:59,965
It's rice.

487
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,026
I don't think it's rice.

488
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,935
There are big pieces inside.

489
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:05,536
There's a lot in it
including vegetables.

490
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:08,406
I think there's more squid
in the filling.

491
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,905
It must be the squid legs.

492
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,235
- There are no legs.
- You're right.

493
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:14,775
What gives the texture isn't
the rice.

494
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:15,905
This is amazing.

495
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:16,946
The sauce is amazing.

496
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,445
(Humming)

497
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,745
Watching them eat is...

498
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,316
- very difficult.
- I know.

499
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,516
I skipped dinner last night.

500
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,486
I think the dried laver is...

501
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:27,786
to make a wrap with it.

502
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,655
Look at the squid sundae.

503
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,696
(Scowling)

504
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,666
The dried laver piece is also huge.

505
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:36,696
My goodness.

506
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,096
- That's cheating.
- Seriously.

507
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,836
- Byung Eun eats so deliciously.
- Right.

508
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,935
When Byung Eun eats,

509
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:46,216
his dimples stand out even more.

510
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,306
- His dimple right here?
- Yes.

511
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,566
When the food is delicious,
my dimples get bigger.

512
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,946
- Isn't it delicious?
- Isn't it amazing?

513
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,416
That looks incredible.

514
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,042
(An incredible dish is arriving.)

515
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,545
- Gosh, fish roe.
- Here you go.

516
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,945
(Today's amazing dish)

517
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,116
It's served generously.

518
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,246
(This restaurant's signature dish)

519
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:07,886
(Spicy and flavorful
Gangwon-style braised ray)

520
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:13,896
(The pride of the third-generation
restaurant owner)

521
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:20,766
(Braised ray)

522
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,766
What do I start with?

523
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,536
I'll definitely try the ray
with the bones.

524
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,006
These are the bones.

525
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,075
- How do we eat the ray?
- The entire piece with the bones.

526
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:32,756
- What?
- It's always eaten with the bones.

527
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:33,846
That's how you eat rays.

528
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,475
- Can I eat the bones?
- It's really delicious.

529
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:36,636
You've never had rays before?

530
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,185
Do I also eat the bones
in the middle?

531
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,655
Only the bones on top are hard.

532
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,415
- Leave those out.
- Except these?

533
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,385
You can eat the bones in the middle.

534
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:45,586
(He understood.)

535
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:52,566
(How does the braised ray taste?)

536
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:58,566
It's delicious.

537
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,952
Byung Eun, is it different
from other restaurants?

538
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:03,975
Some restaurants ferment it longer,

539
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,205
which is their method of cooking.

540
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,446
This one tastes fresh.
The flavor fits the current trend.

541
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:11,386
Also, it has
the right amount of spice.

542
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,355
You can feel the cartilage
when you chew,

543
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,385
but it's not unpleasant.
It tastes good.

544
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,086
Then we'd also like
to order fish roe.

545
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:21,855
Look at that red seasoning.

546
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,065
I'd eat three bowls of rice
with that sauce.

547
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,195
It smells amazing.

548
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:27,265
Just the smell makes
my mouth water so much.

549
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,795
(Creamy fish roe and spicy sauce
placed on rice)

550
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,935
- With some fish roe...
- This looks excellent.

551
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,835
- That's the real deal.
- That's it.

552
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,175
(The group is having
a mental breakdown.)

553
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,635
It's perfect with rice.

554
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,676
How is it so delicious?

555
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,806
(Darn it.)

556
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,915
What's wrong? Why are you angry?

557
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,916
No, I'm not.

558
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,086
It was an interjection.

559
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:48,555
(All in one bite)

560
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,185
I can't bear to watch this.

561
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,385
This scent...

562
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,425
(Fish roe? It was the best choice
I ever made.)

563
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:54,256
It tastes really good.

564
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,025
I'm glad that you ordered fish roe.

565
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:58,506
- The fish roe is good.
- It's a must.

566
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,066
Can I wet this lightly
with the sauce?

567
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,876
(After a delicate touch)

568
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,876
(A clean finish)

569
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,445
This doesn't look ordinary either.

570
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,416
(What will stand
against the braised ray)

571
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:22,986
(A long-standing, strong player
of tradition)

572
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:27,626
(Made with a secret recipe
of three generations)

573
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:31,895
(Braised half-dried pollack)

574
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:36,866
(Braised half-dried pollack)

575
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:39,465
What's the dried laver for?

576
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:43,446
Usually, you enjoy it by wrapping
the half-dried pollack with it.

577
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,076
Is it okay even if it gets stuck
in your teeth?

578
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,945
(Bursting out laughing)

579
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,516
The restaurant owner
burst out laughing.

580
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,486
- That must be your sense of humor.
- I'm sorry.

581
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,886
I'm sorry for surprising you.

582
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,096
I love half-dried pollack.

583
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:01,925
- Half-dried pollack?
- When was the last time you ate it?

584
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,796
Half-dried pollack.

585
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,066
(Humming)

586
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:11,166
- This tastes different.
- It's spicy.

587
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:14,735
Usually, I like half-dried pollack
with sweet seasoning.

588
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,676
Even though it's spicy...

589
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,175
It's different.

590
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,416
(Spicy braised half-dried pollack
with a different charm)

591
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:26,415
(Chewy)

592
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,156
(Meaty)

593
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:35,096
(Byung Eun tastes the braised
half-dried pollack with composure.)

594
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:37,066
(Thinking)

595
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,725
(Nodding)

596
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:41,526
- We have to try this too.
- It just got here.

597
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,206
How is it?

598
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,706
You know what?

599
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,776
At some restaurants,
the seasoning is too strong.

600
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:51,075
It overpowers the flavor
of the dried radish greens...

601
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:52,246
- Trash?
- Or the fish.

602
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:54,416
Dried radish greens.

603
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:56,216
Please continue.

604
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,146
- I apologize.
- Nice to meet you.

605
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:01,685
In this dish, you can taste
the dried radish greens...

606
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:02,686
and the fish.

607
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,485
It was a good idea to order
extra dried radish greens.

608
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:05,655
I agree.

609
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,995
It really brings out the flavor
that you get...

610
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:10,926
when the greens are dried properly.

611
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,265
Byung Eun, you thought...

612
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,095
that the restaurant was too clean
to be running for three generations.

613
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,712
What do you think
of the half-dried pollack?

614
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:18,206
The way he cooks is...

615
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,806
very mature.

616
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:24,946
- With a strong foundation?
- The taste is very mature.

617
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:28,146
It's grounded and mature.

618
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:31,015
- Without excess sugar or additives,
- Right.

619
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,045
The ingredients give
their natural flavor.

620
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:35,186
He used fresh ingredients instead.

621
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:37,685
It really feels like
listening to a professor talk.

622
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:39,556
- I agree.
- He sounds like Huh Young Man.

623
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,556
His way of talking is captivating.

624
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:43,625
I like braised half-dried pollack.

625
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,095
(The most mature bullying
in the world)

626
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,935
The half-dried pollack
seasoning is to die for.

627
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,866
(The most mature bullying
in the world)

628
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:53,806
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean this to happen.

629
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,336
- I'm enjoying it very much.
- It's okay.

630
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:59,005
- Doesn't it look delicious?
- We should share this.

631
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,016
What about letting us play a game?

632
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,846
They're losing their minds
as the dish is disappearing.

633
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,346
- Especially those two rascals.
- It's delicious.

634
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,915
Can you give us some fish
on a spoonful of rice?

635
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,155
- We can leave it up to them.
- This is the best.

636
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:12,325
It's perfect with rice.

637
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:14,496
(A game for the freeloaders,
Call My Name)

638
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,665
Each of us won't know...

639
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,366
what's written above our heads.

640
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:20,935
We have to guess
what's written over our heads.

641
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:21,965
We have to guess?

642
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:22,966
(They have to guess the name
over their heads.)

643
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,966
Put it on.

644
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,526
Let's take it off for each other.

645
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:27,376
(Who is written
over Seung Ho's head?)

646
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,105
Who is this?

647
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,846
(Kung Ye)

648
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,476
We can pull it off.

649
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:36,516
(Donald Trump)

650
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:39,086
My goodness.

(Lee Hyo Ri)

652
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,126
- You go first, Yi Kyung.
- Let's see.

653
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:46,696
Have you met him?

654
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,496
(Donald Trump)

655
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,665
I've never met him while working.

656
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,166
I've never met him either.

657
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,236
What's your next question?

658
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,366
Is this how we play? Okay.

659
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:57,435
Is he an athlete?

660
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,465
(Kung Ye)

661
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,935
I bet he's athletic.

662
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:01,936
- I think so.
- Right?

663
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:04,445
He always dressed like an athlete.

664
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:05,476
No, wait.

665
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:09,646
(A natural at recreational sports)

666
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,085
(Calm down,
that's too much information.)

667
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:12,315
- What's wrong?
- Be careful.

668
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:13,485
You're giving too many hints.

669
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:15,846
He always dressed like an athlete.
Seung Ho will never know.

670
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,286
Is this person...

671
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:19,756
still living?

672
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:21,956
- Yes.
- Yes.

673
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,796
Do you have to think about it?

674
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,266
Does this person appear on TV?

675
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:29,166
- Yes.
- Yes, quite often.

676
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,466
Often?

677
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:32,565
- He's on TV way too often.
- He's on TV often,

678
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,005
especially these days.

679
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,136
He also has many followers.

680
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,666
- Many followers?
- Of course.

681
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,206
Is this person Korean?

682
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,446
Yes.

683
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,076
- A Korean person?
- Right.

684
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,176
- Okay.
- That's right.

685
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,445
Is he Korean?

686
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:44,546
Of course he is.

687
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,916
Really?

688
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,456
Have you seen this person?

689
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,186
I've never met her in person.

690
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:53,756
I've met her before.

691
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,025
You have?

692
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:56,966

693

(Donald Trump)

695
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,466
a man?

696
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,195
- Yes.
- Yes.

697
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:03,336
He's a tough man.

698
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,066
Is it someone that I would know?

699
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:07,505
You might know someone...

700
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:08,535
- who knows him.
- No.

701
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:11,045
He's about 20 social connections
away from you or fewer.

702
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:12,046
That's not true.

703
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:13,245
(He's never seen him,
followers, often on TV, )

704

(20 social connections, a tough man)

705
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,245
Can I say the answer?

706
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,085
- Of course.
- I got it. Donald Trump.

708
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,125
- How did you know?
- Am I right? I'll take it off.

709
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:26,025
- That's unbelievable.
- How did you know?

710
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:28,355
- How did you find out?
- How did you know?

711
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:30,565
Sang Uk said that
he was a tough man.

712
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,765
(1. A tough man)

713
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,665
- On top of that,
- From a tough man...

714
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,265
Dong Hyun said that
he's 20 social connections away,

715
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,266
so I thought that
he was a foreigner.

716
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,136
The toughest man in the world.

717
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:41,236
Among Handsome Guys,
Yi Kyung paid the least so far.

718
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:43,136
- Thank you.
- It's difficult.

719
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:45,445
- Is there any meat?
- What?

720
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:46,876
- Is there any meat?
- Meat?

721
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:49,445
Byung Eun gave me vegetables only.

722
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,785
(Full of vegetables only)

723
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:51,945
I thought that it was a penalty.

724
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:54,516
A penalty? No way.

725
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:56,356
It's really delicious.

726
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:58,156
Thank you, Byung Eun.

727
00:24:58,426 --> 00:24:59,832
- This looks proper.
- He gave you a lot.

728
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:01,996
- Be careful of the bones.
- That looks amazing.

729
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,055
It'll be to die for.

730
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,666
Look how meaty that is.

731
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,766
My mouth is watering.

732
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:10,666
- The red sauce must taste good.
- It's really good.

733
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:16,306
- Let's continue.
- Ask me a question.

734
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:17,875
What is the person's occupation?

735
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,046
(Kung Ye)

736
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,816
- What is his occupation?
- A government employee.

737
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,416
He's a politician.

738
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,315
Can I ask his political orientation?

739
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,986
(Political orientation)

740
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:33,026
We hesitate to answer that...

741
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,126
because we've never seen him.

742
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:36,826
That's a huge hint.

743
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:38,596
He's a figure in history.

744
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,666
Yours is a female celebrity.

745
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,606
He should've gone to see
an ophthalmologist.

746
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,336
- Who?
- An ophthalmologist.

747
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:48,176
I got it.

748
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,635
- It's over.
- I got it.

749
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:50,806
It's already over.

750
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,245
Taejo of Goryeo?

751
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:56,675
(Answer: Taejo of Goryeo)

752
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:57,846
- Taejo of Goryeo.
- No.

753
00:25:57,986 --> 00:26:00,715
- Hey, you should go with it.
- This is really...

754
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:02,485
- I have no idea.
- It's someone very famous.

755
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,586
The front and the back are the same.

756
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:06,625
I got it. Lee Hyo Ri?

757
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,626
(Answer: Lee Hyo Ri)

758
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,626
Am I right?

759
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:09,696
That's cute.

760
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:13,666
He eats so deliciously.

761
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:17,936
It's so good.

762
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:20,905
(In awe)

763
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:22,135
It's unbelievable.

764
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:23,875
Right? The seasoning is...

765
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,376
It's more addictive
than soy sauce marinated crab.

766
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,686
Our rascal is about to lose it.

767
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:35,585
Calm down.

768
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:36,755
(If you lose it,
you have to see the doctor.)

769
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:37,756
Here is...

770
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:38,955
- Let's pay separately.
- The bill.

771
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:39,956
- The bill?
- Yes.

772
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,325
It's 132 dollars.

773
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:42,395
(Total: 132 dollars)

774
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:43,425
But we ordered a lot.

775
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:45,165
I can't wait. They'll probably solve
the quiz with composure.

776
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,695
I hope we'll get it.
Byung Eun, let's solve the quiz.

777
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,635
- With composure.
- They'll do it with composure.

778
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,366
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

779
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:52,405
The following are pairs
of dialect words from Gangneung...

780
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,635
in Gangwon Province and
their standard Korean equivalents.

781
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:57,945
Choose the one
that's incorrectly matched.

782
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:00,846
One, "boksang" and peach.

783
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:04,316
"Dalgaengyi" and candy.

784
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,816
"Kkaebosaengyi" and ground sesame.

785
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:10,056
"Yokshigi" and corn.

786
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:11,656
They sound so similar.

787
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,825
- When you say "peach" fast,
- Peach.

788
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:16,596
It turns into boksang.

789
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,025
- You're right.
- That's right.

790
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,565
It probably happened over 100 years.

791
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,335
Yes, the original word was "peach."

792
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:22,795
- Peach,
- Peach.

793
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:24,465
Peach turned into...

794
00:27:24,466 --> 00:27:25,565
- "boksang."
- "Boksang."

795
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,406
(It sounds reasonable
when you say it quickly.)

796
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:29,105
As I fish often,

797
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,405
- I use corn as bait.
- Yes?

798
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:33,846
Many elders call it "yokshigi."

799
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,815
I've heard them say that a lot.

800
00:27:36,816 --> 00:27:38,086
Nice. We can exclude this one.

801
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:42,316
"Dalgaengyi" seems reasonable
because it sounds sweet.

802
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:43,926
"Dalgaengyi" in Gangwon Province?

803
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,886
Listen. Like you said,

804
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:48,626
the staff came up
with a difficult question.

805
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:50,766
Peach is paired with "boksang."

806
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:52,695
- Corn is paired with "yokshigi."
- They wouldn't force...

807
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,372
Ground sesame is paired
with "kkae" something.

808
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,935
When candy is paired
with "dalgaengyi,"

809
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:58,306
they thought that
everyone would pick this.

810
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,106
(Even the flavor expert is
confused.)

811
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,435
Sir, what do you think?

812
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:05,105
You can't ask him.

813
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,906
He keeps discussing with his waiter.

814
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:09,575
We can't ask him.

815
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,445
If you answer him,

816
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,116
we'll leave without paying the bill.

817
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:14,985
You don't believe me?

818
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,826
- I'm totally serious.
- He keeps talking to...

819
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:17,955
You think it's "kkaebosaengyi?"

820
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,655
I can't help
but think that it's a trap.

821
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,056
How can this be the answer?

822
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,525
Let's go with it.

823
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:23,696
- But...
- "Kkaebosaengyi?"

824
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,065
- What about your opinion?
- Let's go with "kkaebosaengyi."

825
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,166
What do you think?

826
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,035
My choice was "dalgaengyi,"

827
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:31,965
but it's reasonable to doubt
"kkaebosaengyi."

828
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,536
Don't blame me if I'm wrong.

829
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:35,775
I'll curse you
instead of blaming you.

830
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:37,545
Go with "dalgaengyi."

831
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:39,575
- We'll curse at you.
- Let's go with "dalgaengyi."

832
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:41,645
- Because of that punk...
- Go with "dalgaengyi."

833
00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:43,892
If "kkaebosaengyi" is the answer,
you'll get a low kick from me.

834
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:44,916
No, that's...

835
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,385
A monkey wrench?

836
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:47,485
- What?
- A monkey wrench?

837
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:48,855
- I said low kick.
- Low kick?

838
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:50,215
- It has nothing to do with monkeys.
- That's what I heard.

839
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:52,456
What's wrong with these people?

840
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,856
You can't hit someone
with a monkey wrench.

841
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:56,895
- I heard him say monkey.
- Why am I here?

842
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:58,095
This place is so frightening.

843
00:28:58,096 --> 00:28:59,125
- All right.
- Is it "dalgaengyi..."

844
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:00,195
or "kkaebosaengyi?"

845
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,165
We got it. "Dalgaengyi"
and candy are wrong.

846
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,205
Okay.

847
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:05,805
- Your answer is...
- Please let us be right.

848
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:07,436
Number two, "dalgaengyi" and candy.

849
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:10,575
Please, just this once.
I hope that I'm wrong.

850
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,452
- Just submit your credit card.
- Just this once.

851
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:14,815
- Is this correct?
- We pushed through, so let's go.

852
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:15,875
That's correct.

853
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:17,485
("Dalgaengyi" and candy)

854
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,915
You know what?

855
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,116
- I'll torture you all day today.
- Here's a low kick.

856
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,726
We almost got in trouble. Thank you.

857
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:26,756
We shouldn't do what I say.
I knew it.

858
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:28,296
I knew that you were smart.

859
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:30,195
- He's smart.
- Please take your cards.

860
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,295
(Collecting their cards
with victory)

861
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:33,665
- Okay.
- Here you go.

862
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,966
We almost got in trouble.

863
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,035
- We shouldn't follow what I say.
- We almost missed it.

864
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,106
We almost got in trouble.

865
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,736
I can understand why
the guests get so excited.

866
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,275
- It's nothing big, but...
- Of course.

867
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,805
- It's small, but...
- Now...

868
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,546
- It's up to the younger members.
- Yes.

869
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,146
- Here's another Who'll Pay?
- We should.

870
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,116
I'll give you a proverb.

871
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,786
- Again?
- This is unbelievable.

872
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,415
It's a proverb meaning that
no matter how weak something is,

873
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,756
it'll eventually fight back
when it's tormented too much.

874
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,956
"Even when a sparrow dies,
it does this."

875
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:04,995
It keeps its composure.

876
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:06,465
(Even when a sparrow dies,
it keeps its composure?)

877
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:08,706
- "It keeps its composure?"
- Even when a sparrow dies...

878
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,336
- It's one character.
- What?

879
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:11,835
I got it.

880
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:13,365
Even when a sparrow dies, it chirps?

881
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:14,436
Correct.

882
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,076
- It chirps.
- "It chirps?"

883
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:18,606
You mean, it chirps?

884
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,146
That's incredible.

885
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,615
That's so sad.

886
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:24,716
It chirps right before dying.

887
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,015
The one character was a huge hint...

888
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,115
now that I think about it.

889
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:29,656
I couldn't guess it right anyway.

890
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:32,025
I don't have a good feeling
about it.

891
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:34,096
Here's the last question
for the two of you.

892
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:36,995
It's a proverb meaning that
even small and weak things...

893
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:39,966
can create great power when united.

894
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:44,136
"Even mosquitoes can make this
when gathered."

895
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,106
When mosquitoes gather?

896
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:47,776
It has four characters.

897
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,806
What?

898
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,706
- Make "this?"
- Exactly.

899
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,006
What could it be?

900
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:53,975
- The question isn't for you.
- The lightning sound?

901
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:55,446
The question isn't for us.

902
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:57,076
- The flying sound?
- Incorrect.

903
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,246
Crossbreeding?

904
00:30:58,486 --> 00:30:59,716
Of course not.

905
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:01,855
Where did that come from
all of a sudden?

906
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,556
I've seen two mosquitoes together.

907
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,186
Incorrect.

908
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:06,726
I got it. The sound of thunder.

909
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:08,456
Correct.

910
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:10,665
What did I tell you?

911
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,295
- How do they make that?
- Please listen to me carefully.

912
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:14,595
- Why do they make that sound?
- Exactly.

913
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:16,795
- As the sound of thunder is loud?
- Even small and weak things...

914
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:19,505
can create great power when united.

915
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:21,505
Do you know why I let you answer it?

916
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,075
- Look at him.
- I was craving some ray.

917
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,176
Was it to pay the bill?

918
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,116
- Was it to eat?
- I didn't get to eat any.

919
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,286
- This is always better.
- Yes.

920
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,685
- Isn't the ray amazing?
- You should pay already.

921
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:34,756
It's so delicious.

922
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:37,585
- Thank you for the food.
- The total is 132 dollars.

923
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:40,456
(Total: 132 dollars)

924
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:43,356
- The ray tastes much better.
- Thank you.

925
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,696
I paid 130 dollars
when it was only lunch.

926
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:49,365
Thank you for the food.

927
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,965
Thank you for the food.

928
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,365
You paid after a long time.

929
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:53,406
(After one delicious meal)

930
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,135
Gosh, I'm full.

931
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:57,206
(I'm full.)

932
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:03,116
(Along the street
of the tranquil afternoon)

933
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,085
(Handsome Guys head
to the second restaurant.)

934
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:08,285
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

935
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,966
Why are there
so many real estate agencies?

936
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,925
This place is full
of real estate agencies.

937
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:14,796
It's a real estate agency.

938
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:16,825
We should eat first.

939
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:17,926
This must be it.

940
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:19,865
- What? This is it.
- There it is.

941
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:20,995
- Hey.
- This is it.

942
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:23,436
It seems completely out of place.

943
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,436
- What?
- It's a famous restaurant.

944
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,036
- Shall we go in?
- Fried food.

945
00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:29,006
(A long line)

946
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,206
(A busy kitchen)

947
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:35,976
(The packed restaurant)

948
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:39,585
The noodles are firm, chewy,
and delicious.

949
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,786
The pork cutlet is
extremely crunchy and tasty.

950
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:43,955
(Alone...)

951
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:45,856
(or with a friend)

952
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:48,896
(It can be enjoyed anytime.)

953
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,225
(Noodles made in-house...)

954
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:53,696
(to deliver a lively texture)

955
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:56,796
(A classic Japanese noodle dish)

956
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:01,605
(LMR 2, udon)

957
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,876
- Hello.
- Hello.

958
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,306
This place has
an extraordinary vibe.

959
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:10,416
Udon, you're dead.

960
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:12,745
The restaurant will be destroyed.
Be careful.

961
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,716
- What did Sang Uk say?
- You're really dead.

962
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:17,356
I'll stay quiet.
I'd be happy to share anything.

963
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:18,556
- Okay.
- Okay.

964
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:20,625
(Created by hunger)

965
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:21,955
Bukkake...

966
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,996
We'll get 1 of the 2,
and 4 of these.

967
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,195
- Four?
- Let's get these.

968
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,795
Do you mean these?

969
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,395
This, this, this, and this.

970
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:29,896
- Okay.
- And pork cutlet.

971
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:31,336
Good.

972
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:33,606
Excuse me, sir.

973
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,806
- Hello.
- Hello.

974
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:39,905
- He looks like a master.
- He has this vibe...

975
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:41,216
He's young.

976
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,586
He looks like a character
in a comic book about cooking.

977
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:45,915
(The restaurant owner has
the look of a chef.)

978
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:46,916
It's just my feeling.

979
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,216
Did you learn
how to make udon in Japan?

980
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:50,956
No.

981
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,826
I picked up things
by observing someone,

982
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:56,926
and I learned a lot
by studying on my own.

983
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:58,825
Is that so?

984
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:00,366
What does "bukkake" mean?

985
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,635
Bukkake udon is cold udon.

986
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,335
It means to drizzle the sauce.

987
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,365
So I was right.

988
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:06,665
- Pouring?
- Pouring.

989
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,606
The sauce is served separately.

990
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:12,075
You pour it over the udon.

991
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:14,475
(The restaurant's signature dish,
bukkake udon)

992
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,575
They'll pick from the menu.

993
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:17,916
- We'd like to order.
- Okay.

994
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,045
It could be shocking.

995
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:22,585
Can you give us everything
in the second column...

996
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:25,025
except kake soba?

997
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,026
Okay.

998
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,426
And all of these.

999
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:29,996
- The photos...
- Yes.

1000
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:32,466
We'd like these.

1001
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:35,395
Yes, exactly what you see.

1002
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:36,596
(Please give us all of these.)

1003
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,335
(Is that a faster way to order?)

1004
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,436
You see what they mean?

1005
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,405
- All the remaining ones?
- All except this one.

1006
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:42,476
Okay.

1007
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:44,045
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1008
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:45,482
(The restaurant owner leaves
to cook.)

1009
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,916
There's an ice cream shop outside.

1010
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:49,616
Am I not allowed to go outside?

1011
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:52,096
The cooking will take
about ten minutes. Shall we go?

1012
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:53,616
- Yes.
- Making the noodles...

1013
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,756
I'd love that.

1014
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,915
Then I'll buy it.

1015
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,925
- How about...
- The weather is hot.

1016
00:34:57,926 --> 00:34:59,786
- I'll come with you.
- I'll go and get it.

1017
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,896
- Pick 50.
- What, 50?

1018
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,296
Okay.

1019
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,096
I'm having at least two.

1020
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,966
I didn't know that there was
such a variety of ice cream.

1021
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:12,706
(Picking 1 by 1 for other members
and the staff)

1022
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:14,375
Why don't we play
rock-paper-scissors?

1023
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:15,936
The loser has to pay
and get back later.

1024
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:17,645
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1025
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:18,805
(The game of who'll pay is a must.)

1026
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,452
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1027
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,146
What's going on?
Rock-paper-scissors.

1028
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,496
(Paper, scissors, scissors)

1029
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:28,186
(Dong Hyun is picked.)

1030
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:30,316
I always end up paying
for something.

1031
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:32,886
I always pay for something.

1032
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:35,395
Did you also buy that basket?

1033
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:36,925
(Returning in glory)

1034
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,565
No, I'll take it back to them.

1035
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:40,266
All right, it's from Dong Hyun.

1036
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:42,335
- He lost?
- I lost.

1037
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:43,535
I always pay for something.

1038
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:44,766
He lost the game.

1039
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:46,535
- I'll take it after the staff.
- Thank you.

1040
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:47,605
Did I buy too much?

1041
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:51,146
(Together, they enjoy
a refreshing ice cream party.)

1042
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,305
(The Handsome Guys
also enjoy one each.)

1043
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:55,246
This has changed a bit.

1044
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:58,346
(We enjoyed.)

1045
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,015
(Just when
they've cooled down a bit)

1046
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,486
It's here!

1047
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:02,955
(The udon arrives
at the perfect time.)

1048
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,755
What a relief. Nice.

1049
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:06,055
- Look.
- I'll enjoy.

1050
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:07,755
(First dish:
Bukkake udon with clear noodles)

1051
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:09,755
This is our restaurant's
signature dish.

1052
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:10,896
The bukkake udon.

1053
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,395
I thought it was raw fish.

1054
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:15,195
Doesn't it look like raw cuttlefish?

1055
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:16,196
How can udon look like that?

1056
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:17,665
This place is the real deal.

1057
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,806
Wait, what's that?

1058
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:22,276
(Drawing all their attention)

1059
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,035
Is that fishcake?

1060
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,145
This is chikuwa,

1061
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:27,575
which is a fishcake
that's been made into a tube.

1062
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,375
We grilled it
and then deep-fried it.

1063
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:31,245
I thought it was blowfish.

1064
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:33,386
Gosh, thank you. We'll enjoy.

1065
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:34,515
Sir, I love...

1066
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:36,386
how everything's so neat and pretty.

1067
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:39,255
(The dough)

1068
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:41,695
(Resting)

1069
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:46,426
(Making the noodles)

1070
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:51,536
(Made with love and patience)

1071
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:53,506
(From one batch of noodles)

1072
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:57,036
(Presenting three types of udon)

1073
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:01,676
(Udon noodles made from scratch...)

1074
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,616
(take a cold shower.)

1075
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:07,086
(Udon noodles topped with sauce,
Bukkake udon)

1076
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:09,616
(When fried chikuwa...)

1077
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:12,186
(is placed on top)

1078
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:19,426
(The ultimate combo:
Bukkake udon with chikuwa)

1079
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:23,436
(Swimming in a hot broth)

1080
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:29,635
(Broth with deep flavors, kake udon)

1081
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:31,145
- Can we get some bowls?
- Sure.

1082
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,275
I'll mix this.

1083
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:33,706
I thought it was raw fish.

1084
00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:35,375
You can see...

1085
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:37,075
how bouncy the noodles are.

1086
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:38,146
(Bouncy, bukkake udon!)

1087
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:40,116
That's incredible.

1088
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:42,815
It's not the udon we imagined.

1089
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,216
The noodles were made from scratch.

1090
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:45,726
The noodles...

1091
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,626
are pulling me towards them.

1092
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:49,325
This is the real deal.

1093
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:51,206
There's a reason
why people line up to eat this.

1094
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:52,926
- I can tell why.
- No way.

1095
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,166
Look how bouncy...

1096
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,595
- Look.
- The noodles are.

1097
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:58,005
I really need a bite of that.

1098
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,305
(He takes in the aroma first.)

1099
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:00,836
This smells amazing.

1100
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,975
I can really smell
the dried bonito flakes.

1101
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:06,806
(The satisfying sound that signals
the start of their meal)

1102
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:09,376
This smells incredible.

1103
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:12,146
(Yummy)

1104
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:19,086
(Slurping)

1105
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,426
(Yummy)

1106
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,755
The noodles are out of this world.

1107
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:25,296
- The noodles.
- Gosh, the noodles.

1108
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:26,426
The noodles...

1109
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,936
- are like jelly.
- Exactly!

1110
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:31,905
(Slurping the jelly-like noodles)

1111
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,436
(Disbelief)

1112
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,006
I can tell the noodles are bouncy.

1113
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:38,306
(Curious)

1114
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,106
How's the sauce?

1115
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:42,445
The flavors aren't strong.

1116
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,592
- It's just perfect.
- It's milder than marinated crab.

1117
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,716
(Letting Yi Kyung
describe the flavors)

1118
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:52,986
(Eating is their specialty.)

1119
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:54,825
You get a nutty and tangy combo...

1120
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:56,955
from the sesame seeds
and green onion.

1121
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,036
It's like sending corner kicks
into the penalty area.

1122
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:02,066
(This is torture.)

1123
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,405
The rice is perfectly cooked.

1124
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:05,666
Is that rice?

1125
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:07,336
Was rice served with a fried egg?

1126
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,936
Is that an over-easy egg?

1127
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,806
(Mixing)

1128
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:15,406
This is rice with Tsuyu sauce.
It's a first for me.

1129
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,686
(Yummy)

1130
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,486
(No way)

1131
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,185
Rice with Tsuyu sauce...

1132
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:29,256
is like the steamed rice dish...

1133
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:32,226
with soy sauce and egg we give kids.

1134
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:33,895
It looks that way with the egg.

1135
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,536
(You can't beat the classic.)

1136
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,765
(My gosh...)

1137
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:41,176
(They want some
even though they're full.)

1138
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:42,505
What about that one?

1139
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,575
- The fishcake.
- That...

1140
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:46,106
- I'm curious about...
- This is good.

1141
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,916
The bukkake udon dishes.

1142
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:54,586
(Stealing a whiff of the aroma)

1143
00:39:55,316 --> 00:39:57,616
No one taught him that technique.

1144
00:39:58,086 --> 00:39:59,185
We've only tried that
with our hands,

1145
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,426
but I like what he's

1146
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:01,525
doing. Can you smell it?

1147
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:03,196
(He even tries a bite.)

1148
00:40:03,296 --> 00:40:04,496
He's imagining the flavors.

1149
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:06,865
It's like shadow boxing.

1150
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,336
- Shadow...
- Yes, shadow boxing.

1151
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,095
Try that one.

1152
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:11,636
I'll finish this off.

1153
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,005
Are you pushing out...

1154
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:14,305
- empty dishes?
- Yes.

1155
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:15,876
- Like a conveyor belt?
- Really?

1156
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:17,535
- Here you go.
- Sure.

1157
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:19,675
This takes me back...

1158
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:20,975
to old-school food courts.

1159
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,716
Why don't we operate
the belt for them?

1160
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:25,285
(The second dish is bukkake udon
with deep-fried chikuwa.)

1161
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:26,486
Check out that fritter.

1162
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,455
Try the fritter.

1163
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,286
(Chikuwa, come to me.)

1164
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:33,256
(Crunchy)

1165
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:36,396
Why does everything look good?

1166
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,525
It's a flavor we know well,

1167
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:40,526
but...

1168
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:43,835
there's a classiness to it.

1169
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:45,906
(Chewy and crunchy, a classy combo)

1170
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,906
(More udon)

1171
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:55,746
(Slurping)

1172
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,415
(The slurping masters
inhale the udon.)

1173
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,846
You could mix the rice
into that sauce.

1174
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,416
- What's that?
- This steamed rice.

1175
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:05,585
(They easily finish two dishes.)

1176
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,656
- This is insane.
- Two bowls already?

1177
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,526
The noodles vanished.

1178
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:11,895
Have more.

1179
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:13,296
(The next dish enters.)

1180
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:14,535
(Kake udon with a soy sauce broth
made at the restaurant)

1181
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:15,965
Should we eat it together
from the bowl?

1182
00:41:15,966 --> 00:41:17,235
- Let's not fuss about it.
- Sure thing.

1183
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:18,306
It's just us eating this.

1184
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:24,975
(He tries the broth first.)

1185
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:26,546
I haven't had a broth
like this before.

1186
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:28,376
- Really?
- This is the smell...

1187
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,775
that makes people line up outside.

1188
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,886
- No way.
- This broth is new to me.

1189
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:34,115
Is this dried bonito flakes
I'm tasting?

1190
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,255
It is,

1191
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,256
but that alone would not be so good.

1192
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:40,655
There's a subtle layer of flavors,

1193
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:42,896
and the dried bonito flakes
add a punch.

1194
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:45,695
The smokiness.

1195
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:47,196
- Exactly.
- That's it.

1196
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,296
(How are the noodles?)

1197
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:57,136
These noodles hit differently.

1198
00:41:57,676 --> 00:41:58,836
This isn't like bukkake udon.

1199
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,415
Since it sat in warm broth,

1200
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,946
the noodles kept cooking a bit more.

1201
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,746
That's why...

1202
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:06,315
So that's how they're different.

1203
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,116
(Sitting in a bath of broth)

1204
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:14,086
(The kake udon noodles
are soft and delicate.)

1205
00:42:14,356 --> 00:42:15,656
There's more.

1206
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:17,256
Here it is.

1207
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,325
This is what I love.

1208
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:20,402
(The next dishes proudly enter.)

1209
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:21,735
They're having soba noodles next.

1210
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:24,565
You serve every dish
made with Tsuyu sauce.

1211
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,706
That's right.

1212
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,005
- I mean...
- There's more.

1213
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,235
(Their fifth dish is fritters
and zaru soba.)

1214
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:30,276
It's your next dish.

1215
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:32,246
The presentation is beautiful.

1216
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,582
Don't they look like display food?

1217
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:35,645
Look at that. This is so pretty.

1218
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:37,716
- The fritters...
- Is there more?

1219
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:40,216
(The dishes keep coming.)

1220
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,315
- How many did you order?
- Are you expecting someone?

1221
00:42:42,316 --> 00:42:43,456
This is everything.

1222
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:44,855
How many dishes did you order?

1223
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,626
(This is only
for the three of them.)

1224
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:48,496
I'm sure this will taste familiar.

1225
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,626
Look how thick it is.

1226
00:42:49,796 --> 00:42:51,765
Even so, it might taste different.

1227
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:53,695
That's a thick cut of meat.

1228
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,565
- I'm fond of that thickness.
- Right.

1229
00:42:55,566 --> 00:42:56,995
The key to a good pork cutlet...

1230
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,965
- is not overcooking it.
- That's bound to be good.

1231
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:00,836
The batter was kept thin.

1232
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:02,575
(Yummy)

1233
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:03,576
The key is a thin batter.

1234
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:04,775
It's rich and toasty.

1235
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,376
I love the toasty and clean flavors.

1236
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,246
- The batter is really thin.
- I know.

1237
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:11,246
Because it's summer.

1238
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:13,385
Is it wearing sheer clothes?

1239
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:15,106
Yes, sheer clothes
because it's hot outside.

1240
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,985
It's so hot outside these days...

1241
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,626
- that he kept the batter thin.
- Exactly.

1242
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:21,825
Seung Ho, you have that.

1243
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:23,655
- That one.
- Byung Eun...

1244
00:43:23,656 --> 00:43:24,895
loves soba.

1245
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,125
- Sang Uk, I'll add it all in.
- Sure.

1246
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:29,696
(Make the soba your own)

1247
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:32,806
You need to mix it well.

1248
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:35,605
Unbelievable.

1249
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:37,075
It's like you're having a feast.

1250
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:39,306
(Mouth-watering)

1251
00:43:39,546 --> 00:43:41,216
Take some of the noodles.

1252
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:42,316
Right.

1253
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:43,475
And dunk them in the broth.

1254
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:44,945
(Straight into the broth)

1255
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:46,146
- Let's put it on that.
- Sure.

1256
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:47,815
You should have it
with the dried laver.

1257
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:51,456
(Straight into his mouth)

1258
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,956
- My gosh.
- The broth is quite thick.

1259
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:55,395
These noodles are different as well.

1260
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:56,876
(The noodles are different
yet again!)

1261
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,096
Just like jasmine rice,

1262
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:01,895
the noodles don't stick
to one another.

1263
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:03,036
- They don't stick?
- No.

1264
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:06,165
The noodles don't stick
to one another.

1265
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,306
- They don't stick?
- No.

1266
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:16,646
(Yummy)

1267
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:19,745
(The tasters create
a sweet ensemble of music.)

1268
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:20,886
I'm hearing an orchestra.

1269
00:44:21,386 --> 00:44:23,286
You two are the human orchestra.

1270
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:24,925
Could we...

1271
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:26,485
- check the bill first?
- Okay.

1272
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:27,885
- My gosh.
- Look at everything.

1273
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:29,156
Let's keep it nice and clean.

1274
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:31,995
- We ate so much, but...
- This was a huge meal.

1275
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:33,125
No way.

1276
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:34,835
- Is it below 100 dollars?
- But we ordered so much.

1277
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:36,095
One, two, three, four,

1278
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:37,865
five, six, and seven.

1279
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:39,465
Seven dishes and coke.

1280
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:40,805
We ordered ten items,

1281
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:41,935
but the bill is only 89 dollars.

1282
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:43,706
(89 dollars!)

1283
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:46,476
I'd gladly pay for this
if it comes to that.

1284
00:44:46,506 --> 00:44:48,175
Same here.
I wouldn't be sour about it.

1285
00:44:48,176 --> 00:44:49,516
(Total: 89 dollars)

1286
00:44:50,346 --> 00:44:54,116
Kagawa Prefecture in Japan,
famous for its udon,

1287
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,016
has something called an udon taxi.

1288
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:57,556
What?

1289
00:44:57,786 --> 00:44:59,585
You need to pass a special test...

1290
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:02,096
- to become a driver.
- This is a tough one.

1291
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:03,655
For the written exam,

1292
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,325
drivers are tested
on expert knowledge of udon.

1293
00:45:05,326 --> 00:45:06,365
They should know that.

1294
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:07,625
For the performance test,

1295
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:09,495
they are evaluated...

1296
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:11,636
on customer service
and tour guide skills.

1297
00:45:12,236 --> 00:45:14,365
Lastly, in the third part
of the exam,

1298
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:16,205
they are tested...

1299
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:18,446
on one of the techniques
used to make udon.

1300
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:20,276
What is it?

1301
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:22,115
What exactly is the purpose...

1302
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:23,515
of an udon taxi?

1303
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:24,546
Udon taxis...

1304
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:27,316
either take customers
to their chosen restaurant...

1305
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,815
or guide them to several spots...

1306
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:32,826
recommended by the driver.

1307
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:35,402
- This is hard to guess.
- It has to be about the noodles.

1308
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:36,695
It has to be about...

1309
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:38,266
either the broth or the noodles.

1310
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:40,425
What of the two would it be?

1311
00:45:40,426 --> 00:45:42,366
"One of the techniques
used to make udon."

1312
00:45:42,496 --> 00:45:44,195
Don't you need a technique
to make noodles?

1313
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:45,966
I also think it's about the noodles.

1314
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,106
About making the broth...

1315
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:50,376
Does a taxi driver have to know
about the broth?

1316
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:53,176
The noodles are about the same,
but the broth varies.

1317
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:56,145
As soon as I heard it, I thought
of noodle-making techniques.

1318
00:45:56,146 --> 00:45:57,246
You're saying that too.

1319
00:45:57,846 --> 00:45:59,886
"One of the techniques
used to make udon."

1320
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:03,286
- The techniques used to make udon.
- To make udon.

1321
00:46:04,016 --> 00:46:05,455
Should we generalize it, and say,

1322
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,956
"the noodle techniques?"

1323
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,626
On noodles.

1324
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:10,672
- Techniques on noodles.
- It's some kind of technique.

1325
00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:11,866
The technique on noodles!

1326
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:14,525
When you say answer,

1327
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:16,895
you have to say the exact word
we have.

1328
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:18,106
(Disappointed)

1329
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,166
- Then let's do this.
- Techniques for making udon.

1330
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:21,905
We'll go with the noodles, right?

1331
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:23,912
- We'll go with the noodles.
- The technique used to make udon.

1332
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:26,375
(What is their final answer?)

1333
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:28,146
- One, two, three.
- Noodles.

1334
00:46:28,476 --> 00:46:29,476
Noodles?

1335
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:31,245
Noodles are equal to techniques.

1336
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,285
Whether they make them
or knead them.

1337
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:34,685
- Right. Whether they cut them.
- Techniques on noodles.

1338
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:35,886
(Would noodles be the answer?)

1339
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:38,886
There must be something more
about it.

1340
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:40,026
Incorrect.

1341
00:46:40,456 --> 00:46:41,625
Okay. We passed.

1342
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:43,595
- We're safe.
- Okay.

1343
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:45,025
(Sad, happy)

1344
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:47,066
- Congrats. Be healthy.
- Yes.

1345
00:46:47,996 --> 00:46:49,065
(The Young Boys compete
individually from now on.)

1346
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,495
We have to guess it right.

1347
00:46:50,496 --> 00:46:51,536
It's an individual game.

1348
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:53,466
I think it's related to noodles.

1349
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:55,876
But we got the word wrong.

1350
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:58,406
Try it, then.
It's either about boiling them or...

1351
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:01,416
Or I think it's...

1352
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,546
I got it. Aging the noodles.

1353
00:47:04,786 --> 00:47:05,886
Aging. Incorrect.

1354
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:06,946
I got it.

1355
00:47:07,816 --> 00:47:09,755
- I got it. Kneading.
- Kneading? Incorrect.

1356
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:11,885
I got it. Boiling the noodles.

1357
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:13,256
Boiling? Incorrect.

1358
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:14,625
(Saying wrong answers
3 consecutive times)

1359
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:15,656
Making the noodles.

1360
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:18,625
(How about Tae Hyun's answer,
making the noodles?)

1361
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:19,626
Incorrect.

1362
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:21,265
- There's an exact word.
- An exact word?

1363
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:23,042
- An exact word we're looking for.
- Hand-pulling!

1364
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:25,966
(Is it hand-pulling?)

1365
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,205
Correct.

1366
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:30,706
(Yi Kyung is correct!)

1367
00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:34,076
They have to hand-pull the noodles.

1368
00:47:34,406 --> 00:47:36,292
Yi Kyung, we were right
about the noodles, though.

1369
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:37,415
Hand-pulled noodles.

1370
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,546
(It was close.)

1371
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,945
- Sang Uk, at this pace...
- Sang Uk.

1372
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:43,115
- You have a 50 percent chance.
- Guess what.

1373
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:45,885
Will Sang Uk finally wear
the penalty makeup?

1374
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:47,686
(The shadow of makeup
is approaching Sang Uk.)

1375
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:49,025
(Interesting)

1376
00:47:49,026 --> 00:47:50,256
Jeez.

1377
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,025
- Is it between the two of us?
- Yes, you two.

1378
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:54,586
(Final payment,
Sang Uk versus Seung Ho)

1379
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:55,895
(The one who needs
to avoid putting on makeup)

1380
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:57,036
I have to sit right.

1381
00:47:58,936 --> 00:48:00,035
It feels like a final.

1382
00:48:00,036 --> 00:48:01,536
(It's not an easy opponent.)

1383
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:05,746
(Who will pay for it in the end?)

1384
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:08,775
In Japan,
when you use this recklessly...

1385
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:10,746
in cafes or restaurants,

1386
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:12,515
an employee might stop you...

1387
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:14,446
- or in some cases...
- I got it. Electricity.

1388
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:16,485
(Listening carefully)

1389
00:48:16,486 --> 00:48:18,556
(Electricity.
(I got it. Electricity.)

1390
00:48:18,926 --> 00:48:20,885
- The outlets.
- I'm not done with the question.

1391
00:48:20,886 --> 00:48:23,202
(Seung Ho says the answer
before the question is finished.)

1392
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:24,355
- The electrical outlets?
- Yes. I'll just go for it.

1393
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:25,366
He's right.

1394
00:48:25,996 --> 00:48:27,765
Seung Ho. Correct.

1395
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:30,865
(Seung Ho is correct!)

1396
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,036
(Sang Uk is the final payer.)

1397
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:34,636
Gosh. Sang Uk.

1398
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:36,476
- I didn't think of it.
- No?

1399
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:40,576
- I thought it'd be wet towels.
- We can say he'll get the penalty.

1400
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:42,616
(Sang Uk is a step closer
to the penalty makeup.)

1401
00:48:42,617 --> 00:48:43,976
I'm losing money.

1402
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:46,046
Sang Uk.

1403
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:47,586
Sang Uk,
don't forget to take the wig.

1404
00:48:47,986 --> 00:48:49,786
Get the manicures. Yes.

1405
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,056
(Total: 89 dollars)

1406
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,126
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

1407
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:54,826
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1408
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:58,466
I'm running a loss.

1409
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,236
(They move after the LMRs
and arrive at...)

1410
00:49:02,436 --> 00:49:03,835
This must be Seorae Village.

1411
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:06,935
The Seorae Village is filled
with restaurants and cafes.

1412
00:49:06,936 --> 00:49:08,005
(It's filled with cafes and shops
with a French vibe.)

1413
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:11,006
The cafes in Seorae Village
are famous, aren't they?

1414
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:13,945
- There are cafes in every alleyway.
- There are many cafes here.

1415
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:15,345
There are many foreigners.

1416
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,576
- That's true.
- Yes. Many foreigners are here.

1417
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:20,157
- There are non-Korean babies too.
- It has a French vibe.

1418
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:22,486
- I think they speak good Korean.
- Really?

1419
00:49:24,016 --> 00:49:25,325
When you walk around Seorae Village,

1420
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:28,055
you can see many French families
on the walk.

1421
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:29,626
(You can see
a lot of French families.)

1422
00:49:30,296 --> 00:49:32,126
It's because
there's a French school here.

1423
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:36,065
The French school moved here
in 1985.

1424
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:39,065
(The relocation of the French school
increased the number of French.)

1425
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:43,275
As you can see,
the decorations are exotic.

1426
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:45,775
So are the buildings and streets.

1427
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:48,876
(A little France in Seoul
adorned with exotic decorations)

1428
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,746
We have to have desserts
since we're here.

1429
00:49:52,846 --> 00:49:55,656
- You can see how famous it is.
- There's a cafe.

1430
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:57,386
Look at the blue ribbons.

1431
00:49:57,556 --> 00:49:59,785
- It's a cafe but...
- It's a cafe but has blue ribbons.

1432
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:01,455
- What is this?
- It has so many ribbons.

1433
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,296
- From 2017 to 2025.
- Gosh.

1434
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:07,265
Two, four, six, eight, and nine.
It has nine ribbons.

1435
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,165
(The blue ribbons over 9 years
prove how great the cafe is.)

1436
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,636
It must be a really nice place.

1437
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:15,075
- Shall we?
- Gosh.

1438
00:50:15,076 --> 00:50:16,776
(Shall we go inside?)

1439
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:18,176
She's a foreigner.

1440
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:20,005
- Hello.
- Hi.

1441
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:21,745
- Hello.
- Are you the owner of the cafe?

1442
00:50:21,746 --> 00:50:23,546
- No. Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

1443
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:25,846
- Are you French?
- Yes.

1444
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:28,086
Thank you.

1445
00:50:29,356 --> 00:50:30,986
- Gosh. What is this?
- What is that?

1446
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:33,486
They won a baguette championship.

1447
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:34,656
What?

1448
00:50:36,596 --> 00:50:38,826
(They won the baguette championship
in 2024.)

1449
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:40,525
How old is this place?

1450
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:42,396
- Pardon?
- How long has it been open?

1451
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,105
- About 9 years?
- About 9 years.

1452
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:46,106
About nine years.

1453
00:50:46,107 --> 00:50:47,606
How can you speak Korean so well?

1454
00:50:47,806 --> 00:50:49,405
I've been around for a long time.

1455
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:51,446
- Why? Why did you come here?
- I studied by myself.

1456
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:53,646
- Because I like Korea.
- You came by yourself.

1457
00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:56,145
You came alone,
but you're married now, aren't you?

1458
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:57,245
- Yes.
- To a Korean man.

1459
00:50:57,246 --> 00:50:58,446
- Yes.
- I knew it.

1460
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:00,946
You found love and work in Korea.

1461
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:02,456
What's the most delicious one?

1462
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,086
We are very familiar with vanilla.

1463
00:51:06,386 --> 00:51:08,496
Our mille-feuille vanille
is very popular.

1464
00:51:08,656 --> 00:51:09,825
- Mille-feuille?
- Mille-feuille vanille?

1465
00:51:09,826 --> 00:51:10,955
It's the most famous one.

1466
00:51:10,956 --> 00:51:12,065
Isn't it mille-feuille?

1467
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:14,165
You're talking about the same thing.

1468
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,726
- Really?
- I think it's the same thing.

1469
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:16,895
Yes, it's mille-feuille.

1470
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:19,365
- I'm correct.
- Come on.

1471
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:21,035
- Really?
- It's the layered one.

1472
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,036
I know about it.

1473
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,836
We serve it in a way
that's easy to eat.

1474
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:26,005
Tae Hyun, for this one,

1475
00:51:26,006 --> 00:51:27,975
why don't we let one person pay?

1476
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:28,976
- Okay.
- Good.

1477
00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:30,622
But don't underestimate the cost
of the breads.

1478
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:32,846
- Last time...
- Exactly.

1479
00:51:32,886 --> 00:51:35,315
Don't order one dish per person.

1480
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:37,555
- Don't order one per person.
- Okay.

1481
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:38,985
I'll order right away.

1482
00:51:38,986 --> 00:51:40,885
I want that... Lingot Rose?

1483
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:42,396
- Okay.
- I'll have one of those.

1484
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:46,396
- I'll get tarte vanille.
- One tarte vanille?

1485
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,795
- We should get this one too.
- It's the most famous one.

1486
00:51:48,796 --> 00:51:50,235
- We'll get it.
- The vanilla.

1487
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:52,105
- We'll get one of these.
- One mille-feuille.

1488
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:54,805
- Hey, Vanille.
- I'll get tiramisu.

1489
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:55,906
- Okay.
- Tiramisu?

1490
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:57,305
- We have to eat later.
- I like tiramisu.

1491
00:51:57,306 --> 00:51:59,776
- And tarte au chocolat.
- One tarte au chocolat.

1492
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:01,946
- That will be over 100 dollars.
- Really?

1493
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:04,375
- That's all.
- Thank you.

1494
00:52:04,376 --> 00:52:05,485
- Okay.
- We'll pay when we leave.

1495
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,386
(They ordered
the desserts and drinks.)

1496
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:08,916
Seorae Village...

1497
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:10,756
is known for its cafes.

1498
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:15,196
Seorae Village has its own vibe
you can't find elsewhere.

1499
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,825
Don't you know how to speak French?

1500
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:19,926
- Yes. Fencing is from France.
- Right?

1501
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:21,965
It's where fencing originated.

1502
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:24,896
I do speak French. Attaque
contre-attaque. Attaque touche.

1503
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:26,336
What does it mean?

1504
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:27,906
Aljaltakggalsen?

1505
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,936
What?

1506
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:31,075
It means the start
and the end of the match, right?

1507
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:34,206
No. "He attacked."

1508
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:36,076
"He defended."

1509
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:38,416
"This one won."
That's what it means.

1510
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:41,485
You should have learned
something useful,

1511
00:52:41,486 --> 00:52:42,515
especially when dating.

1512
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:44,385
- Don't you know everyday words?
- What was that?

1513
00:52:44,386 --> 00:52:45,956
Everyday words? Well...

1514
00:52:46,856 --> 00:52:49,255
I only know the terms
the referees use.

1515
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:50,256
Or something like "Sorry."

1516
00:52:50,257 --> 00:52:52,165
- Sorry. What is it?
- Yes.

1517
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,326
- "Pardon."
- "Pardon."

1518
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:54,926
- Pardon.
- Pardon.

1519
00:52:56,536 --> 00:52:57,896
It's coming.

1520
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:00,266
Gosh. That's how they serve it.

1521
00:53:00,366 --> 00:53:02,276
Gosh. This was it.

1522
00:53:02,436 --> 00:53:05,105
Ma'am, can you tell us
if you understand his French?

1523
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:06,805
Can you check if it's correct?

1524
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:07,806
- Okay.
- Say it.

1525
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:08,875
Say it.

1526
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:10,445
(Getting his French tested
by a French, he hesitates.)

1527
00:53:10,446 --> 00:53:12,446
Say it confidently
like you did before.

1528
00:53:12,616 --> 00:53:13,885
Say it louder.

1529
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:15,356
- There was a long phrase.
- Right.

1530
00:53:16,016 --> 00:53:18,016
- I'll do it. Hold on. Let me focus.
- Say "Sorry."

1531
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:19,356
What's wrong?

1532
00:53:19,856 --> 00:53:21,895
- I'm sweating all of a sudden.
- Come on.

1533
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,526
Attaque
contre-attaque. Attaque touche.

1534
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:25,896
Attaque
contre-attaque. Attaque touche.

1535
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:28,836
I knew it.

1536
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:30,166
I'm sorry.

1537
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:31,905
I'll try it again.

1538
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:34,065
I'll try it again.

1539
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:36,705
- No. They say "touche."
- She said sorry.

1540
00:53:36,706 --> 00:53:38,846
(Trying for the 2nd time)

1541
00:53:39,176 --> 00:53:40,475
(She still doesn't get it.)

1542
00:53:40,476 --> 00:53:43,275
How dare you lie to us?

1543
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:44,475
You don't play fencing.

1544
00:53:44,476 --> 00:53:46,085
(He's a bit sulky.)

1545
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:47,485
What was "Sorry" again?

1546
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:48,855
Right. Pardon.

1547
00:53:48,856 --> 00:53:49,955
Pardon. Okay.

1548
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:51,585
In the end, you say sorry.

1549
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:52,785
Let's leave it at that.

1550
00:53:52,786 --> 00:53:54,886
- Pardon.
- It's heartwarming. Pardon.

1551
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:58,426
He spoke French
a French person couldn't understand.

1552
00:53:59,226 --> 00:54:00,826
It's just my pronunciation.

1553
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:03,066
If I could only get
the pronunciation right...

1554
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:04,995
Here are the tartes.

1555
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:06,305
(Desserts have arrived too.)

1556
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:07,566
They look so pretty.

1557
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:10,806
You can leave them anywhere.

1558
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:12,775
We'll distribute them.

1559
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:19,115
(The sweet desserts look fancy.)

1560
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:20,545
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1561
00:54:20,546 --> 00:54:22,856
- Okay. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1562
00:54:24,986 --> 00:54:26,385
(Lingot Rose)

1563
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:28,725
(A cheese mousse with
New York-style cheesecake in it)

1564
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,026
- It's tasty.
- There are five.

1565
00:54:30,696 --> 00:54:32,966
- Isn't that for us?
- Is this how we eat it?

1566
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,796
It's so good.

1567
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:36,696
Is it different?

1568
00:54:37,396 --> 00:54:38,396
Should I cut it?

1569
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:42,376
It's so soft.

1570
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:46,575
It tastes really good.

1571
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:47,576
(Amazed)

1572
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:49,546
Does it taste like the snack
called French Pie?

1573
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:50,646
Try it.

1574
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:53,016
This one is similar to that snack.

1575
00:54:53,216 --> 00:54:54,686
That's interesting.

1576
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:56,986
(Savoring)

1577
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,386
(It hits the spot.)

1578
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,955
It's their signature dish
with lots of vanilla.

1579
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:04,555
They won it with this.

1580
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:05,825
(Mille-feuille vanille)

1581
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:09,796
(A rich vanilla cream between
the pie made with French AOP Butter)

1582
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:15,066
(He can't help but be truly amazed.)

1583
00:55:16,136 --> 00:55:17,476
It's so good.

1584
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:21,845
The thin and crunchy pastry
is tasty.

1585
00:55:21,846 --> 00:55:23,615
It's buttery and flavorful.

1586
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:26,615
The vanilla cream is not too sweet
but flavorful.

1587
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,056
Its milky flavor
is out of this world.

1588
00:55:32,086 --> 00:55:33,886
I can eat ten of them right now.

1589
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:38,826
As for this one, I want
Byung Eun and Yi Kyung...

1590
00:55:38,996 --> 00:55:40,365
to try it.

1591
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:42,296
- This one?
- Should we get one more?

1592
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,196
- Should we?
- Yes.

1593
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:47,565
- Shall we?
- One more mille-feuille vanille.

1594
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:50,235
- Are there more coming?
- We ordered one more of it.

1595
00:55:50,236 --> 00:55:51,875
- Here's one more dessert.
- Thank you.

1596
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,245
- Hold on.
- Is that the one I talked about?

1597
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,345
I'll cut the mille-feuille.

1598
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:56,345
No. I'll do it for you.

1599
00:55:56,346 --> 00:55:58,175
- Do we cut it?
- There's a way to do it.

1600
00:55:58,176 --> 00:55:59,516
One like this.

1601
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,645
- Like a layer.
- Like a milling style.

1602
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:03,056
Two and three.

1603
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:05,755
- Who didn't try it?
- Me.

1604
00:56:05,756 --> 00:56:06,855
- I had it.
- And?

1605
00:56:06,856 --> 00:56:07,925
- Two people.
- This one...

1606
00:56:07,926 --> 00:56:10,056
There's one piece left, right?
Then it's mine.

1607
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:12,566
- Who says?
- Hold on.

1608
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:14,825
I'll take half of the piece.

1609
00:56:14,826 --> 00:56:15,836
(Laughing)

1610
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:16,966
Gosh. Look.

1611
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:19,306
(Amazed)

1612
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,206
Really?

1613
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:23,035
Can one really react like that
after eating a dessert?

1614
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:24,206
Did you try it, Sang Uk?

1615
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:26,945
It's so good.

1616
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:28,976
(He takes a bite out of curiosity.)

1617
00:56:29,316 --> 00:56:30,316
Really?

1618
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:32,916
(I'll try it too.)

1619
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,485
It feels like ice cream too.

1620
00:56:36,486 --> 00:56:37,785
(Fully convinced)

1621
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:38,955
Gosh.

1622
00:56:38,956 --> 00:56:40,586
- That's...
- The more you chew...

1623
00:56:40,756 --> 00:56:41,926
This place has good food.

1624
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,656
- Are you a dessert person?
- Not really.

1625
00:56:44,996 --> 00:56:46,165
- But this place...
- But I had it because it was good.

1626
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:47,166
- Right?
- I wasn't going to eat...

1627
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,195
if it wasn't good.

1628
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,795
Everything tasted different.

1629
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:50,916
It tastes like crackers too.

1630
00:56:51,236 --> 00:56:53,535
I'm surprised
because everything here...

1631
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,675
is something
I've never tasted elsewhere.

1632
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:57,375
(After tasting
all kinds of sweetness)

1633
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:58,875
- I found...
- It's crazy.

1634
00:56:58,876 --> 00:57:01,275
The photo of Byung Eun
during his heyday.

1635
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:03,045
- His heyday.
- I know it.

1636
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:04,375
We searched for it before.

1637
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:05,915
- Gosh. You...
- He was more handsome than Taesaja.

1638
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,185
He looks like someone.

1639
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:09,785
- I was shocked.
- Seriously.

1640
00:57:09,786 --> 00:57:11,516
Doesn't he look like a member
of Taesaja?

1641
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,455
He totally looks like an idol.

1642
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:14,956
- Back then.
- He was so handsome.

1643
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:20,566
(His heyday when he ignited feelings
in many girls' hearts)

1644
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,136
- It's just...
- When was this?

1645
00:57:23,696 --> 00:57:25,705
When I was 24 or 25.

1646
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:27,935
- It's your college years.
- He looks so hot.

1647
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:31,976
I suppose I looked fine back then.

1648
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:36,245
There were L brand jeans back then.

1649
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:37,275
- The L Brand.
- The L Brand jeans.

1650
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:40,415
They let me model for it
when I sent a photo of myself.

1651
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,685
(He even modelled for the L Jeans.)

1652
00:57:41,686 --> 00:57:42,715
Yes.

1653
00:57:42,716 --> 00:57:44,056
- So...
- It was so popular.

1654
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:46,055
That made me really happy.

1655
00:57:46,056 --> 00:57:47,856
You drank with your friends
with that money.

1656
00:57:47,956 --> 00:57:49,756
- We drank makgeolli.
- They asked you to buy.

1657
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:53,466
He was one of the pretty boys.

1658
00:57:54,226 --> 00:57:55,566
Earlier today,

1659
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:58,372
Sang Uk shook your hands
when you said dried radish greens.

1660
00:57:58,396 --> 00:58:00,406
- He was scared of you.
- Why?

1661
00:58:00,906 --> 00:58:02,035
I know. It's the image you have.

1662
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:04,052
I know what you're like
because I've worked with you before.

1663
00:58:04,076 --> 00:58:06,046
As the youngest,
he was afraid of you.

1664
00:58:07,206 --> 00:58:09,875
(It overpowers the flavor
of the dried radish greens...)

1665
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,175
(Trash?)

1666
00:58:11,176 --> 00:58:12,186
(Dried radish greens.)

1667
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:14,186
Please continue.

1668
00:58:14,187 --> 00:58:17,886
(He got nervous after a handshake
after a joke.)

1669
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:19,955
I've only seen your characters.

1670
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:21,385
The characters Byung Eun played.

1671
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:24,226
You smiled while shaking my hand.

1672
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,466
And I suddenly got so scared.

1673
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:29,335
That happened.

1674
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:32,435
Does it actually happen
where due to your image,

1675
00:58:32,436 --> 00:58:34,106
- the neighbors go...
- Actually...

1676
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:36,005
Many people notice me...

1677
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:38,035
- from "Assassination."
- That's right.

1678
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:39,776
In the movie,

1679
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,945
I played a vicious person.

1680
00:58:42,946 --> 00:58:45,646
That must have left an impression
on many people.

1681
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:51,316
(Sorry.)

1682
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:53,026
(I'm so sorry.)

1683
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:57,925
(He made a strong impression
on people...)

1684
00:58:57,926 --> 00:59:00,495
(with the merciless character,
Captain Kawaguchi, )

1685
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:03,036
(in the movie "Assassination.")

1686
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:05,266
What's interesting is
that I starred...

1687
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:07,846
in something like
"Because This Is My First Life..."

1688
00:59:08,306 --> 00:59:10,775
and many other rom-coms, but...

1689
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:11,776
That's right.

1690
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:19,146
(In the rom-com series,
"Because This Is My First Life,")

1691
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:21,545
We drank beer together
while talking.

1692
00:59:21,546 --> 00:59:25,255
(he nailed Ma Sang Goo's character, )

1693
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:27,586
(who is a hopeless romantic
to women.)

1694
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:31,795
A strong character tends to leave
a stronger impression.

1695
00:59:31,796 --> 00:59:32,826
- Right.
- Yes.

1696
00:59:33,026 --> 00:59:34,566
So I think that's why. Here.

1697
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,265
(Shaking hands
to prevent misunderstanding)

1698
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:39,365
He has power in his eyes.

1699
00:59:39,366 --> 00:59:42,706
I'd rather appreciate it
if you yell at me.

1700
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:46,175
By the way, some actors
have a face...

1701
00:59:46,176 --> 00:59:48,446
that calls only
for a good character.

1702
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:50,845
You just can't play a villain.

1703
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:52,315
- That's obvious.
- No one asks me to play that role.

1704
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:54,586
And you give off a powerful energy.

1705
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,955
- Anyone can see that.
- Yes.

1706
00:59:55,956 --> 00:59:57,485
He looks like
he'd throw a strong punch.

1707
00:59:57,486 --> 01:00:00,255
As for Byung Eun,
he has a good person's image.

1708
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,155
- But also a seriously...
- He has both images.

1709
01:00:03,156 --> 01:00:05,026
- Scary image.
- That's really good.

1710
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,495
Sometimes I improvise on the scene.

1711
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,736
When I watch that on TV,

1712
01:00:10,796 --> 01:00:13,266
sometimes I get chills
while watching myself.

1713
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:15,065
"I don't remember that."

1714
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:16,975
- That happens.
- I see.

1715
01:00:16,976 --> 01:00:19,446
It was because I was so zoned in
back then.

1716
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:22,175
I tied up the female character...

1717
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:25,786
and tried to treat her brutally.
After doing that,

1718
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:27,585
I went up to her before I knew it,
and said,

1719
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,016
"I'll see you in the afterlife."

1720
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:32,356
I said that even before I knew it.

1721
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:33,526
That's chilling.

1722
01:00:34,156 --> 01:00:35,485
I said,
"I'll see you in the afterlife,"

1723
01:00:35,486 --> 01:00:38,456
and the script supervisors
near the monitors went...

1724
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:41,165
(Terrified)

1725
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,966
- I was like...
- That's chilling.

1726
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:47,505
(The scene the script supervisors
found chilling)

1727
01:00:47,506 --> 01:00:48,536
Naomi.

1728
01:00:50,136 --> 01:00:51,436
When you go to the other world,

1729
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,006
say hello to Yukiko.

1730
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:01,345
(A chilling line he improvised)

1731
01:01:01,346 --> 01:01:02,555
When I'm zoned in,

1732
01:01:02,556 --> 01:01:05,055
I sometimes improvise things
I didn't expect.

1733
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:08,956
When I play the villain, it gives me
an incredible sense of catharsis.

1734
01:01:09,226 --> 01:01:12,596
You do things
that are so atrocious and terrible,

1735
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,266
which you can't do
even for a second in reality.

1736
01:01:16,366 --> 01:01:17,795
Such as stabbing with a knife.

1737
01:01:17,796 --> 01:01:18,936
- Sorry.
- Don't be scared.

1738
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:20,906
(Startled)

1739
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:22,305
Why do you keep jumping?

1740
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:24,435
You always stab with your sword.
What's wrong with you?

1741
01:01:24,436 --> 01:01:26,645
- He's an actor.
- When he said "catharsis,"

1742
01:01:26,646 --> 01:01:29,015
- he could just say it.
- In front of a camera.

1743
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:31,246
But when he said it in a way he did,

1744
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,946
it got scary with the pronunciation.

1745
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:36,585
(A peace-making handshake)

1746
01:01:36,586 --> 01:01:38,715
Sometimes, we take emotional scenes,

1747
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:41,286
and the emotions are not that deep.

1748
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:43,826
But the director comes in and says,
"Quiet, everyone!"

1749
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:45,796
"We have an emotional scene today!"

1750
01:01:45,996 --> 01:01:47,666
- He does that.
- You're right.

1751
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,335
"Focus!"

1752
01:01:49,336 --> 01:01:51,296
"You have to cry
your eyes out here."

1753
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:53,005
- Really?
- As I enter, I think,

1754
01:01:53,006 --> 01:01:54,905
- What pressure!
- "It's not that serious."

1755
01:01:54,906 --> 01:01:55,906
(Feeling pressure)

1756
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:57,075
I say, "It's okay."

1757
01:01:57,076 --> 01:01:58,936
"Keep things as usual."

1758
01:01:59,076 --> 01:02:01,576
- He goes, "Silence!"
- They say, "Quiet!"

1759
01:02:02,276 --> 01:02:03,845
- It gives you pressure to cry.
- Yes.

1760
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,015
(Laughing)

1761
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:06,516
I had an emotional scene before.

1762
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:09,285
- It drives you crazy.
- The character gets angry...

1763
01:02:09,286 --> 01:02:12,216
to a point it makes him cry.
He becomes sad.

1764
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:15,455
While acting, I stumbled
and leaned against the wall.

1765
01:02:15,456 --> 01:02:18,255
I crouched
and tried to start crying.

1766
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,825
And the youngest female staff
was looking at her phone like this.

1767
01:02:20,826 --> 01:02:24,196
(Indifferent)

1768
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,666
(Laughing)

1769
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,106
- Gosh.
- It's true.

1770
01:02:27,436 --> 01:02:29,305
It does happen.

1771
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:31,106
- It's true.
- It's real.

1772
01:02:31,336 --> 01:02:33,705
Then I thought,
"What am I doing right now?"

1773
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:34,776
You know it, don't you?

1774
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:37,876
It's crazy.

1775
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:40,246
- Right.
- When she did that,

1776
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:46,356
I got determined to captivate her
with my performance.

1777
01:02:46,956 --> 01:02:48,255
(Giving an over-the-top performance)

1778
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:49,625
I went overboard.

1779
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:52,895
(Giving an over-the-top performance)

1780
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:55,326
(Still not interested)

1781
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:56,995
"I lost."

1782
01:02:56,996 --> 01:02:58,566
I regret it when I go back home.

1783
01:02:58,766 --> 01:03:00,735
- "I went overboard again."
- Right.

1784
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,265
The director goes,
"Why are you overacting?"

1785
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:03,275
Exactly.

1786
01:03:03,276 --> 01:03:06,245
When you heard what you said,
I could relate to it.

1787
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:07,345
- How?
- Really.

1788
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:08,906
- I have many fights.
- Yes.

1789
01:03:09,116 --> 01:03:11,975
I put all my energy,
and I lean on the cage.

1790
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:13,716
- Yes?
- And I'm panting.

1791
01:03:14,046 --> 01:03:15,955
When you fight a lot,
you can see the audience clearly.

1792
01:03:15,956 --> 01:03:17,476
I'm breathing hard.
And the audience...

1793
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:21,685
(The audience gives no reaction.)

1794
01:03:21,686 --> 01:03:23,295
- If they do that...
- That's understandable.

1795
01:03:23,296 --> 01:03:25,255
- Then I really think,
- Yours can be like that.

1796
01:03:25,256 --> 01:03:27,026
"What am I doing here?"

1797
01:03:27,696 --> 01:03:29,836
"Should I take a good blow
and lose?"

1798
01:03:30,736 --> 01:03:33,065
- Seriously.
- Your fight can be boring.

1799
01:03:33,066 --> 01:03:34,906
"Is that what you want?"

1800
01:03:35,266 --> 01:03:38,105
Dong Hyun, in the future,

1801
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,545
- if you were to act...
- He can't do it.

1802
01:03:39,546 --> 01:03:41,376
When you fight,

1803
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:42,875
- you wear underpants only.
- Just the underpants.

1804
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:44,575
You'd feel less embarrassed
when acting.

1805
01:03:44,576 --> 01:03:46,745
- But he...
- That's not true.

1806
01:03:46,746 --> 01:03:48,215
He can strip down to panties,

1807
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,686
but he needs brand names on them.

1808
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:52,686
From my sponsorship.

1809
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:55,655
Something like G Chicken.

1810
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:56,825
(Laughing)

1811
01:03:56,826 --> 01:03:58,026
His sponsors.

1812
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:01,765
Chicken...
There were many food places,

1813
01:04:01,766 --> 01:04:04,666
such as gamjatang.
I had lots of them.

1814
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:08,006
J Gamjatang.

1815
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:10,176
Yes. Gamjatang.

1816
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:11,735
I had many of them.

1817
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:14,346
- H Chicken.
- Yes. Chickens.

1818
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:17,616
After listening
to the four experienced actors,

1819
01:04:17,946 --> 01:04:20,046
I could see
how the scenes were taken.

1820
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:22,656
- Do we play a game for this?
- Yes.

1821
01:04:23,156 --> 01:04:25,286
It's 92 dollars and 10 cents
for the desserts.

1822
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:27,656
- Let's hand our fate over.
- Take out your credit cards.

1823
01:04:27,856 --> 01:04:28,925
Let's ask the owner...

1824
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:31,055
- to come and grab a card.
- Okay.

1825
01:04:31,056 --> 01:04:32,565
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,

1826
01:04:32,566 --> 01:04:33,965
and the winner decides the order
of the cards.

1827
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:35,365
- Yes.
- Okay.

1828
01:04:35,366 --> 01:04:36,366
We have to play it.

1829
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:38,665
- Okay. Take out your cards.
- I can't show my card to them.

1830
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,666
Take them out.

1831
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,265
(First,
they gather the credit cards.)

1832
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:43,735
It has to be color coordinated.

1833
01:04:43,736 --> 01:04:44,805
Rock-paper-scissors.

1834
01:04:44,806 --> 01:04:46,245
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Sang Uk should pay.

1835
01:04:46,246 --> 01:04:47,645
The three of us will play it
and do it again with you.

1836
01:04:47,646 --> 01:04:48,646
The three of you do it.

1837
01:04:48,647 --> 01:04:50,415
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1838
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,475
- Pick the winner.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1839
01:04:51,476 --> 01:04:53,315
Rock-paper-scissors.

1840
01:04:53,316 --> 01:04:54,345
- Okay.
- We just need to pick the winner.

1841
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:55,816
- I lost.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1842
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,385
- Okay.
- I get to decide.

1843
01:04:57,386 --> 01:04:58,955
- You choose the order of the six?
- Put them here,

1844
01:04:58,956 --> 01:05:00,155
starting from this side.

1845
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:01,156
Okay.

1846
01:05:02,256 --> 01:05:04,355
Let's see.

1847
01:05:04,356 --> 01:05:05,426
I think...

1848
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:08,296
I'll put mine at the end.

1849
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:10,396
- You'll follow the order I pick.
- Sure.

1850
01:05:11,696 --> 01:05:13,005
Gosh. The word Korean pops up.

1851
01:05:13,006 --> 01:05:14,236
(After placing the cards...)

1852
01:05:14,436 --> 01:05:15,835
Don't touch them from now on.

1853
01:05:15,836 --> 01:05:17,875
I'll say, "Please take one card..."

1854
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:19,545
- "and pay with it."
- Okay.

1855
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:21,445
We'll keep quiet.

1856
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:22,875
- I'm the only one talking.
- Okay.

1857
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:23,945
Excuse me.

1858
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:25,946
- We'll pay now.
- Okay.

1859
01:05:26,286 --> 01:05:29,715
We'll pay with one of these cards.

1860
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:30,816
Please pick one.

1861
01:05:32,826 --> 01:05:35,002
- Please give it some thought.
- Please give it some thought.

1862
01:05:35,026 --> 01:05:36,555
Perhaps it'll be the one you like.

1863
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:41,166
(Their fate is
in the employee's hands.)

1864
01:05:42,426 --> 01:05:44,566
(Will it be his card?)

1865
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:48,066
(Will it be his card?)

1866
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:51,758
We'll pay with one of these cards.

1867
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:53,028
Please pick one.

1868
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,699
Please give it some thought.

1869
01:05:54,899 --> 01:05:57,045
- Please give it some thought.
- Please give it some thought.

1870
01:05:57,069 --> 01:05:58,668
Perhaps it'll be the one you like.

1871
01:05:58,669 --> 01:06:03,369
(Their fate is
in the employee's hands.)

1872
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:06,709
(Will it be his card?)

1873
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,549
(Will it be his card?)

1874
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:17,418
(It's Sang Uk's card!)

1875
01:06:17,419 --> 01:06:18,748
Sang Uk's card got chosen.

1876
01:06:18,749 --> 01:06:20,719
(It's Sang Uk's card!)

1877
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:22,458
All right. It's a match.

1878
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:24,259
I mean...

1879
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:27,729
- Really?
- Why did you pick this card?

1880
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,769
I just liked the purple color.

1881
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:32,328
- Do you like purple?
- Yes.

1882
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:33,398
His card is purple.

1883
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:35,838
Hey, even the wall is purple.

1884
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,039
You're right.

1885
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:39,908
What's going on today?

1886
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:42,209
Sang Uk, please go and pay.

1887
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:44,178
- I guess today isn't my day.
- He'll receive...

1888
01:06:44,179 --> 01:06:45,449
- the penalty.
- He's popular.

1889
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:48,348
(He's close to the penalty
as he has paid 3 times in a row.)

1890
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:49,988
Thank you. We enjoyed the food.

1891
01:06:49,989 --> 01:06:51,489
Okay. Thank you.

1892
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:52,818
(Total: 92.10 dollars)

1893
01:06:52,819 --> 01:06:54,019
(Sad)

1894
01:06:54,419 --> 01:06:55,758
Thank you for the food.

1895
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:56,788
(Thank you, Sang Uk.)

1896
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:59,258
- You look so down.
- I'm okay.

1897
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:00,398
Desserts equal France.

1898
01:07:00,399 --> 01:07:01,459
And France equals fencing.

1899
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:03,228
(The miraculous syllogism
is complete.)

1900
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,698
(Desserts equal France equals
fencing.)

1901
01:07:04,699 --> 01:07:05,769
It was very expensive.

1902
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,268
- My goodness.
- A face-off.

1903
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:10,438
Sang Uk.

1904
01:07:10,439 --> 01:07:11,909
Where are we going for dinner?

1905
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:13,208
For dinner,

1906
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,508
I looked up some places.

1907
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:16,449
We're only going to one place,
right?

1908
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:17,678
We'll go there...

1909
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:18,948
and eat together.

1910
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:19,949
(The changed rule will be applied
from today onward.)

1911
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,018
(All of them will enjoy DMR
in one place.)

1912
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:22,218
So,

1913
01:07:22,219 --> 01:07:23,818
Seorae Village is known...

1914
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:26,048
for authentic French cuisine.

1915
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:28,989
Thus, we'll go
to a French restaurant.

1916
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,369
(They'll enjoy food at a restaurant
with the stylish French vibes.)

1917
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:38,868
We'll go to a French restaurant.

1918
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:39,898
An authentic one.

1919
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:42,039
(Seorae Village DMR, French cuisine)

1920
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,168
Since there are six of us...

1921
01:07:44,169 --> 01:07:45,408
If it's 100 dollars per person,
the total will be 600 dollars.

1922
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:46,839
The total will be big.

1923
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,909
Let me ask you a question.

1924
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,478
Will we play a game by ourselves...

1925
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:52,078
- to decide who pays?
- What will happen?

1926
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,079
Will that person pay for everything?

1927
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,678
If you succeed in the group mission,

1928
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:57,049
the production crew will pay
for dinner.

1929
01:07:57,149 --> 01:07:59,518
- It's against the production crew.
- We might avoid paying.

1930
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:01,765
- It's against the production crew.
- All of us might avoid it.

1931
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:03,628
We'll be a team.

1932
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,058
- Okay.
- Let's eat some French cuisine.

1933
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:06,458
- Let's go.
- French.

1934
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,358
- Let's eat and see.
- Okay.

1935
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:09,359
(They go to the French restaurant
to eat dinner!)

1936
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,600
- "Let's eat and see" is funny.
- Yes. Let's eat and see.

1937
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:14,999
Is this the main section?

1938
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:16,439
Yes. This is where...

1939
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:17,708
many restaurants open.

1940
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,269
- Do you see the passing cars?
- Yes.

1941
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:20,508
The buildings...

1942
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:22,679
on either side of the uphill road
have many stores.

1943
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,349
The road.

1944
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:27,318
I haven't been
to the main section in a long while.

1945
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:28,319
Right?

1946
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,425
(They enter Seorae Village,
little France inside Seoul.)

1947
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:32,019
Gosh, this neighborhood has...

1948
01:08:32,389 --> 01:08:34,289
many restaurants
with delicious food.

1949
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:37,059
What? Is this the place?

1950
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:39,058
That place sells lamb skewers.

1951
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:40,828
- Apparently, it's here.
- That place sells lamb skewers.

1952
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:41,998
Lamb skewers.

1953
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:43,328
Is it upstairs?

1954
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:45,369
- What?
- Is that the restaurant?

1955
01:08:46,129 --> 01:08:47,768
- Then...
- Is there no sign...

1956
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:50,238
- on the first floor?
- No.

1957
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:51,708
- You can't come unless you know.
- Really?

1958
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:53,508
- You have to know that it's there.
- How did you find it?

1959
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,308
I'm scared already.

1960
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:56,408
(From the outside, they aren't sure
that it's a restaurant.)

1961
01:08:56,409 --> 01:08:57,449
This is...

1962
01:08:57,879 --> 01:08:59,719
(Today's one and only DMR)

1963
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,549
(France inside your mouth)

1964
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:07,719
(Gosh, it's so delicious!)

1965
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:10,858
(It's a small restaurant
that's all over social media.)

1966
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:11,859
(Red meat of France)

1967
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,898
(Seafood of France)

1968
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,059
(White meat of France)

1969
01:09:14,499 --> 01:09:17,399
(Is this cooking or art?)

1970
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:20,569
(The quintessential French cuisine
you can taste in Seorae Village)

1971
01:09:21,099 --> 01:09:24,208
(DMR, French cuisine)

1972
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:25,768
This will be a good option.

1973
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:27,479
There's salad.

1974
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:29,379
Pan-fried scallops.

1975
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:31,748
- It's nice.
- I like Iberico pork.

1976
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:33,248
Foie gras pasta sounds good.

1977
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:34,848
- Is foie gras on the menu?
- Yes.

1978
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:36,918
Here it is. I want to eat it.

1979
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:38,988
It's 3 of the 1 delicacies
of the world, right?

1980
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:40,188
- One of the three delicacies.
- I see.

1981
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,309
One of the three delicacies.

1982
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:44,128
- Did you say, "Shredded squid?"
- Delicacies of the world.

1983
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:45,158
No.

1984
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:46,228
Is this a store
that sells side dishes?

1985
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,729
- I'm sorry.
- For a second...

1986
01:09:48,329 --> 01:09:49,998
I was in a hurry.

1987
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,329
I was fascinated by the menu.

1988
01:09:51,869 --> 01:09:52,938
Let's ask the owner.

1989
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,538
- Sir.
- Sir.

1990
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:55,798
- All right.
- Hello.

1991
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:57,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

1992
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:58,869
(Owner, Kim Sung Mo)

1993
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:59,878
He's the owner.

1994
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:02,238
- For how long have you run it?
- I'm in my seventh year.

1995
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,408
- The seventh year?
- In the same location?

1996
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:04,948
- Yes.
- By the way,

1997
01:10:04,949 --> 01:10:06,278
how did you open a restaurant here?

1998
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:08,818
I wanted to make French cuisine
Koreans would like.

1999
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:10,388
Did you major...

2000
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:11,418
- in French cuisine?
- Yes.

2001
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,288
- I see.
- Judging by your accent,

2002
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:14,659
you must've lived in France.

2003
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:15,888
For a short while, yes.

2004
01:10:15,889 --> 01:10:16,988
- For how long?
- If you know French...

2005
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:18,949
- Say something in French.
- A little over a year.

2006
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:20,528
Thank you very much.

2007
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:22,605
(He pronounces the phrase like
"Stir-fried anchovies.")

2008
01:10:22,629 --> 01:10:24,168
(Laughing)

2009
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:25,599
His confidence level dropped.

2010
01:10:26,499 --> 01:10:28,369
Please give us stir-fried anchovies.

2011
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:30,209
His confidence level dropped.

2012
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,539
Seriously,
his confidence level dropped.

2013
01:10:32,609 --> 01:10:33,938
- I'm sorry.
- His French skills...

2014
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:35,338
- disappeared.
- He didn't understand me.

2015
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:36,679
Seriously.

2016
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:38,178
- You know,
- Okay.

2017
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:39,179
(It's time to order food for real.)

2018
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,078
we want to order salad, pasta,

2019
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:43,288
seafood, and meat.

2020
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:45,448
- We want to enjoy a variety.
- Seriously.

2021
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,918
We'll order
one tajarin cream pasta...

2022
01:10:46,919 --> 01:10:49,058
- and one octopus oil pasta.
- Okay.

2023
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:50,189
- Good.
- One of each.

2024
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:51,658
Let's order pulpo.

2025
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:53,528
- We'll also order one pulpo,
- Okay.

2026
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:55,498
One Iberico steak,
one confit of duck,

2027
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:57,898
and one beef steak.

2028
01:10:57,899 --> 01:10:59,498
Is there a dish...

2029
01:10:59,499 --> 01:11:00,968
that's a must-have...

2030
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:03,309
in your opinion?

2031
01:11:03,339 --> 01:11:04,768
Among the salad options,

2032
01:11:04,769 --> 01:11:07,508
Nicoise salad and Lyonnaise salad
are the most popular.

2033
01:11:07,509 --> 01:11:08,609
I see.

2034
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:10,448
I think you chose well.

2035
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:12,009
- I think you got everything.
- I see.

2036
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:13,778
- All right. I'll prepare them.
- That'll be our order.

2037
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:15,349
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2038
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:17,148
So far, the total is
about 300 dollars.

2039
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,788
(They finish ordering in a breeze.)

2040
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:20,518
Let's win the group mission.

2041
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:21,588
You know,

2042
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:23,258
we're sitting at the table
as a team.

2043
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:24,289
- It's nice.
- Seriously.

2044
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,058
- I don't know what the mission is,
- It's nice.

2045
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:27,958
But we have the brainy one...

2046
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,829
- and the strong one.
- Good.

2047
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:31,529
Get ready to take off your pants.

2048
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,468
- His pants?
- It won't be easy.

2049
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:35,069
- Yes. If it comes down to that...
- Yes.

2050
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:36,638
- Gamjatang?
- Yes.

2051
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:37,909
(Gamjatang?)

2052
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:41,008
(Will he win the group event
thanks to the sponsor?)

2053
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,548
(Gamjatang)

2054
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:46,108
A gamjatang restaurant
was your sponsor.

2055
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:47,248
What did it do for you?

2056
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,848
Were you allowed to eat there...

2057
01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:50,548
- for free?
- It wasn't like that.

2058
01:11:50,549 --> 01:11:52,218
The thing is, UFC only pays...

2059
01:11:52,219 --> 01:11:54,318
for the player and the second one,

2060
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,529
the cornerman.

2061
01:11:57,559 --> 01:11:59,329
They pay for four days at the hotel.

2062
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:02,328
But since you need two weeks
to adjust to the time zone,

2063
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:04,029
food expenses become hefty.

2064
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,298
- I see.
- So...

2065
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:07,699
I wasn't a very well-known fighter.

2066
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,808
- Each sponsor gave a small amount,
- That's right.

2067
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:11,608
And all of them went on my uniform.

2068
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,878
- I see.
- The accumulated money was used...

2069
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:15,379
for training abroad.

2070
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,708
At first,

2071
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:19,348
the sponsors didn't need to pay
a lot of money.

2072
01:12:19,349 --> 01:12:20,648
So the CEOs I talked to went,

2073
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:22,048
"Hey, Dong Hyun."

2074
01:12:22,049 --> 01:12:25,088
"Let's put the brand logo
on your uniform."

2075
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,118
So...

2076
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:27,419
my T-shirt kept getting longer.

2077
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:30,158
So I...

2078
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,658
- It'll be a dress in the end.
- Think about it.

2079
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:33,298
- Think about it. Seriously.
- The price differs...

2080
01:12:33,299 --> 01:12:34,498
- depending on the location.
- That's right.

2081
01:12:34,499 --> 01:12:36,928
The chest area is the most visible,
so it's expensive.

2082
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:37,929
That's the chest area.

2083
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,468
As for the shorts,

2084
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:41,298
the front and back areas
are expensive.

2085
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:42,419
Is the front area expensive?

2086
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:43,938
I threw my opponents a lot,

2087
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:45,179
so the back area was expensive.

2088
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:47,638
You grabbed onto the back.

2089
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:48,978
You know,

2090
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:50,248
- here is the thing.
- That's incredible.

2091
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:52,208
Seriously, I had to do...

2092
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:53,418
the calculations.

2093
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:54,948
While it was important
to focus on the match...

2094
01:12:54,949 --> 01:12:56,748
- It's a necessary step.
- If a group of 4 to 5 people...

2095
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:57,749
go abroad a month ahead,

2096
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,689
food expenses reach
over 10,000 dollars.

2097
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:02,918
But UFC...

2098
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:05,058
doesn't cover such expenses.

2099
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:06,358
So I had to show the brand logo...

2100
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:07,698
for the smallest help we got.

2101
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:09,699
- That's right.
- I haven't revealed this anywhere.

2102
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:10,898
(Curious)

2103
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:12,028
The logos go on the front...

2104
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:13,368
and back of the uniform.

2105
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,099
Then there are banners.

2106
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:18,038
The team brings rolled-up posters...

2107
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:19,538
and hang them up when
the fighter is being introduced.

2108
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:20,909
They unroll them and hang them up.

2109
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,308
I stood there.

2110
01:13:22,309 --> 01:13:23,448
(This is interesting.)

2111
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:24,878
When they introduced me,

2112
01:13:24,879 --> 01:13:27,318
there were banners behind me.

2113
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,248
I ended up hiding some of them
by standing there, right?

2114
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:31,789
I checked the screen...

2115
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:34,089
and moved around like this...

2116
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,319
- to show all the banners.
- I see.

2117
01:13:36,529 --> 01:13:37,689
(Moving)

2118
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:40,028
- A B-roll will be added.
- Also,

2119
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:41,298
when I win the match,

2120
01:13:41,299 --> 01:13:43,098
they go, "Hey, Kim Dong Hyun."

2121
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:44,398
I turned around...

2122
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,428
- like this.
- I see.

2123
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:47,469
- You showed the brand logos.
- I made them visible.

2124
01:13:47,599 --> 01:13:49,569
- You know...
- One time, I wore a beanie.

2125
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:51,238
When I wore a beanie, I did this.

2126
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,308
You showed the logo.

2127
01:13:52,309 --> 01:13:53,709
(He succeeded in showing the logo.)

2128
01:13:53,839 --> 01:13:55,938
I showed the logo.

2129
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:58,139
(Thanks to the sponsors,
the current Cicada Kim exists.)

2130
01:13:58,209 --> 01:13:59,378
(As they talk,
the first dish appears!)

2131
01:13:59,379 --> 01:14:00,849
- What?
- It's here.

2132
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:02,279
- Gosh.
- It's Nicoise salad.

2133
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:04,789
- Nicoise salad.
- Nicoise salad.

2134
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:07,358
- It looks so pretty.
- Nice.

2135
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,818
Here's the salad dressing.

2136
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,258
(It contains grilled salmon.)

2137
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:11,359
Grilled salmon.

2138
01:14:12,559 --> 01:14:14,898
It could be a meal in and of itself.

2139
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:16,175
(It contains fresh vegetables
and olives.)

2140
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,328
How can a salad be so luxurious?

2141
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,639
(Nicoise salad contains
the Mediterranean Sea of Nice.)

2142
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:22,598
- Is this Lyonnaise salad?
- Yes, it's Lyonnaise salad.

2143
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:23,709
Lyon.

2144
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:24,769
What's this?

2145
01:14:24,809 --> 01:14:26,108
It's called terrine.

2146
01:14:26,109 --> 01:14:27,708
It's a traditional French dish.

2147
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:29,948
- It's a cold pork dish.
- Oh, my.

2148
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:31,949
It's like the Korean cold pork.

2149
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,178
(Lyonnaise salad)

2150
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:34,448
(Being a landlocked city, Lyon
is advanced in meat processing.)

2151
01:14:34,449 --> 01:14:36,009
(People in Lyon eat terrine
with salad.)

2152
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,518
Is it something like
the French head meat?

2153
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:39,589
- Yes.
- Cold pork.

2154
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:40,719
Okay.

2155
01:14:42,459 --> 01:14:44,588
I think we can eat it as it is.

2156
01:14:44,589 --> 01:14:45,589
All the ingredients are mixed.

2157
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:46,659
So...

2158
01:14:46,759 --> 01:14:48,259
I think they used Gamdongran.

2159
01:14:48,599 --> 01:14:51,069
(Do you mean the eggs they sell
at convenience stores?)

2160
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:53,269
I'll hold it in place.

2161
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:55,939
(Impressed)

2162
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:59,168
(The yolk flows out gently
from the soft-boiled egg.)

2163
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:00,638
It isn't Gamdongran.

2164
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:02,378
- I'm impressed.
- Yes.

2165
01:15:02,379 --> 01:15:03,379
(Just impressed)

2166
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,979
(They enjoy the taste of Lyon
in Seoul.)

2167
01:15:08,549 --> 01:15:09,619
(Fresh)

2168
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:12,889
The doneness is perfect.

2169
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:14,989
This salad is tasty.

2170
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,989
(This time, he tries a bite
of the French head meat.)

2171
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:22,599
(How does it taste?)

2172
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:25,429
(Eating)

2173
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:27,799
Is there a mushroom inside?

2174
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:30,069
I think there are
peppercorns inside.

2175
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:31,469
You bite into them.

2176
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:34,108
(Vegetables and peppercorns
bring out the texture of meat.)

2177
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:35,878
Byung Eun, try the cold pork.

2178
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:36,879
(He hands it over
to Byung Eun, the gourmet.)

2179
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,679
It's something I haven't had before.

2180
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:42,249
(He takes a bite of terrine.)

2181
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:45,349
- It's to die for.
- Do you like the black ones?

2182
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:46,519
Right?

2183
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:49,188
- There are peppercorns, right?
- Yes.

2184
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:51,035
(The texture of meat and peppercorns
creates a lovely harmony.)

2185
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:53,229
I'd eat a salad like this every day.

2186
01:15:55,959 --> 01:15:57,169
Let's mix them gently.

2187
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:00,499
- How is broccoli so pretty?
- I mean...

2188
01:16:01,499 --> 01:16:04,439
(He eats salmon first.)

2189
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:07,709
(He eats vegetables as well.)

2190
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,579
(Dong Hyun also tries a bite
of salmon.)

2191
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:13,319
Grilled salmon is so nice.

2192
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:15,818
Grilled salmon is so nice.
It doesn't smell fishy.

2193
01:16:15,819 --> 01:16:17,748
(Tender salmon and
crunchy vegetables match perfectly.)

2194
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:20,918
Grilled salmon goes well with salad.

2195
01:16:20,919 --> 01:16:23,859
- Yes.
- I feel like I'm becoming healthy.

2196
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,759
- Is this white broccoli?
- Yes.

2197
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:28,728
There was another name for it.
Cauliflower.

2198
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:31,089
(Despite similarities, cauliflower
has a different texture.)

2199
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,529
- Cauliflower.
- Cauliflower.

2200
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:34,369
It works up your appetite.

2201
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:39,468
- Gosh, that's...
- What's that?

2202
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,538
- It's duck confit.
- What's this?

2203
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:41,578
- Duck confit.
- It's like an oriental duck dish.

2204
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:44,209
- Confit?
- Duck confit.

2205
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:48,279
(Duck that's sous-vided in oil
gets grilled in the oven once more.)

2206
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:51,018
(The outside is crispy...)

2207
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:53,489
(and the inside is tender.)

2208
01:16:54,259 --> 01:16:58,359
(French grilled duck, duck confit)

2209
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:01,959
(Impressed)

2210
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,298
It's a proper dish.

2211
01:17:03,299 --> 01:17:05,628
- It looks crispy.
- Totally.

2212
01:17:05,629 --> 01:17:06,969
(Carving the duck)

2213
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:09,069
It's a slab of meat.

2214
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:11,608
There's so much to eat.

2215
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:12,838
(There's thick meat
inside the crispy skin.)

2216
01:17:12,839 --> 01:17:14,039
I didn't imagine such a thing.

2217
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:17,248
I finished carving the duck.

2218
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:18,449
(The carving process is over.)

2219
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:21,419
- Try the duck confit.
- Okay.

2220
01:17:22,749 --> 01:17:24,818
When you carve the meat,

2221
01:17:24,819 --> 01:17:27,459
- it's so juicy inside.
- Yes.

2222
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:32,089
(It'll taste better
if I eat it with my hands.)

2223
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:33,699
It smells amazing.

2224
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:36,899
(Impressed)

2225
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,898
She told us to eat it with this.

2226
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:40,199
- Right.
- I should've known.

2227
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:42,238
(I knew something was missing.)

2228
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,938
When you eat duck,

2229
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:46,979
you always get mustard.

2230
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:49,779
I thought it was missing
because it was French cuisine.

2231
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:54,079
It's definitely mustard.
Look at the color.

2232
01:17:54,919 --> 01:17:56,019
It isn't mustard.

2233
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:58,689
- Isn't it mustard?
- No.

2234
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:01,658
It totally looks like mustard.

2235
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:03,059
Isn't it mustard?

2236
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:05,859
(The French chef who is serious
about cooking...)

2237
01:18:06,489 --> 01:18:09,999
(made it with a lot of care.)

2238
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:11,969
(The essence of kabocha)

2239
01:18:11,999 --> 01:18:14,868
- It's kabocha. It's very sweet.
- What?

2240
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:16,538
- It suits the dish.
- Wait. Is it kabocha?

2241
01:18:16,539 --> 01:18:17,539
Yes.

2242
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,669
(Curious)

2243
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:21,278
How fascinating. Kabocha?

2244
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,409
(How strange)

2245
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:25,879
(How does it taste?)

2246
01:18:26,349 --> 01:18:28,718
It's so tasty. Hurry up and eat it.

2247
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:29,779
Okay.

2248
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,149
It's very tender.

2249
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:36,689
- It tastes amazing with the skin.
- The skin looks delicious.

2250
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,028
The skin is crispy and very nice.

2251
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:42,069
(The harmony of the crispy skin
and the tender meat)

2252
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:46,098
What's this?

2253
01:18:46,099 --> 01:18:47,538
The meat can be a bit dry,

2254
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:50,339
but the pureed kabocha
turns it creamy.

2255
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,708
(It entertains the eyes...)

2256
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:56,909
(as well as the mouth.)

2257
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,149
(Impressed)

2258
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:03,418
You know, I don't know
how to put it.

2259
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:06,318
But it feels luxurious.

2260
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:08,388
I can feel that the chef put
a lot of thought into it.

2261
01:19:08,389 --> 01:19:09,788
This isn't a common dish.

2262
01:19:09,789 --> 01:19:11,389
Not many restaurants cook duck
like this.

2263
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:16,259
(The exotic French dish is new.)

2264
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:17,968
- It's so fascinating.
- It's pulpo.

2265
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,098
It's pulpo.

2266
01:19:19,099 --> 01:19:20,869
(What's the next dish?)

2267
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:24,509
I'm the most excited about this one.

2268
01:19:25,539 --> 01:19:28,438
There are grilled vegetables
and pureed kabocha.

2269
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,508
Please cut it up
and dip it in the puree.

2270
01:19:30,509 --> 01:19:31,779
(Pulpo)

2271
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:35,179
(Boiled octopus
that's marinated in the sauce...)

2272
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:38,749
(gets cooked again
so that the surface turns crispy.)

2273
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:43,119
(A special octopus dish
with vegetable accompaniments)

2274
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,128
- The knife goes in easily.
- Right?

2275
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:46,729
Yes. The knife goes in easily.

2276
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:48,098
It's incredible.

2277
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:49,729
It doesn't feel like an octopus.

2278
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:51,029
- Really?
- Yes.

2279
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,429
I can't wait.

2280
01:19:53,099 --> 01:19:54,139
Try it.

2281
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:56,699
(He dips a piece of octopus
in the pureed kabocha.)

2282
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:02,679
(When you eat
the chewy and tender octopus, )

2283
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:04,549
(you can't help but exclaim.)

2284
01:20:05,649 --> 01:20:07,278
The texture is so tender.

2285
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:08,679
- The texture...
- Seriously.

2286
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:12,618
I looked forward to this dish.
It exceeds my expectations by far.

2287
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:14,035
(The tender texture
exceeds his expectations.)

2288
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,818
- Try it.
- Pulpo.

2289
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:16,958
Hurry up and try the pulpo.

2290
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:19,058
Hurry up. You need to dip it
in the sauce.

2291
01:20:19,059 --> 01:20:21,028
This one? It's the puree
we had earlier.

2292
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,159
- This one?
- Kabocha.

2293
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:28,138
(Byung Eun takes a bite as well.)

2294
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:29,269
(What?)

2295
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:32,209
(It's tasty, right?)

2296
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:35,179
The chef of this restaurant
is very talented.

2297
01:20:35,339 --> 01:20:38,108
You can't eat overcooked octopus
because it's too tough.

2298
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:39,549
- It's so tender.
- This is...

2299
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:41,329
- Would you like this one?
- It's so tender.

2300
01:20:41,449 --> 01:20:44,549
The sauce that's seeped
into the surface makes it salty.

2301
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:45,819
It's so nice.

2302
01:20:46,449 --> 01:20:48,688
It's neither tough...

2303
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:51,489
nor overly tender.
The texture is just right.

2304
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:54,658
(Another octopus enters.)

2305
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,229
- It's octopus oil pasta.
- Totally.

2306
01:20:56,829 --> 01:20:59,099
- Is this the signature dish?
- Yes.

2307
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:04,839
(Chewy octopus
and a heap of savory cheese)

2308
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,339
Even the presentation is different.

2309
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:13,849
I don't know if it's because this is
my first French restaurant.

2310
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:15,995
In any case, it's a dish
I've never seen before.

2311
01:21:16,019 --> 01:21:17,149
Every dish is new.

2312
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:19,119
The noodles are a bit...

2313
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,688
- They're unique.
- They remind me of Vietnamese...

2314
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:21,919
- Vietnamese noodles.
- Yes.

2315
01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:23,089
Pho noodles.

2316
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:25,389
- Vietnamese noodles.
- Let's stab it with a fork.

2317
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,498
Their dishes are so tasty.

2318
01:21:27,499 --> 01:21:28,999
(Mix the pasta with oil.)

2319
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:31,869
(Accompany a piece of octopus.)

2320
01:21:37,139 --> 01:21:38,308
(My goodness)

2321
01:21:38,309 --> 01:21:39,339
What's this?

2322
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,649
It isn't the texture I had in mind.

2323
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,318
How was the pasta boiled?
The strands are so thin.

2324
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:50,689
(What's the texture of the pasta?)

2325
01:21:52,089 --> 01:21:56,419
It tastes a bit like
it has been fried.

2326
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:59,758
It's a bit crunchy. You're right.

2327
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:03,128
You're right.
The pasta is a bit crunchy.

2328
01:22:03,129 --> 01:22:05,229
(This pasta has a crunchy texture.)

2329
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:08,769
(Since it's oil pasta,
a generous amount of oil is used.)

2330
01:22:08,999 --> 01:22:12,509
(Various vegetables get added
to accompany the dish.)

2331
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,979
(Then al dente pasta gets added.)

2332
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:21,749
(Then the pasta gets cooked fast
so that it remains al dente.)

2333
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:26,988
(Then the crunchy and tender texture
gets created.)

2334
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:28,019
The pasta is so unique.

2335
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:33,459
- The texture of this pasta is new.
- That's right.

2336
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:35,229
It's another dish.

2337
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:37,768
- It's pasta.
- It's tajarin cream pasta.

2338
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:40,328
It's topped
with button mushroom slices.

2339
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:41,498
- Button mushroom?
- Please mix them in.

2340
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:42,969
What kind of cream is this?

2341
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:44,738
It's so fascinating.

2342
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:47,379
(It doesn't look like cream pasta
at a glance.)

2343
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:51,209
(When you break the yolk
and mix the ingredients)

2344
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,679
It's hot.

2345
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:55,048
There's cream inside.

2346
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:58,949
(Cream pasta shows itself
with hot steam.)

2347
01:22:59,689 --> 01:23:02,419
I bet it's very tasty, Byung Eun.

2348
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:04,165
You know the taste
that makes you keep eating, right?

2349
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:06,789
Like the taste
of perilla oil makguksu.

2350
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:08,699
Eat it while it's hot.

2351
01:23:09,059 --> 01:23:10,329
Remove it.

2352
01:23:11,129 --> 01:23:16,099
(The taste you know is addictive.
(How does it taste?)

2353
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:20,809
(Savoring the taste)

2354
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:31,319
The ham is nice.

2355
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:34,058
- It's very thick, right?
- Yes.

2356
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:35,089
It's very thick.

2357
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:37,928
I thought it'd be like
any other cream pasta.

2358
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:40,328
Is it because of the yolk?

2359
01:23:40,329 --> 01:23:41,529
The sauce turned thicker.

2360
01:23:41,829 --> 01:23:45,169
The crunchy texture of raw mushrooms
makes this dish tasty.

2361
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:46,398
The aroma of mushrooms too.

2362
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,638
(Raw mushroom gives it
the crunchy texture.)

2363
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:49,045
All the dishes in this restaurant...

2364
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:50,968
(He takes another bite
since it's tasty.)

2365
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:53,669
- have unexpected flavors.
- My goodness.

2366
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,239
This dish...

2367
01:23:55,709 --> 01:23:58,109
- Guys, try this dish.
- Okay.

2368
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,649
- It's really tasty.
- It's unique.

2369
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:01,879
It's really unique.

2370
01:24:02,019 --> 01:24:03,149
Tae Hyun,

2371
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:06,189
this isn't enough
for the three of us.

2372
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:07,988
There wasn't a lot...

2373
01:24:07,989 --> 01:24:10,029
- from the start.
- Order a bowl of rice. Mix it in.

2374
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:12,088
That doesn't sound half bad.

2375
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,189
(He loves the joke.)

2376
01:24:13,759 --> 01:24:16,628
(Let's have a taste.)

2377
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:18,329
(Impressed)

2378
01:24:18,669 --> 01:24:20,999
(This is the taste we like.)

2379
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,399
- This is...
- It's tasty.

2380
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:26,438
Anyone in the world
will like this dish.

2381
01:24:26,439 --> 01:24:28,078
(Anyone in the world
will like this dish.)

2382
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:29,279
It's so different.

2383
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:31,509
(He loves it!)

2384
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,249
All the dishes in this restaurant...

2385
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:36,879
have unexpected flavors.

2386
01:24:37,349 --> 01:24:38,495
When you eat a dish, you go, "What?"

2387
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:43,319
(The French cuisine
is unfamiliar and special.)

2388
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,658
Right now,

2389
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,158
we just ordered and had
several main dishes.

2390
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:48,928
But actually, we shouldn't be
eating like this...

2391
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:50,228
- at places like these.
- Right.

2392
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:52,968
And people in France tend to
take much longer when they eat.

2393
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:54,999
- Right.
- Right. They take much longer.

2394
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:58,468
There was a time
when I trained in France...

2395
01:24:58,469 --> 01:24:59,909
- as a national team member.
- Right.

2396
01:25:00,169 --> 01:25:02,939
When the matches ended at 11:30am,

2397
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:05,009
the afternoon session
started at 4:30pm.

2398
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:06,879
Five hours were given for lunch.

2399
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:11,518
That was why we had lunch
for around two hours.

2400
01:25:11,519 --> 01:25:12,818
- Right.
- Right.

2401
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:15,458
The food here was supposed to be
eaten like that.

2402
01:25:15,459 --> 01:25:17,829
You might get hungry after the meal
if you eat like that.

2403
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:20,628
- It's time for dinner next.
- Many of the players...

2404
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:23,229
kept having energy bars
during training.

2405
01:25:23,629 --> 01:25:26,368
The food should be enjoyed slowly
with some wine.

2406
01:25:26,369 --> 01:25:27,538
- Nice and slow.
- Right.

2407
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,239
We weren't mature enough.

2408
01:25:31,539 --> 01:25:33,499
They would've never seen anyone
eat as fast as us.

2409
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:36,138
- After opening this restaurant.
- Without saying a word.

2410
01:25:36,139 --> 01:25:37,579
- Right.
- We just ate.

2411
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:41,048
It was our
first French meal together.

2412
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:42,148
Please pass us the bill.

2413
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:43,349
(It's time to check the bill.)

2414
01:25:43,419 --> 01:25:44,918
We got nine dishes,

2415
01:25:44,919 --> 01:25:46,849
four Cokes, and two bottles of beer.

2416
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:48,919
It's 375 dollars in total.

2417
01:25:49,459 --> 01:25:50,518
That's less than 400 dollars.

2418
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:52,079
- That's less than 400 dollars.
- Right.

2419
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:54,098
Gosh, 375 dollars?

2420
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:55,598
(That's still a lot of money.)

2421
01:25:55,599 --> 01:25:57,468
- The group game will begin.
- Right.

2422
01:25:57,469 --> 01:25:58,728
What must we do?

2423
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:00,799
If you succeed in the game
that we provide,

2424
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,868
the production crew will pay.

2425
01:26:02,869 --> 01:26:03,908
- Right.
- Right.

2426
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:05,268
If you fail,

2427
01:26:05,269 --> 01:26:06,908
one person will be picked
through the individual game...

2428
01:26:06,909 --> 01:26:09,208
and that person will pay.

2429
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:10,279
- Right.
- Okay.

2430
01:26:11,309 --> 01:26:13,249
The game that will be played...

2431
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:15,048
is called Line Up the Words.

2432
01:26:15,049 --> 01:26:16,248
Line Up the Words?

2433
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:17,319
LUW?

2434
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:19,049
- Line Up the Words?
- Yes.

2435
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:21,488
Gosh, this one is hard.

2436
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:23,688
- Right.
- You have to say...

2437
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:25,858
the word based on the words
we give to you...

2438
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,459
in a line and come back
to the first person.

2439
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:29,959
How many chances do we get?

2440
01:26:30,299 --> 01:26:32,329
You will have to make it...

2441
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:33,998
within three chances.

2442
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:37,239
Let's say we start from there.

2443
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,808
Of course, it is the hard...

2444
01:26:39,809 --> 01:26:42,108
for the last two to answer
after reaching up to here.

2445
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:44,078
- Right.
- But the hardest spot...

2446
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,109
is where I am at.

2447
01:26:45,149 --> 01:26:46,478
- You have to answer right away.
- From here,

2448
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:47,999
I have to answer
as soon as he answers.

2449
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:50,595
- Aren't I right?
- So you want a different spot?

2450
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:53,389
I'm wondering if it'll be
better for me to sit here.

2451
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:55,258
This is the hardest spot.

2452
01:26:55,259 --> 01:26:57,258
It's because...

2453
01:26:57,259 --> 01:26:58,689
- Fine.
- Gosh. As expected.

2454
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,528
(The eldest gives up the spot
for just one answer.)

2455
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:01,529
Gosh. As expected.

2456
01:27:01,929 --> 01:27:04,028
I shouldn't be sitting there.

2457
01:27:04,029 --> 01:27:06,529
If you still get it wrong
in that spot...

2458
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,369
That can't be helped.

2459
01:27:09,299 --> 01:27:11,538
Let's start. Let's do a chant first.

2460
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:12,969
- Okay.
- Okay.

2461
01:27:13,169 --> 01:27:15,339
Let's make the production crew
pay for us once.

2462
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:16,539
One, two, three.

2463
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,809
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2464
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:20,249
- Here's the topic.
- Okay.

2465
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:22,218
Names of countries...

2466
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:23,918
(First topic)

2467
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:25,559
- that are four Korean words long.
- Gosh.

2468
01:27:26,189 --> 01:27:28,388
- Are you serious?
- All right.

2469
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:30,189
- Let's be calm.
- I can't think of any.

2470
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,129
We'll start with Yi Kyung.

2471
01:27:32,989 --> 01:27:34,228
One, two, three.

2472
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:35,328
- Netherlands.
- It's over.

2473
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:37,029
- One, two, three.
- Ireland.

2474
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:38,699
One, two, three.

2475
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:39,768
Greenland.

2476
01:27:39,769 --> 01:27:41,099
One, two, three.

2477
01:27:42,769 --> 01:27:43,769
Incorrect!

2478
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,708
(One, two, three)

2479
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:49,379
- Incorrect!
- There's Republic of Korea!

2480
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,949
- They took two of my answers.
- Republic of Korea!

2481
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,848
- It wasn't that hard!
- Did you think of our answers?

2482
01:27:53,849 --> 01:27:55,348
- It wasn't hard.
- Netherlands...

2483
01:27:55,349 --> 01:27:56,718
and Iceland? What was it again?

2484
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,118
- Iceland?
- Ireland.

2485
01:27:58,119 --> 01:27:59,789
- That was hard.
- What about Thailand?

2486
01:28:00,589 --> 01:28:01,758
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2487
01:28:01,759 --> 01:28:03,158
So that is how
the game is played, right?

2488
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:05,628
- I see. Let's start the game.
- Right. Your first attempt...

2489
01:28:05,629 --> 01:28:06,858
(They fail with the first topic.)

2490
01:28:06,859 --> 01:28:07,928
- has been used.
- It would be great...

2491
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:08,958
if you could stay focused
a bit more.

2492
01:28:08,959 --> 01:28:10,358
Hold on. Where do you want to sit?

2493
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:11,705
You should switch seats, Byung Eun.

2494
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:13,129
It'll be the same wherever I go.

2495
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,868
- Are you sure? Move to the front.
- It's okay.

2496
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:17,968
- It's better to be at the front.
- What if I get it wrong there?

2497
01:28:17,969 --> 01:28:19,449
It's really better
to be at the front.

2498
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,079
Choose a seat that you want.

2499
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:22,629
Would you like to come here?

2500
01:28:23,139 --> 01:28:24,448
- That won't be a bad idea.
- Here.

2501
01:28:24,449 --> 01:28:25,608
- Seung Ho's seat? Okay.
- Okay.

2502
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:27,148
Where? Gosh.

2503
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:28,218
- There was a seat that you wanted.
- My pride won't allow me...

2504
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:29,279
to take the first seat.

2505
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:30,679
Okay.

2506
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:32,789
Gosh, it's really warm.

2507
01:28:33,519 --> 01:28:36,018
(Confused)

2508
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,989
- The topic has changed.
- Right.

2509
01:28:38,859 --> 01:28:40,359
(Let's stay focused.)

2510
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:41,998
Names of mixed-gender groups.

2511
01:28:41,999 --> 01:28:43,128
(Second topic,
names of mixed-gender groups)

2512
01:28:43,129 --> 01:28:44,228
Singers?

2513
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:45,298
- Singers.
- What?

2514
01:28:45,299 --> 01:28:47,198
- Mixed-gender groups?
- Mixed-gender groups?

2515
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,698
Groups that have
male and female members.

2516
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,869
- We will start with Tae Hyun.
- Mixed-gender groups.

2517
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:54,478
One, two, three.

2518
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:55,879
Chuli and Miae.

2519
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,409
One, two, three.

2520
01:28:57,649 --> 01:28:58,708
Roo'Ra.

2521
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:00,149
One, two, three.

2522
01:29:00,249 --> 01:29:01,279
Turtles.

2523
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,848
One, two, three.

2524
01:29:02,849 --> 01:29:03,919
COED SCHOOL.

2525
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,318
One, two, three.

2526
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,348
KOYOTE!

2527
01:29:06,349 --> 01:29:07,518
One, two, three.

2528
01:29:07,519 --> 01:29:08,588
Young Turks Club.

2529
01:29:08,589 --> 01:29:09,688
One, two, three.

2530
01:29:09,689 --> 01:29:10,689
UP.

2531
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:12,389
- One, two, three.
- Cool.

2532
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:14,059
One, two, three.

2533
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,829
- Incorrect!
- Hey!

2534
01:29:17,059 --> 01:29:19,568
(One, two, three)

2535
01:29:19,569 --> 01:29:21,939
(Incorrect!)

2536
01:29:22,099 --> 01:29:23,438
(Enraged)

2537
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:25,508
- Which groups are there?
- Gosh!

2538
01:29:25,509 --> 01:29:27,108
- We have reached so far.
- We were almost there.

2539
01:29:27,109 --> 01:29:28,578
- That was close.
- We have reached so far.

2540
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:30,208
I don't know a lot of groups
from the past.

2541
01:29:30,209 --> 01:29:31,209
Gosh!

2542
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,778
Was there a group
you were thinking of?

2543
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:34,579
- Which group were you thinking of?
- Space A.

2544
01:29:34,849 --> 01:29:37,218
Is ALLDAY PROJECT
a mixed-gender group?

2545
01:29:37,219 --> 01:29:38,219
You're right.

2546
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,688
- Oh, ALLDAY PROJECT!
- Right.

2547
01:29:39,689 --> 01:29:41,065
We would've made it
if he answered it.

2548
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,919
- You were thinking of Space A.
- Right.

2549
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:44,829
- Gosh, Sang Uk!
- Gosh!

2550
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:47,229
- Sang Uk could've...
- Sang Uk!

2551
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:49,459
- Is ALLDAY PROJECT right?
- Sang Uk!

2552
01:29:49,829 --> 01:29:51,229
Where are you going to go, Sang Uk?

2553
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:53,329
- Choose the seat that you want.
- Come here.

2554
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:54,439
I'll move to the front.

2555
01:29:55,999 --> 01:29:58,168
This game keeps making people
feel smaller.

2556
01:29:58,169 --> 01:29:59,638
(Sang Uk gets moved to the seat
for the weakest.)

2557
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:01,778
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's empty our thoughts.

2558
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:03,339
- Right.
- Let's do this calmly.

2559
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,848
If we lose again,
someone has to pay 400 dollars.

2560
01:30:05,849 --> 01:30:07,455
- Someone has to pay.
- It was 370 dollars.

2561
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:09,348
It's his first time here...

2562
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:10,749
and he's going through all of this.

2563
01:30:11,549 --> 01:30:12,619
(Snickering)

2564
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:14,459
Thank you so much.

2565
01:30:15,089 --> 01:30:16,118
Me?

2566
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,128
(I feel very sorry.)

2567
01:30:18,129 --> 01:30:20,289
It's been a while since
I've felt this sort of tension.

2568
01:30:20,389 --> 01:30:21,958
I'm serious. Just for this game.

2569
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:24,028
(It's just a game.)

2570
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:25,698
- Please tell us when you're ready.
- I'm ready.

2571
01:30:25,699 --> 01:30:26,699
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

2572
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,139
- I'm ready too.
- Let's go.

2573
01:30:29,069 --> 01:30:32,368
Names of vegetables that are
longer than three Korean words.

2574
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:33,938
(Names of vegetables that are
longer than three Korean words)

2575
01:30:33,939 --> 01:30:36,078
- Hold on.
- Three Korean words?

2576
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:37,708
Gosh, hold on.
This fell off the table.

2577
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:38,978
I have to pick this up
as it fell off the table.

2578
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:40,279
We'll start with Sang Uk.

2579
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:42,749
- One, two, three.
- Vegetables?

2580
01:30:42,879 --> 01:30:43,879
Cabbage.

2581
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,318
One, two, three.

2582
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:46,348
Broccoli.

2583
01:30:46,349 --> 01:30:47,489
One, two, three.

2584
01:30:47,959 --> 01:30:48,959
Tomato.

2585
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,819
- One, two, three.
- Cauliflower.

2586
01:30:50,889 --> 01:30:52,788
- One, two, three.
- Lettuce.

2587
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:54,199
One, two, three.

2588
01:30:54,629 --> 01:30:55,899
(Mumbling)

2589
01:30:57,029 --> 01:30:59,028
(Kim Dong Hyun is incorrect!)

2590
01:30:59,029 --> 01:31:00,098
What was that?

2591
01:31:00,099 --> 01:31:01,238
All of the ones I thought of
were already mentioned!

2592
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:04,709
I really thought of the tomato,
broccoli, and cauliflower.

2593
01:31:04,969 --> 01:31:06,238
- All of them were mentioned!
- Come on!

2594
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,638
I'm serious!

2595
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:09,008
- Wasn't that too harsh on me?
- Gosh.

2596
01:31:09,009 --> 01:31:11,048
- All of them were mentioned.
- Dong Hyun!

2597
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,155
What was I supposed to do
when all of them were mentioned?

2598
01:31:13,179 --> 01:31:15,825
- I had to think of more than three?
- There were surely a lot more.

2599
01:31:15,849 --> 01:31:17,178
- Gosh.
- No way!

2600
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:18,188
(Feeling resentful)

2601
01:31:18,189 --> 01:31:19,319
What was the point?

2602
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:21,588
(The Handsome Guys lose
the group match.)

2603
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:23,758
I was expecting us
to go past Dong Hyun.

2604
01:31:23,759 --> 01:31:26,588
But Dong Hyun has decided
to pay for all of us.

2605
01:31:26,589 --> 01:31:28,498
Gosh, Dong Hyun. Thank you.

2606
01:31:28,499 --> 01:31:30,028
(Why should I pay?)

2607
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:31,128
That was close though.

2608
01:31:31,129 --> 01:31:32,728
I can pay,

2609
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:35,239
but we have to follow the rules.

2610
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:37,609
- What do we do now?
- Do we get a quiz?

2611
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:41,078
I think we can play the same game
once again.

2612
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,079
- What?
- The person who gets it wrong...

2613
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,079
will pay for the meal?

2614
01:31:43,209 --> 01:31:44,378
- What does that mean?
- I see.

2615
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,149
- Hold on.
- But what if we all get it right?

2616
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:48,719
This is a battle for the seats then.

2617
01:31:50,549 --> 01:31:51,848
This is a battle for the seats.

2618
01:31:51,849 --> 01:31:53,218
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors...

2619
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:54,558
- to win the seats.
- I agree.

2620
01:31:54,559 --> 01:31:55,658
The winner chooses the seat?

2621
01:31:55,659 --> 01:31:56,788
- The winner will choose.
- Okay.

2622
01:31:56,789 --> 01:31:57,789
- Okay.
- All right.

2623
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:59,735
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2624
01:31:59,759 --> 01:32:01,505
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Until we get the winner.

2625
01:32:01,529 --> 01:32:03,298
Rock-paper-scissors.
Until we get the winner.

2626
01:32:03,299 --> 01:32:04,828
(You guys should've worked this hard
a while ago.)

2627
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:05,928
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

2628
01:32:05,929 --> 01:32:07,028
- I'm getting a cramp.
- Scissors.

2629
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:08,168
- Scissors.
- We got winners!

2630
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:09,268
- I'm getting a cramp.
- Scissors.

2631
01:32:09,269 --> 01:32:10,899
(Scissors)

2632
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:12,208
- Gosh!
- We got winners.

2633
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:13,238
Let's see.

2634
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:15,879
- Move away.
- He kept playing it late.

2635
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:18,479
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2636
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:20,309
Rock-paper-scissors.

2637
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:22,649
- Gosh.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2638
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:23,978
(Cheering)

2639
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:25,049
I'll stay here.

2640
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:26,448
- The first spot?
- Yes.

2641
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:27,809
- That's fine.
- Where will you go?

2642
01:32:28,119 --> 01:32:30,058
- You're in second place.
- Move away.

2643
01:32:30,059 --> 01:32:31,128
(Tae Hyun will move to
the 2nd spot.)

2644
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,288
- What about you, Seung Ho?
- Who is in third place?

2645
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:34,128
- These spots are fine.
- This is a good spot.

2646
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:35,829
- You 3 should get it sorted.
- It's us 3.

2647
01:32:36,059 --> 01:32:37,059
You three should get it sorted.

2648
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,605
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2649
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:39,698
(Dong Hyun places 4th right away.)

2650
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:40,699
- I won.
- It's just us two.

2651
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,468
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2652
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:43,868
(Fifth, sixth)

2653
01:32:43,869 --> 01:32:45,269
Please move away. I'll move here.

2654
01:32:45,939 --> 01:32:47,008
- What about you?
- Gosh.

2655
01:32:47,009 --> 01:32:49,609
(The seats for the individual game
have been decided.)

2656
01:32:49,909 --> 01:32:50,938
Gosh. It will be okay.

2657
01:32:50,939 --> 01:32:52,549
I have some data now.
It will be okay.

2658
01:32:52,809 --> 01:32:55,078
- It will be okay.
- I'm at a disadvantage.

2659
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:57,519
- What are you saying?
- What are you saying?

2660
01:32:57,649 --> 01:32:59,749
I'm terrible at these games.

2661
01:33:00,649 --> 01:33:01,759
Gosh.

2662
01:33:01,889 --> 01:33:05,189
There's no one else
that has sat here and there.

2663
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:07,328
- Well,
- "Here and there."

2664
01:33:07,329 --> 01:33:10,028
I stutter when I freeze up
all of a sudden.

2665
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:11,368
He was a fighter
that had to be the bravest.

2666
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:13,068
- Why is he whining so much?
- Gosh.

2667
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:14,498
Weren't you a fighter?

2668
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:16,639
- All right. Let's do this.
- Great.

2669
01:33:16,969 --> 01:33:19,138
Okay. Is it okay if I start
the final game?

2670
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:20,209
- Yes.
- Yes.

2671
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,139
- The Summer Games.
- The Summer Games?

2672
01:33:23,879 --> 01:33:25,279
The names of the sports.

2673
01:33:25,879 --> 01:33:27,409
You're at an advantage
with this one.

2674
01:33:28,549 --> 01:33:30,019
- I can't think of them.
- Okay.

2675
01:33:31,149 --> 01:33:32,489
- I'll start.
- All right.

2676
01:33:32,589 --> 01:33:34,318
- One, two, three.
- Fencing.

2677
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:35,918
- One, two, three.
- Soccer.

2678
01:33:35,919 --> 01:33:37,589
- One, two, three.
- Judo.

2679
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:39,659
- One, two, three.
- Athletics.

2680
01:33:39,829 --> 01:33:41,399
- One, two, three.
- Swimming.

2681
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:43,298
- One, two, three.
- Basketball.

2682
01:33:43,299 --> 01:33:44,468
One, two, three.

2683
01:33:44,469 --> 01:33:46,299
- Water polo.
- One, two, three.

2684
01:33:46,469 --> 01:33:47,499
Fencing.

2685
01:33:48,969 --> 01:33:50,939
- One, two, three.
- Fencing.

2686
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:52,439
- Yes!
- Yes!

2687
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,508
(I already said that one!)

2688
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:54,539
- Yes!
- Yes!

2689
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:56,239
(Cheering as if
he won the gold medal)

2690
01:33:56,879 --> 01:33:59,809
(We survived!)

2691
01:34:00,449 --> 01:34:02,949
(Byung Eun becomes the one
to pay for the meal.)

2692
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:05,388
Gosh, I was thinking so much.

2693
01:34:05,389 --> 01:34:06,718
- Same here.
- Same here.

2694
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,989
- I thought of four.
- I was thinking so much inside.

2695
01:34:09,289 --> 01:34:10,388
Why is fencing wrong?

2696
01:34:10,389 --> 01:34:11,605
- He mentioned it.
- I said that one.

2697
01:34:11,629 --> 01:34:13,458
- You did?
- He mentioned it earlier.

2698
01:34:13,459 --> 01:34:14,558
Gosh.

2699
01:34:14,559 --> 01:34:15,828
I was just thinking of sports
right after hearing the topic.

2700
01:34:15,829 --> 01:34:17,269
He wasn't able to hear
anything else.

2701
01:34:19,229 --> 01:34:20,628
- Byung Eun.
- Gosh, Byung Eun.

2702
01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:21,698
Will you be okay?

2703
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:22,868
- I'll be fine.
- Will you be okay?

2704
01:34:22,869 --> 01:34:24,508
(I'll be fine.)

2705
01:34:24,509 --> 01:34:26,638
We feel bad when the guest pays.

2706
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,039
It's okay. I was the one who lost.

2707
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:30,299
Do you really think that way?

2708
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:31,708
(Don't say things
that aren't in your heart.)

2709
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:33,008
I'm just joking.

2710
01:34:33,009 --> 01:34:34,049
Gosh.

2711
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:35,979
Gosh, this is exhausting.

2712
01:34:37,149 --> 01:34:38,819
(Laughing)

2713
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:40,548
Don't worry about it.

2714
01:34:40,549 --> 01:34:42,418
(The exciting and special meal
with Byung Eun comes to an end.)

2715
01:34:42,419 --> 01:34:46,288
I thought that
it would feel awkward...

2716
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:49,828
if I appear on a show
that I've never appeared on before,

2717
01:34:49,829 --> 01:34:50,898
but that was never the case.

2718
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:52,368
- That's a relief.
- Tae Hyun...

2719
01:34:52,369 --> 01:34:54,398
and Yi Kyung were here.

2720
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:56,439
The other three also helped me
have a great time.

2721
01:34:56,869 --> 01:34:58,068
It really felt like...

2722
01:34:58,069 --> 01:34:59,408
I had a great time...

2723
01:34:59,409 --> 01:35:02,038
with great people and great food.

2724
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:03,338
I wish to come again...

2725
01:35:03,339 --> 01:35:04,878
if I get the chance.

2726
01:35:04,879 --> 01:35:06,108
- Right.
- I will make sure...

2727
01:35:06,109 --> 01:35:07,279
to play this game again.

2728
01:35:08,649 --> 01:35:10,578
Okay! Thank you!

2729
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:12,118
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2730
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:13,819
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2731
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:15,918
- Gosh.
- That was awesome.

2732
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:17,158
You're the best, Park Byung Eun!

2733
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,389
(You're the best, Park Byung Eun!)

2734
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:20,958
Thank you.

2735
01:35:20,959 --> 01:35:22,399
Do you have a business card?

2736
01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:25,098
Is it better for me to come...

2737
01:35:25,099 --> 01:35:26,669
after making a reservation? I see.

2738
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:29,099
Please insert your card here.

2739
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:31,308
- Thank you.
- Do you need the receipt?

2740
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,368
- No.
- Okay.

2741
01:35:32,369 --> 01:35:33,468
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2742
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:35,308
I'll give you a call
before visiting again next time.

2743
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:36,338
Right. Thank you.

2744
01:35:36,339 --> 01:35:41,249
(Byung Eun promised to come again
as he was satisfied with the meal.)

2745
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:43,817
(Next Menu Recommendation)

2746
01:35:43,957 --> 01:35:45,926
(A hot place
for the young generation...)

2747
01:35:45,927 --> 01:35:47,896
(as it looks like the back alleys
of Europe)

2748
01:35:47,897 --> 01:35:50,097
(Haebangchon Sinheung Market)

2749
01:35:50,127 --> 01:35:53,127
(Who will be the guest
that will join them here?)

2750
01:35:54,097 --> 01:35:56,636
(Lee Su Ji, human copy machine)

2751
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:58,937
(Yes! I'm Lee Su Ji!)

2752
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:00,837
- Yes!
- Hi!

2753
01:36:01,777 --> 01:36:03,877
(You're the first female guest
to be on your own.)

2754
01:36:04,177 --> 01:36:07,077
(You thought she was
the only guest to be here, right?)

2755
01:36:07,777 --> 01:36:09,616
(Lin Zhao Ming?)

2756
01:36:09,617 --> 01:36:11,547
(PSY?)

2757
01:36:11,587 --> 01:36:13,687
(Jamie's Mom?)

2758
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:15,417
(Hambuggy?)

2759
01:36:15,587 --> 01:36:17,017
(Who is this? Is this Lee Su Ji?)

2760
01:36:17,317 --> 01:36:20,727
(Who is the real Lee Su Ji?)

2761
01:36:20,887 --> 01:36:22,927
(I'll show you my true self.)

2762
01:36:23,227 --> 01:36:25,366
(- Would you like to smell it?
- (Could you put it on my nose?)

2763
01:36:25,367 --> 01:36:26,826
(Gosh!)

2764
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:29,067
(Gosh, you fool!)

2765
01:36:29,197 --> 01:36:33,666
(Overflowing energy...)

2766
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:37,707
(and super cuteness)

2767
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:41,377
(The Handsome Guys
fall for Lee Su Ji.)

2768
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:46,187
(How exciting will it be next week?)

2769
01:36:47,047 --> 01:36:48,357
