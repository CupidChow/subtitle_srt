(Instead of individualism,)

3
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:35,686
(Life in Shortage started with their arms tied.)

4
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,786
(They cook...)

5
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,786
(with their arms tied.)

6
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,756
(They also eat with their arms tied.)

7
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:41,896
(Do they even go to the bathroom with their arms tied?)

8
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,526
(They have absolutely no privacy.)

9
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:45,766
(If you want to be free,)

10
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,896
(become the chieftain.)

11
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,406
(Freedom will be given to the chieftain.)

12
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:52,836
(With their freedom at stake,)

13
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:54,606
(the Handsome Guys' desperate struggle started.)

14
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:57,006
(Rare and extraordinary)

15
00:00:57,136 --> 00:01:01,046
(As the fierce struggle for the chieftain's seat continued)

16
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,816
(To learn the spirit of true cooperation,)

17
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:07,116
(they managed to invite a teacher after much effort.)

18
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:12,986
(Hyuk, what are you doing here?)

19
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,926
(Will Hyuk also get tied?)

20
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,266
(What is he? Isn't he our teacher?)

21
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:21,866

00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,976
(Laughing)

26
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:37,786

(Dizzy)

30
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:45,156
- One, two.
- One, two.

38
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,086
What are the things we can make?

39
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:15,456
Stir-fried pork,

40
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:16,656
- Ramyeon.
- ramyeon.

41
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:19,756
(Today's menu is Chef Yi Kyung's stir-fried pork.)

42
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:20,926
The heat is strong.

43
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,196
It has to be close to being cut.

44
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,526
Put some water over the heat to make ramyeon.

45
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,836
Is five packets of ramyeon enough? Six?

46
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:31,206
Come here. It will take a long time.

47
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,166
The water has to boil. Let's sit.

48
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,906
(Flopping down)

49
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,946
(While the children return home and prepare food for the holiday,)

50
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:42,516
(they look like an old couple relaxing behind them.)

51
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,146
Lately, I've fallen in love with singing.

52
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,886
I'm being very serious.

53
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:50,156
- What do you sing?
- "Teacup."

54
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,486
- "Teacup?" - Yes.

55
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:53,026
- "Teacup" is...
- I don't know that song.

56
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,156
The song is really amazing.

57
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:58,326
("Teacup" by Nogoziri)

58
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:00,096
I love the emotional vibe to it.

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,536
- How about...
- I'm cooking it over low heat.

60
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:02,766
Where should I plate it?

61
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,166
Sang Uk, can you hand me that in front of you?

62
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,266
Those two.

63
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,776
(A heartwarming tune)

64
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,176
I have to sing it with my eyes closed.

65
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:13,206
(A heartwarming tune)

66
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,146
(His singing mode is on.)

67
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,386
This song?

68
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:26,956
(Overflowing emotions)

69
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:29,296
(Laughing)

70
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,566
Suddenly, it feels like we're back in the 70s.

71
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,026
Right.

72
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,266
Did the guys behind us have a glass of makgeolli?

73
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,436
Perhaps

74
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,176
(The vibe of the 70s)

75
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,936
(An old couple enjoying the pleasure of music over a glass of makgeolli)

76
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:46,606
- This is nice.
- The stir-fried pork is done...

77
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,946
in 30 seconds. What should I do?

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,476
- Already?
- Gosh.

79
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,546
- The ramyeon is the problem.
- Ham will also be ready soon.

80
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:53,646
(Yi Kyung's stir-fried pork is almost ready.)

81
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,816
- We should start making ramyeon.
- Shall we?

82
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,316
(The elderly couple move.)

83
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:58,626
- Please make some ramyeon.
- Okay.

84
00:03:58,626 --> 00:03:59,926
We're up.

85
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,596
Mr. Teacup is up.

86
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,096
(Shaking the ramyeon seasoning)

87
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:05,926
Hey.

88
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,836
(Spilling)

89
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:09,896
He spilled half of it.

90
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:11,666
It's because my arm is tied to yours.

91
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,766
- I've never done this before.
- He spilled half of it.

92
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:14,976
I only spilled it once.

93
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,736
You spilled so many vegetable flakes.

94
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,906
Hey, don't be so obsessed with vegetable flakes.

95
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,516
(This time, he prepares the egg.)

96
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,116
Hey, this is... Wait, let me try again,

97
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,316
(Thud)

98
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,416
It's not a boiled egg, is it?

99
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,286
- Of course not.
- Then why did you...

100
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,126
It's hard to break it.

101
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,096
(Spilling)

102
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:36,726
How you control is very important.

103
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,096
- Just tap it lightly on the edge.
- Hyuk is...

104
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,936
- Hyuk is interesting.
- Why are you hitting it there?

105
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,006
- This isn't easy. I'm serious.
- But...

106
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:48,676
(He smashes down the egg on the table.)

107
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,836
You probably can't see what Hyuk is doing.

108
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:53,106
He's throwing away the egg white on the table.

109
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,816
He's putting only the egg yolk in here.

110
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,816
Hyuk, what are you...

111
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:59,146
- What is this?
- I don't know if you see it.

112
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,386
Could you film the egg white over here?

113
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,356
No, it's not necessary to film it.

114
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,086
- It's an egg white party.
- This is all egg white.

115
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,126
It's not water.

116
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:11,626
(A huge mess)

117
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,166
Gosh, it's slippery.

118
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:14,896
I can't break it with my hands.

119
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:18,166
He can't break eggs with his hands.

120
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,806
It's ready.

121
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,636
The noodles will get soggy. Let's serve them fast.

122
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,006
Okay, let's sit down.

123
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,446
There's more meat. Let me know if you want more.

124
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,416
- The food smells very good.
- Thank you for the food.

125
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:31,886
Thank you for the food.

126
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,316
Thank you.

127
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,986
(Beneath the glowing sunset sky,)

128
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,616
(the tribesmen start their meal.)

129
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:39,426
- Have some.
- Let's eat.

130
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,156
The meat doesn't have a bad smell.

131
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:44,396
(So delicious)

132
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,326
His cooking skills are amazing.

133
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:48,466
What is it, Dong Hyun?

134
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,136
It tastes like stir-fried pork you eat at a restaurant.

135
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:51,906
(A huge compliment)

136
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:54,876
(Feeling proud)

137
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:58,676
(Gobbling up)

138
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,046
(Eating with his left hand...)

139
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,046
(while sacrificing his right hand)

140
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:07,316
(Thanks to his friend, he's eating comfortably with his right hand.)

141
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,216
It's really nice to eat outside. I haven't done it in a while.

142
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,286
Hyuk, when is the best part of your day?

143
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:15,426
Time doesn't mean much to me.

144
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,766
- What do you mean?
- I just think,

145
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,096
"The sun came up. The sun went down."

146
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:23,566
When you're in the darkness, time and space disappear.

147
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,066
It becomes quiet.

148
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,166
Things are the same when you close your eyes.

149
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,536
"In the darkness, time and space disappear."

150
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,006
You know what's funny?

151
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,406
People are capable of sensing energy.

152
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,746
- What?
- You can sense the presence.

153
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,716
I'm a ninja. I can see everything.

154
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,846
(That's ridiculous.)

155
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,086
Didn't I guess correctly last time?

156
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,156
I'll stand either on your left or your right.

157
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,986
Will you guess which side I'm on?

158
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,656
If you don't make any jokes, I can definitely guess.

159
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:48,826
- I promise not to make jokes.
- Seriously.

160
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,196
- I'm approaching from the left.
- Wait.

161
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,326
I'm in the middle now.

162
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,966
Tell me where I am after five seconds.

163
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,536
- You have to do it seriously.
- You're like someone...

164
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,866
who becomes specialized by studying on your own.

165
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:05,376
(Careful)

166
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:06,976
You're on my right.

167
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:10,246
Hyuk, let me do it one more time.

168
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,986
No, you're supposed to do it only once.

169
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,186
- Did you really feel it?
- Of course.

170
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,026
How is this possible?

171
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,056
(Fascinated)

172
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:21,326
When I'm alone at home,

173
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,096
I can feel that it's empty in the house.

174
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,796
- Otherwise, you feel ghosts?
- No.

175
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,196
Gosh, I'm very full.

176
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:28,966
It's been a while since I enjoyed my meal this much.

177
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,206
You have to clean up now, right?

178
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,666
- Right.
- Before that,

179
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,736
we're thinking of changing the length of the strap.

180
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,636
- Stem?
- The length of the strap.

181
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,506
- The length of the strap.
- The length?

182
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,676
Okay. We have to change it.

183
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,776
These two are very desperate.

184
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,216
Their feet are also tied.

185
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,146
What kind of game will we play?

186
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:47,186
This game is...

187
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:51,086
(Strap Length Battle, Joint Balloon Transfer)

188
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:52,856
While holding a ping pong racket...

189
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,386
with the free hand,

190
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,756
the players will take turns hitting a balloon.

191
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:57,796
(Rule 2: Take turns to hit the balloon)

192
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,266
You have to put the balloon in the basin on the other side.

193
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,466
If you drop the balloon at any point,

194
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,806
return the starting point with the balloon.

195
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,666
- You may restart.
- With the same balloon?

196
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,936
The ranking is determined by who puts the most balloons...

197
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,076
into the basin in two minutes.

198
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,116
- You'll get to change the strap.
- Okay.

199
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,846
(If they win, their strap length will change.)

200
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:19,586
(The order of Joint Balloon Transfer)

201
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,116
(1. Dong Hyun, Sang Uk, 2. Hyuk, Tae Hyun, 3. Yi Kyung, Seung Ho)

202
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,216
- You go first.
- Okay.

203
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:23,286
(The first pair: Sang Uk, Dong Hyun)

204
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:24,626
We might put everything in.

205
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,326
Don't hit the balloon twice while keeping the balloon low at the end.

206
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,556
I'll be watching you.

207
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,196
Don't worry. We'll play fair and square.

208
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:32,296
(Warning: Hitting the balloon twice isn't allowed.)

209
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,596
(Thinking hard)

210
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,736
Dong Hyun.

211
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,266
Let's keep the balloon low.

212
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,866
- Don't hit it high.
- Okay.

213
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,006
As you know, the hardest is in front of the basin.

214
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:42,376
It's hard to put the balloons in.

215
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,036
They have an advantage.

216
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,406
One of them is left-handed.

217
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,676
Look. We have to hit it like this over there.

218
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,216
- Exactly. That's what we should do.
- Okay.

219
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:53,086
(Will the athletic group do a good job?)

220
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,916
(Going forward)

221
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,986
Like this.

222
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:59,926
(Sang Uk sends the balloon far as soon as they start.)

223
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:02,296
Hey.

224
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,696
That's it. Hurry and go back.

225
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,226
(They win the first point easily.)

226
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:08,566
They're good.

227
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,536
Gosh.

228
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:14,566
Hey!

229
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,276
Hey!

230
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,436
That's it.

231
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,806
(He overcomes the crisis with a fencing step.)

232
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:21,076
(In awe)

233
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,116
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

234
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,546
I told you not to hit it high.

235
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,886
(Flying up)

236
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,216
(The balloon lands on top of the tent.)

237
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:32,326
You have to pick up that balloon.

238
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:33,556
- We have to pick it up?
- Yes.

239
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:34,956
(Start again with the balloon that you dropped.)

240
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:35,956
Where is it?

241
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,126
Goodness.

242
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,426
(Their precious time is passing.)

243
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:40,966
You have to start first.

244
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:42,566
Don't hit it high.

245
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,466
Don't hit it high.

246
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,836
(He sends it far again.)

247
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,506
Keep it low.

248
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,376
Oh, no.

249
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,576
(It's about to drop.)

250
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,046
Oh, no.

251
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:00,716
(Sang Uk overcomes it with his personal skill.)

252
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:02,256
- You have to start it.
- Me?

253
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,716
- Yes.
- We shouldn't hit it high.

254
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:04,826
Right.

255
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:06,326
You have one minute left.

256
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:07,326
Already?

257
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,256
- Okay.
- They're really good.

258
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,256
(Current number of balloons: 4)

259
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:14,666
(They have less than 1 minute.)

260
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:17,966
(Current number of balloons: 4)

261
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,736
We got it. Let's hurry.

262
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,836
(Current number of balloons: 6)

263
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:22,976
We got it.

264
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:23,976
(The athletic group is gaining points in order.)

265
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:25,006
Hurry up.

266
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,206
They will win first place.

267
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:29,646
Get it.

268
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,586
This one is hard.

269
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:35,586
- No.
- You hit it twice.

270
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:37,456
You hit it twice.

271
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,256
- No, I didn't.
- Take it out.

272
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:41,156
Take the same balloon with you.

273
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:42,596
That was a comparative analysis.

274
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:44,426
- "Comparative analysis?" - No, I didn't mean that.

275
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:45,966
That's ridiculous.

276
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,596
This is...

277
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,536
(While he feels resentful, the time is over.)

278
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,096
- Wait.
- The time is up.

279
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,206
Who hit it twice?

280
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:53,706
You did, Dong Hyun.

281
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:54,776
- Me?
- Yes.

282
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:57,706
- We need to look at the footage.
- We need VAR.

283
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,076
Who hit twice?

284
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,046
(The scene of the problem)

285
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,046
This one is hard.

286
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:03,776
(Hitting once)

287
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,246
(Hitting twice)

288
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:07,616
- No.
- You hit it twice.

289
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,956
Dong Hyun hit the blue balloon twice.

290
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,326
- Over here?
- Goodness.

291
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:14,996
I will yield.

292
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,296
- I will yield one.
- But...

293
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,296
I'll yield one.

294
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:19,666
(That's not yielding.)

295
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,596
He doesn't agree that he hit it twice.

296
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,696
- The 2 of you got 6 balloons.
- Really?

297
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,566
Okay, I'll yield.

298
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,276
(Dong Hyun and Sang Uk got 6 balloons.)

299
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,876
They still got a lot.

300
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,306
(Taking it off temporarily for the game)

301
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,346
I'll yield.

302
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,146
Did they get six?

303
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,346
(The second pair: Hyuk and Tae Hyun)

304
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,476
We just need six, right?

305
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:40,086
On top of that, Hyuk can sense energy.

306
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:42,716
- Right, the energy of the balloon.
- Let's go.

307
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:43,716
(What is Hyuk's strategy as he boasts good energy?)

308
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,856
Just keep sending it forward.

309
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,186
We can press it gently into the basin.

310
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,756
We've done it on "Whenever Possible,"

311
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:49,826
- so we'll do well.
- Of course.

312
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:50,956
(Send it forward like the athletic group)

313
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,496
We can hit it sharply at the end.

314
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:54,496
If we hit it too hard, it will bounce off.

315
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,496
We'll do it gently.

316
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,366
- Shall we start the next round?
- Yes.

317
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,406
- He stepped over the line.
- Okay.

318
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:00,466
He stepped over the line.

319
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,336
(Cheating is detected.)

320
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,576
How could you when you're sensitive to energy?

321
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,806
(Embarrassed)

322
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:08,046
Gosh, you're right.

323
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,416
Let's get started.

324
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,586
(Straight forward)

325
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,216
(The oldest boys are good at sending it forward.)

326
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,886
(However...)

327
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:17,316
(Rising up)

328
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,586
It went up.

329
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,226
Why does it go up so high?

330
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,726
(Falling)

331
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,726
(It drops to the ground directly.)

332
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,666
(It's not easy, is it?)

333
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,606
- We have to send it forward.
- Forward.

334
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,476
Sang Uk did it really well.

335
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:37,506
Gosh, this is...

336
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,506
(2nd time with the light blue balloon)

337
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:42,146
(Going straight again)

338
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,416
I mean...

339
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,746
(It's too far.)

340
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,856
(He saved it.)

341
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,586
(All he has to do is push it in.)

342
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,296
(Striking hard)

343
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,266
This is hard. Hyuk.

344
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,326
(Laughing)

345
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,496
You look like two dads at your children's kindergarten.

346
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,496
Seriously.

347
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:08,066
Wait. Let's concentrate. There's no pressure.

348
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,436
(Moving forward with composure)

349
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,346
We got it. Why does it keep...

350
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,946
We got it. Why does it keep...

351
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:18,516
Why do you keep...

352
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:22,786
We got it.

353
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,016
Why do you keep...

354
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:25,956
taking it out?

355
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:26,956
(They barely earned their first point.)

356
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,956
(Good luck, dad.)

357
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,266
(Please let us make it at once this time.)

358
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,576
- We got it.
- Wait.

359
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,976
Time-out.

360
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,306
What was that?

361
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:46,646
- What was that?
- That doesn't count.

362
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,376
Didn't he hit it twice?

363
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:49,876
No, he just hit it three times.

364
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:50,946
What was that?

365
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:52,486
Is that rhythmic gymnastics or what?

366
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:53,646
(Is this his pressing strategy?)

367
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:56,256
(Despite people's complaints, they continue playing.)

368
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,626
(Hyuk's toss and Tae Hyun's pressing)

369
00:13:58,626 --> 00:13:59,626
We got it.

370
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,626
(Current number of balloons: 3)

371
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:06,866
(They've been earning points 3 times in a row.)

372
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,496
(Flying off)

373
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,606
Oh, no.

374
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,836
Two fathers over there, run fast.

375
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:16,636
You can at least win second place.

376
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,946
- "Fathers?" - I'm exhausted now.

377
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:23,316
The fathers want to give up.

378
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,316
(Dad is exhausted.)

379
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,846
- Hurry and throw it.
- One, two, three.

380
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,716
(They muster up the energy to start again,)

381
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:32,556
(but their bodies can't keep up.)

382
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:36,596
(With a combined age of 100, they squeeze out the last bit of energy.)

383
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,766
- They'll put in one more.
- We got it.

384
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,196
- Time is up.
- We got it.

385
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,166
We won't count the last balloon.

386
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,196
Okay.

387
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:45,466
(Disappointed)

388
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,866
(They try to catch up their breath.)

389
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:49,406
How many do you have?

390
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,006
- Is it 3?
- Their total number is 3.

391
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,106
(Surprisingly, Hyuk and Tae Hyun put in 3 balloons.)

392
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,176
The athletes are clearly different.

393
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:58,046
Sang Uk, you're quite deft with your hands.

394
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,586
You have to be detailed.

395
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,656
Everyone holds it like this, right? You have to be detailed.

396
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,356
- You have to hit first.
- Yes, I'll hit forward.

397
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:07,386
I'll be using my left hand. I'm right-handed.

398
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,426
Try to hit it beyond the half point.

399
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:10,596
I'll run after it.

400
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,066
At the end, we should touch it gently.

401
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,096
(Yi Kyung and Seung Ho's tactic: Hit and run after it)

402
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,696
Dong Hyun's team has six.

403
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:18,136
Hyuk's team has three.

404
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,966
If we make between 3 and 6, we'll place 2nd again.

405
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,176
It's not easy at the end.

406
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,906
(Hit it with a thud and run)

407
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,146
It's over.

408
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:28,146
(Just as they planned, they hit it and run after it.)

409
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:29,816
(Carefully)

410
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,116
(Carefully)

411
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:32,746
Goodness.

412
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,446
It landed by chance at the end.

413
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:36,256
(Exclaiming)

414
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:37,686
We have to stay calm.

415
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:39,726
(Calmly...)

416
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,256
(making a drop shot)

417
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:42,296
Hey.

418
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,596
(He receives the drop shot with composure.)

419
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,526
We made it to the end.

420
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,036
- We got it.
- We made it.

421
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,096
We're much faster.

422
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,906
They're surprisingly fast.

423
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,406
Goodness.

424
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,506
(Gaining 1 point in 5 seconds)

425
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,776
(Current number of balloons: 3)

426
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,176
They're good.

427
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:03,276
They're fast.

428
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:06,116
(Their hit and run strategy is working well.)

429
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,416
(After hitting it, they run to the goal instantly.)

430
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:11,256
Stay calm.

431
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,526
(It's their chance to earn a point.)

432
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,096
- We got it.
- You hit it twice.

433
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:19,166
- You hit it twice.
- You hit it twice.

434
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,166
- Me?
- The referee...

435
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,396
We'll take a look later.

436
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,466
I swear on my everything that I didn't.

437
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,436
- He didn't.
- I swear on my everything.

438
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,506
I watched him up close, and he didn't.

439
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,036
I'll definitely raise an objection.

440
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,176
That's what I thought too.

441
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,276
(After demanding VAR, they start again.)

442
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:33,976
(Stumbling)

443
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,016
(Gently)

444
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,446
(After the double hit controversy, he hits it carefully.)

445
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,016
(Current number of balloons: 3)

446
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:44,256
- We got it.
- You got it.

447
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,286
(Currently, they placed 2nd.)

448
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:47,126
It's over.

449
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:48,156
(Hyuk and Tae Hyun definitely placed last.)

450
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:51,256
(Current number of balloons: 4)

451
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,396
Oh, my.

452
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,936
They're quite athletic.

453
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,536
Where did it go?

454
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,406
(As they earn a point,)

455
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:06,446
(the game is over.)

456
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,576
I clearly said that I'd raise an objection.

457
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,576
(Current number of balloons: 6)

458
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:13,316
(Both teams' scores are tied with 6 points each.)

459
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,316
It's over.

460
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,686
(Whether he hit it twice or not will decide the strap length.)

461
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:19,886
Let's take a look.

462
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,126
(Did Seung Ho hit twice?)

463
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:23,856
If I hit it twice, I'd admit it no matter what.

464
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,766
- Me too.
- I saw it up close, and he didn't.

465
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,766
I didn't think so either.

466
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,026
(They check VAR with strange nervousness.)

467
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:29,166
Just yield.

468
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,666
(The scene of the problem)

469
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:33,136
We got it.

470
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,506
(Hitting once)

471
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:37,506
(Hitting twice)

472
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,976
(From this angle, he hit it twice.)

473
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:43,316
Don't assume that the balloon hit my racket.

474
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:44,716
After Yi Kyung hit it...

475
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:45,746
(After Yi Kyung's hit)

476
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:47,916
It touched the basin.

477
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,916
(It didn't touch Seung Ho's racket.)

478
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,156
We got it.

479
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,856
- The verdict says...
- Yes?

480
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,096
that he didn't hit it twice. They won seven balloons.

481
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:58,696
It's true. I really didn't.

482
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,066
- He didn't hit it twice.
- No.

483
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,966
- I really didn't.
- It bounced off the basin.

484
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,796
Usually, I move...

485
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,136
and wait like this.

486
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,236
Before putting it into action,

487
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:07,266
I pull my leg back.

488
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,806
Immediately, I make a Marseille turn...

489
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,636
and shoot the ball behind. Step, step.

490
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,276
I move forward. Step, step.

491
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:13,346
Step, step.

492
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:14,376
Then shoot.

493
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,416
I curl the ball.

494
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,616
A photo of Son Heung min.

495
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:17,676
You know what I'm saying?

496
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:18,846
A shout-out to Son.

497
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,386
(A shout-out to Son)

498
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,016
(Exhaling)

499
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,386
It's hard to keep up with Rascal Seung Ho.

500
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:26,156
For those who placed last,

501
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,326
there will be no change.

502
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:28,896
We have to put them back on. That's annoying.

503
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,356
This is annoying.

504
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,866
The 1st and 2nd place switched places.

505
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,596
You'll exchange the 30cm and 50cm straps.

506
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,666
Do we just exchange them?

507
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,966
We just need to take this off.

508
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:40,166
Also, their chieftain rights will be transferred.

509
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,366
- That's us.
- Yes.

510
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,536
I love you.

511
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:45,176
Bad calls are also part of the game.

512
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:49,346
We became the chieftain.

513
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,176
- The cleanup will be done...
- Yes?

514
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,146
- by the four of you.
- Okay.

515
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:55,486
Why don't you play a game? You can put everything on the line.

516
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,786
- Put everything on the line.
- Anything is good.

517
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,456
It can't be a physical game.

518
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,626
They're much stronger than us.

519
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:04,326
It won't be fun.

520
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,096
- A game that requires thinking...
- We'll give you 30 more seconds.

521
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,096
- Thirty seconds.
- What about thirty seconds?

522
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,236
We'll give them to you.

523
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:10,236
(He refuses.)

524
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,266
- That's hard.
- Instead of a physical game...

525
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,266
How about this, Tae Hyun?

526
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,466
Instead of a physical game,

527
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,276
- the game requires the head.
- Okay.

528
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:18,236
You play the same game without the ping pong rackets...

529
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:19,276
- but with the head.
- With the head.

530
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:20,576
You play the same game without the ping pong rackets...

531
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,646
- but with the head.
- With the head.

532
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:23,046
- What do you think?
- That sounds good.

533
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,546
- Isn't that nice?
- That's fair.

534
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,646
We're bad at using our heads.

535
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:27,516
How do we play it with the head?

536
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,486
- You hit it with the head.
- You head the balloon.

537
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,086
That would be more difficult.

538
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,356
We'll just go with it.

539
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,726
- Isn't this harder?
- Are you going to put...

540
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:34,956
- everything on the line?
- Yes.

541
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:36,026
Okay.

542
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:37,526
The losing team has to clean up everything.

543
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:39,296
Do you want to go first?

544
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,466
Will you go first?

545
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,566
- Do you want to go first?
- Let's do it.

546
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,566
(Hyuk and Tae Hyun volunteer to go first.)

547
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,806
We use our heads much better than you think.

548
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,736
You see the forehead?

549
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:48,906
- Use the forehead.
- Okay.

550
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:49,976
(Their strategy is using the forehead.)

551
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,346
That's right.

552
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,406
Wait.

553
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,016
(The forehead)

554
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,116
Wait.

555
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:58,176
(The forehead)

556
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,646
(As planned, they use their forehead enthusiastically.)

557
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,456
Actually, this is more stable than before.

558
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,196
(Bowing deeply)

559
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:11,896
(Bowing deeply)

560
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,296
(Hello)

561
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,766
(Happy New Year)

562
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:15,836
Goodness.

563
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:18,736
- How do you advance like this?
- It's really hard.

564
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,366
Keep it in.

565
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,176
- That's it.
- Move forward.

566
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,276
No, don't make it go up.

567
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:25,276
You have to do it like Tae Hyun.

568
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:27,906
Move forward.

569
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:28,946
No, don't make it go up.

570
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:30,816
(Hyuk sends it straight up.)

571
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,546
- You have to do it like Tae Hyun.
- Forward.

572
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,416
They got it now.

573
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:36,956
You got it.

574
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:41,186
(They finally got a chance to earn a point.)

575
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:44,956
You got it.

576
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:47,166
(He clearly headed it away from the basin.)

577
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:48,296
Do it again.

578
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,366
Just make one in.

579
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,866
I feel like you took out several of them.

580
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:52,936
Move forward. That's right.

581
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,866
(Once again, Hyuk...)

582
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:55,976
Gosh.

583
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,906
(You said that you're good at using your head.)

584
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,406
When Tae Hyun pushes it in,

585
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:00,806
Hyuk takes it out.

586
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,646
You exercise a lot,

587
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,176
but you don't seem athletic.

588
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:05,986
(Exclaiming in surprise)

589
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,186
Gently. Don't do it hard.

590
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:09,086
Use your forehead.

591
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:10,086
What?

592
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,086
- We got it.
- They made one in.

593
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:14,556
If you put one more in, you'll succeed.

594
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,056
Why do you keep hitting it up?

595
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,126
Tap it lightly.

596
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,326
Hyuk...

597
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,336
(He has an extraordinary skill of dodging the balloon gracefully.)

598
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,366
Hyuk.

599
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:27,566
- Hyuk.
- You have ten seconds left.

600
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,676
- You're good.
- Don't give up.

601
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:29,776
Don't give up.

602
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:30,976
All right, it's the last one.

603
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:32,976
(The two fathers do their best until the end.)

604
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,576
Slowly. Stay calm.

605
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:36,046
Stay calm.

606
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:38,146
- Stay calm.
- Just one.

607
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:39,686
Did they make it?

608
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,716
(Just in the nick of time,)

609
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:45,056
(he scored the final header.)

610
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:47,356
(They succeeded a total of 2.)

611
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:48,486
(Breathing heavily)

612
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,256
It's over.

613
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,596
It's so tiring.

614
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,766
(The fathers made a lot of effort and succeeded 2.)

615
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,496
Hit it up. That's right.

616
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,596
- It shouldn't go up so high.
- Yes, that's how you do it.

617
00:21:58,496 --> 00:21:59,606
- It's your turn.
- Wait.

618
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,706
(A knee kick)

619
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:03,576
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

620
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:04,836
You kicked me.

621
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,006
We didn't touch it.

622
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,206
(Despite the knee kick, he keeps fighting.)

623
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:10,546
Slowly.

624
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,316
- We got it.
- Well done.

625
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:13,516
They did one.

626
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:14,616
(Right after)

627
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:15,686
You got it.

628
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:17,616
You have to put it in.

629
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,926
- Okay.
- Okay.

630
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,026
- It's over.
- All right.

631
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,626
(They succeeded 3 balloons within 30 seconds.)

632
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,096
They're definitely different.

633
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,296
Your eyes look out of focus.

634
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:25,396
(Hyuk and Tae Hyun get to clean up.)

635
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,896
(Sang Uk and Dong Hyun are exempt from cleaning up.)

636
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,796
- Please clean well for us.
- Sure.

637
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:33,966
We had a good meal, so we'll clean.

638
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,036
(Shortage in Privacy Current Status)

639
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,636
- Thank you in advance.
- Gosh.

640
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,536
- Good luck.
- I'm tired.

641
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:39,776
I'm tired.

642
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:41,806
(Groaning)

643
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,176
Even the way they walk is funny.

644
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,186
Even the way they walk is funny.

645
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:50,486
(The fathers' hands and feet are tied up again.)

646
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,986
We really look like prisoners being dragged away.

647
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,556
Don't you agree?

648
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,696
(They feel like they've done something seriously wrong.)

649
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:57,696
Prisoners.

650
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:00,366
Do we wash them here?

651
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,426
(The older members start to wash dishes at the sink.)

652
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:02,496
When I hand you...

653
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:03,496
the dish,

654
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,966
rinse it with water and put it on that side.

655
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,166
(Sink)

656
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,236
Why is it so sad...

657
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:10,306
looking at them?

658
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,406
(Smiling)

659
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:14,176
Do you need any help?

660
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,576
No, it's okay.

661
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,616
We don't need more people anyway.

662
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:19,346
Thank you.

663
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:22,456
(They leave while trusting the older members.)

664
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:23,756
(What?)

665
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,156
To go to the bathroom, we have to do another mission.

666
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,726
(Restroom Challenge)

667
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,166
(Put Coins in the Fork)

668
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,496
(Hold a coin at the starting line.)

669
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,136
(Roll it.)

670
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:41,066
(Put it in.)

671
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:44,336
(It's a success if you put it in at least once.)

672
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,546
(When you succeed, you can remove the bracelet for 5 minutes.)

673
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:49,976
(Yi Kyung and Seung Ho take on the challenge.)

674
00:23:49,976 --> 00:23:51,246
Isn't it easy?

675
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:53,546
(What?)

676
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,046
Let me stand here.

677
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:56,816
- There we go.
- That's it.

678
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,886
(It doesn't look easy.)

679
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,926
(Concentrating)

680
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,196
(Exclaiming)

681
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:06,926
(The coin doesn't roll in the direction he wants.)

682
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:09,866
Using the bathroom is important, but...

683
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,036
(However, Yi Kyung...)

684
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,236
(Water Bottle Challenge during Shortage in Sleep)

685
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:15,736
Go to bed, everyone.

686
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:17,806
I'm going to bed after getting this.

687
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,946
(Despite everyone's indifference)

688
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:31,386
(The challenge master of petty techniques succeeded with pride.)

689
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:32,956
It could be possible.

690
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:35,456
(Will he make it again this time?)

691
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:37,896
Shall I roll it like this?

692
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,336
(The coin gets closer to the fork.)

693
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,906
(Clink)

694
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,836
(It strikes the fork.)

695
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,576
I shouldn't roll it too hard either.

696
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:53,076
(He prepares the coin again.)

697
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:00,986
(In the goal)

698
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,486
- Let's go. We succeeded.
- Gosh.

699
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,156
- Did we succeed? That's amazing.
- Yes, let's go to the bathroom.

700
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,186
- I'll go.
- Sure.

701
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,356
(Rascal Seung Ho uses the bathroom comfortably.)

702
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:15,066
(After cleaning up and using the bathroom)

703
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:16,636
(The best part of camping, the night has fallen.)

704
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,436
It's nighttime.

705
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,406
It's much better at night.

706
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:21,466
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

707
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,076
You have to take a shower soon, don't you?

708
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:24,206
Right.

709
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:26,746
We'd like to respect your privacy when you take a shower.

710
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:27,846
Of course.

711
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:29,016
We prepared a team game...

712
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,476
with your individual shower privilege at stake.

713
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:31,776
Okay.

714
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:34,386
There's a total of four shower privileges.

715
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,186
Whenever you succeed,

716
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:37,686
you'll get a shower privilege.

717
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,086
If you earn four shower privileges,

718
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:42,996
- all of you will get to shower.
- Okay.

719
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:44,696
With four, each pair will be split.

720
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,926
If you earn three shower privileges,

721
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,796
three of you will take a shower in private.

722
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:52,436
The remaining two will take a shower while being tied.

723
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:55,506
It's impossible for them to take a shower.

724
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:57,206
The team game is called...

725
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:59,046
Ready, Action!

726
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:01,706
- What is it?
- Hyuk will play for the first time.

727
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:03,046
In a game called Ready, Action!

728
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,516
each of us have to act.

729
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,246
(When the members act a given situation with various levels)

730
00:26:06,246 --> 00:26:08,586
Based on their acting and their levels,

731
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,156
you have to take a guess.

732
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:11,816
You have to guess the order...

733
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,286
(The members' acting intensity)

734
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:16,196
of levels from the lowest to the highest.

735
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,126
- You have to guess the order?
- Yes.

736
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:20,396
- We have four actors.
- We have...

737
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:22,496
four actors.

738
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,936
There are four actors...

739
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,066
and one aspiring actor.

740
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,206
I have acting experience too.

741
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,406
You're a veteran actor.

742
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:32,006
I was also in a movie.

743
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:34,652
It's really nice because we have another actor.

744
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,922
- In the beginning...
- Can we guess?

745
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,392
- In the beginning, - He should guess first.

746
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:40,232
- you should guess.
- He can do it.

747
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:42,902
This will be a waste of his talent.

748
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:43,902
(Actor Hyuk's passionate acting is coming up soon.)

749
00:26:44,032 --> 00:26:45,302
You have to watch us first.

750
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,572
Otherwise, you won't understand.

751
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,732
Okay.

752
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,832
I hope I get a good one.

753
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,542
Let it be either 1, 2, 6, or 7.

754
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,412
For 1, 2, 6, and 7, the intensity must be strong.

755
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,472
(For 1, 2, 6, and 7, the intensity must be strong.)

756
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:55,842
I picked one.

757
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:56,882
All right.

758
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,342
You got rear-ended...

759
00:26:58,342 --> 00:26:59,852
- while driving.
- You got hurt.

760
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:02,312
How do you react when you get out of your car?

761
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,452
- So you are furious.
- You get out of the car?

762
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:05,652
Another car crashed into you.

763
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:06,822
Level One is...

764
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,322
complaining timidly in a tiny voice.

765
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:10,762
- After getting out of the car?
- Yes.

766
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,462
- You have to get out of the car.
- Someone crashed into you.

767
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:14,332
The highest level is...

768
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,402
throwing a fit like you decided...

769
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,632
to gain something from it.

770
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,702
(1. Complaining timidly in a tiny voice)

771
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:19,772
(7. Throwing a fit like you decided to gain something from it)

772
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:22,502
Whose acting do you want to see first?

773
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,342
Let's start with Seung Ho.

774
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:27,012
Gosh, since we're tied to each other,

775
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:28,842
- to prepare for it...
- I'll follow you.

776
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,442
Gosh.

777
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,412
There must be some action in it if he has to prepare for it.

778
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:35,082
Ready.

779
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,382
(The first driver, Seung Ho)

780
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:37,422
Action!

781
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:39,752
(Suddenly, he gets rear-ended.)

782
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:40,852
(Laughing with exasperation)

783
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:43,962
(Anger meter)

784
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,122
He got out.

785
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:47,862
Come out of the car.

786
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:48,892
(He drops the honorifics.)

787
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:52,232
Come out of the car.

788
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:56,202
(Intrigued)

789
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,702
Speak up while I'm still being polite.

790
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,272
Or I'll hit you right away.

791
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:02,012
(If you don't speak, you might get attacked.)

792
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,482
That's... I know what it is.

793
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:06,112
Okay.

794
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:07,812
Would you like to see Dong Hyun?

795
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,252
(Next up is Dong Hyun who's been in a movie.)

796
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:11,122
(Bursting out laughing)

797
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,222
You shouldn't smile.

798
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:13,992
I could be joyful.

799
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:15,452
That's right.

800
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,062
(Dong Hyun is driving pleasantly.)

801
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,362
Right. On TV...

802
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,792
(Suddenly, he gets rear-ended.)

803
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:25,732
I'm busy right now. Hold on.

804
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:32,042
Gosh, you must be an inexperienced driver.

805
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:33,772
Give me your business card.

806
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:36,212
I will take care of it later.

807
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,542
I have to go now. Please give me your business card.

808
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:41,012
You have to take care of it.

809
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,552
I have a herniated disc in the neck.

810
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:43,582
- "Herniated disc in the neck?" - Thank you.

811
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,652
Please compensate me later. Give me your business card.

812
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,022
- Give me your business card.
- Where are you looking at?

813
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:50,092
What?

814
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,692
I could feel it in his acting.

815
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:53,392
He has a very strong intention.

816
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:55,832
- What?
- You weren't being aggressive,

817
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:58,102
- Wait a minute.
- but you were emotional.

818
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,132
Did I look scary even though I was smiling?

819
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:01,832
Yes, that's what I see now.

820
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:04,972
That's because of my face.

821
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:07,242
I was having a good time in the situation.

822
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:08,712
It's because of my face.

823
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,212
- Shall I go?
- Yes.

824
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:12,782
He loves acting.

825
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,482
(Next up is Sang Uk who loves to act.)

826
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:17,652
Boom.

827
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:19,752
Darn it.

828
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,392
Sir.

829
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,462
Goodness. Roll down your window.

830
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,692
(He knocks the car behind him hard.)

831
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,832
We need to file an insurance claim for all this.

832
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,962
How could you crash into my car from behind?

833
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,702
What is he doing next to Sang Uk?

834
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:35,532
He's a fellow passenger sitting in the front passenger seat.

835
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,372
- Honey, are you okay?
- It really hurts.

836
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:38,702
- "Honey, are you okay?" - Goodness.

837
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:41,712
Don't you see him in pain?

838
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,642
Gosh, please take care of it with your insurance.

839
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,112
(He finishes acting while asking for the insurance claim.)

840
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:46,812
- It hurts. Don't send him away.
- I'll call you.

841
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:48,312
- You can't send him away like that.
- It's okay.

842
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:49,582
(The aspiring actor's ad-lib spree)

843
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:50,822
It's a new car.

844
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,182
Its resale value will go down.

845
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:53,452
"Its resale value?"

846
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,992
Stop the ad-libs. You're confusing him.

847
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:57,692
(Ambiguous)

848
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,862
(Inside Driver Yi Kyung's car)

849
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,262
Excuse me.

850
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,332
Excuse me.

851
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:10,302
Okay.

852
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,172
It's nothing. It's okay.

853
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,472
- Really?
- Yes. Darn it.

854
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,582
Come out, honey. That's not right.

855
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,312
- What is it?
- Goodness.

856
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,212
- Come out.
- You're increasing...

857
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:21,912
- the intensity.
- Hey!

858
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:23,622
Come out!

859
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:25,952
(Ready, Action! got confusing because of the couple's acting.)

860
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:27,322
That increased the intensity.

861
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,662
They showed me clearly.

862
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,692
I see.

863
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,532
- We have a chance of winning.
- Mine is...

864
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,332
I'm so curious about yours.

865
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:36,662
- Wait.
- Gosh.

866
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,232
(The last driver, Tae Hyun)

867
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,302
Boom.

868
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:42,872
Come out first.

869
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:44,502
(Waddling)

870
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:46,272
Gosh, goodbye.

871
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,912
(Gosh, goodbye.)

872
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,312
- What?
- That's yours?

873
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:53,012
- Okay.
- What?

874
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:55,512
- Okay.
- It's very clear.

875
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,582
That changes the entire order.

876
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:00,092
What?

877
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,122
(What?)

878
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,152
What?

879
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,162
(It changes the order?)

880
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,422
- That doesn't make sense.
- He must have his reason.

881
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,692
Aren't you Level One?

882
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:09,832
- Yes.
- Right?

883
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,302
- I thought so.
- His intensity was one?

884
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,702
- Next?
- Next is Yi Kyung.

885
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:13,772
Mine is...

886
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,502
(Yi Kyung has 3, another low level.)

887
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:16,772
- Which level is it?
- Is it three?

888
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:19,272
- Your intensity was 3?
- I thought that it was 2.

889
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:20,472
- Right.
- That was the intensity.

890
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,342
Yes, I agree.

891
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:26,112
- Who's next?
- Now...

892
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:28,212
- it's getting ambiguous.
- Who is next?

893
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,022
Those two are very confusing.

894
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,152
Dong Hyun?

895
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:33,692
- Me?
- Dong Hyun.

896
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:35,592
What's his level?

897
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:37,322
Level two.

898
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:38,462
Really?

899
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:41,132
(Tae Hyun 1, Dong Hyun 2, Yi Kyung 3)

900
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,802
- His acting is always intense.
- Come on.

901
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,502
- Why was it so intense?
- What did I do?

902
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,702
- See that?
- Your acting was somewhat intense.

903
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,532
We've played this many times.

904
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,402
- We know who's at fault.
- If you're Level Two,

905
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:50,902
how could you say, "Darn it?"

906
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,342
Listen, Dong Hyun. "Level One,"

907
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:55,372
"complaining timidly in a tiny voice."

908
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,442
I complained timidly.

909
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:57,782
I said, "You have to take care of it later."

910
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,142
I did it thinking that it was Level Two.

911
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:00,412
Why did you bring up a herniated disc in the neck?

912
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:02,482
You talked about a herniated disc in your neck.

913
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:03,652
It wasn't a complaint, but...

914
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:04,882
Yours was less intense than Dong Hyun's.

915
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,052
- That's why.
- Right?

916
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:07,192
What level did you think I had, Yi Kyung?

917
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,452
- I thought you had Level Four.
- Right.

918
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,122
- Dong Hyun's acting was intense.
- Four can't be this intense.

919
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,662
His acting is always intense.

920
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,092
- Do you think that I'm next?
- Yes.

921
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:14,432
I have Level Four.

922
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,132
The most intense acting was Seung Ho's.

923
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,862
- What's your level, Seung Ho?
- Right, it's Seung Ho.

924
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,602
I don't have Level Seven.

925
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:22,332
I have Level Six, but let me explain why my acting was intense.

926
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:23,902
- It was intense.
- I left some room...

927
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:24,902
- for someone...
- Right.

928
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,142
- Right.
- with higher intensity than mine.

929
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:27,372
That's what you're supposed to do as Level Two.

930
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:28,512
I'll be very soft for Level Two.

931
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:29,882
That's what Levels 2 and 6 are supposed to do.

932
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,142
- As Level Two...
- How many times have we done this?

933
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,382
- If I get Level Two, - Darn it.

934
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:34,812
should I say "it's okay" and leave?

935
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,982
- Yes.
- Dong Hyun, that's better.

936
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,452
- Is Dong Hyun guessing this time?
- Okay.

937
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,522
Sang Uk wants to guess. How about Sang Uk?

938
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,552
(Making a sneaky suggestion)

939
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:44,822
Yes, may I try it? I'm very confident about it.

940
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,332
- It's up to you.
- I'll try acting again.

941
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,392
- Okay.
- I didn't understand.

942
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:49,602
- If I get Levels 1 or 2...
- Okay.

943
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,632
He's an aspiring actor.

944
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:53,972
I'm afraid of getting scolded again for not guessing correctly.

945
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,142
Is this it?

946
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,212
- Tell us the situation.
- Yes.

947
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,182
If you were a child...

948
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:06,252
begging for a toy, how would you act?

949
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,752
- Us as a child?
- You beg for a toy?

950
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,222
Level One.

951
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,422
From begging calmly...

952
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:13,822
Level Seven.

953
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:17,392
To demanding while throwing a tantrum.

954
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,292
Begging calmly is...

955
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,662
- Level One.
- Yes.

956
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,432
Throwing a fit is Level Seven.

957
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,932
- We'll start from here.
- Okay.

958
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,132
You want Dong Hyun to start?

959
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:26,372
Watch mine first. Okay.

960
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:27,932
- You're confident, aren't you?
- I am.

961
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,002
- Okay.
- Yes, I'm very confident.

962
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,042
Okay.

963
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,972
Either he has the highest or the lowest level.

964
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,212
Director, please say action.

965
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,512
Ready, Action!

966
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:40,452
Dad.

967
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,582
He's grown up.

968
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:45,422
Can you buy me this?

969
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,252
No, it's okay.

970
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:51,392
(The intensity doesn't seem high.)

971
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:52,422
Hold on.

972
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:54,392
Okay. That's okay for now.

973
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,062
- I'll go.
- Okay.

974
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:57,662
Dad, please buy me this.

975
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,002
- No.
- Please buy it for me.

976
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,472
No, your mom told you not to.

977
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,532
Can't you buy it for me?

978
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:04,072
- I told you no.
- Okay.

979
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:05,602
(Okay)

980
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:07,072
(As if he was polite)

981
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:09,842
(Child Yi Kyung gets angry in a strange way.)

982
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,382
Okay.

983
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:17,882
(The seven-year-old Rascal Seung Ho starts by sighing.)

984
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:21,252
(Making space)

985
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:23,092
Father!

986
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,192
Father!

987
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,732
If you buy me...

988
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,202
(Pausing)

989
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,902
If you buy me just one toy,

990
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:36,472
I will be completely loyal to you.

991
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:38,272
Father.

992
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,342
(The son's last wish...)

993
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:40,512
(before being exiled)

994
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,512
(His acting was clearly very intense.)

995
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,282
- You just have to guess the levels.
- Okay.

996
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,452
- He picks high levels often.
- By the way...

997
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,612
By the way,

998
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:50,882
imagine that one of us has...

999
00:34:51,252 --> 00:34:54,692
a level higher than Seung Ho's.

1000
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,792
I always leave some room for someone with higher intensity.

1001
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:00,532
- You left some room?
- Yes, I did.

1002
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,292
- You really left some room?
- Yes.

1003
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,432
Let's see the next one.

1004
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,802
It's Hyuk's turn to act.

1005
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,372
Ready...

1006
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:12,912
(The next son heads to the stage resolutely.)

1007
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,872
It's here.

1008
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,812
- Ready, Action!
- It's here.

1009
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,082
Wait a minute.

1010
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,352
Father!

1011
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:24,622
Father!

1012
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:27,252
Hey, what is it?

1013
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:30,362
Father!

1014
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,822
- What do you want?
- This.

1015
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:33,932
(The son begs desperately for the toy with a flushed face.)

1016
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,562
Father!

1017
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:42,132
That.

1018
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,842
I want...

1019
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,882
to have it!

1020
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:54,612
(Some performances are not just watched but experienced.)

1021
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,782
Cut.

1022
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:58,382
- Otherwise, the actor will die.
- Okay.

1023
00:35:58,682 --> 00:35:59,792
That was great.

1024
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,792
- It's very hard.
- It's clear.

1025
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:02,962
Cut.

1026
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:05,462
(It's very hard.)

1027
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:07,492
- It's crystal clear.
- It exploded.

1028
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,562
Bravo.

1029
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:11,232
I saw acting of my legends.

1030
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,732
It's very clear.

1031
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,842
- Sang Uk, do you get it up to now?
- Yes, it's very obvious.

1032
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,802
- You have to figure out Tae Hyun's.
- Right.

1033
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:20,512
(The last Tae Hyun's begging)

1034
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,482
- All right. Ready...
- I'll do what's on my mind.

1035
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,082
Action!

1036
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,682
Dad, please buy this for me.

1037
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:29,282
- No.
- Can't you buy it for me?

1038
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:30,652
Your mom told you not to buy it.

1039
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:34,622
Dad, buy it for me. I don't have it.

1040
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:37,892
Just buy me one. Everyone else has it.

1041
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:39,932
- You have the same at home.
- Just buy me one.

1042
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,332
- Why can't you buy me one?
- What's wrong with you?

1043
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:44,162
Never mind.

1044
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:46,372
- That's nice.
- What kind of dad is that?

1045
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,272
It's so clear. I see the order perfectly.

1046
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:51,102
(Full of confidence)

1047
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,402
We picked good levels this time.

1048
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:54,412
The lowest is Dong Hyun.

1049
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:55,642
All right.

1050
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:58,512
Exactly. This was what I needed.

1051
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,112
- Right.
- I did it well this time.

1052
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:01,582
Next.

1053
00:37:01,582 --> 00:37:02,612
(Level Two is...)

1054
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:04,682
- Yi Kyung.
- That's right.

1055
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,552
- That's correct. I'm Level Two.
- Yes.

1056
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:08,022
We picked good levels this time.

1057
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:09,592
- I was one step ahead of you.
- Right.

1058
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:11,362
- That was good.
- Next is...

1059
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,792
That was good.

1060
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,892
(Level Three is...)

1061
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:15,462
- Tae Hyun.
- That's right.

1062
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,332
- It must be around 4.
- I think it's 4.

1063
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:18,462
- Four or five?
- Four or five.

1064
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:20,632
- That's right.
- Nice.

1065
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:21,732
- It's perfect.
- I picked a good level.

1066
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:23,042
This will be good too.

1067
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,742
- Next is...
- This is...

1068
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,102
- Seung Ho.
- Right.

1069
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:28,372
- That's right.
- It's Level Six.

1070
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:29,512
- Exactly.
- Who's next?

1071
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:30,642
The next is...

1072
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:32,882
- Aren't you Level 7?
- Yes, I'm Level 7.

1073
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,912
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

1074
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:37,152
- You won this round.
- Okay!

1075
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,522
How nice was it not to choose the hard levels,

1076
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:40,622
- like Levels 3 and 5?
- Nice.

1077
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,322
We immediately succeeded with Levels 1, 2, 6, and 7.

1078
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:43,522
(Everything went in their favor this round.)

1079
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:45,392
Have you checked the level you chose?

1080
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:46,492
- Yes.
- Sure.

1081
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:50,632
How will you react when you come across your first love...

1082
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,032
on the street?

1083
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:56,202
Level One, a natural and nonchalant greeting.

1084
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:00,842
Level Seven, an awkward and flustered greeting.

1085
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,612
- When you meet your first love?
- That's a tough one.

1086
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:04,482
That's tough.

1087
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,712
This is difficult to do.

1088
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:07,182
An awkward hello?

1089
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:08,682
(A natural and nonchalant greeting, An awkward and flustered greeting)

1090
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,252
Let's give her a name.

1091
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,192
- A name?
- We'll go with the same name.

1092
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:14,992
- How about your wife's name?
- No way.

1093
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,292
(A flat refusal)

1094
00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:17,762
I won't be able to be serious.

1095
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,662
How about "Jik Nyeo?"

1096
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:20,732
Jik Nyeo?

1097
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:21,832
(The sassy Jik Nyeo who was Kyun Woo's first love?)

1098
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,832
Kyun Woo and Jik Nyeo.

1099
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,932
How about Hyun Sook?

1100
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,932
- Hyun Sook?
- That's our writer's name.

1101
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:29,002
You won't be able to take it seriously.

1102
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,342
- It's fine.
- Hyun Sook?

1103
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,502
- Hyun Sook?
- Yes, Hyun Sook.

1104
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:33,872
- Let's go with Hyun Sook.
- Yes, Hyun Sook.

1105
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:35,442
- Hyun Sook?
- Hyun Sook.

1106
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:37,112
"Hyun Sook." I quite like that.

1107
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:38,982
That's a good name. "Hey, Hyun Sook."

1108
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:39,982
(Hyun Sook has a name that feels like someone's first love.)

1109
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:41,812
How will you react...

1110
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,652
when you come across your first love Hyun Sook on the street?

1111
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,552
We'll start with Yi Kyung.

1112
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:48,152
What? Wait. Hyun Sook!

1113
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:50,792
(What? Wait. Hyun Sook!)

1114
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:53,392
Hyun Sook...

1115
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:54,832
What on earth?

1116
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,232
(Hyun Sook...)

1117
00:38:57,332 --> 00:38:58,402
Hyun Sook...

1118
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,672
(They start off with someone dying of a heart attack.)

1119
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,402
- That's obvious.
- There's only one possibility.

1120
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:05,802
- That's the one.
- I mean...

1121
00:39:06,872 --> 00:39:08,572
- That...
- Nothing can be stronger than that.

1122
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,082
The guy died.

1123
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:12,182
I was so flustered that I died.

1124
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:14,782
Okay, I get it for now.

1125
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:17,152
- Is it my turn?
- Ready, action.

1126
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:19,482
My gosh, Hyun Sook!

1127
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:21,192
My gosh, Hyun Sook!

1128
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,322
(Seung Ho greets her jumping up and down.)

1129
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,022
Hyun Sook...

1130
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,632
Hyun Sook? Hyun Sook, hi.

1131
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:29,462
Hyun Sook, it's good to see you.

1132
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:30,462
(Tae Hyun greets her casually.)

1133
00:39:30,462 --> 00:39:31,532
Okay.

1134
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:32,702
Hyun Sook.

1135
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:34,202
Hey, Hyun Sook.

1136
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:35,872
(Jang Hyuk keeps calling her name.)

1137
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:36,872
Hey, Hyun Sook.

1138
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,572
Hey.

1139
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,512
Hyun Sook?

1140
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,712
- Yes, that's me.
- Is that you?

1141
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:44,982
(Dong Hyun meets his first love on the street.)

1142
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,312
- You've gotten so tall.
- I know.

1143
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,452
I see.

1144
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,422
- You were only this tall.
- She's your first love.

1145
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,782
Should we shake hands?

1146
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:53,352
You're acting like she's a stranger.

1147
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,552
Be well.

1148
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:55,622
- Bye.
- Sure.

1149
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:56,692
(His confusing acting...)

1150
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:59,122
(leaves Sang Uk puzzled.)

1151
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:01,792
It's hard to guess the levels this time.

1152
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:05,162
Hold on a second. That was so confusing.

1153
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,232
Yi Kyung had the highest level.

1154
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:08,702
I drew Level Seven.

1155
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:10,672
- Okay.
- Below that is Seung Ho.

1156
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:12,272
Yi Kyung died, remember?

1157
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:13,772
Aren't you levels 7 and 6? Of course.

1158
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:14,912
(Seung Ho drew Level Six and showed that by jumping.)

1159
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,342
I think Tae Hyun drew the lowest level.

1160
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:18,482
Tae Hyun?

1161
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:20,412
- Level Two.
- Of course.

1162
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:21,682
That much was obvious.

1163
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:23,882
You only have to guess which levels they were.

1164
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:25,582
Of course.

1165
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:27,152
These two were so confusing.

1166
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:29,192
- So?
- Hyun Sook...

1167
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,392
- Hyun Sook.
- "Hyun Sook?"

1168
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:31,692
- Hey, Hyun Sook.
- "Hey, Hyun Sook."

1169
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:32,792
(Hyuk kept calling Hyun Sook's name.)

1170
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,192
- This is a tough one.
- Was he trying to be natural?

1171
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,332
I'm lost.

1172
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,832
(Looking away)

1173
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,132
Well...

1174
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:42,332
(Who drew the level above Tae Hyun's?)

1175
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:44,002
- Above Tae Hyun.
- After Tae Hyun, it's...

1176
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:46,842
Hold on.

1177
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:48,242
(Looking away)

1178
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:50,342
- Was it Hyuk?
- I think it was.

1179
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:53,012
(Did Jang Hyuk draw the level that was above Tae Hyun's?)

1180
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:55,212
- Was I right?
- I drew Level Five!

1181
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:56,252
(Dong Hyun had the middle one at Level 5.)

1182
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:57,822
- I switched at the last second.
- At the last second?

1183
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,152
- No way.
- He actually got it.

1184
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,992
Do you know why I knew...

1185
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:02,992
- it wasn't Dong Hyun?
- Why?

1186
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,792
When he wants you to choose him,

1187
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,222
he looks at you.

1188
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:07,892
(Dong Hyun flashes his gaze when he wants to be chosen.)

1189
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,132
But earlier...

1190
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,902
(A second ago...)

1191
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,372
(It's not me.)

1192
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:15,432
(It's not me, okay?)

1193
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:16,602
He got it again.

1194
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,402
- You got it.
- Okay, nice. Good job.

1195
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,512
You got 2 right, and now there's 1 more to go.

1196
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,512
(The long-awaited final round, Round 4)

1197
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,772
What will it be? Who'll be guessing it?

1198
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,682
Why don't I give it a try?

1199
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:27,112
- Are you sure you can do it?
- Come on.

1200
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,882
Okay, fine. I'll put my trust in you.

1201
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:31,498
Don't worry. I've been guessing correctly all evening.

1202
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:32,058
Okay.

1203
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,732
Okay, fine. I'll put my trust in you.

1204
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,902
Don't worry.

1205
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:36,442
I've been guessing correctly all evening.

1206
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,472
Okay.

1207
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:38,642
- All right.
- What's the situation?

1208
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:40,912
You agreed to treat your friends to a meal.

1209
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:43,012
How would you feel...

1210
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,642
if one of them kept ordering extra dishes without thinking?

1211
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:46,682
Level One,

1212
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:49,482
letting it slide without looking uncomfortable.

1213
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:50,852
Level Seven,

1214
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:53,692
stopping that friend with visible anger.

1215
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:55,752
Getting angry with that friend.

1216
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:56,822
And telling him to stop ordering.

1217
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,362
- Let's get this one too.
- Sure.

1218
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:01,432
Okay, we'll start with Hyuk.

1219
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:02,932
Action.

1220
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:04,862
- Let's order more.
- Are you enjoying yourself?

1221
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:06,632
Let's order more. Whelk, please.

1222
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:09,202
- Are you enjoying the food?
- Yes.

1223
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:11,502
Is that so?

1224
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,272
Are you going to have some more?

1225
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:16,742
Sure. Keep ordering more food.

1226
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:21,382
I see.

1227
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:22,382
(This won't be easy.)

1228
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,152
- Okay.
- That was his intensity.

1229
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:25,322
Okay.

1230
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:27,252
- Tae Hyun looks worried.
- Tae Hyun, are you ready?

1231
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,322
(It's Tae Hyun's turn to treat his friends.)

1232
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:29,422
Right, okay.

1233
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,722
Ready, action.

1234
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,062
Ma'am, can we get another dish of this?

1235
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:34,632
- We'll order the priciest dish.
- This too.

1236
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:36,032
Tae Hyun's buying today.

1237
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:37,162
- Hey.
- Guys, have some more.

1238
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:38,302
It's on Tae Hyun today.

1239
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,132
- Hey.
- Ara, please!

1240
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:41,302
Sure, let's order that.

1241
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:42,572
Stop it.

1242
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:43,602
Is that new on the menu?

1243
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,002
We'll order that too.

1244
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,002
We don't have to order that much.

1245
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:47,812
I'll order five more portions to take home.

1246
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:49,812
- Stop that. You've ordered enough.
- Can we order six plates?

1247
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:51,642
Don't overdo it.

1248
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,452
(Okay, got it.)

1249
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:55,812
Next up is Yi Kyung.

1250
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:59,082
- Be the friend ordering food.
- Ready, action.

1251
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:00,092
Yi Kyung's buying today.

1252
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:01,352
(A furious voice strikes hard.)

1253
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,262
Stop eating, you pig!

1254
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:04,262
Hey.

1255
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:05,962
You're not here to have a whole meal, you know.

1256
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,032
What's your problem?

1257
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,762
You're not here to have a whole meal.

1258
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,202
Why are you ordering so much when we only got together for drinks?

1259
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:12,932
- Hey!
- Cancel that order.

1260
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:14,272
- You know I'm older, right?
- Cancel it.

1261
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:15,732
- I'm older than you.
- Cancel it!

1262
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:16,742
(Something worse might happen if he doesn't cancel the order.)

1263
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:19,142
Come on. You said you were buying.

1264
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,272
(He's busy acting and also guessing.)

1265
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:22,812
(The intense acting came from deep within.)

1266
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:24,042
There you go.

1267
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,412
- Obvious, isn't it?
- It sure is.

1268
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:30,422
No wonder he wanted me to be the one ordering food.

1269
00:43:30,422 --> 00:43:33,252
What if someone has a level higher than his?

1270
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:35,892
It'd be hilarious if someone's level is higher than Yi Kyung's.

1271
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:36,962
Do what you need to do.

1272
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,122
- Seung Ho's up.
- I'll be quick.

1273
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:40,232
Ready, action.

1274
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:41,862
- Go ahead and order.
- Ara, please.

1275
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:43,262
- Order what you want.
- Really?

1276
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:44,502
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1277
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:45,932
I'll order everything expensive.

1278
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:48,772
- I'll have the raw fish combo.
- Well...

1279
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:51,202
I'll order more to take home.

1280
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:52,302
I'll order some to-go.

1281
00:43:52,302 --> 00:43:54,612
- Sure, order what you want.
- I don't eat here often.

1282
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:55,942
How about some conch?

1283
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:56,942
- Conch?
- Sure thing.

1284
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:58,882
Order everything. We'll pay for the table next to us.

1285
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,352
Well... Sure.

1286
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:02,482
Go ahead.

1287
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:04,322
(Seung Ho's flustered, but he tells his friend to order.)

1288
00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:07,092
Sang Uk's up. Ready, action.

1289
00:44:07,552 --> 00:44:10,222
Sang Uk's buying, so let's order everything we can.

1290
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:12,262
- The raw fish combo and...
- I already ordered for us.

1291
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,062
- The raw fish combo!
- Stop it.

1292
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:15,932
- What if I did the same to you?
- You don't have to eat it all.

1293
00:44:15,932 --> 00:44:17,932
- You shouldn't do this.
- Try a bite of everything.

1294
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:18,962
We'll pay for the table next to us.

1295
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:20,732
- Don't be like that.
- Okay.

1296
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:21,772
Stop it.

1297
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:22,932
Order the expensive kind.

1298
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,542
Okay.

1299
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,042
(The older brothers were immersed in the others' passionate acting.)

1300
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,212
Goodness.

1301
00:44:27,212 --> 00:44:28,972
That was a decent scene you created.

1302
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:30,342
This is fun.

1303
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,782
I'd love to play another round.

1304
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:36,182
(He found the true joy...)

1305
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:37,652
(of Ready, Action! only in the final round.)

1306
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:40,622
This is one of the main games we play in this show.

1307
00:44:40,622 --> 00:44:41,922
There's a certain anticipation.

1308
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:42,922
(Hyuk's enjoying himself more than he did in Pilates.)

1309
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:45,192
Okay. I'll even guess the right level.

1310
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:47,992
- No one asked you to do that.
- Really?

1311
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,232
- Okay, fine.
- Just guess the correct order.

1312
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:52,962
All right. Here goes. The one with the highest level.

1313
00:44:53,502 --> 00:44:54,702
One of you drew Level Seven.

1314
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:56,272
Yi Kyung.

1315
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,342
Don't guess the level. I was only Level Six.

1316
00:44:58,342 --> 00:44:59,342
Six?

1317
00:44:59,672 --> 00:45:02,072
- Level 6?
- Okay, fine. Level 6.

1318
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,382
There's also someone who drew Level Five.

1319
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:06,142
Sang Uk drew Level Five.

1320
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:08,052
- I'm sure of it.
- I had Level Four.

1321
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,312
Four?

1322
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,252
No wonder I was confused.

1323
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:12,782
- There's a Level Three.
- There are levels 1 to 3.

1324
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:14,252
No wonder it was tough.

1325
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,862
- Hold on a second.
- I have no idea.

1326
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:18,362
- Okay.
- Levels 1 to 3.

1327
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:20,192
- I'll start with Level One.
- Start with the lowest level.

1328
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:21,432
Seung Ho drew Level One.

1329
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:23,232
Seung Ho's Level One.

1330
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:27,232
- Something went wrong.
- What?

1331
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:29,332
You're Level Two?

1332
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:30,842
(Everyone looks flustered.)

1333
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,772
- But...
- I thought he was Level One.

1334
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,272
I thought he drew Level One as well.

1335
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,912
Anyway, I thought Tae Hyun drew Level Three.

1336
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:38,542
- You're right on.
- Level Three.

1337
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:41,512
- Are you Level One, Hyuk?
- I thought Hyuk was Level One.

1338
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,952
- Are you Level One?
- I drew Level One.

1339
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:44,382
Exactly. That's what I thought.

1340
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:46,692
- Levels 1 and 2 were tough.
- They were tough to tell apart.

1341
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,652
Here's what I thought.

1342
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,822
The volume of Hyuk's voice made it seem like Level One,

1343
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:52,822
and Seung Ho said his lines much louder.

1344
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:55,462
However, Seung Ho kept telling me to order the food,

1345
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,462
while Hyuk expressed his frustration with his eyes.

1346
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:00,102
That's what confused me.

1347
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:02,072
That's my bad.

1348
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,502
Dong Hyun, you said you'd be guessing the levels,

1349
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,042
but you didn't get any of them right.

1350
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:09,342
Levels 1 to 3 were tough to distinguish.

1351
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:10,642
Anyway,

1352
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,682
- that means we got 2 out of 4.
- You guessed 2 correctly.

1353
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:13,682
What happens now?

1354
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:15,982
Two of you can shower freely,

1355
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:19,052
while the other three will have to shower chained together.

1356
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:20,722
(The three of us will be chained together?)

1357
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:22,592
- Can't you give us another chance?
- Let us gamble.

1358
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:24,392
- Can't we gamble?
- Should we?

1359
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:25,892
I'm sure I can get it right.

1360
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:27,092
Let's gamble what we just won.

1361
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:29,962
Sure, let's go for it.

1362
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:31,262
- I'm serious.
- Yes.

1363
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:32,432
If we succeed this round,

1364
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:34,532
everyone can shower freely.

1365
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:35,772
If we fail,

1366
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:36,842
only one will shower freely,

1367
00:46:36,842 --> 00:46:38,142
and the rest will shower in pairs.

1368
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,042
- The rest will be tied up in pairs.
- That sounds fine, right?

1369
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,042
Deal?

1370
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,112
Deal.

1371
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,382
- I'll succeed no matter what.
- Win with that confidence.

1372
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:46,442
We're doing it again?

1373
00:46:46,442 --> 00:46:48,212
- I'll definitely get it right.
- You can do it.

1374
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:50,952
I observed their individual traits.

1375
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:53,152
and how they express it.

1376
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:55,592
I can definitely get it right.

1377
00:46:57,462 --> 00:46:58,492
What's the situation?

1378
00:46:58,492 --> 00:46:59,762
Let me read it.

1379
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:00,932
(Bonus Round, 5 individual showers versus 1 individual shower)

1380
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:03,702
How would you demand a refund...

1381
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:05,662
at a department store as a VIP?

1382
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:07,472
Level One says...

1383
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:10,702
with sophisticated words and actions.

1384
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,842
Making a sophisticated demand for a refund?

1385
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:13,342
- To get a refund...
- Level Seven says...

1386
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:15,472
making a scene so terrible...

1387
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:16,782
that people around will call the police.

1388
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:18,882
"Shouldn't we call the police?"

1389
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:20,712
That's how bad Level Seven is.

1390
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,912
- Okay.
- Let's start with Tae Hyun.

1391
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:23,422
- Sophisticated?
- Can we start from here?

1392
00:47:23,422 --> 00:47:24,922
- Let's start with me.
- You want to start?

1393
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:25,922
- Yes.
- Okay.

1394
00:47:25,922 --> 00:47:27,192
- You must be confident.
- My goodness.

1395
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:28,292
He seems worried.

1396
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:29,852
Ready,

1397
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:31,562
action.

1398
00:47:32,192 --> 00:47:33,562
Welcome, sir.

1399
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:37,332
I bought these shoes from here last time.

1400
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,732
- Yes, I remember.
- These shoes.

1401
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:41,472
- How...
- I bought size 280,

1402
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,642
but my toes bent.

1403
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:46,142
It's because the shoe follows the US size.

1404
00:47:46,142 --> 00:47:48,472
What do you mean by the US size?

1405
00:47:48,472 --> 00:47:50,582
The whole world should have the same standard!

1406
00:47:50,582 --> 00:47:53,852
If it's size 280, it should be 28cm!

1407
00:47:53,852 --> 00:47:54,982
It's worn by Michael Jordan.

1408
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:56,682
- Can you see it or not?
- I can see it.

1409
00:47:56,822 --> 00:47:58,522
(But the terrible customer isn't easy to handle.)

1410
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:00,392
- I can see it, but...
- Can you see it?

1411
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:02,852
I bought size 280mm,

1412
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:06,062
but this is definitely 278mm!

1413
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:07,432
He's so detailed.

1414
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:09,932
- No way.
- My toes hurt!

1415
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:11,402
- His foot...
- They hurt!

1416
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:12,732
I'll exchange them to a new pair.

1417
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,272
- Will you?
- Yes, I'll exchange them.

1418
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:15,702
Okay, fine.

1419
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:18,502
- No wonder he was confident.
- Give me two pairs.

1420
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:19,642
Give me two pairs.

1421
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,472
He had the perfect size.

1422
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:22,972
He had it.

1423
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:24,512
He was confident for a reason.

1424
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:25,942
Are you ready?

1425
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:27,852
Ready,

1426
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:29,252
action.

1427
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:30,552
Hello, sir.

1428
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:31,622
I'd like a refund, please.

1429
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:33,282
Hello, sir.

1430
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:34,392
I'd like a refund, please.

1431
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,052
- Refund what...
- Give me a refund!

1432
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,722
- Refund what?
- How many times must I say it?

1433
00:48:37,862 --> 00:48:41,532
- How many times must I say it?
- Sir, I...

1434
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:42,592
(The salesperson's right shoe)

1435
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:44,532
- Give me a refund!
- Sir.

1436
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:46,402
How many times must I say it?

1437
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:48,532
- Call the police.
- Give me a refund!

1438
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:49,872
Okay.

1439
00:48:49,872 --> 00:48:51,872
(The poor salesperson is having a rough day today.)

1440
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:53,172
Hold on.

1441
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:55,842
(The employees are someone's precious family member.)

1442
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:57,112
Sang Uk, your shoe...

1443
00:48:57,842 --> 00:48:59,412
- Should I go next?
- Hold on.

1444
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:01,082
- My gosh.
- Let's move on quickly.

1445
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:02,552
There's a flow to it.

1446
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:03,752
Wait. Do you have...

1447
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:04,922
a mouth guard?

1448
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:06,852
- I think...
- You're right.

1449
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:08,552
If the remaining person is Level Seven, I might really die.

1450
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:10,922
- It'll be simple.
- This is bad.

1451
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:13,262
- It'll be simple.
- Seung Ho is pretty intense.

1452
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:15,132
Gosh, hold on.

1453
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:17,132
- I bought these shoes.
- Yes.

1454
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:20,802
- It smells like crap.
- It smells terrible.

1455
00:49:21,202 --> 00:49:22,872
(The smell of new shoes makes him swear.)

1456
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:23,942
This...

1457
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:25,172
It's a piece of rubbish. I want a refund.

1458
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:26,342
That's how it should be.

1459
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,872
It's a smell edition.

1460
00:49:27,872 --> 00:49:29,612
- "Smell edition." - It's supposed to smell.

1461
00:49:29,612 --> 00:49:31,082
- It's a smell edition?
- It's supposed to smell?

1462
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:33,112
You should've told me in advance, then.

1463
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:34,112
I didn't know...

1464
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:35,782
- it was a smell edition.
- Yes, it's supposed to...

1465
00:49:35,782 --> 00:49:36,982
Is it supposed to smell?

1466
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:38,282
- Yes, it's vintage.
- Smell it.

1467
00:49:38,282 --> 00:49:39,682
- Yes, it's vintage.
- Smell it.

1468
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:41,592
(Disgusted)

1469
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,222
It does smell terrible, but that's because it's a smell edition.

1470
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,322
I didn't know.

1471
00:49:45,322 --> 00:49:46,892
If it's an edition, I'll wear it.

1472
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:47,932
Okay.

1473
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:49,332
Thank you.

1474
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:51,162
- See you.
- About that much.

1475
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:52,632
This... I see.

1476
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:54,672
- This much.
- Hyuk...

1477
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:57,072
Let's go. Ready,

1478
00:49:57,402 --> 00:49:58,442
action.

1479
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,812
- I bought these shoes.
- Yes.

1480
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:02,412
But they don't fit.

1481
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:03,612
- Goodness.
- Well,

1482
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,312
that could happen, but...

1483
00:50:05,312 --> 00:50:07,212
It could be because your feet swelled in the morning.

1484
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,852
- My feet swelled in the morning?
- Yes.

1485
00:50:09,212 --> 00:50:11,082
I guess that's possible.

1486
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,422
That's why...

1487
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:13,822
Can I get a refund?

1488
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:15,192
I'm sorry, but I can't give you a refund.

1489
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,452
You can't? But...

1490
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:18,162
I'm the VIP here.

1491
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:19,762
- Please give me a refund.
- I'm sorry.

1492
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:22,192
Even if the CEO comes, I can't give a refund.

1493
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:23,632
(He is very uncompromising with the refund.)

1494
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:26,232
If that's the case... Okay.

1495
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:27,372
I'm sorry.

1496
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:30,032
- You can see it until here, right?
- I can.

1497
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:32,402
I can see the order. Tae Hyun, wrap it up.

1498
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:33,642
- You need to do a good job.
- Okay.

1499
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:35,072
- Do you get it?
- Ready,

1500
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:37,242
action. Hello, sir.

1501
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,642
Hello. I bought...

1502
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:41,012
- these shoes.
- Yes.

1503
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:44,022
I don't think they fit nicely.

1504
00:50:44,022 --> 00:50:46,322
Shoes from overseas tend to be smaller.

1505
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:47,322
- Really?
- Yes.

1506
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:48,422
If that's the case,

1507
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:50,422
- I'll try to stretch them.
- Sure.

1508
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,392
Your feet could swell...

1509
00:50:52,392 --> 00:50:53,562
- They are quite pretty.
- in the morning too.

1510
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:55,932
- They are quite pretty.
- Yes.

1511
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:58,302
- They're pretty.
- I agree.

1512
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:00,132
I'll just wear them since they're pretty.

1513
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:01,602
- Yes, they're quite nice.
- Okay.

1514
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:03,202
I got it completely.

1515
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:04,502
- You did?
- Yes.

1516
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:06,002
- Nice.
- That was nice.

1517
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:07,512
- You must get it right.
- That was pretty well done.

1518
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,172
- You must get it right.
- That was good.

1519
00:51:09,472 --> 00:51:10,512
I'll say the lowest intensity first.

1520
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:11,542
Sure.

1521
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:12,912
The one with the lowest intensity...

1522
00:51:12,912 --> 00:51:14,152
- is Tae Hyun.
- Okay.

1523
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,952
I think he's Level Two.

1524
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:17,452
(Tae Hyun with the lowest intensity is Level 2?)

1525
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:18,522
He got it right.

1526
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:20,492
Sang Uk is good.

1527
00:51:20,492 --> 00:51:21,922
Next,

1528
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:23,522
- Hyuk.
- What's his number?

1529
00:51:23,762 --> 00:51:25,162
I think he's...

1530
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:27,362
- Level Three?
- You're right.

1531
00:51:27,362 --> 00:51:28,632
- You're right.
- Level Three.

1532
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:29,792
Level Three.

1533
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,432
I thought so.

1534
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:34,072
- Next, Seung Ho.
- What's the number?

1535
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:36,232
- Seung Ho is Level Five.
- You're doing great now.

1536
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:37,972
We won this.

1537
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:39,972
- Here.
- He even got the numbers right.

1538
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:42,642
Sang Uk is good at this game.

1539
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:45,012
Dong Hyun is Level Six.

1540
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:46,082
(I'm Level 6?)

1541
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:48,212
Stop acting. You're not good at it.

1542
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:51,082
Your nostrils give it away.

1543
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:53,082
I'm Level Six.

1544
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:54,252
(Dong Hyun, Level 6)

1545
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:56,952
Yi Kyung is Level Seven.

1546
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,422
(The bonus round is a complete success.)

1547
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:00,632
We did so well.

1548
00:52:00,632 --> 00:52:01,862
This is crazy.

1549
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:03,062
That was so neat.

1550
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:04,402
- That was so smooth.
- Good job.

1551
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:05,662
There's nothing I can say...

1552
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:07,102
since you even got the numbers right.

1553
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:08,672
Everyone gets to shower individually.

1554
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:10,702
(Thanks to Sang Uk, everyone can shower individually.)

1555
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,772
Everyone can shower individually.

1556
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:14,842
- Yes.
- I'll do it again.

1557
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:16,942
From now on, I'll temporarily lift...

1558
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:18,212
the Shortage in Privacy...

1559
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:19,682
so you can enjoy camping.

1560
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:21,452
Okay.

1561
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:23,482
- Take it off.
- Go take a shower...

1562
00:52:23,552 --> 00:52:26,252
and enjoy freely.

1563
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:28,092
- I got it.
- We finally can take it off.

1564
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,922
Shortage in Privacy lifted.

1565
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:32,692
- He was...
- That was fun.

1566
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:34,092
Thank you for coming, Hyuk.

1567
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:35,192
- I had fun today.
- You...

1568
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:37,562
- drove here.
- I had fun.

1569
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:39,402
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hyuk.

1570
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:40,872
- See you.
- Have fun.

1571
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:42,502
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

1572
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:44,202
- The exit is that way.
- It's that way.

1573
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,302
My bag is there.

1574
00:52:45,302 --> 00:52:47,142
He was so funny.

1575
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,012
I did my very best.

1576
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:50,582
- I'm off.
- Thank you.

1577
00:52:50,582 --> 00:52:51,712
See you.

1578
00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:56,612
(Hyuk.)

1579
00:52:56,612 --> 00:53:00,892
(You'll come back next time, right?)

1580
00:53:02,022 --> 00:53:09,792
(They each shower in privacy.)

1581
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,502
It's so cool and nice at night.

1582
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:15,902
(They have a light night snack before they sleep.)

1583
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,032
It really is.

1584
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:20,142
Hyuk was so funny.

1585
00:53:20,512 --> 00:53:22,342
- Tell him I said thank you.
- Okay.

1586
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,312
I asked, "Isn't the changed format more interesting?"

1587
00:53:24,312 --> 00:53:25,512
And he agreed.

1588
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:28,252
I think he enjoyed himself a lot more...

1589
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:29,512
than when he came last time.

1590
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:32,052
What will become of this show?

1591
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:34,092
- Will it change again to 4.0?
- Change again?

1592
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:35,352
- To 4.0?
- To 4.0?

1593
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:38,322
Has it been ten months since we started?

1594
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:40,832
When we first started the show,

1595
00:53:40,832 --> 00:53:42,162
we had to go to countryside and so on.

1596
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:43,262
Yes.

1597
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,832
- It was tough.
- Yes.

1598
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,662
That was the hardest for me.

1599
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,202
The first day of shooting.

1600
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:50,432
- Really?
- I didn't know what to do,

1601
00:53:50,432 --> 00:53:52,472
and it was my first time meeting you all.

1602
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:53,672
It was very raw.

1603
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:56,242
Dong Hyun drove,

1604
00:53:56,872 --> 00:53:58,942
and I thought I should do it.

1605
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:03,882
(Episode 1 of Handsome Guys, deciding who will drive)

1606
00:54:04,382 --> 00:54:09,452
(They had a scuffle-not-scuffle about how they were good drivers.)

1607
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:11,492
I sat in the passenger seat,

1608
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:13,122
but I was technically sleeping with my eyes open.

1609
00:54:13,122 --> 00:54:14,562
- I wasn't in my right mind.
- Right.

1610
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,492
I can't forget the first day too.

1611
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:18,232
When we were on the way there,

1612
00:54:18,232 --> 00:54:19,402
I thought I was going to poop my pants.

1613
00:54:19,532 --> 00:54:20,732
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

1614
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:22,372
- Why?
- I couldn't say...

1615
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:24,002
I wanted to go to toilet.

1616
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:27,372
(On the first day, he had a very bad stomachache,)

1617
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,342
(but he couldn't say it.)

1618
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:32,882
(After enduring it for so long, he barely said it.)

1619
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:36,412
(He's grabbing the belt too tightly for him to be okay.)

1620
00:54:36,782 --> 00:54:39,522
(The town hall toilet appeared like a miracle.)

1621
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:40,792
It's so small.

1622
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:45,022
(Both the toilet and a variety show were too much for Sang Uk.)

1623
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:47,532
Seriously...

1624
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:49,292
(The memory of it makes him feel dizzy even now.)

1625
00:54:49,932 --> 00:54:52,702
Everyone seems to be smarter than me here.

1626
00:54:52,902 --> 00:54:54,872
I rank third here.

1627
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:56,732
- Third? Hold on.
- Yes.

1628
00:54:56,732 --> 00:54:58,372
You think you're better than me.

1629
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,042
You're way beneath me.

1630
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:01,442
(You're way beneath me.)

1631
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:03,942
Shall I ask ChatGPT to give us an IQ test?

1632
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:05,012
- Do it.
- Let's do it.

1633
00:55:05,012 --> 00:55:06,512
- Seriously.
- Let's do it.

1634
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,952
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1635
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:09,182
Okay, then...

1636
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:11,452
you and Seung Ho should stay out of it.

1637
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:12,452
- Three of us.
- I'll...

1638
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:14,022
- do it seriously.
- Okay.

1639
00:55:14,392 --> 00:55:15,452
I'll list out the numbers.

1640
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:17,322
Guess what number the question mark is.

1641
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:19,322
- That sounds nice.
- It's that kind of quiz.

1642
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:20,592
How do you guess it?

1643
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:21,662
- You can do it.
- Like this.

1644
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:23,362
- That's IQ.
- My goodness.

1645
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:24,532
This looks good.

1646
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:25,932
Two.

1647
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,032
Six.

1648
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,202
Twelve.

1649
00:55:28,202 --> 00:55:29,232
Twenty, thirty.

1650
00:55:29,232 --> 00:55:30,332
What comes next?

1651
00:55:30,672 --> 00:55:31,902
Hold on, 2, 6, 12...

1652
00:55:31,902 --> 00:55:33,072
Forty-two.

1653
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:34,472
- Hold on.
- Forty-two.

1654
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:36,142
Wait, you're correct.

1655
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:38,342
- We're still talking.
- Come on.

1656
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:40,182
How did you know right away?

1657
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,812
You add 2, 4, 6,

1658
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:45,182
eight, ten, and twelve. That was clear as day.

1659
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:46,322
How...

1660
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,152
You got it only because you were sitting...

1661
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:49,322
next to him.

1662
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:50,522
Stop, it's over.

1663
00:55:50,522 --> 00:55:52,322
- Do I need to use my brain again?
- You're not the third smartest.

1664
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,892
- You're fourth.
- I'll stop now.

1665
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,062
- Fourth.
- Let's see who's the fourth.

1666
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:56,492
Fine, let's do it.

1667
00:55:56,492 --> 00:55:58,032
- Using my brain...
- Come on.

1668
00:55:58,032 --> 00:55:59,932
- I won't lose to you.
- Amazing.

1669
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:01,532
It's similar to the previous quiz.

1670
00:56:01,602 --> 00:56:02,972
- Three.
- Three.

1671
00:56:03,072 --> 00:56:04,342
Five.

1672
00:56:04,442 --> 00:56:05,642
Nine.

1673
00:56:05,772 --> 00:56:06,902
Seventeen.

1674
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:08,242
Thirty-three.

1675
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,042
Then a question mark.

1676
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:12,142
That's right.

1677
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:14,452
Three, five, nine, seventeen, thirty-three.

1678
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:15,952
- I got it.
- Sixty-five.

1679
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:17,722
- No.
- Sixty-five.

1680
00:56:18,282 --> 00:56:20,122
- Tae Hyun is right.
- See?

1681
00:56:20,122 --> 00:56:21,422
- It's 65?
- Yes.

1682
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,562
I beat him.

1683
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:26,522
My gosh.

1684
00:56:26,522 --> 00:56:27,562
You're in last place.

1685
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:29,092
- Why is it 65?
- What?

1686
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:31,432
- Two, four, eight, sixteen.
- What?

1687
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:32,602
Two.

1688
00:56:32,732 --> 00:56:34,872
Two plus two, then plus four.

1689
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:36,232
Eight, sixteen, thirty-two.

1690
00:56:36,232 --> 00:56:37,472
- They increase like this.
- Yes.

1691
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:38,502
- How...
- Plus four.

1692
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:39,572
That's right.

1693
00:56:39,572 --> 00:56:41,142
- Let's just sleep.
- Okay.

1694
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:42,672
- As I heard the question, - I'm in fourth place.

1695
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:44,042
- I heard the equation too.
- You're in fifth place.

1696
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:45,442
- Amazing.
- Just let it go.

1697
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:46,682
Will you finally accept it, Dong Hyun?

1698
00:56:46,682 --> 00:56:47,952
I'm going to sleep. Whatever.

1699
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:49,512
- Do you accept it?
- I don't.

1700
00:56:49,512 --> 00:56:51,022
- That was the pattern?
- Yes, it's the same.

1701
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:52,122
I won't accept it.

1702
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:53,252
Why are you so good?

1703
00:56:53,252 --> 00:56:55,252
I told you.

1704
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:58,592
- I'm off.
- We're going to sleep.

1705
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:00,322
- Okay.
- Bye.

1706
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:01,592
(It's time to sleep.)

1707
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:05,262
(I'll turn off the light.)

1708
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:08,402
(The oldest members with the lowest ranking...)

1709
00:57:08,402 --> 00:57:11,172
(goes to sleep right away.)

1710
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:13,872
(The younger members...)

1711
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:16,412
(ranked from 1st to 3rd are engrossed in their phones.)

1712
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:21,752
(But after a while, they fall asleep one by one.)

1713
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:31,162
(It's morning at the campsite.)

1714
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:34,732
(The first to wake up comes out with a rustle.)

1715
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:37,902
(Yi Kyung wakes up to the sound.)

1716
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:40,332
- Where are you going?
- Toilet.

1717
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:43,632
(Seung Ho wakes up early to go to the toilet.)

1718
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:48,972
(Yi Kyung goes back to bed.)

1719
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:51,412
(It's cold.)

1720
00:57:53,712 --> 00:57:56,252
(Sang Uk struggles to enter his sleeping bag.)

1721
00:57:57,352 --> 00:58:00,352
(He gives up and uses it as a blanket instead.)

1722
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:04,622
(Bored Seung Ho is pretending to be a staff member.)

1723
00:58:06,822 --> 00:58:09,262
(The old married couple acting sweet in the morning)

1724
00:58:10,132 --> 00:58:11,132
(Lumbering)

1725
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:13,462
(They struggle to wake up.)

1726
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:15,632
Gosh, Eu Ddeum.

1727
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,232
Eu Ddeum.

1728
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:18,842
(Tae Hyun feels the aftereffect of Pilates.)

1729
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:20,272
Gosh, Eu Ddeum.

1730
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:21,972
I was going to team up with you, but I won't.

1731
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:24,712
(He cuts Tae Hyun off immediately.)

1732
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:26,542
Sang Uk.

1733
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:28,482
Yes?

1734
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:33,382
(The youngest also wakes up when Seung Ho calls him.)

1735
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:35,452
Once you're wearing a mic,

1736
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:38,362
go into the tents one by one.

1737
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:44,162
(Shower tents set up according to the number of members)

1738
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,602
(There's a fishing stool in each tent.)

1739
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:49,202
(What's this game...)

1740
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:53,172
(that will affect the second day's privacy?)

1741
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,442
What? Go in here?

1742
00:58:55,642 --> 00:58:56,742
There's a chair.

1743
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,382
(Half-asleep, he enters the tent without knowing why.)

1744
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:07,122
(Determined)

1745
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:09,252
(He can't even open his eyes.)

1746
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,122
(What is happening?)

1747
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:15,832
(Half-asleep)

1748
00:59:16,192 --> 00:59:19,002
We'll play a team game, and if you win,

1749
00:59:19,462 --> 00:59:20,702
everyone can be freed from Shortage in Privacy.

1750
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:23,102
We'll play a game as soon as we wake up?

1751
00:59:23,902 --> 00:59:25,672
- It's a team game.
- A team game.

1752
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,202
This game is...

1753
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,912
Word Association Game.

1754
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:33,182
Members in Tents 1 and 2...

1755
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:35,582
will say the word that comes to their minds...

1756
00:59:35,582 --> 00:59:37,152
at the same time.

1757
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:38,582
- Water.
- Exercise.

1758
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,022
Water, exercise.

1759
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:43,492
After hearing that, Members in Tents 2 and 3...

1760
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,722
will say the word that is related to both words.

1761
00:59:45,892 --> 00:59:46,992
- Running.
- Jogging.

1762
00:59:47,162 --> 00:59:50,232
Tents 3 and 4, Tents 4 and 5, Tents 5 and 1 and so on...

1763
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:52,602
will say the word that comes to your minds at the same time.

1764
00:59:53,102 --> 00:59:56,232
You succeed if 2 of you say the same word in 10 rounds.

1765
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:58,042
If you succeed,

1766
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:01,142
everyone will be freed from Shortage in Privacy.

1767
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:02,812
If you fail,

1768
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:05,342
all five of you will be tied together.

1769
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,042
Wouldn't we get it right at least once?

1770
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,482
Don't overthink it.

1771
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:11,122
How many syllables must the word be?

1772
01:00:11,122 --> 01:00:12,822
There's no such rule.

1773
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,552
The number of syllables doesn't matter.

1774
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:16,622
He spends the whole game time trying to understand the rules.

1775
01:00:16,622 --> 01:00:17,692
Yes.

1776
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:18,992
(The dumbest member of Handsome Guys)

1777
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:20,362
The number of syllables doesn't matter.

1778
01:00:21,232 --> 01:00:22,832
Just say any word.

1779
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:24,862
Why did we choose Tents 1 and 2?

1780
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:26,962
- Any word...
- Once someone says a word,

1781
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,332
you can't repeat it.

1782
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:31,542
That... If it weren't for that rule, we would've definitely succeeded.

1783
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:34,442
Since you're ready, I'll start.

1784
01:00:34,912 --> 01:00:36,242
- Let's go.
- Tents 1 and 2.

1785
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:37,342
One, two, three.

1786
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,382
- Morning.
- Toilet.

1787
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:40,282
Morning and toilet.

1788
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:42,082
Tents 2 and 3, get ready.

1789
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:44,382
Morning and toilet, Tents 2 and 3.

1790
01:00:44,522 --> 01:00:45,582
One, two, three.

1791
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:46,582
- Poop.
- Poop.

1792
01:00:46,582 --> 01:00:47,592
One, two, three.

1793
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:48,592
- Poop.
- Poop.

1794
01:00:49,452 --> 01:00:51,162
- What?
- I kept thinking about it.

1795
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:52,522
- I kept thinking about it.
- What?

1796
01:00:52,522 --> 01:00:53,892
- This...
- I kept thinking about it.

1797
01:00:53,992 --> 01:00:55,332
Wasn't he a bit slow?

1798
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,262
(Video replay)

1799
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:58,802
(Poop! Poop...)

1800
01:00:58,962 --> 01:01:01,102
(Upon replaying it, they failed.)

1801
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:04,502
I thought it was Tents 3 and 4 after Tents 1 and 2.

1802
01:01:04,842 --> 01:01:06,042
- They want to poop.
- But...

1803
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:07,472
Morning and toilet? It has to be poop.

1804
01:01:07,472 --> 01:01:08,972
- I think they succeeded.
- That's true,

1805
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:10,112
but he was too slow.

1806
01:01:10,112 --> 01:01:12,382
- He sucks at stuff like this.
- That's how you play it.

1807
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:13,482
Why are you...

1808
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,882
"Poop" is just one syllable. Instead of saying it after him,

1809
01:01:16,112 --> 01:01:17,252
you should've said it at the same time.

1810
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:18,852
Why were you slow?

1811
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:22,052
I thought it was these two's turn after us.

1812
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:23,152
Amazing.

1813
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:24,692
I didn't think it was my turn.

1814
01:01:24,692 --> 01:01:27,122
Please edit that out. It was a practice match.

1815
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,462
- We'll let it slide.
- We'll let it slide.

1816
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:30,792
- We'll let it slide.
- We'll let it slide.

1817
01:01:31,002 --> 01:01:32,162
We always...

1818
01:01:32,162 --> 01:01:33,462
- We'll let it slide.
- Do you agree?

1819
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:35,332
We're with such an amazing production crew.

1820
01:01:35,332 --> 01:01:36,602
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

1821
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:41,212
You guys are so brazen. But you really did think of poop, right?

1822
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:42,872
We'll start from the right side.

1823
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:43,972
Okay.

1824
01:01:45,082 --> 01:01:46,142
One, two, three.

1825
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:47,212
- Camping.
- Arm.

1826
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:48,412
Goodness, harm.

1827
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:49,412
- Arm.
- Arm.

1828
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:51,382
- Arm?
- Arm or harm?

1829
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:52,682
- Arm.
- Arm?

1830
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:54,052
Tae Hyun and Yi Kyung.

1831
01:01:54,052 --> 01:01:55,352
(Camping plus arm?)

1832
01:01:55,352 --> 01:01:56,952
Let's go. One, two, three.

1833
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:57,992
- Tent.
- Meat.

1834
01:01:57,992 --> 01:01:58,992
(Tent, meat)

1835
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:00,692
What can I associate? I can't think of anything.

1836
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:02,292
Meat and tent?

1837
01:02:02,432 --> 01:02:04,192
- Yi Kyung and Sang Uk.
- Okay.

1838
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:06,102
Let's go. One, two, three.

1839
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,232
- Fire.
- Barbecue.

1840
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:08,972
Fire and barbecue.

1841
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:10,972
He already said meat, and you say barbecue?

1842
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:13,602
- That's Sang Uk for you.
- Yes.

1843
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,772
Sang Uk and Seung Ho.

1844
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:17,682
One, two, three.

1845
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:18,682
- Charcoal.
- Beef.

1846
01:02:18,682 --> 01:02:19,782
(Charcoal, beef)

1847
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:20,982
- Did he say meat again?
- Is beef not allowed?

1848
01:02:20,982 --> 01:02:22,152
Charcoal and beef.

1849
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:24,012
All he says is meat.

1850
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:26,522
We're almost there.

1851
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:28,222
- Charcoal...
- Charcoal and meat.

1852
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:29,222
- We're almost there.
- Right, there's charcoal.

1853
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:30,452
We're almost there.

1854
01:02:30,692 --> 01:02:32,392
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1855
01:02:32,392 --> 01:02:33,462
(Charcoal plus beef)

1856
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:34,732
Dong Hyun, are you ready?

1857
01:02:35,232 --> 01:02:36,562
One, two, three.

1858
01:02:36,562 --> 01:02:37,662
- Tongs.
- Rice.

1859
01:02:38,202 --> 01:02:39,432
Tongs and rice.

1860
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:41,572
- Tongs and rice?
- Tongs and rice?

1861
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:43,602
Tongs and rice.

1862
01:02:44,102 --> 01:02:45,372
The words got farther away.

1863
01:02:47,072 --> 01:02:48,872
Dong Hyun and Tae Hyun, let's go.

1864
01:02:48,872 --> 01:02:49,942
One, two, three.

1865
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:50,972
- Curry.
- Kimchi.

1866
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:52,012
(Curry, kimchi)

1867
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:53,612
You kept talking about curry...

1868
01:02:53,612 --> 01:02:57,212
- the whole day yesterday.
- I mean...

1869
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,122
I tried to think of something else.

1870
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:00,152
I would've gone with that...

1871
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,192
- if this was just about me.
- What did you think?

1872
01:03:01,422 --> 01:03:02,892
Whatever. I'll just say what I feel like saying.

1873
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:04,492
Here we go.

1874
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:05,662
One, two, three.

1875
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:06,762
- Potato.
- NORAZO.

1876
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:09,092
- NORAZO and potato.
- NORAZO.

1877
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,032
- NORAZO.
- I thought of NORAZO too.

1878
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:12,762
- Why NORAZO?
- NORAZO is known for "Curry."

1879
01:03:12,762 --> 01:03:13,802
NORAZO.

1880
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:15,172
Potato and NORAZO.

1881
01:03:15,272 --> 01:03:17,002
Wait. I can't think of anything.

1882
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:18,602
Let's go.

1883
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:20,742
One, two, three.

1884
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:21,912
- Sweet potato.
- Sweet potato.

1885
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,442
What?

1886
01:03:23,872 --> 01:03:25,042
- Sweet potato.
- Sweet potato.

1887
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:26,282
- What?
- Sweet potato.

1888
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:27,582
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk said sweet potato at the same time.)

1889
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:28,782
How did they think of sweet potato?

1890
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:30,612
Why sweet potato?

1891
01:03:30,782 --> 01:03:32,252
Sweet potato should come after potato.

1892
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:33,722
- Me too.
- You too?

1893
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,452
- You guys are amazing.
- Sweet potato.

1894
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:37,322
You thought of sweet potato?

1895
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:40,122
I don't think this happened just because...

1896
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:41,962
we're dumb and simple-minded.

1897
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:44,402
- I think we hit it off well.
- We do.

1898
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:45,462
That's amazing.

1899
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:47,162
- You said sweet potato?
- How is this possible?

1900
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:48,872
Is this game supposed to be this easy?

1901
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:51,302
Dong Hyun. You say it's easy,

1902
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:53,472
but didn't you only say rice and meat?

1903
01:03:53,472 --> 01:03:54,612
It's so easy.

1904
01:03:54,612 --> 01:03:56,772
Everyone is freed from Shortage in Privacy.

1905
01:03:57,372 --> 01:03:59,612
- We succeeded?
- Everyone will be untied.

1906
01:03:59,612 --> 01:04:02,912
You can shower and eat...

1907
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:04,652
comfortably and untied.

1908
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,952
- Yes.
- Amazing.

1909
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,152
- You guys...
- As for breakfast,

1910
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:09,622
we got a food truck.

1911
01:04:09,922 --> 01:04:11,422
- My gosh.
- Get your food from the truck...

1912
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:13,622
- and eat together here.
- That sounds nice.

1913
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:15,732
It would've been bad if we were all tied together.

1914
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:17,692
We'd have had to feed each other.

1915
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:19,432
The ones at the end would've had to feed us one by one.

1916
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:21,302
- Shall we go eat?
- Let's go eat.

1917
01:04:21,472 --> 01:04:22,502
This is incredible.

1918
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:25,102
It would've been funny if five of us were tied.

1919
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:26,242
This is amazing.

1920
01:04:27,142 --> 01:04:29,372
- Did you feel the chemistry?
- I think we could've done it.

1921
01:04:29,372 --> 01:04:31,312
It's not easy to say the same thing toward the end of the game.

1922
01:04:31,612 --> 01:04:32,612
Hello.

1923
01:04:32,942 --> 01:04:34,612
- Hello.
- Hello.

1924
01:04:35,282 --> 01:04:36,352
(Today's breakfast!)

1925
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,052
A food truck on Handsome Guys?

1926
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:40,852
(Welcome. It's your first time to a food truck, right?)

1927
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:43,322
(Enjoy your success.)

1928
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:48,862
(Various side dishes to fill your stomach for the day)

1929
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:51,932
(Warm seaweed soup to melt away your fatigue)

1930
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:54,802
(We even have sweet fruits!)

1931
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:58,102
- Nice.
- Five...

1932
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:01,042
- Imagine we had both hands tied.
- How do you do it?

1933
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:02,872
How do you scoop like this?

1934
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:04,742
One person has to scoop for all.

1935
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,082
Sir.

1936
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:07,852
- Oldest first.
- Goodness.

1937
01:05:07,852 --> 01:05:08,882
Oldest first.

1938
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:12,152
It would've been terrible if we had our hands tied.

1939
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:14,792
I like the side dishes.

1940
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,352
They must be flustered.

1941
01:05:16,692 --> 01:05:17,752
Exactly.

1942
01:05:17,752 --> 01:05:19,422
We work well together.

1943
01:05:19,592 --> 01:05:21,162
I think four of us work well together.

1944
01:05:21,162 --> 01:05:23,332
- Five.
- We succeed in everything we do.

1945
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:25,302
- Five.
- Four.

1946
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,332
- Five.
- Four. Definitely four.

1947
01:05:27,332 --> 01:05:29,772
Sang Uk, you should try to blend in.

1948
01:05:30,772 --> 01:05:33,102
You sleep late, Sang Uk.

1949
01:05:33,742 --> 01:05:36,012
(He ladles his seaweed soup into the bowl.)

1950
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:40,212
(He gets his members' soup too.)

1951
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:42,782
Dong Hyun finally started to be considerate of others.

1952
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:44,822
This? I'm getting two for myself.

1953
01:05:45,382 --> 01:05:47,652
(He's joking.)

1954
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:49,752
When you discuss the program restructuring,

1955
01:05:49,752 --> 01:05:51,492
please speak well of me.

1956
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:53,462
It looks delicious.

1957
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:57,032
Something quickly flashed through my mind.

1958
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,302
When we go back up, the new Life in Shortage will start.

1959
01:05:59,932 --> 01:06:01,632
What's there to be short of now?

1960
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:05,702
If we were tied up, we couldn't even sit like this here.

1961
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:07,242
We technically couldn't eat.

1962
01:06:07,772 --> 01:06:09,272
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1963
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:11,112
- Enjoy your food.
- Enjoy your food.

1964
01:06:11,742 --> 01:06:13,112
I can't believe this.

1965
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:14,782
(A filling and generous breakfast)

1966
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:16,912
It's delicious.

1967
01:06:16,912 --> 01:06:19,252
(Eating well)

1968
01:06:22,022 --> 01:06:23,592
(Satisfied)

1969
01:06:23,592 --> 01:06:24,592
It's nice.

1970
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:27,932
(The older members eat as well.)

1971
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,732
There's no shortage whatsoever.

1972
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,562
We're just eating breakfast on a camping trip.

1973
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:36,672
It has been a while since I had such a hearty breakfast.

1974
01:06:37,302 --> 01:06:40,942
(They eat as they enjoy the camping vibe.)

1975
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,912
I'll do this for the team.

1976
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:46,812
Sir, would you like some sicklepod tea?

1977
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:48,552
Your eyes will become healthy.

1978
01:06:48,912 --> 01:06:50,152
- There isn't any more.
- No?

1979
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:51,352
- My goodness.
- I'm sorry.

1980
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:54,222
(He takes care of the younger members as well.)

1981
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:56,392
- Thank you.
- Dong Hyun, are there ice and Coke?

1982
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:57,922
There aren't ice and Coke, you punk.

1983
01:06:58,692 --> 01:07:00,562
(Laughing)

1984
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:02,262
I'm full.

1985
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:03,262
(They're full.)

1986
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:06,502
(They have a therapeutic moment without any shortage.)

1987
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:09,772
Did you enjoy the meal you've earned...

1988
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:11,442
through Word Association Game?

1989
01:07:11,442 --> 01:07:12,872
- Yes.
- Yes, we enjoyed the meal.

1990
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:14,972
What's the next shortage?

1991
01:07:15,412 --> 01:07:16,772
Bring it on.

1992
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:19,042
We have good teamwork.

1993
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:21,552
During the remaining time,

1994
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:23,552
you'll work to remedy the overflowing individualism.

1995
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:26,452
You'll get tied up again for Shortage in Privacy.

1996
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:28,092
(Excuse me?)

1997
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:30,209
You'll work to remedy the overflowing individualism.

1998
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:33,549
You'll get tied up again for Shortage in Privacy.

1999
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,219
(Excuse me?)

2000
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:36,419
Weren't we done with that?

2001
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,119
Originally...

2002
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:40,219
All five members will be tied up.

2003
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,229
(What?)

2004
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,229
Didn't they come up with something that wasn't on the schedule?

2005
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:46,029
This wasn't on the schedule.

2006
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:48,229
- What do we do afterward?
- Now, we'll need to have...

2007
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:50,769
Shortage in Screentime.

2008
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:53,199
You were 100 percent certain that we'd fail, right?

2009
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:55,569
Yes.

2010
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:57,139
"Yes."

2011
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,839
(The production crew didn't expect them to do well.)

2012
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:01,179
- I love your honesty.
- Okay. We understand.

2013
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:02,409
We understand.

2014
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,609
Okay. We'll fill up the screentime.

2015
01:08:04,609 --> 01:08:06,149
(We love you, Handsome Guys.)

2016
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:09,619
It was a tasty meal.

2017
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,189
Let's wash up quickly.

2018
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,529
(They get ready separately while enjoying the last freedom.)

2019
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,029
(Handsome Guys gather around once more.)

2020
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:19,029
The sun...

2021
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:20,359
It's suddenly like this.

2022
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,999
Like I've explained earlier, we don't have enough screentime.

2023
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:24,299
Screentime.

2024
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:26,099
If the five of us are getting tied up,

2025
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,999
we'll need to decide on the positions...

2026
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,969
because people at the ends will have one hand that's free.

2027
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,539
- Will we get tied up in a line?
- Yes.

2028
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:34,139
(People at the ends will have one hand that's free.)

2029
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:36,409
(Glancing over)

2030
01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:38,009
In that case, shouldn't those with long arms go...

2031
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:39,649
to the ends?

2032
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,219
In the order we're sitting?

2033
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:42,419
Is anyone left-handed?

2034
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:45,419
- Hey.
- I'm left-handed.

2035
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:48,989
Then let's take the aesthetic route.

2036
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,429
The two tallest members should take the ends. The youngest one.

2037
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:56,799
We'll look after and protect the older members.

2038
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:59,599
To be honest, the tallest members always get such benefits.

2039
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:01,269
The two shortest members should take the ends.

2040
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:02,309
Okay.

2041
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:05,009
The ones with long arms should take the ends.

2042
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:07,509
Compared to my height, I have a long reach.

2043
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,749
If it's longer than mine, I'll let you take one end.

2044
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:11,949
(They argue fiercely to take the ends.)

2045
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,249
Shall we throw our shoes?

2046
01:09:13,919 --> 01:09:15,849
I'm good at shoe-throwing. I'll place first.

2047
01:09:16,049 --> 01:09:18,189
Let's stand here and throw our shoes.

2048
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:19,919
The one whose shoe is the closest to the target will win.

2049
01:09:19,919 --> 01:09:21,459
Then let's do it over there...

2050
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,589
- where the lawn ends.
- Okay.

2051
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:24,589
(They decide to throw shoes at the end of the lawn.)

2052
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:27,029
The one whose shoe is the closest to the target will win.

2053
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:30,299
The person who does this should be exempt...

2054
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,099
from any types of shortage today.

2055
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:33,669
Sticking a shoe on here.

2056
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,339
That should be rewarded.

2057
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:37,309
- I'll do it for real.
- That'll be rewarded.

2058
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:38,809
- All right.
- How will you stick the shoe?

2059
01:09:38,809 --> 01:09:40,639
- That'll be rewarded.
- Now,

2060
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:43,849
I want someone to do it and be exempt from shortage.

2061
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:46,179
It's okay to hit the target,

2062
01:09:46,179 --> 01:09:47,579
- but you'll place last if it falls.
- Yes.

2063
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:48,789
You'll place last if it falls.

2064
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:50,549
- Okay.
- Dong Hyun will go first.

2065
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:51,819
(Number 1 player, Kim Dong Hyun enters.)

2066
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:53,959
I'll afraid that I'll hit it and make it fall.

2067
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:56,689
The distance from the target will determine the rankings.

2068
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:57,829
(He aims for the camera as he goes over the rules.)

2069
01:09:58,699 --> 01:09:59,799
Hey.

2070
01:10:00,599 --> 01:10:01,599
Hey.

2071
01:10:01,799 --> 01:10:02,999
Okay.

2072
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,699
(Was his aim successful? Dong Hyun did pretty well.)

2073
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:05,969
Come here. Where are you going?

2074
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:07,399
- Should I wait there? Okay.
- You only get one chance.

2075
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:08,909
My socks are getting wet.

2076
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,809
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2077
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:13,139
Send it over the target.

2078
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:15,879
Stick the shoe.

2079
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,079
Okay. I won.

2080
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:19,849
I think I'll win.

2081
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,249
We're going in the order of age.

2082
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:24,889
(Number 3 player, Lee Yi Kyung)

2083
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:26,119
Send it over.

2084
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,589
(My goodness)

2085
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:31,429
What?

2086
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,059
It's a hole-in-one.

2087
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:35,169
(It seemed to fall short.)

2088
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:36,769
(Then it spun and got very close to the target.)

2089
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:39,569
Yi Kyung, that was a birdie.

2090
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,569
- That was a hole-in-one.
- Seriously.

2091
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,569
(Happy)

2092
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:44,139
He's good at everything.

2093
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:47,279
(Number 4 player who is nervous, Shin Seung Ho)

2094
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:53,219
Seung Ho and I...

2095
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:54,889
(Seung Ho's shoe is very close to Yi Kyung's.)

2096
01:10:55,049 --> 01:10:57,089
The two of them are good at everything.

2097
01:10:57,089 --> 01:10:59,889
- Seriously.
- Why are we playing this game?

2098
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,059
Seriously, what's up with the two of them?

2099
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:02,929
Yi Kyung's shoe is closer.

2100
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:04,259
- Mine is closer.
- Yi Kyung.

2101
01:11:04,629 --> 01:11:05,959
What's up with him?

2102
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:08,999
(Pitiful)

2103
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:10,399
The order has been decided.

2104
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,839
(Disappointed)

2105
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:14,369
- I should be good with my feet.
- Last place.

2106
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:17,309
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Second place.

2107
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:19,679
Third place is meaningless.

2108
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,009
Let's stand up...

2109
01:11:23,009 --> 01:11:24,449
- and decide on the positions.
- Okay.

2110
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:25,779
Then they can tie as we are.

2111
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:26,979
For goodness' sake.

2112
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:28,649
Which spot is better?

2113
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:30,489
I'll take...

2114
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:31,889
the middle spot.

2115
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,159
(The middle spot?)

2116
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:37,359
Hold on. Who placed third?

2117
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:39,229
- Me.
- I placed fourth.

2118
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,729
I'll take the middle spot.

2119
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:42,499
I'll get dragged around.

2120
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:43,969
Really?

2121
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:45,469
(Position assignment: Yi Kyung in the middle)

2122
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:46,569
That gives me hope.

2123
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:48,709
Which spot do you want?

2124
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,409
I'm left-handed, so I want to left end.

2125
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:53,379
- Then I'll take this spot.
- Okay.

2126
01:11:53,379 --> 01:11:54,579
- Really?
- Yes.

2127
01:11:55,009 --> 01:11:56,149
Third place is next.

2128
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,649
That makes me hesitant.

2129
01:11:58,249 --> 01:12:00,179
(Laughing)

2130
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:02,449
Why? I'm hesitant...

2131
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:04,219
because the two of them are smart.

2132
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,559
Smart people must've chosen the middle spots for a reason.

2133
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:09,229
It's meaningless.

2134
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:11,229
I wanted to go to the end.

2135
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:12,299
(He feels like something is off.)

2136
01:12:12,299 --> 01:12:14,029
(He thinks about it again.)

2137
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,699
No. I'll take the left end.

2138
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,129
(He takes the left end without changing his mind.)

2139
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:18,669
- Okay.
- How about you?

2140
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:19,839
- I'll take this spot.
- Really?

2141
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:20,999
- Like this?
- Like this.

2142
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:22,039
Okay.

2143
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:24,369
- We were sitting in this order.
- What?

2144
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:25,879
What?

2145
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,139
In some ways, we're like fools.

2146
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:28,479
(Nothing changes even if they play games.)

2147
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:30,349
You need a top with long sleeves.

2148
01:12:30,349 --> 01:12:31,849
(Let's tie ourselves.)

2149
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:33,619
(My goodness)

2150
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,389
I won't be able to do anything as I want.

2151
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,489
(All Handsome Guys are linked!)

2152
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:41,159
- Let's go.
- Since you've enjoyed camping,

2153
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,989
- you should wrap up the trip.
- Okay.

2154
01:12:43,089 --> 01:12:44,929
Please take down the tent.

2155
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:45,929
Like this?

2156
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:47,729
(Unbelievable)

2157
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:49,599
(Take down the tent?)

2158
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,769
(Oh!)

2159
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,269
We can't do anything.

2160
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,409
(The members at the ends will need to work.)

2161
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:57,439
We can't do anything.

2162
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,939
- Okay.
- You guys can still work.

2163
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:03,179
- You guys are on your own.
- The two members at the ends.

2164
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,119
- All right.
- We'll get miscellaneous tasks.

2165
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,149
Let's stick together. Help me with your hands.

2166
01:13:09,149 --> 01:13:10,589
Go ahead and work.

2167
01:13:10,589 --> 01:13:12,319
- Help me. Grab this.
- Hurry up.

2168
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,689
- Hurry up and work.
- Grab this.

2169
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:17,589
- Hurry up and work.
- You can pull it out.

2170
01:13:17,589 --> 01:13:19,599
- You can pull it out.
- Our arms are tied.

2171
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:21,029
You can pull it out.

2172
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,369
It isn't easy since our arms are tied.

2173
01:13:22,369 --> 01:13:23,799
For goodness' sake.

2174
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:24,899
Pull it out.

2175
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:26,199
Grab it and pull it out.

2176
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:27,239
Pull it out like a radish.

2177
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,239
- Okay.
- Okay.

2178
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:31,939
Pull it out again.

2179
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,539
- This is...
- Will it end if we pull them out?

2180
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:36,009
- Pull all of them out.
- Shall I do that?

2181
01:13:36,009 --> 01:13:37,509
- Let's rotate.
- Okay. Let's rotate.

2182
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:38,779
Let's rotate in Dong Hyun's direction.

2183
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:39,919
- I'll use my left hand.
- Okay.

2184
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:42,119
I can't pull it.

2185
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:43,849
Sang Uk isn't working either.

2186
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:45,759
Go to the next one.

2187
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:46,789
Dong Hyun, pull it out again.

2188
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,019
(When Dong Hyun works, the grasshoppers follow.)

2189
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:50,559
Let's rotate. I'll pull out the next one.

2190
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,099
Dong Hyun, you need to pull this out.

2191
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:53,099
(They follow Dong Hyun.)

2192
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:54,759
- Hurry up and pull it out.
- Dong Hyun, pull it out.

2193
01:13:54,759 --> 01:13:55,999
You can do it.

2194
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,129
This is so nice.

2195
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:59,269
Hurry up and pull it out.

2196
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,239
This is incredible.

2197
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:04,639
Dong Hyun, move this first.

2198
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:06,509
- Dong Hyun, hurry up.
- Dong Hyun.

2199
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:07,839
- Dong Hyun.
- Here.

2200
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:09,879
They don't work even though they have hands.

2201
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:11,849
We don't have hands we can use.

2202
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:13,849
Being at the end is bed.

2203
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:14,849
(The untied hands need to do all the work.)

2204
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:16,589
Now, take it off.

2205
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:18,049
(It's time to take off the fly cover.)

2206
01:14:18,419 --> 01:14:19,659
(While Dong Hyun's left hand and Sang Uk's right hand work)

2207
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:21,059
- Dong Hyun.
- Let's put it here for a second.

2208
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:23,129
Dong Hyun, go over there.

2209
01:14:23,129 --> 01:14:24,389
Let's go in Dong Hyun's direction.

2210
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:25,399
(The 3 grasshoppers in the middle enjoy the relaxing time.)

2211
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:26,699
- Hey, don't pull us apart too much.
- If you do that,

2212
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,259
- our armpits will get ripped.
- Hey.

2213
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:29,829
Sang Uk, pull them.

2214
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:32,499
- Pull them.
- Hey.

2215
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:35,239
(Let's get pulled.)

2216
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:38,239
(Their arms get pulled without mercy.)

2217
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,709
(Let's get pulled.)

2218
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:42,779
(He becomes a twisted doughnut with his arms spread out.)

2219
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:45,219
Hey.

2220
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,749
- Please save me.
- Hey.

2221
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:47,819
Please save me.

2222
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:49,219
Hey.

2223
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:50,289
(Their revenge was successful.)

2224
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,319
(Thanks to the effect of the gruesome revenge)

2225
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:55,259
For goodness' sake. It's the bottom one, right?

2226
01:14:55,259 --> 01:14:56,359
(One piece at a time)

2227
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:57,489
- Be careful.
- Pull it.

2228
01:14:57,489 --> 01:14:58,499
- Be careful.
- Okay.

2229
01:14:58,499 --> 01:14:59,499
(Handsome Guys take down the tent together.)

2230
01:14:59,599 --> 01:15:00,599
(Impressed)

2231
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:02,769
Watch your hands.

2232
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:04,669
- Shall I fold them?
- Yes.

2233
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:06,469
(Working hard)

2234
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:09,239
(They fold the poles.)

2235
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:12,539
(The members at the ends take care of the complicated tasks.)

2236
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:14,579
People at the ends have to do those tasks.

2237
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,249
- Grab it.
- Now?

2238
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:18,249
- Grab it. Pull it and dust it.
- Okay.

2239
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:19,749
(After removing the poles, they dust the tent once.)

2240
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:20,819
- Okay.
- Dust it.

2241
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:22,419
Put it in.

2242
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:24,449
One is missing. Whose fault is that?

2243
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:25,489
Let's pull it out.

2244
01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:26,589
It's in the ground.

2245
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:27,859
(They retrieve all the pegs.)

2246
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,659
(Scanning the remaining pegs)

2247
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:32,899
(Spotting one)

2248
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:33,899
What are you doing?

2249
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,399
- I need to pull it out.
- Go ahead.

2250
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:37,999
- What's this?
- Oh, no.

2251
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:39,069
It went over there.

2252
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,899
(Flying off)

2253
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:43,869
- I mean...
- For goodness' sake.

2254
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:45,709
What's going on with the arms?

2255
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:47,279
Hold on.

2256
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:50,209
Let's go over there.

2257
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,279
What's up with the file?

2258
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,619
(What's up with the file?)

2259
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,749
Dong Hyun...

2260
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:56,419
had a chance as the third-place winner.

2261
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,219
But he chose the left end.

2262
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:01,059
Why don't we throw shoes once more?

2263
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:02,259
(Why don't we throw shoes once more?)

2264
01:16:02,889 --> 01:16:05,159
There's a reason behind the smart people's decision.

2265
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:07,429
(The smart ones are happy.)

2266
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:08,899
We need to put away the table and chairs now.

2267
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:10,499
All right. Don't be selfish.

2268
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:13,069
What's this?

2269
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,099
(It isn't easy to keep everyone in order.)

2270
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:16,339
- Where should I go?
- Come here.

2271
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:17,569
- Where?
- All right.

2272
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:18,909
We need to put away the table and chairs.

2273
01:16:19,209 --> 01:16:21,209
We look cool. Let's spread out.

2274
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:22,549
What do you think? Do we look cool?

2275
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:23,849
Do U-Know's dance.

2276
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:25,449
- Let's do U-Know's dance.
- Okay.

2277
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:30,949
(Will they attempt to do a cool dance while they're at it?)

2278
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:33,119
- Let's do U-Know's dance.
- Okay.

2279
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:37,789
(Doing the wave)

2280
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:39,999
Like this.

2281
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:42,899
(Handsome Guys' dance looks very different.)

2282
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,099
- All right.
- It was cool.

2283
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,269
Turn around.

2284
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:46,439
- Turn this way.
- Okay.

2285
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:47,639
Turn this way.

2286
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:50,809
We'll fold the chairs and put them in the wagon.

2287
01:16:51,369 --> 01:16:52,509
(Working hard)

2288
01:16:52,509 --> 01:16:54,209
- I can do this much.
- Hold it.

2289
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:57,109
A camping trip ends with a cleanup.

2290
01:16:57,109 --> 01:16:58,149
(They have perfect teamwork.)

2291
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:59,479
- Bring them together.
- Okay.

2292
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:01,419
- Pass it down.
- Sang Uk, here you go.

2293
01:17:01,419 --> 01:17:02,889
(After a few clashes, their teamwork becomes perfect.)

2294
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,049
Pass it down.

2295
01:17:04,049 --> 01:17:05,119
Pass it down.

2296
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:08,119
- Okay.
- All right.

2297
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:09,589
Okay. You did a good job of putting everything away.

2298
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:11,259
Now, you'll play...

2299
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,199
a game to escape the shortage and get off work.

2300
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,529
- Get off work.
- Get off work?

2301
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,069
- This is the main game.
- Get off work?

2302
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:17,369
Getting off work is the best.

2303
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:20,569
The first game is Receive the Water Balloon.

2304
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:21,699
You'll decide on the order first...

2305
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:24,239
and throw the water balloon to the next person in turns.

2306
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,279
If the catcher pops the balloon,

2307
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:27,579
he'll be eliminated.

2308
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:30,579
The last one standing will get off work.

2309
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:31,779
How is this distance?

2310
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:33,319
- There we go.
- It's good.

2311
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:34,879
- Let's go in this direction.
- Okay.

2312
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:37,219
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2313
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:39,019
There's nothing above me, right?

2314
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:40,219
Drone, move out of the way.

2315
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:41,889
Move out of the way!

2316
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:43,289
(Okay.)

2317
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:44,529
It listened to you.

2318
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:45,999
If you throw it high, I won't be able to catch it.

2319
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,029
Here I go.

2320
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,969
Hey, how high will you throw it?

2321
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:50,269
It'll come at my face.

2322
01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:51,529
Catch it.

2323
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:52,899
Catch it.

2324
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,469
(He caught it!)

2325
01:17:56,609 --> 01:17:57,969
(Impressed)

2326
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:00,139
Dong Hyun does this exercise often.

2327
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,779
Tae Hyun.

2328
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:03,909
(Dong Hyun to Tae Hyun)

2329
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:06,819
(Dong Hyun's camera)

2330
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:13,459
(For goodness' sake)

2331
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:15,789
(Oh, my,)

2332
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:18,959
(we're so happy.)

2333
01:18:19,799 --> 01:18:20,859
You're out.

2334
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:22,369
(The popped balloon gives them a dopamine rush.)

2335
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,429
Hey,

2336
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:24,799
why did you throw it so high?

2337
01:18:24,799 --> 01:18:25,839
He threw it higher!

2338
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:27,499
What I did wasn't unimaginable.

2339
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,139
(Upset)

2340
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:30,969
That was so funny.

2341
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:32,539
The practice round is over.

2342
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:33,709
- Okay.
- Okay.

2343
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,779
- Was that the practice round?
- Yes. This is...

2344
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:35,949
the Shortage in Screentime.

2345
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:37,449
Okay.

2346
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:38,949
(Cha Tae Hyun gets another life.)

2347
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:39,979
Here I go.

2348
01:18:40,519 --> 01:18:41,579
Catch it well.

2349
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:44,519
(Yi Kyung to Sang Uk)

2350
01:18:47,919 --> 01:18:49,429
(Bursting)

2351
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:52,159
(Sang Uk's camera)

2352
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:54,459
(Spilling)

2353
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,529
(Laughing)

2354
01:18:56,629 --> 01:18:59,369
(The burst balloon makes them happy as long as it's some else's turn.)

2355
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:02,169
It's impossible not to pop it.

2356
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,069
- Sang Uk is out.
- Okay.

2357
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,109
Scoot over.

2358
01:19:05,109 --> 01:19:06,879
- I'm soaked.
- Let's begin.

2359
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,109
Dong Hyun, I'll do it properly this time.

2360
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:10,579
Let's pass it well.

2361
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,179
I'll keep my word.

2362
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:16,789
Gosh, Dong Hyun is good.

2363
01:19:16,849 --> 01:19:18,019
(How will the member who failed earlier, Tae Hyun do?)

2364
01:19:18,889 --> 01:19:20,589
It didn't burst!

2365
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,889
(He lets everyone know.)

2366
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:23,389
It didn't burst.

2367
01:19:23,389 --> 01:19:24,429
Okay.

2368
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:26,029
It didn't burst.

2369
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:27,059
(He aims the balloon...)

2370
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:28,229
(and launches it!)

2371
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:30,299
(Yi Kyung receives it easily.)

2372
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,529
It should've burst.

2373
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,339
(He passes it back to Seung Ho.)

2374
01:19:33,339 --> 01:19:34,399
Oh, my.

2375
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:36,839
Oh, my.

2376
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,569
- It slipped.
- It didn't burst.

2377
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:40,439
- It slipped.
- It didn't burst.

2378
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:42,709
It isn't easy to catch the balloon.

2379
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,679
(Still,)

2380
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:46,549
(you should try to catch it!)

2381
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,389
(Dong Hyun catches it with his entire body.)

2382
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:51,589
Dong Hyun is good at this.

2383
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:54,089
(Tae Hyun is getting ready.)

2384
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,669
(My goodness)

2385
01:20:03,429 --> 01:20:06,539
(The sky blue balloon doesn't let him off twice.)

2386
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:09,169
(Giggling)

2387
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:11,809
(Tae Hyun, welcome.)

2388
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:14,409
I'll do it.

2389
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,909
- All right.
- Let's make a triangle.

2390
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:18,279
- If it doesn't burst...
- Let's make a triangle.

2391
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:19,449
Here.

2392
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:21,079
(He starts off with a safe delivery.)

2393
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:22,349
(He succeeds in catching it with a touch touch.)

2394
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:23,519
Okay.

2395
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:25,719
(Nervous)

2396
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:26,759
Dong Hyun, what should I do?

2397
01:20:26,759 --> 01:20:27,759
Should I do it properly?

2398
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:28,989
Show him what you can do.

2399
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:31,689
(Get ready.)

2400
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:32,699
(It's a sudden attack!)

2401
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:36,799
(But he receives it.)

2402
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:38,129
Dong Hyun is really good at it.

2403
01:20:39,499 --> 01:20:41,239
(Giggling)

2404
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:42,569
Pass it well. I'll make it work.

2405
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:46,079
(The man who took out Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun will throw it.)

2406
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,379
(That was so close.)

2407
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,779
- The sound was loud.
- The difficulty level is going up.

2408
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:54,979
- Seung Ho, I'm in your care.
- Okay.

2409
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:55,989
- I'll do it properly.
- What?

2410
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,589
- Are you guys scheming? Okay.
- We aren't scheming.

2411
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:01,059
What's this?

2412
01:21:01,059 --> 01:21:02,629
Wasn't that pass too easy?

2413
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:03,659
He's good.

2414
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:04,759
Finish him off now.

2415
01:21:05,389 --> 01:21:07,359
- Seung Ho, throw it properly.
- Use your hands.

2416
01:21:12,029 --> 01:21:13,769
(It's high!)

2417
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:14,939
(What will become of Dong Hyun?)

2418
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:16,069
Bye!

2419
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:17,469
(Go!)

2420
01:21:17,469 --> 01:21:18,609
Bye!

2421
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:22,379
(Dong Hyun fails to catch the water balloon.)

2422
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:23,649
Bye!

2423
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,379
- Come here.
- It's the two of us again.

2424
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:27,249
(Our strategy worked.)

2425
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,319
It's the two of us again.

2426
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:30,149
- It's the two of them again.
- Okay.

2427
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:32,519
- Let's throw it hard.
- Okay.

2428
01:21:32,759 --> 01:21:34,219
For fairness, let's decide on who'll throw first...

2429
01:21:34,219 --> 01:21:36,329
- through rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2430
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:37,989
Let's throw upward only.

2431
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:39,099
- Let's keep it neat.
- Okay.

2432
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:40,459
Once you win in rock-paper-scissors,

2433
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:41,559
you'll be halfway done.

2434
01:21:41,559 --> 01:21:43,199
Once you win in rock-paper-scissors, it's game over.

2435
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:44,769
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2436
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:46,669
(Seung Ho will attack first.)

2437
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:47,899
- It's game over.
- You never know.

2438
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:49,009
Let's get wet.

2439
01:21:49,009 --> 01:21:51,009
I think I'll get off work.

2440
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:53,479
- Let's go with the pink one.
- The biggest one.

2441
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:55,109
- The small one.
- The biggest one.

2442
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:56,809
It'll be the last one anyway.

2443
01:21:56,809 --> 01:21:57,909
Okay.

2444
01:21:58,249 --> 01:21:59,679
As you throw it, shout, "Let's get off work."

2445
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,749
What will I do if it hits the transmission tower?

2446
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:04,689
(He warns Yi Kyung that he'll throw high.)

2447
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:05,959
All right.

2448
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,089
Let's get off work!

2449
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:09,389
Let's get off work!

2450
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:10,689
(The balloon goes up much higher than before.)

2451
01:22:12,959 --> 01:22:14,329
(It didn't burst!)

2452
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,459
- It didn't burst.
- It didn't burst.

2453
01:22:15,459 --> 01:22:17,999
(Shocked)

2454
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,669
- It didn't burst.
- That balloon is too small.

2455
01:22:20,339 --> 01:22:21,469
- No way.
- That balloon is too small.

2456
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,669
I'll get off work.

2457
01:22:22,669 --> 01:22:23,909
(I'll get off work.)

2458
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:25,739
- I'll get off work.
- Bye.

2459
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:27,909
I think catching it with the hands tears the balloon.

2460
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:30,409
Hey, you could throw it like this.

2461
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:31,509
He could do that.

2462
01:22:31,909 --> 01:22:33,179
- I'll get off work.
- Okay.

2463
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:34,249
One,

2464
01:22:34,519 --> 01:22:35,589
two...

2465
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:38,419
(Let's stay calm, Yi Kyung.)

2466
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:46,529
(Here comes the rain of getting off work.)

2467
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:50,129
(My goodness)

2468
01:22:50,129 --> 01:22:51,299
Shouldn't we redo it?

2469
01:22:51,329 --> 01:22:53,899
(Oh, yes. I'm going home.)

2470
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,239
I'm going home.

2471
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:56,769
Tell us what the result is.

2472
01:22:56,969 --> 01:22:59,409
- Yi Kyung failed.
- Is that so?

2473
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:01,209
- Of course. You threw it.
- Really?

2474
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:02,809
Seung Ho, you can go home.

2475
01:23:02,809 --> 01:23:05,009
(Seung Ho will go home!)

2476
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:06,119
That was incredible.

2477
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:09,819
What will we do?

2478
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:12,089
The camping trip ends here.

2479
01:23:12,519 --> 01:23:14,889
Apparently, there's a famous place in Yangpyeong.

2480
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:15,889
What?

2481
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:17,829
So that you can enjoy the group life,

2482
01:23:17,829 --> 01:23:20,059
we can pay a quick visit.

2483
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:21,629
- Are you serious?
- Okay.

2484
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:23,099
- Please get on the bus.
- Okay.

2485
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:24,669
(They quickly move to the famous place in Yangpyeong.)

2486
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:26,599
Get on the bus.

2487
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:28,069
(Tied together, they get on the board.)

2488
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:29,409
We're like prisoners.

2489
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:31,539
We're like prisoners.

2490
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,339
(The Handsome Gang members have been apprehended.)

2491
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:35,079
We shouldn't do anything bad.

2492
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:36,809
Let's behave.

2493
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,579
(The men with a big build take a seat first.)

2494
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:40,619
I can't fasten my seatbelt.

2495
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:43,089
What's going on?

2496
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,619
- Oh, my goodness.
- Let's pull it back.

2497
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:47,689
Don't make a commotion.

2498
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:50,459
Number 4978.

2499
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:51,629
Yes.

2500
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:52,799
Death sentence.

2501
01:23:52,799 --> 01:23:53,929
- What?
- "Death sentence."

2502
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,729
(He suddenly receives the worst sentence.)

2503
01:23:56,729 --> 01:23:59,399
(Laughing)

2504
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:03,309
(Inmate number 4978 puts on his seatbelt quietly.)

2505
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:04,909
- I'll get going now.
- Bye.

2506
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:05,939
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2507
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:07,609
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Have a safe trip home.

2508
01:24:07,639 --> 01:24:09,349
He was going to leave anyway.

2509
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,579
(They say goodbye to the man who was going to leave anyway.)

2510
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:12,779
He was going to leave anyway.

2511
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:14,479
I'll get off work next. I'm sorry.

2512
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:15,549
I think that'll happen.

2513
01:24:15,549 --> 01:24:17,649
I just need to beat you!

2514
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,159
(I just need to beat you!)

2515
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:22,359
Mister at the very end,

2516
01:24:22,389 --> 01:24:24,559
how did you end up here after winning three gold medals?

2517
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,829
(How did you end up here?)

2518
01:24:26,299 --> 01:24:27,559
Did you get too greedy?

2519
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:28,799
Listen.

2520
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,099
("Prison Playbook" by Handsome Guys)

2521
01:24:31,129 --> 01:24:32,299
That man...

2522
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:33,499
beat up so many people.

2523
01:24:33,499 --> 01:24:35,099
(Former fighter, number 4978)

2524
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:37,209
I knew that he'd end up here.

2525
01:24:37,809 --> 01:24:39,239
After beating up so many people,

2526
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,009
he ended up in prison for theft.

2527
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,139
(The unexpected crime makes him break character.)

2528
01:24:42,139 --> 01:24:43,779
Did he end up in prison for theft?

2529
01:24:44,809 --> 01:24:46,279
Why are you here?

2530
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:47,719
It was a financial crime.

2531
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:49,149
- A financial crime.
- Yes.

2532
01:24:49,149 --> 01:24:50,319
(Inmate 3, Financial offender)

2533
01:24:50,349 --> 01:24:51,649
I turned...

2534
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:55,689
chocolate gold coins into fake Bitcoins.

2535
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:57,289
- My goodness.
- You know the gold wrappers.

2536
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:58,989
I used them to make fake Bitcoins and sold them,

2537
01:24:58,989 --> 01:25:00,159
but I got caught.

2538
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,469
With my fist and your brain,

2539
01:25:02,529 --> 01:25:04,529
we'll be able to get a big break.

2540
01:25:04,529 --> 01:25:06,499
Let's meet up once we go out.

2541
01:25:06,499 --> 01:25:07,569
Let's do that.

2542
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:09,739
Mister at the end, what's your sentence?

2543
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,639
About three months.

2544
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,139
Three months?

2545
01:25:13,139 --> 01:25:14,379
(The sentence isn't as long as he thought.)

2546
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:15,749
I'm here for free food.

2547
01:25:15,749 --> 01:25:16,849
(I'm here for free food.)

2548
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:18,009
Do they serve good food these days?

2549
01:25:18,009 --> 01:25:19,279
You've been in and out repeatedly.

2550
01:25:19,919 --> 01:25:22,019
You've been in and out ten times.

2551
01:25:22,519 --> 01:25:23,749
I hired a law firm...

2552
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,089
called Cha and Choi.

2553
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:26,419
They're the best.

2554
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:27,659
Cha and Choi?

2555
01:25:28,419 --> 01:25:30,889
It's already time to harvest.

2556
01:25:31,289 --> 01:25:33,329
They say, "The boughs that bear most lie lowest."

2557
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,429
- They hang lowest, you mean.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

2558
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:38,699
(Number 4978's specialty is bringing people down.)

2559
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:39,799
I'm sorry.

2560
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,539
It must be because he's someone who always brings people to the ground.

2561
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:44,309
I heard this about Mr. Fighter.

2562
01:25:44,769 --> 01:25:46,279
I heard you hit someone while playing the rice-barley game.

2563
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,479
Right.

2564
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:48,979
Why hit someone during the game?

2565
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:50,579
- Why hit someone during the game?
- Why do that?

2566
01:25:50,809 --> 01:25:52,749
My fist heads to someone's face like a magnet.

2567
01:25:53,979 --> 01:25:56,019
"Mr. Fighter." Where are you from?

2568
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:58,649
Where are you from?

2569
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:00,789
I'm from a place full of fighting.

2570
01:26:01,759 --> 01:26:02,889
Mr. Punch.

2571
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,729
- "Mr. Punch?" - Yes.

2572
01:26:05,529 --> 01:26:07,059
I want some Yangpyeong hangover soup.

2573
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,169
Yangpyeong hangover soup.

2574
01:26:09,299 --> 01:26:10,869
Besides Yangpyeong hangover soup,

2575
01:26:10,869 --> 01:26:12,199
what else is famous in Yangpyeong?

2576
01:26:12,469 --> 01:26:13,599
- Sorry?
- In Yangpyeong?

2577
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:16,069
Yangpyeong's guest houses.

2578
01:26:16,309 --> 01:26:18,209
Isn't Yangpyeong famous for that?

2579
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:19,839
You startled me!

2580
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,879
What is it?

2581
01:26:22,209 --> 01:26:23,449
- What is it?
- What is it?

2582
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,009
- What is it?
- Yangpyeong!

2583
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:26,679
Yangpyeong has that!

2584
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:28,479
- What?
- No!

2585
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:29,589
What does Yangpyeong have?

2586
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:30,589
(Tae Hyun suddenly looks glum.)

2587
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,319
There's a bungee jump in Yangpyeong!

2588
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,259
(There's a bungee jump in Yangpyeong!)

2589
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:37,329
There's a bungee jump!

2590
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,699
(The only person who likes those things has gone home.)

2591
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:41,329
- No way!
- There's a bungee jump!

2592
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:42,869
I will never do that.

2593
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:44,299
- No way!
- There's a bungee jump!

2594
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,599
- I will never do that.
- It's in Yangpyeong.

2595
01:26:45,839 --> 01:26:47,769
It can't be the bungee jump, can it?

2596
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:48,839
No way!

2597
01:26:48,839 --> 01:26:50,609
(Quickly checking the GPS app)

2598
01:26:50,769 --> 01:26:51,839
(Startled)

2599
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,079
We happen to be heading toward the river.

2600
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:55,339
I told you.

2601
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:57,279
(Currently heading toward the river)

2602
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:58,809
- We're heading toward the river?
- Yes.

2603
01:26:58,809 --> 01:26:59,949
Oh, my gosh.

2604
01:27:00,219 --> 01:27:03,049
Shall we play a simple game on our way?

2605
01:27:03,049 --> 01:27:04,049
- Sure.
- Okay.

2606
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:05,689
- Will there be a benefit?
- Yes.

2607
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:07,019
The person who wins the game...

2608
01:27:07,019 --> 01:27:08,189
will be able to head home...

2609
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:09,229
right after arriving at the destination.

2610
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,229
Okay!

2611
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:11,229
What?

2612
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:13,529
It must really be the bungee jump!

2613
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:16,799
I will think of a three-digit number.

2614
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,069
You have to guess that number correctly.

2615
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:20,869
(Number Baseball)

2616
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,369
Here's how it's played.

2617
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:25,879
Whenever you guess the number, I will give you a hint.

2618
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:29,349
It's a strike when the number and position is correct.

2619
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,009
It's a ball when the number is correct...

2620
01:27:31,009 --> 01:27:32,449
and the position is incorrect.

2621
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:35,479
It's an out when number and position is incorrect.

2622
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:36,719
Here's an example.

2623
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:37,919
Let's say the number I was thinking of...

2624
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,089
- was 123.
- Okay.

2625
01:27:39,089 --> 01:27:41,089
When you guess 178,

2626
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:42,829
- it's 1 strike.
- Right.

2627
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:46,499
- I got it.
- Right.

2628
01:27:46,659 --> 01:27:49,329
Then let's start with the game.

2629
01:27:49,329 --> 01:27:50,499
Should Sang Uk start?

2630
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:51,769
- Shall I go first?
- Okay.

2631
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:55,599
(Thinking of a number)

2632
01:27:55,699 --> 01:27:57,309
It's 718.

2633
01:27:58,169 --> 01:27:59,609
You guessed 718.

2634
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:00,979
That's one ball.

2635
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:03,979
What did that mean again?

2636
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,049
(Out of 718, a number is correct, but is in a different position.)

2637
01:28:06,049 --> 01:28:08,649
You can call it out if you know the answer.

2638
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:10,149
It's 134.

2639
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:12,759
You guessed 134. That's 1 ball.

2640
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,089
(Current situation: 718 1B, 143 1B)

2641
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,329
It's 269.

2642
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:17,889
Out.

2643
01:28:18,129 --> 01:28:20,659
(Numbers 2, 6, and 9 are not in the answer.)

2644
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:23,929
(It's easier to guess the numbers.)

2645
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:25,199
It's 012.

2646
01:28:26,169 --> 01:28:28,099
You asked 012 right after 269?

2647
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:30,169
- Yes.
- Okay. Out.

2648
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:31,239
(The result is an out.)

2649
01:28:31,509 --> 01:28:35,109
(Numbers 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are still alive.)

2650
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:40,349
(Current situation)

2651
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:45,019
It's 723.

2652
01:28:45,489 --> 01:28:46,819
That's 1 strike, 1 ball.

2653
01:28:48,519 --> 01:28:50,159
(Number 2 was out,)

2654
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,159
(so numbers 3 and 7 are in the answer.)

2655
01:28:53,599 --> 01:28:54,659
It's 321.

2656
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,129
You guessed 321.

2657
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:58,899
That's one ball.

2658
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:03,139
(It seems like he didn't understand the rules.)

2659
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:05,039
(Current situation)

2660
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:06,909
(723 1S 1B, 321 1B)

2661
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:09,909
(A lot of hints are out.)

2662
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,449
I got it. It's 583.

2663
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:12,849
- Are you guessing the answer?
- Yes.

2664
01:29:12,919 --> 01:29:14,279
- No.
- Incorrect!

2665
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:15,319
(Incorrect)

2666
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:16,989
- Will no hints be given for that?
- He went for 583?

2667
01:29:16,989 --> 01:29:19,249
- There will be no hints for that.
- I see.

2668
01:29:19,249 --> 01:29:20,659
- There will be no hints?
- I got it.

2669
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:23,129
I got the answer!

2670
01:29:23,289 --> 01:29:24,759
The smart one is here!

2671
01:29:25,129 --> 01:29:28,199
The answer is 743.

2672
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:31,269
- You guessed 743.
- Yes.

2673
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:32,329
Incorrect!

2674
01:29:32,329 --> 01:29:34,869
(Incorrect)

2675
01:29:35,099 --> 01:29:37,769
(It's Sang Uk's turn again.)

2676
01:29:38,009 --> 01:29:40,339
- It's 412.
- You guessed 412.

2677
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,039
Out.

2678
01:29:42,579 --> 01:29:43,809
I got it. The answer is 573.

2679
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:45,409
You guessed 573.

2680
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:46,619
(Answer: 573)

2681
01:29:46,749 --> 01:29:47,949
- Correct.
- Yes!

2682
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:49,719
I got it all wrong.

2683
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:51,089
I got number 7, 3, and 1.

2684
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:52,119
Same here.

2685
01:29:52,349 --> 01:29:54,459
Bye, Kim Dong Hyun!

2686
01:29:54,459 --> 01:29:57,189
I'm smarter than you!

2687
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:58,429
Gosh. I didn't get it.

2688
01:29:58,429 --> 01:29:59,899
Kim Dong Hyun!

2689
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:03,329
I'm smarter than Kim Dong Hyun!

2690
01:30:03,329 --> 01:30:05,669
Don't you dare mess around with me anymore.

2691
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:06,939
I got it all wrong.

2692
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:10,209
You may head home after arriving at the destination, Tae Hyun.

2693
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:11,239
Yes!

2694
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,509
- I got it all wrong.
- Yes!

2695
01:30:13,379 --> 01:30:14,839
I wanted to beat Tae Hyun.

2696
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:18,209
(Singing)

2697
01:30:19,209 --> 01:30:23,319
(They soon arrive by the river.)

2698
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:24,419
(Dumulmeori)

2699
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:27,959
We have arrived at our destination.

2700
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:29,429
I will get off first.

2701
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:34,729
(They get off in order as well.)

2702
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:37,829
You may be released right away, Tae Hyun.

2703
01:30:37,829 --> 01:30:39,299
- Yes!
- He can be released?

2704
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:40,899
Congratulations.

2705
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:42,339
(He escapes the Shortage in Privacy.)

2706
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:44,109
- Congratulations, Tae Hyun.
- Okay. Thank you.

2707
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:45,169
Great work.

2708
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:46,679
(Tae Hyun goes and Dong Hyun comes.)

2709
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:47,839
I'm stuck between two tall guys.

2710
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,649
- These two.
- Gosh, Tae Hyun.

2711
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:52,009
This is Yangpyeong's representative tourist spot,

2712
01:30:52,009 --> 01:30:53,219
Dumulmeori.

2713
01:30:53,219 --> 01:30:54,549
- Right.
- What is this place?

2714
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:56,889
(The place where the Namhan River and the Bukhan River meet)

2715
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:59,289
(Dumulmeori)

2716
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:05,059
(The natural scenery is like a landscape painting.)

2717
01:31:05,789 --> 01:31:09,969
(A spot with great vibes and is popular during all seasons)

2718
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:12,899
(Photo spots are a bonus.)

2719
01:31:13,299 --> 01:31:15,699
(There isn't a bungee jump here that the members are afraid of.)

2720
01:31:15,969 --> 01:31:17,769
The corn dogs are famous here.

2721
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:19,069
Let's go and get some.

2722
01:31:19,069 --> 01:31:20,639
Okay. Do you want some as well?

2723
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:21,739
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2724
01:31:22,279 --> 01:31:23,449
I should have some.

2725
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,209
It looks amazing here!

2726
01:31:26,009 --> 01:31:27,749
The view is spectacular here.

2727
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:30,949
I feel so happy to be able to eat the corn dog without being tied.

2728
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:32,689
This is what happiness is about.

2729
01:31:32,689 --> 01:31:34,089
(Happy at the thought of being able to eat freely)

2730
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:36,859
(These guys still haven't found that happiness.)

2731
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:38,959
The ones next to me keep changing.

2732
01:31:39,999 --> 01:31:42,529
Usually, the main figure is left until the end.

2733
01:31:43,299 --> 01:31:44,569
This is how it is when a villain gets caught.

2734
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,499
- The sidekicks get removed first.
- Right.

2735
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:49,669
- I feel anxious right now.
- You feel anxious.

2736
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:51,009
I feel anxious!

2737
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,439
There it is. Dumulmeori Corn Dog.

2738
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:55,509
- Dumulmeori.
- Hello.

2739
01:31:55,509 --> 01:31:57,549
Hello. We'll get 1 spicy corn dog and 3 mild corn dogs.

2740
01:31:57,549 --> 01:31:58,649
- There's a spicy one.
- I'll give it a try.

2741
01:32:00,219 --> 01:32:02,049
Hey!

2742
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:04,819
- What?
- Seung Ho!

2743
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,159
- Why haven't you gone?
- I'm here.

2744
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,859
- Why haven't you gone?
- Hey, sir!

2745
01:32:10,329 --> 01:32:11,489
Why haven't you gone?

2746
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:12,689
(Unable to understand)

2747
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:14,529
This is really famous.

2748
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,429
It's the spicy one. You can have some.

2749
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:20,339
(Taking a big bite right away)

2750
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:21,599
Why didn't you go?

2751
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:23,639
I just...

2752
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:25,739
couldn't leave.

2753
01:32:26,139 --> 01:32:27,339
That's true loyalty.

2754
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:29,649
I would've done the same if I had won.

2755
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:31,809
Then you should stay...

2756
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:33,349
after winning this round.

2757
01:32:33,349 --> 01:32:35,419
I was going to stay just until here.

2758
01:32:35,619 --> 01:32:40,689
(I'll just focus on my corn dog.)

2759
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:42,289
As this is a tourist spot,

2760
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,259
there are many people visiting even during the weekday.

2761
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:45,889
They must be doing something with the people here.

2762
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:48,529
This game will be played with the people here...

2763
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:50,699
and it's called the Action Speed Quiz.

2764
01:32:51,069 --> 01:32:53,499
(The next game is a tough one.)

2765
01:32:53,499 --> 01:32:54,999
Gosh, I should get going!

2766
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:58,039
Gosh, we should watch this.

2767
01:32:58,039 --> 01:32:59,239
This will be fun to watch.

2768
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,179
The people will describe the answers with gestures...

2769
01:33:01,179 --> 01:33:03,309
and the members must guess them correctly.

2770
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:07,979
Each of you must bring one person to play the game with.

2771
01:33:08,179 --> 01:33:10,119
We have to look for people who seem to be good at this?

2772
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:11,749
- That's right.
- They will act it out?

2773
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,829
Would you like to do a quiz with me?

2774
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:18,389
- I'm down?
- You're down? Done!

2775
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:21,759
- That was good.
- He's a precious guest.

2776
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:24,069
- They have to bring partners too.
- Right.

2777
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:25,629
We'll meet by the tree.

2778
01:33:25,629 --> 01:33:26,969
- He seems to be witty.
- I'll get it for you.

2779
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,439
(They start moving.)

2780
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:29,639
My partner must be confident.

2781
01:33:29,769 --> 01:33:33,109
Would you like to do a quiz with me if you have the time?

2782
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:34,639
- Go for it!
- Okay.

2783
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,139
- Right.
- He can go.

2784
01:33:36,249 --> 01:33:38,079
Are you an introvert or an extrovert?

2785
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:39,649
(Asking about his MBTI right away)

2786
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:41,019
- I'm an introvert.
- You're an introvert?

2787
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:43,549
Extroverts are better. Is that so?

2788
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:45,519
- You don't seem to like him.
- I'm fine with him.

2789
01:33:45,849 --> 01:33:48,189
- I'll change him into an extrovert.
- We'll see you later.

2790
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,319
Hold on.

2791
01:33:49,929 --> 01:33:51,559
Would you like to do a quiz with me?

2792
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,699
What's your MBTI?

2793
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:55,129
- I'm an ENFP.
- Okay.

2794
01:33:55,459 --> 01:33:56,599
You pass!

2795
01:33:56,829 --> 01:33:58,529
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

2796
01:33:58,599 --> 01:33:59,799
Let's move to the tree.

2797
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:01,569
I think she'll do well.

2798
01:34:01,799 --> 01:34:05,339
We'll hear a brief introduction of the partners.

2799
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,109
I'll start with my partner...

2800
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:08,579
who I invited right on the spot.

2801
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:10,779
I'm Im Hyun Min from Misa-dong.

2802
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:12,979
It's Im Hyun Min.

2803
01:34:12,979 --> 01:34:14,719
- Next?
- Hello.

2804
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:17,019
I'm Jung Beom Soo, and I'm from Hwaseong.

2805
01:34:17,249 --> 01:34:18,289
Jung Beom Soo!

2806
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:19,289
(Let's go!)

2807
01:34:19,419 --> 01:34:22,259
Hello. I'm Kim Da Bin, and I'm from Gwangjin-gu.

2808
01:34:22,259 --> 01:34:23,289
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2809
01:34:23,289 --> 01:34:24,829
She's 90 percent extroverted.

2810
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,429
- She's 90 percent extroverted.
- Right.

2811
01:34:27,559 --> 01:34:31,199
We will now play the Action Speed Quiz.

2812
01:34:31,329 --> 01:34:32,429
How much time will be given?

2813
01:34:32,429 --> 01:34:34,939
- You will be given two minutes.
- Right.

2814
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:36,939
The member who gets the most number of answers right...

2815
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:38,609
- will head home from here.
- Okay.

2816
01:34:39,269 --> 01:34:40,339
(So this is what this game is for.)

2817
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:41,939
- You can do this.
- I feel so much pressure.

2818
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:43,179
You can do it.

2819
01:34:43,179 --> 01:34:44,979
Okay. I'll try my best.

2820
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:47,349
Could we get some help?

2821
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:48,519
Could 1 of the 2 of you help us?

2822
01:34:48,519 --> 01:34:50,549
Could you flip the answers?

2823
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:51,749
(Getting a sudden call for help while eating ice cream)

2824
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:53,089
Will we get anything from this?

2825
01:34:53,089 --> 01:34:55,589
I thought they were just regular people in the back.

2826
01:34:55,819 --> 01:34:58,189
I was just watching the shoot.

2827
01:34:58,559 --> 01:34:59,559
(Their task is handed over.)

2828
01:34:59,559 --> 01:35:01,399
All right. Number one.

2829
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:03,329
We'll just go with number one as we're the first team.

2830
01:35:03,629 --> 01:35:05,829
The category is proverbs.

2831
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:08,139
- Oh, my gosh!
- Right.

2832
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:10,069
(Feeling pressure)

2833
01:35:10,069 --> 01:35:11,139
Hyun Min,

2834
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:13,239
- please let me go home.
- I'll do my best.

2835
01:35:13,909 --> 01:35:15,139
Nice one.

2836
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:17,079
Get ready.

2837
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:18,579
(Team Yi Kyung starts!)

2838
01:35:18,649 --> 01:35:19,649
(First proverb)

2839
01:35:19,649 --> 01:35:20,719
(The one that farts gets angry.)

2840
01:35:21,579 --> 01:35:22,779
The one that farts gets angry.

2841
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:24,789
(The one that farts gets angry.)

2842
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:26,459
(Getting the answer right away)

2843
01:35:26,459 --> 01:35:28,759
(Second proverb)

2844
01:35:28,759 --> 01:35:29,759
All right.

2845
01:35:29,759 --> 01:35:32,789
(A frog in a well)

2846
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,599
(Yi Kyung is the only one who doesn't get it.)

2847
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:39,599
Pass!

2848
01:35:40,499 --> 01:35:41,569
Pass.

2849
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,269
(The next question)

2850
01:35:43,309 --> 01:35:44,669
The frog fell into the well? What was it?

2851
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:46,209
That was the previous one.

2852
01:35:46,509 --> 01:35:47,879
Even monkeys fall from trees.

2853
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,779
He's good.

2854
01:35:51,609 --> 01:35:53,379
(Belling the cat)

2855
01:35:55,219 --> 01:35:56,249
(Putting a bell...)

2856
01:35:56,249 --> 01:35:57,549
(on the cat's neck)

2857
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,259
Dog? Belling the pig.

2858
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:02,359
(It's not a pig.)

2859
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:03,629
Is it a dog?

2860
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:04,959
It's a bell.

2861
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,159
(If it's a bell...)

2862
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,529
Is it a cat's neck? Belling the cat.

2863
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:09,969
Correct.

2864
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:11,869
What? Why is he so good?

2865
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,569
(Next proverb)

2866
01:36:13,599 --> 01:36:15,339
You can't move your lips.

2867
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:19,369
(He describes the answer while smacking his own face.)

2868
01:36:19,369 --> 01:36:20,609
You can't hurt yourself!

2869
01:36:20,779 --> 01:36:22,109
(Laughing)

2870
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:23,549
Oh, right! Hold on.

2871
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:26,109
It's about getting smacked somewhere.

2872
01:36:26,849 --> 01:36:28,649
Could you describe it a bit more?

2873
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:30,589
(Getting a slap in the face in Jongno)

2874
01:36:30,789 --> 01:36:32,719
(And there's the Han River right there.)

2875
01:36:33,089 --> 01:36:34,959
I know what this is. Pass!

2876
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:36,589
Pass!

2877
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:38,529
- Everyone knows that one.
- Right.

2878
01:36:38,529 --> 01:36:40,629
(Next question)

2879
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:42,999
(Above the one that jumps,)

2880
01:36:42,999 --> 01:36:44,469
(there's the one that flies.)

2881
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:45,629
Superman?

2882
01:36:46,599 --> 01:36:48,939
(Jumping)

2883
01:36:48,939 --> 01:36:50,569
(I'll jump too.)

2884
01:36:50,909 --> 01:36:52,839
(The one that flies with wings.)

2885
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:54,439
I have no idea. Pass.

2886
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:56,379
(Giving the one who is hated another rice cake)

2887
01:36:56,379 --> 01:36:58,109
(The next question is quite hard.)

2888
01:37:02,019 --> 01:37:03,019
(Here you go.)

2889
01:37:03,019 --> 01:37:04,289
Giving the one who is hated another rice cake.

2890
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:06,419
- Correct.
- Nice.

2891
01:37:06,419 --> 01:37:08,619
(They got 4 questions right until now.)

2892
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:11,459
Getting your foot stubbed by a trusty ax.

2893
01:37:11,459 --> 01:37:12,459
Nice.

2894
01:37:12,829 --> 01:37:13,829
(Time is up.)

2895
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:14,829
Okay.

2896
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,129
How many did we get?

2897
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:17,529
You got five, Yi Kyung.

2898
01:37:17,529 --> 01:37:19,329
- That was good.
- Five is a good number.

2899
01:37:19,329 --> 01:37:21,069
- Let's go!
- He did really well.

2900
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,069
(His actions were very clear.)

2901
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:23,339
Were we next?

2902
01:37:23,339 --> 01:37:24,409
- Yes. Which number do we pick?
- Okay.

2903
01:37:24,509 --> 01:37:25,539
All right.

2904
01:37:25,869 --> 01:37:27,879
- Food.
- The next one is food!

2905
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:29,949
Food? Nice.

2906
01:37:30,249 --> 01:37:31,279
Food is an easy one.

2907
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:32,679
We'll start.

2908
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:34,379
(Team Sang Uk starts!)

2909
01:37:34,379 --> 01:37:36,219
(First word)

2910
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:38,849
(Chicken gizzard)

2911
01:37:38,849 --> 01:37:39,919
Fried chicken!

2912
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:42,789
Pass!

2913
01:37:42,789 --> 01:37:44,059
(Pass)

2914
01:37:44,189 --> 01:37:46,629
(They quickly move onto the next word.)

2915
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,559
(Slurping noodles)

2916
01:37:48,559 --> 01:37:49,799
Curry.

2917
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:52,499
- That's...
- Curry.

2918
01:37:52,669 --> 01:37:53,699
(Getting an answer)

2919
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:54,899
Soup?

2920
01:37:55,899 --> 01:37:57,109
Pass.

2921
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:59,109
(They currently attempted 2 and passed 2.)

2922
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:01,609
(His work has become faster thanks to them.)

2923
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:07,379
- Rice cake skewer?
- Nice one.

2924
01:38:07,379 --> 01:38:08,649
(Describing again)

2925
01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:10,119
Tornado potatoes?

2926
01:38:10,449 --> 01:38:11,489
This is hard.

2927
01:38:11,489 --> 01:38:13,559
(Since Sang Uk is struggling...)

2928
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:17,129
(The hint man suddenly joins in.)

2929
01:38:17,289 --> 01:38:19,329
Chicken skewer? Tornado potatoes?

2930
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:21,359
- Pass.
- Pass.

2931
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:23,899
(Oxtail soup)

2932
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:25,299
(The next word is a tough one.)

2933
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:28,299
- The proverbs were easier.
- Gosh.

2934
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:30,269
- Chicken!
- Chicken!

2935
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:31,609
Baeksuk.

2936
01:38:32,269 --> 01:38:33,339
Chicken baeksuk?

2937
01:38:33,339 --> 01:38:35,609
- Nice. Keep going.
- Duck baeksuk?

2938
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:37,449
- What is it?
- Pass!

2939
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:40,219
(Passing whenever Sang Uk speaks)

2940
01:38:40,419 --> 01:38:41,479
You'll be the one to go home.

2941
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:42,979
- No.
- It's you.

2942
01:38:43,449 --> 01:38:45,449
(It seems like he's done for.)

2943
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:46,719
- Red bean porridge?
- Pass!

2944
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:47,819
- Radish!
- Pass!

2945
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:49,319
- Gimbap.
- Pass!

2946
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:50,529
- The caldron...
- Pass!

2947
01:38:51,089 --> 01:38:52,159
(He's very busy thanks to them.)

2948
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,399
Pass!

2949
01:38:53,559 --> 01:38:54,629
Pass!

2950
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:55,729
Gosh, it's this one.

2951
01:38:56,059 --> 01:38:57,969
(At this rate...)

2952
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:59,669
You're doomed.

2953
01:38:59,669 --> 01:39:01,669
(You're doomed.)

2954
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:04,409
(Time is up for Team Sang Uk.)

2955
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,679
- What were the answers?
- Oxtail soup and rolled omelet.

2956
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:08,509
- That was so hard!
- Small octopus.

2957
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:09,839
- Oxtail soup?
- Chicken gizzard.

2958
01:39:09,879 --> 01:39:11,149
Sang Uk got no answers.

2959
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:13,149
That was hard.

2960
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:14,249
It's okay.

2961
01:39:14,249 --> 01:39:16,179
If I seem to struggle, pass the answer.

2962
01:39:16,349 --> 01:39:17,849
You don't have to pass too quickly.

2963
01:39:18,549 --> 01:39:21,059
- Gosh, this one is easy.
- This one is easy.

2964
01:39:21,059 --> 01:39:22,989
We'll go with movies next.

2965
01:39:23,329 --> 01:39:24,359
Movies?

2966
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:26,629
(The first movie)

2967
01:39:27,559 --> 01:39:29,559
"The Host!" Okay.

2968
01:39:29,559 --> 01:39:31,799
- Are you serious?
- It's that easy?

2969
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:33,229
Gosh, it's over.

2970
01:39:35,999 --> 01:39:38,109
"Nameless Gangster!" Okay.

2971
01:39:38,109 --> 01:39:39,169
Correct.

2972
01:39:39,169 --> 01:39:40,679
(They got two questions right.)

2973
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,239
("A Moment to Remember")

2974
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,409
"A Moment to Remember!" Okay!

2975
01:39:45,409 --> 01:39:47,379
("A Moment to Remember")

2976
01:39:47,749 --> 01:39:48,779
Correct.

2977
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:51,489
("My Daughter Is a Zombie")

2978
01:39:51,489 --> 01:39:52,749
Zombie!

2979
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:55,159
(Doing his best to act like a zombie as an introvert)

2980
01:39:55,259 --> 01:39:56,759
(Zombie!)

2981
01:39:57,329 --> 01:39:58,829
"Train to Busan!"

2982
01:39:59,029 --> 01:40:00,929
Or "Kingdom!"

2983
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:02,959
(Turning into a different zombie)

2984
01:40:03,029 --> 01:40:04,469
What zombie films are there?

2985
01:40:04,469 --> 01:40:05,599
(Zombie acting expert)

2986
01:40:05,969 --> 01:40:08,499
(He gives up on being an introvert for the answer.)

2987
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:09,869
It's definitely a zombie.

2988
01:40:11,809 --> 01:40:13,779
(Loading zombie films)

2989
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:14,939
- Pass.
- Pass!

2990
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:16,009
There are too many of them.

2991
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:17,649
("Kung Fu Panda")

2992
01:40:18,809 --> 01:40:20,779
(Kung Fu)

2993
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:21,879
(Tossing)

2994
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:23,449
(Get the answer, Dong Hyun!)

2995
01:40:23,449 --> 01:40:24,619
What's that?

2996
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,349
What was that again?

2997
01:40:26,349 --> 01:40:27,919
No!

2998
01:40:28,889 --> 01:40:31,559
(He describes that the panda loves noodles.)

2999
01:40:31,629 --> 01:40:33,289
It's Choi Daniel.

3000
01:40:33,599 --> 01:40:34,799
Chinese martial arts?

3001
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:36,329
"Kung Fu Hustle?"

3002
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:39,169
- This one.
- The one with Choi Daniel.

3003
01:40:39,169 --> 01:40:40,499
Bruce Lee? Jeet Kune Do?

3004
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:42,069
- Pass!
- Pass.

3005
01:40:42,199 --> 01:40:43,669
"Ong Bak 3."

3006
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:44,909
("Tazza")

3007
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:48,079
"Tazza!"

3008
01:40:49,339 --> 01:40:51,449
(They currently got four questions right.)

3009
01:40:51,709 --> 01:40:53,479
(Acting like Gollum)

3010
01:40:53,849 --> 01:40:54,849
It's another monster.

3011
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:57,289
It's similar.

3012
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:58,789
- He pointed at his finger.
- Ring! "The Lord of the Rings!"

3013
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,119
Correct.

3014
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:01,989
(They currently got five questions right.)

3015
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,359
No!

3016
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:04,359
(Dong Hyun is currently tied with Yi Kyung.)

3017
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:06,289
(Let's get one more question right.)

3018
01:41:06,559 --> 01:41:08,659
(Here's the next question.)

3019
01:41:09,299 --> 01:41:11,399
("Aladdin?")

3020
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,199
(Getting on the magic carpet)

3021
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,569
(Using his brain to the max)

3022
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,269
(Focusing)

3023
01:41:16,339 --> 01:41:17,469
How much time is left?

3024
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:19,469
There are 15 seconds left.

3025
01:41:20,309 --> 01:41:22,839
(This could be the last question with the time left.)

3026
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:24,009
What is this?

3027
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:26,779
- Pass!
- "Aladdin?"

3028
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:27,919
("Aladdin")

3029
01:41:28,019 --> 01:41:31,989
(Walk-off hit)

3030
01:41:31,989 --> 01:41:33,389
You got six questions right.

3031
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:35,759
You're great at this. Thank you!

3032
01:41:35,759 --> 01:41:37,059
Okay!

3033
01:41:37,659 --> 01:41:40,229
(He fails to go home in the end.)

3034
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:41,729
I have to be in a movie shoot. This is bad.

3035
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:44,029
- Thank you.
- Let's thank the people...

3036
01:41:44,029 --> 01:41:45,029
- who have helped us.
- Thank you, Hyun Min.

3037
01:41:45,029 --> 01:41:46,129
They did so well.

3038
01:41:46,129 --> 01:41:47,839
Hyun Min did a great job, but I couldn't get the answers.

3039
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:49,969
I won!

3040
01:41:49,969 --> 01:41:51,069
Thank you.

3041
01:41:51,069 --> 01:41:52,509
(They even take a picture together!)

3042
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:54,309
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

3043
01:41:54,309 --> 01:41:55,939
- Good luck.
- I'm off.

3044
01:41:55,939 --> 01:41:56,979
(I will get going first.)

3045
01:41:57,009 --> 01:41:58,379
Gosh, Dong Hyun.

3046
01:41:58,679 --> 01:41:59,809
I feel bad.

3047
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:01,149
Who will be the loser?

3048
01:42:01,249 --> 01:42:02,319
(They all leave like that.)

3049
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:03,349
I'm off!

3050
01:42:03,919 --> 01:42:05,189
Bye!

3051
01:42:05,749 --> 01:42:07,919
- Bye!
- Bye!

3052
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,689
You two are left now.

3053
01:42:09,919 --> 01:42:13,599
Dumulmeori is a famous spot for dates.

3054
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:15,759
(The two of us on a date?)

3055
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:18,599
The two of you can walk together and take pictures.

3056
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:21,239
Have an affectionate time.

3057
01:42:23,299 --> 01:42:25,439
If you walk straight up,

3058
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,779
- there will be a nice photo spot.
- Right.

3059
01:42:27,779 --> 01:42:29,379
- Go and take a picture together.
- Great.

3060
01:42:29,379 --> 01:42:31,379
- Let's go on a date.
- Come back after that.

3061
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,309
I'm happy to be with Sang Uk.

3062
01:42:33,309 --> 01:42:34,549
- Gosh.
- We slept next to each other too.

3063
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:37,189
We've spent so much time together.

3064
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:41,259
I didn't expect to stay until the end.

3065
01:42:41,589 --> 01:42:42,889
"Getting a slap in the face in Jongno."

3066
01:42:42,889 --> 01:42:44,189
I couldn't remember Jongno.

3067
01:42:44,189 --> 01:42:45,929
"A frog in a well" was really easy as well.

3068
01:42:45,929 --> 01:42:47,799
- Was in "a frog in a well?" - Yes.

3069
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:50,769
That must be the photo spot. The frame.

3070
01:42:51,029 --> 01:42:52,169
- That?
- Yes.

3071
01:42:53,169 --> 01:42:54,369
Oh, gosh.

3072
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:56,639
- What is this?
- Oh, right.

3073
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:58,269
We also did Pilates together yesterday.

3074
01:42:58,269 --> 01:42:59,269
Right.

3075
01:42:59,269 --> 01:43:00,709
What do we do? This?

3076
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:01,739
(They decide to go with the Pilates pose.)

3077
01:43:01,839 --> 01:43:05,949
(We must be meant for each other.)

3078
01:43:06,309 --> 01:43:08,219
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thank you.

3079
01:43:08,419 --> 01:43:10,489
Men are done once their tasks are done.

3080
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:12,119
Let's see.

3081
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,359
(We look great together.)

3082
01:43:14,619 --> 01:43:16,989
- This will be the last game.
- Right.

3083
01:43:17,129 --> 01:43:20,029
One eye will be covered for this game.

3084
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:22,899
Ten elephant trunk spins will be done.

3085
01:43:22,899 --> 01:43:24,199
I'm done for again.

3086
01:43:24,469 --> 01:43:26,939
Your goal is to hit the ping pong ball...

3087
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:28,299
on top of the water bottle at once.

3088
01:43:28,299 --> 01:43:29,439
- Hitting it at once like this?
- Yes.

3089
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:30,439
(There's only one chance to hit the ball.)

3090
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:32,069
The water bottle must stay standing.

3091
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:33,579
Just the ball must be hit.

3092
01:43:33,639 --> 01:43:34,679
Decide on the order.

3093
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:36,309
After taking turns, the one to make it first...

3094
01:43:36,309 --> 01:43:38,379
- will be able to go home.
- Okay.

3095
01:43:38,609 --> 01:43:40,279
- Do we untie this?
- Yes.

3096
01:43:40,279 --> 01:43:41,479
Decide on the order after that.

3097
01:43:41,479 --> 01:43:42,479
(The straps are untied for their safety.)

3098
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:44,119
Is it covered like this?

3099
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:46,619
- It doesn't matter, right?
- Right.

3100
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:49,089
(Putting on the eye patch in a serious manner)

3101
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:50,119
Gosh!

3102
01:43:50,829 --> 01:43:51,859
That hurt.

3103
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:54,259
I'm left with a guy like this.

3104
01:43:54,929 --> 01:43:57,199
- Whenever you're ready.
- Sang Uk first?

3105
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,329
I'll get it done at once. You should think carefully.

3106
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,499
You can go first. You wanted to go first.

3107
01:44:01,499 --> 01:44:04,309
- Okay.
- Okay.

3108
01:44:06,009 --> 01:44:09,109
- One, two, three, - Two, three,

3109
01:44:09,109 --> 01:44:12,449
- four, five, six, - four, five, six,

3110
01:44:12,449 --> 01:44:16,219
- seven, eight, nine, ten. Go!
- seven, eight...

3111
01:44:18,389 --> 01:44:20,659
(The dizziness is coming.)

3112
01:44:20,689 --> 01:44:22,189
(Going off course)

3113
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:24,589
(The course will be searched again.)

3114
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:26,759
(That's good. Keep going off course.)

3115
01:44:28,059 --> 01:44:30,229
(Returning to the course)

3116
01:44:32,129 --> 01:44:34,499
- Fail.
- Why?

3117
01:44:34,499 --> 01:44:35,999
I said the water bottle had to stay standing.

3118
01:44:35,999 --> 01:44:37,069
(You fail even when the water bottle falls over.)

3119
01:44:37,569 --> 01:44:38,709
Okay.

3120
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:39,969
We'll begin.

3121
01:44:42,379 --> 01:44:44,179
One, two...

3122
01:44:44,179 --> 01:44:45,379
I'm already dizzy. Gosh!

3123
01:44:45,549 --> 01:44:48,119
Three, four,

3124
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:50,219
five, six,

3125
01:44:50,389 --> 01:44:52,819
seven, eight,

3126
01:44:52,989 --> 01:44:54,859
nine, ten.

3127
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:59,159
(What?)

3128
01:44:59,389 --> 01:45:00,399
Where am I going?

3129
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:03,059
(His cochlea is out of control.)

3130
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:04,169
It's over there.

3131
01:45:04,169 --> 01:45:05,199
(Laughing)

3132
01:45:05,329 --> 01:45:06,329
(It's over there.)

3133
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:08,499
Where am I going?

3134
01:45:08,499 --> 01:45:10,469
(Don't move out of the screen.)

3135
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:13,039
(I keep getting further away from it.)

3136
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:14,109
Where am I going?

3137
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:18,479
(He arrives at the destination by the longest route.)

3138
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:23,849
- Yes!
- Fail.

3139
01:45:23,989 --> 01:45:26,249
(Relieved)

3140
01:45:26,519 --> 01:45:28,859
- This is harder than I thought.
- I need to take a rest.

3141
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,829
(The Cochlear canal is calming down.)

3142
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:31,859
Shall we go again?

3143
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,029
(Sang Uk tries.)

3144
01:45:33,129 --> 01:45:34,659
- Here we go.
- I can do it.

3145
01:45:34,659 --> 01:45:35,699
(Wishing himself luck)

3146
01:45:35,759 --> 01:45:37,129
This won't do. I have to disturb him.

3147
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:39,629
One.

3148
01:45:39,669 --> 01:45:40,699
Two.

3149
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:43,709
(Yi Kyung spins Sang Uk like he's a top.)

3150
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:46,169
(Scurrying away)

3151
01:45:46,169 --> 01:45:47,809
Six, seven.

3152
01:45:47,839 --> 01:45:49,379
(Spinning him fast while gritting his teeth)

3153
01:45:49,379 --> 01:45:50,709
- It's too fast.
- Eight.

3154
01:45:50,909 --> 01:45:52,979
(And spinning him as far as possible)

3155
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:54,049
Nine.

3156
01:45:54,249 --> 01:45:55,249
- Ten.
- How far are you going?

3157
01:45:55,249 --> 01:45:56,379
Hurry up. Five...

3158
01:45:56,879 --> 01:45:58,489
Five, four...

3159
01:45:58,489 --> 01:46:00,049
(Adjusting his cochlear canal)

3160
01:46:00,149 --> 01:46:02,289
(You won't make it.)

3161
01:46:03,019 --> 01:46:04,829
(Surprised)

3162
01:46:05,059 --> 01:46:06,559
(Advancing quickly with fencing footwork)

3163
01:46:06,559 --> 01:46:08,529
Two, one.

3164
01:46:08,659 --> 01:46:09,759
(He approaches the ping pong ball safely.)

3165
01:46:09,759 --> 01:46:10,799
Time is up.

3166
01:46:10,799 --> 01:46:11,969
(He misses the flick.)

3167
01:46:11,969 --> 01:46:13,529
- He failed.
- Goodness.

3168
01:46:13,529 --> 01:46:14,569
You failed.

3169
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,969
I think this will be my last chance.

3170
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:18,839
This is my last chance.

3171
01:46:19,569 --> 01:46:21,009
(Yi Kyung tries.)

3172
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:23,509
(Starting elephant trunk spins)

3173
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,409
Two, three,

3174
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:26,709
- four.
- Gosh.

3175
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:28,879
(Doing exactly what he did to him)

3176
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:31,449
(He's spinning him fast.)

3177
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,989
(The pigeon gets dizzy.)

3178
01:46:34,419 --> 01:46:35,459
Ten.

3179
01:46:35,459 --> 01:46:36,589
(He finished 10 elephant trunk spins.)

3180
01:46:36,759 --> 01:46:37,789
(All he has to do is move forward.)

3181
01:46:37,789 --> 01:46:39,859
- I can do it.
- Come.

3182
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:41,999
(Nervous)

3183
01:46:42,059 --> 01:46:43,199
Come.

3184
01:46:43,769 --> 01:46:45,369
I can do it.

3185
01:46:45,829 --> 01:46:46,969
Sang Uk, I'm leaving.

3186
01:46:46,969 --> 01:46:48,899
(Sang Uk, I'm leaving first.)

3187
01:46:50,199 --> 01:46:51,339
You failed.

3188
01:46:51,339 --> 01:46:53,109
(Yi Kyung failed.)

3189
01:46:53,339 --> 01:46:54,439
(Disheartened)

3190
01:46:54,439 --> 01:46:55,879
It's hard to do it.

3191
01:46:56,839 --> 01:46:58,579
I felt nervous just now.

3192
01:46:58,579 --> 01:46:59,649
(I felt nervous.)

3193
01:46:59,779 --> 01:47:01,279
I feel like I'm still spinning.

3194
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:03,679
(Sang Uk, why am I still spinning?)

3195
01:47:03,889 --> 01:47:06,489
Will I be spinning 30 times?

3196
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:08,389
Here we go.

3197
01:47:08,389 --> 01:47:09,789
(Sang Uk's 30th spin challenge)

3198
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:12,129
You spin me really fast.

3199
01:47:12,189 --> 01:47:13,959
(He pulls up his sleeves to get ready to spin him.)

3200
01:47:14,899 --> 01:47:16,029
- Already?
- One.

3201
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:17,899
(Spinning Sang Uk roughly as soon as they start)

3202
01:47:17,999 --> 01:47:21,899
(Staggering)

3203
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:25,869
(As you can see, getting off is very hard.)

3204
01:47:26,369 --> 01:47:27,439
Ten.

3205
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:28,479
(He made 10 elephant trunk spins with speed.)

3206
01:47:30,809 --> 01:47:32,909
(Things are going smoothly so far.)

3207
01:47:33,209 --> 01:47:34,679
Hurry up. Two, one.

3208
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:35,819
(Will he flick only the ping pong ball?)

3209
01:47:36,849 --> 01:47:37,919
One.

3210
01:47:38,049 --> 01:47:39,689
(Oh Sang Uk succeeds.)

3211
01:47:39,689 --> 01:47:40,759
I'm worried.

3212
01:47:40,759 --> 01:47:41,789
(Oh Sang Uk succeeds.)

3213
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:42,989
I'm leaving.

3214
01:47:43,419 --> 01:47:44,529
I'm worried.

3215
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:47,259
(Yi Kyung gets the penalty.)

3216
01:47:47,329 --> 01:47:48,429
Well done.

3217
01:47:48,429 --> 01:47:50,499
(The last person to get off work is Sang Uk.)

3218
01:47:50,569 --> 01:47:51,769
It was a nice game.

3219
01:47:51,899 --> 01:47:53,799
You may get off work now.

3220
01:47:53,799 --> 01:47:54,869
Bye.

3221
01:47:56,169 --> 01:47:57,869
- Goodbye.
- Get home safe.

3222
01:47:57,869 --> 01:47:58,909
(The next stage awaits Yi Kyung.)

3223
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:01,679
Yi Kyung, you failed to get off work until the end.

3224
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:03,809
Go back to the corn dog place that you enjoyed.

3225
01:48:03,809 --> 01:48:06,779
Sell 50 of their corn dogs before going home.

3226
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:09,319
(Selling 50 corn dogs)

3227
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:12,119
(The penalty starts.)

3228
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:13,689
I can't believe this is how the camping ends.

3229
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:14,789
(He puts on the gloves quickly.)

3230
01:48:14,959 --> 01:48:16,259
- Hello.
- Hello.

3231
01:48:16,259 --> 01:48:17,359
- You're my instructor.
- Hello.

3232
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:18,859
I look forward to working with you.

3233
01:48:19,329 --> 01:48:20,629
First, take a look at what he does.

3234
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:21,659
Okay.

3235
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:23,199
(Focused)

3236
01:48:23,229 --> 01:48:25,069
Pour some sugar all at once.

3237
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:27,699
- A lot at once.
- After that,

3238
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:29,399
squeeze a thick layer of the sauce.

3239
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:30,769
This is amazing.

3240
01:48:31,469 --> 01:48:33,739
- You do it all at once?
- I cover it with a thick layer.

3241
01:48:33,739 --> 01:48:35,879
(Step 3: Squeeze out the mustard in long lines.)

3242
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:37,509
(Exclaiming)

3243
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:38,709
You do exactly what I showed you.

3244
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:40,149
(You do exactly what I showed you.)

3245
01:48:40,209 --> 01:48:41,549
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

3246
01:48:41,919 --> 01:48:42,949
Hello.

3247
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:45,089
- Can you sprinkle the spicy sauce?
- Okay.

3248
01:48:45,089 --> 01:48:46,249
One with spicy sauce.

3249
01:48:46,249 --> 01:48:47,559
- Would you like all the sauces?
- All.

3250
01:48:47,719 --> 01:48:49,289
Wrap it. Based on what I saw...

3251
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:50,889
- Only on 1 side?
- Yes, only on 1 side.

3252
01:48:50,929 --> 01:48:52,089
- Only on one side like this?
- Yes.

3253
01:48:52,089 --> 01:48:53,389
(Pour a lot of sugar and shake it off)

3254
01:48:53,459 --> 01:48:54,529
Isn't it correct?

3255
01:48:55,059 --> 01:48:57,329
(Next is putting on ketchup, which is important.)

3256
01:48:57,799 --> 01:48:59,099
It requires technique.

3257
01:48:59,729 --> 01:49:00,969
If it turns out ugly,

3258
01:49:00,969 --> 01:49:02,099
you have to eat it yourself.

3259
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:03,599
(What?)

3260
01:49:03,599 --> 01:49:04,769
Could you explain...

3261
01:49:04,969 --> 01:49:06,069
to the customer?

3262
01:49:06,069 --> 01:49:07,439
(Putting on the sauce gets more stressful.)

3263
01:49:07,509 --> 01:49:09,139
- Does it look okay?
- Yes.

3264
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:10,849
Say "enjoy" as you serve it.

3265
01:49:10,849 --> 01:49:12,979
- Enjoy. It's the spicy type.
- Enjoy.

3266
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:14,049
Hello.

3267
01:49:15,149 --> 01:49:17,389
- One mild, one spicy, please.
- One of each?

3268
01:49:17,489 --> 01:49:18,849
Would you like all the sauces?

3269
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:21,059
For the mild one, I'd like sugar only.

3270
01:49:21,419 --> 01:49:22,689
For the spicy one, I'd like the sauce.

3271
01:49:22,689 --> 01:49:23,759
- I see.
- I mean, ketchup.

3272
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:24,759
Only the ketchup.

3273
01:49:24,759 --> 01:49:25,959
Why not make them the same?

3274
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,499
- No, you can't ask that.
- Really?

3275
01:49:27,499 --> 01:49:28,759
Only sugar on the mild one.

3276
01:49:28,759 --> 01:49:30,929
(A lot of sugar for the mild taste)

3277
01:49:31,129 --> 01:49:32,629
Only ketchup on the spicy one.

3278
01:49:32,629 --> 01:49:33,799
(Squeezing out ketchup on the spicy corn dog)

3279
01:49:33,799 --> 01:49:34,869
(Squeezing out ketchup)

3280
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:36,669
(Always surveilling the sauce)

3281
01:49:36,839 --> 01:49:38,409
- Here you go.
- There they are.

3282
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:40,339
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Thank you.

3283
01:49:40,339 --> 01:49:42,309
- Enjoy them.
- Thank you.

3284
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:44,579
I get used to the environment very fast.

3285
01:49:45,009 --> 01:49:46,849
Seven mild corn dogs, please.

3286
01:49:46,849 --> 01:49:48,149
Seven?

3287
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:49,519
- Seven?
- Seven.

3288
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:51,719
Seven.

3289
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,289
I saw you doing three at a time.

3290
01:49:54,059 --> 01:49:55,719
You grabbed the three like this.

3291
01:49:56,489 --> 01:49:57,629
After grabbing them like this...

3292
01:49:57,829 --> 01:50:00,489
(Surprised)

3293
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:04,229
(Applying the sauce with ease)

3294
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:05,269
All the way.

3295
01:50:05,269 --> 01:50:06,669
You're improving.

3296
01:50:06,669 --> 01:50:07,869
- Aren't I improving?
- Yes.

3297
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:09,969
(As expected, he's the best worker from Handsome Guys.)

3298
01:50:09,999 --> 01:50:11,839
Thank you. Enjoy.

3299
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:14,309
I have a daughter who was born in 1987.

3300
01:50:14,309 --> 01:50:15,709
- Is that so?
- Would you like her number?

3301
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:17,009
No. I'm not...

3302
01:50:17,249 --> 01:50:18,979
No, I'm not...

3303
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:19,979
This is the spicy one.

3304
01:50:19,979 --> 01:50:22,019
That's spicy, and this is not spicy.

3305
01:50:22,779 --> 01:50:24,889
This is a nice workplace.

3306
01:50:25,019 --> 01:50:26,489
Thank you. Enjoy.

3307
01:50:27,319 --> 01:50:31,529
(Then he got absorbed in squeezing sauces.)

3308
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:32,589
- Five.
- Five.

3309
01:50:32,589 --> 01:50:34,329
(While holding 4 corn dogs,)

3310
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:36,999
(he can apply ketchup easily.)

3311
01:50:37,029 --> 01:50:38,599
Today is your first day,

3312
01:50:38,599 --> 01:50:39,829
- but you're very good.
- I agree.

3313
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:41,169
I've tried it, and it's very delicious.

3314
01:50:41,169 --> 01:50:42,839
- I'm your fan.
- Thank you.

3315
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:45,039
You're my favorite customer.

3316
01:50:45,569 --> 01:50:47,279
- It got on your hand.
- It's okay.

3317
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:49,009
Please take some of this.

3318
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:50,679
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

3319
01:50:50,679 --> 01:50:51,879
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

3320
01:50:51,879 --> 01:50:53,379
This is the mild one.

3321
01:50:53,379 --> 01:50:54,419
- This is the spicy one.
- Thank you.

3322
01:50:54,879 --> 01:50:56,319
Enjoy. Here you go.

3323
01:50:56,419 --> 01:50:57,919
Enjoy. Thank you.

3324
01:50:57,919 --> 01:50:58,949
- Take care.
- Good job.

3325
01:50:58,949 --> 01:51:00,859
Thank you, everyone.

3326
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:02,789
(He finished selling 50 corn dogs.)

3327
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:04,559
- You're good.
- Thank you.

3328
01:51:04,559 --> 01:51:05,559
Well done.

3329
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:07,759
Well done, everyone.

3330
01:51:07,759 --> 01:51:09,029
(His penalty is cleared.)

3331
01:51:09,129 --> 01:51:11,199
Everyone, Handsome Guys...

3332
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,769
- finally became a regular show.
- Yes.

3333
01:51:14,599 --> 01:51:16,939
This is all thanks to your passionate love...

3334
01:51:16,939 --> 01:51:18,439
and support.

3335
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:20,569
We will take a very brief moment...

3336
01:51:20,569 --> 01:51:22,839
to reorganize and return.

3337
01:51:23,179 --> 01:51:25,409
After becoming funnier and more competitive,

3338
01:51:25,409 --> 01:51:26,949
we'll be back for the New Year.

01:51:27,209 --> 01:51:29,049
Until then, don't forget us...

3340
01:51:29,049 --> 01:51:31,389
- and wait for us.
- Wait for us.

3341
01:51:31,519 --> 01:51:32,919
Please.

3342
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:34,119
(Look forward to handsomer Handsome Guys early next year.)

3343
01:52:28,911 --> 01:52:34,121
(Handsome Guys, see you again next year!)
