1
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,731
(Is it doenjang stew...)

2
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:18,442
(or kimchi stew?)

3
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:20,401
(Chicken feet...)

4
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,171
(or jokbal?)

5
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,241
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:26,411
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:28,182
(and regret)

8
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:30,782
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:34,092
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:36,252
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:41,792
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:43,962
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:51,272
(A concrete jungle)

14
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:56,072
(Lush greenery amidst the concrete jungle)

15
00:00:56,742 --> 00:01:01,112
(It's a place with well-preserved history of five millennia.)

16
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:03,912
It's beautiful out.

17
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:06,882
- Good morning. - Good morning.

18
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,652
The weather is beautiful.

19
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,252
Dong Hyun, where are we?

20
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:11,492
We're in Samsung-dong.

21
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,492
- We're in Seolleung. - Oh, Seolleung.

22
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,091
- Seolleung. - Seolleung.

23
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:16,692
- We're in Seolleung. - What does "Seolleung" mean?

24
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,532
- It means royal tombs. - Tombs.

25
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:19,732
- Tombs? - Yes.

26
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,531
- In Korean history... - Since he passed Korean history...

27
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:22,901
- test level 5, I wanted to ask him. - He passed level 5.

28
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:24,071
Of course, I know.

29
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:25,101
(Seolleung refers to royal tombs...)

30
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:26,241
(of King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon.)

31
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:27,242
Oh, right.

32
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:30,341
When I checked everyone's win rate...

33
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:31,342
Yes?

34
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:34,752
One of us is overwhelmingly at the bottom.

35
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,382
Who is that person?

36
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:39,081
(It's me.)

37
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,321
- I... - But...

38
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,851
The gap between the first-place winner...

39
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,461
and the one at the bottom is getting huge.

40
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,462
Really?

41
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:47,462
The knowledge gap is quite evident.

42
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,462
While growing up, I only practiced martial arts.

43
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,731
The rest of you stayed in school and studied.

44
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:53,732
- That's not true. - While...

45
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,271
you studied, I trained...

46
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,371
- as a martial artist. - You can't think that way.

47
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,871
In terms of academic background, neither did he...

48
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,071
I left school very early.

49
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,672
He took the qualification exam instead.

50
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,311
Seung Ho is missing today.

51
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,742
- He's not here. - He's late today.

52
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:09,412
Seung Ho couldn't be here due to a prior engagement.

53
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,781
Who will replace Seung Ho?

54
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,222
It can't be just the four of us.

55
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,021
I wonder who's coming today.

56
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:17,392
I overheard someone talk about today's guest.

57
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,062
It's someone whom Dong Hyun would like.

58
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:21,362
- He'll like him. - An athlete?

59
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,931
(Smiling slightly)

60
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,702
Is it because he's an athlete, or is it for another reason?

61
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,261
Someone who isn't academic?

62
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,101
- In terms of knowledge? - Yes.

63
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,832
- You're both on a similar level. - Similar?

64
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:32,142
That sounds good.

65
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:35,042
Let's call him out. Tae Kyun.

66
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,041
Hello.

67
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,011
- Hello. - Hello.

68
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,342
(Hanhwa Eagles' eternal cleanup hitter, Kim Tae Kyun)

69
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:43,382
(The right-handed hitter with the most hits in KBO)

70
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,452
(311 home runs)

71
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:49,892
(The 4th Hanhwa Eagles' retired number)

72
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,792
(The Eagles' eternal cleanup hitter)

73
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,592
(There's something else he does as well as playing baseball?)

74
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,631
(He turns out to be a secret eating expert.)

75
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:02,071
(Slurping)

76
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,172
(Exclaiming)

77
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:06,401
(Eating endlessly in a trance)

78
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:07,641
(Full of anticipation)

79
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,372
(What kind of eating will he show on Handsome Guys?)

80
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,811
(The Eagles' eternal Player Number 52)

81
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,581
(Kim Tae Kyun)

82
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,651
- I'm so glad to see you. - You came today.

83
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,112
Didn't he get bigger?

84
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,051
Did you plan it beforehand as the athletic group?

85
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,721
Are the teams determined?

86
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,192
- You're right. - Goodness.

87
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,151
Members of the athletic group can communicate...

88
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:25,361
- without words. - Did they plan this?

89
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,792
How did they end up dressing the same?

90
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,461
If the three of them become a team...

91
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:30,462
(If the athletic group becomes a team)

92
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,102
Won't they completely destroy the restaurants where they eat?

93
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,701
We have a stronger connection...

94
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,132
- because we're both from Daejeon. - Right.

95
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:37,601
- You're from Daejeon? - Yes.

96
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,041
Both of you are from Daejeon.

97
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,401
- You're from Daejeon too. - We're all from Daejeon.

98
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:42,912
This can't be helped. These three should team up.

99
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,112
I mean...

100
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,682
Tae Kyun, you've gotten more slender.

101
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:50,051
- Right? I'm on a diet. - He got slender.

102
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:51,882
- Yes, you lost weight. - Right?

103
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,821
Are you still on a diet?

104
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:55,251
I'm still on a diet.

105
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,962
I decided that today will be my kitching day.

106
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,961
- You won't restrict yourself today? - What day?

107
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,092
- "Kitchen day?" - "Kitchen?"

108
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,291
- Kitchen day? - Chiking day.

109
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,331
"Chiking?"

110
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:04,401
- Kitchen day? - Kitchen day.

111
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:05,402
- "Kitchen?" - "Kitchen day?"

112
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:07,001
The day when you eat a lot in the kitchen?

113
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,372
- Kitching day. - "Kitching day?"

114
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,402
- Teaching. - Yes, teaching day.

115
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:12,202
What's "teaching day?"

116
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,172
None of you know either.

117
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,642
I can't believe that I lost the quizzes to these people.

118
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:17,841
This is difficult.

119
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,981
- None of you know. - What do you mean by "teaching?"

120
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:21,182
It's kitching day.

121
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:24,622
I can eat your portions since it's my kitching day.

122
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,581
Please don't use that word.

123
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:27,752
We all understood anyway.

124
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,122
It's his cheating day.

125
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,261
On the show, we don't just eat.

126
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,292
We answer the quiz to decide who will pay.

127
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:35,932
What place do you think you'll get here?

128
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:37,491
Among the athletes,

129
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,132
I'm a baseball commentator.

130
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:40,932
Being a commentator has...

131
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,671
nothing to do with your knowledge.

132
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:45,241
To be a commentator, I have to study.

133
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,271
- Really? - Yes.

134
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,912
- I also have to read books. - By the way,

135
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:50,171
- Sang Uk is good at quizzes. - Really?

136
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,681
- You never know. - Really?

137
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:52,942
When did you start playing baseball?

138
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:54,381
I started when I was in second grade.

139
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:55,811
I started fencing I was in seventh grade.

140
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,351
Then you must be smarter than me.

141
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,651
You graduated from elementary school.

142
00:04:58,652 --> 00:04:59,752
Exactly.

143
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,751
- I finished compulsory education. - I see.

144
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:02,821
Then I can't compare to you.

145
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,191
(The 1st place in the athletic group goes to Sang Uk.)

146
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,722
He finished compulsory education.

147
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,732
Anyway, we're in Seolleung with Tae Kyun.

148
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,161
As you know, on the other side,

149
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,202
there's Teheran-ro.

150
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:14,802
- Teheran-ro. - I know.

151
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,901
Do you know why...

152
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,172
it was named "Teheran-ro?"

153
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,071
- Dong Hyun, could you explain? - I know.

154
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,572
It's related to India.

155
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,042
- Go on and explain. - That's all I know.

156
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,042
Do you know the capital city of Iran?

157
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,752
- Is it Iran? - Is it Teheran?

158
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,951
- Tehran's the capital city of Iran. - I'm sorry.

159
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,321
- The mayor of Tehran came... - Iran?

160
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,422
To visit Korea.

161
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,821
They decided to trade.

162
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,291
There's Seoul Street in Tehran.

163
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,691
In Seoul, there's Teheran-ro.

164
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:42,062
That's why it's called Teheran-ro.

165
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,461
On that street, won't it feel like eating in India?

166
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,462
Iran.

167
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,271
It's me who said India.

168
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,401
- It's me who said India. - Today, he said India...

169
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,601
and "kitching day."

170
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,542
- "Kitching day." - I won't forget his mistakes.

171
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:56,242
I won't be at the bottom during the quiz.

172
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:59,641
(Look forward to his performance during the quiz.)

173
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,581
Seolleung is a mecca...

174
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,612
for office workers.

175
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,752
All the offices are clustered in this area.

176
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,791
You often see waves of office workers pouring out.

177
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:10,822
There are so many.

178
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,832
All the skyscrapers on Teheran-ro are used as office space.

179
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:15,862
That's right.

180
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:19,702
(From hearty, budget friendly meals...)

181
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,131
(to gourmet dishes that are perfect for team dinners)

182
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,871
Aren't tasty restaurants in this area recognized?

183
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:24,872
Yes.

184
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:26,342
(Among so many dishes at this place)

185
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,642
(What will Handsome Guys recommend?)

186
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:33,182
We'll be eating lunch here today.

187
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,851
- Yes. - From what I briefly heard,

188
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,111
there's a famous shabu shabu restaurant over here.

189
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,251
It totally suits you.

190
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,681
There's a very famous shabu shabu restaurant.

191
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,692
I can imagine you eating vegetables dipped in the broth.

192
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,991
Shabu shabu feels healthy,

193
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:46,191
- especially after you eat it. - Right.

194
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:47,661
(Healthy and hearty shabu shabu that fills you up)

195
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,261
Tae Kyun, do you know any restaurant around here?

196
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,332
I've been to...

197
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,801
a sundae gukbap restaurant in this area.

198
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:54,802
- That's authentic. - Yes.

199
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:56,571
- Sundae gukbap? - That's authentic.

200
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:58,901
It's cost-effective for office workers.

201
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,871
- Right. - It's also a simple meal.

202
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:02,771
- They have to cure their hangover. - Exactly.

203
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:03,911
And they need a proper meal.

204
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:04,981
(Sundae gukbap is perfect in all situations.)

205
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:06,141
(Today's LMR)

206
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,481
(Lunch Menu Recommendation)

207
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,811
- Tae Hyun's... - We got two proper meals today.

208
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,252
Shabu shabu, and Tae Kyun's sundae gukbap.

209
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,052
- These are authentic dishes. - I agree.

210
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,422
Who wants what?

211
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,262
To be honest, my wife would be happy...

212
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,692
to eat shabu shabu throughout the year.

213
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,432
As she's such a fan, we often have shabu shabu.

214
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:28,231
So I'd like to eat shabu shabu again today.

215
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,102
If I eat shabu shabu, I won't have to pay.

216
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,502
Join me if you don't want to pay.

217
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,241
- Join me. - Both of them...

218
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:37,511
- I won't pay either. - But I want sundae gukbap.

219
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,611
- I can't decide. - If you're okay with paying,

220
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:40,882
- please join me. - Really?

221
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,611
Dong Hyun, are you good at quizzes?

222
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:44,721
No, I'm not,

223
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,421
but after hearing you say "kitchen," I became sure.

224
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,121
I thought, "I could get away with paying."

225
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:50,591
(Immediately seen as just another simple-minded guy)

226
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:51,792
It's hard to decide.

227
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:53,022
I'll get shabu shabu.

228
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,062
So I can adjust the amount I eat.

229
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,592
Yes, that's true.

230
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,792
- I'll get sundae gukbap. - Sundae gukbap?

231
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:01,332
- Tae Kyun, are you still thinking? - I'll also get sundae gukbap.

232
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,501
- It will be a big match. - Gukbap...

233
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:05,572
It's spear versus spear.

234
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:06,972
I wonder who will win.

235
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,671
Sundae gukbap?

236
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,841
I'm confident about not paying if I get sundae gukbap.

237
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:12,142
Right, you won't pay.

238
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,411
I'll eat shabu shabu today.

239
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,851
(Yi Kyung picks his favorite shabu shabu.)

240
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:16,852
Shabu shabu.

241
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,951
Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun,

242
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,451
and I'll get shabu shabu.

243
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:24,491
Tae Kyun and Sang Uk will get sundae gukbap...

244
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:25,991
for lunch.

245
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,422
Which dish will we eat first?

246
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:29,862
We'll go to the shabu shabu restaurant first.

247
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,461
- Shabu shabu. - We get to eat first.

248
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,001
Let's go to the shabu shabu restaurant.

249
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:36,501
- All right. - Let's go.

250
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,702
(Let's go to the shabu shabu restaurant.)

251
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,341
I rarely pick what I'm going to eat.

252
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,412
Picking what to eat is hard.

253
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,881
People like me order everything that they want.

254
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,692
- Right. - We don't pick just one dish.

255
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,051
There's a delicious smell all the way to this alley.

256
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,191
(If you follow the delicious smell that fills the alley)

257
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,861
I smell something.

258
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:01,391
Is this it? This is the place.

259
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,662
- Here it is. - Is it?

260
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,262
What?

261
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,061
He's an expert.

262
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,931
"International Maestro Chef Industry Certificate."

263
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:10,432
(From the entrance, you can sense the owner's confidence.)

264
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:15,642
(The first restaurant has an aura of a top-notch restaurant.)

265
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:19,511
(During lunchtime, )

266
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:23,712
(the place is packed with office workers.)

267
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:28,051
(Today's menu that will satisfy...)

268
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,792
(the hunger of office workers)

269
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,231
(Tender meat...)

270
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,632
(and full of vegetables)

271
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:42,001
(LMR 1, shabu shabu)

272
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,172
I should've picked shabu shabu instead.

273
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,502
I've seen Korean beef sirloin, but I've never seen blowfish kalguksu.

274
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:48,671
They serve spicy chicken stew with blue crabs.

275
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,271
Wait, I've never seen this before.

276
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,382
Spicy chicken stew with blue crabs?

277
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:52,912
Why would you look at single dishes?

278
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,752
Tae Hyun, just order a lot and leave us some food.

279
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,411
No, it doesn't work that way.

280
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:59,382
Dong Hyun, doesn't the spicy chicken stew with blue crabs sound amazing?

281
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,491
- I'd love some. - Blue crabs in spicy chicken stew?

282
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,522
I'm craving it a lot.

283
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,351
I'd like sirloin kalguksu.

284
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,261
- I'd like blowfish kalguksu. - How about an appetizer?

285
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:07,891
- Deep-fried shrimp? - Deep-fried shrimp sounds great.

286
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,332
We also need to get bossam.

287
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,262
(Gosh, my head hurts.)

288
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:13,861
Shall we call the owner? Excuse me, sir.

289
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,201
- Hello. - Hello.

290
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:16,831
- Are you the restaurant owner? - Hello.

291
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,002
Yes, I am.

292
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,541
We're a restaurant specializing in shabu shabu.

293
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,971
Porridge and noodles are served additionally. It's a course meal.

294
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,281
(A full shabu shabu course meal with kalguksu and porridge)

295
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:26,512
- That sounds good. - A course meal? That's great.

296
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,742
It's very cheap, too.

297
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,812
- It's 15 dollars. - It's only 15 dollars.

298
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:31,952
We're a budget-friendly restaurant.

299
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,751
Office workers line up to eat here.

300
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,952
That's why so many office workers come here.

301
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,822
Will you order this or not?

302
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,391
The blue crab stew...

303
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,691
The spicy chicken stew with blue crabs sounds amazing.

304
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:42,862
And deep-fried shrimp.

305
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:44,532
We need to get deep-fried shrimp.

306
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:45,902
Hey!

307
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:47,261
Deep-fried shrimp is a must.

308
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,371
You can't go wrong with fried food.

309
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:49,902
Our braised monkfish is...

310
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,371
- Braised monkfish sounds delicious. - popular.

311
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:53,401
Braised monkfish with blue crabs?

312
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,971
Then we'll get three orders of shabu shabu.

313
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,711
We have to order braised monkfish because he recommended it.

314
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:01,651
- Will you yield... - And deep-fried shrimp?

315
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,051
I'm not a ghost who died of starvation.

316
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:06,021
- You decided to yield. - Three Coke Zero, please.

317
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:07,951
- Sure. - That darn Coke Zero.

318
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:08,992
Coke Zero.

319
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:12,222
When these guys look at the menu, they lose all control.

320
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,361
- Everything looks good. - Once you see it, you can't resist.

321
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:15,961
There's no end to human desires.

322
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:16,991
That's right.

323
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:20,001
- Here's the shabu shabu broth. - Thank you.

324
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,472
It looks very neat.

325
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,402
Shall I pull it away?

326
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,341
Shall I pull it away?

327
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,202
(Sniffing right away)

328
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:28,441
(I want to smell it too.)

329
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,671
It smells like it's made with seafood.

330
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:30,741
(Constant sniffing by the blue team trio)

331
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:32,011
Gosh, is this made with seafood?

332
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,212
They aren't different from dogs.

333
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:36,711
- Look at them. - It's clearly made with shrimp.

334
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,921
- Right. - It's also made with blue crab.

335
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,021
(The blue team trio has a sense of smell as good as dogs.)

336
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,222
- It's made with kelp, too. - Tae Hyun.

337
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,621
- Let me be a wolf dog. - A wolf dog?

338
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:44,822
Yes, since I had been a fighter.

339
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,361
(The essence of shabu shabu, Korean sirloin arrives.)

340
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,532
- Here's Korean beef. - The portion is quite big.

341
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:56,371
(A combination of Korean beef and broth, shabu shabu)

342
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,171
- I'll do it for you. - I'm good at it.

343
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,271
- I'm good at it. - We'll do it.

344
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:01,041
What's this? Don't just add anything.

345
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,042
What's wrong?

346
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,071
You need to add solid vegetables first.

347
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,681
Keep the vegetables separate.

348
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,741
Don't put everything in all at once. Put it in separately.

349
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:09,111
I'm an expert.

350
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:10,511
- For the last ten years... - Based on my experience,

351
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,652
it's best to boil everything together.

352
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,121
Exactly.

353
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,821
You have to put in all the meat to make the meat broth.

354
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,491
Add a moderate amount of meat.

355
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,191
- Right. - It can be tough when overcooked.

356
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,191
- Really? - He wanted to put it all in.

357
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:22,331
I usually put in all of it.

358
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,231
Isn't it better to add hard vegetables first?

359
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,261
Yes, that's right.

360
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,101
Pumpkin, mung bean sprouts.

361
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:28,231
(The basis of shabu shabu, mung bean sprouts appear.)

362
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,431
Mung bean sprouts are crunchy when they're undercooked.

363
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,702
It'd have been better if it was added last.

364
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:34,941
- Next is cabbage? - Cabbage should be cut.

365
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,912
Cut it big enough to enjoy with the meat.

366
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,242
The cabbage should be eaten by tearing it up.

367
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:41,012
The bok choy should be cut vertically.

368
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,251
(They keep bossing them around due to hunger.)

369
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,651
You should cut it like this.

370
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:47,552
Who cuts bok choy like that?

371
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,352
(Gosh...)

372
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:50,752
(Cursing with his eyes)

373
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,962
- I do. - It's the same as putting all in.

374
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,861
This is the best way to enjoy it.

375
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,731
Since Dong Hyun isn't accustomed to working in a group...

376
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:57,792
I'm an expert at this.

377
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,331
- Why do you say that? - Group training is carried out...

378
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:03,001
- in an orderly and systematic way. - Right.

379
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,402
Being delicious is all that matters.

380
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,402
You're individualistic. "Being delicious is all that matters."

381
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:08,472
Shouldn't we add meat?

382
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,742
- Now? - The broth isn't boiling yet.

383
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,881
Why don't we add it after making the vegetable broth?

384
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,251
- Okay, I agree. - Is that okay with you?

385
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,782
- I'll yield. - "Yield?"

386
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,151
The fried tofu looks firm and bouncy.

387
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,351
(When the fried tofu gets firm as it gets cooked)

388
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,421
We should add meat now.

389
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:23,192
- Isn't it ready to eat? - We need to add meat now.

390
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,551
Should I add all of it in?

391
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:25,661
- Half of it. - Add all of it.

392
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,761
- Add all of it? - Let me see.

393
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:27,822
To make the broth.

394
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,861
Usually, I order more meat and add all of it in.

395
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:32,102
Me too.

396
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,931
- To make the broth. - Then the broth becomes rich.

397
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,531
- Okay. - It's Korean beef, so we can eat.

398
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,501
- Yes, it's ready to eat. - Is it because it's Korean beef?

399
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,101
Yes, eat it once it's parboiled.

400
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:40,102
Right now.

401
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,612
You can also eat it rare.

402
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:45,942
This is just...

403
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,582
Lower the heat.

404
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:54,652
It's so delicious.

405
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:59,621
If you'd like it spicy, please eat it with the chili sauce.

406
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:03,092
- The chili sauce is good. - If you don't like it spicy...

407
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,102
It's so good.

408
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,202
(Humming)

409
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:13,801
(Tae Hyun who has a small appetite)

410
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:17,211
(In love with crunchy vegetables)

411
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,281
Enoki mushrooms.

412
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,711
This is delicious.

413
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,082
Is it good because it's Korean beef?

414
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,912
I haven't tried the Korean beef yet.

415
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,581
The vegetables taste really good.

416
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:27,881
It's delicious.

417
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,321
- Whitewood ear mushroom. - Whitewood ear mushroom.

418
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:30,421
This is excellent.

419
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:31,892
It's so healthy.

420
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,822
That looks really tender.

421
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:42,432
(The three of them are in love with shabu shabu.)

422
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:46,242
(Clapping)

423
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,941
- This is disgraceful. - What?

424
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,441
Not being able to eat at a restaurant is disgraceful.

425
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:52,842
I've never done this before.

426
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,012
(He's about to lose it.)

427
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:57,712
Did the broth become flavorful?

428
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,351
Can you try some broth?

429
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,522
I'm curious about the broth.

430
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:02,852
Look at that.

431
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,491
(In awe)

432
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:07,662
It's very nice and clean.

433
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:12,162
The broth is...

434
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,161
(What about the broth?)

435
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,701
Like it's already seasoned, the broth is rich.

436
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:17,831
I bet it's flavorful.

437
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,472
(Groaning)

438
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,501
The steam keeps coming this way.

439
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,372
- The smell... - Just get Korean beef.

440
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,842
It would also be good without.

441
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,211
(He takes the ladle...)

442
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,321
(and scoops some broth quietly.)

443
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,951
- Tae Kyun, what are you removing? - You know...

444
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,951
- the impurities in the broth. - What's wrong?

445
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,861
I'm removing the impurities.

446
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,221
These aren't impurities.

447
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,531
These are impurities from the meat.

448
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,692
No, they aren't impurities.

449
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,301
They aren't impurities.

450
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,432
You need to remove them.

451
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,801
These are good for the health.

452
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:49,902
- Dong Hyun eats them separately. - Really?

453
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,001
This is healthy.

454
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,241
(Disappointed)

455
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,971
- Really? - This is healthy.

456
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,541
I wanted us to take a sip.

457
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,571
This is healthy.

458
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:57,912
Sometimes, I eat only this at the restaurant.

459
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,541
- I'm sorry. - You're so mean.

460
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,712
There can't be impurities from the food.

461
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,151
We can't even try the broth?

462
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:04,152
(We can't even try the broth?)

463
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,482
(Adding 1 more order of meat)

464
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:08,991
(They can't take their eyes off of it.)

465
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,991
Both of them are looking in the same direction.

466
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:12,321
(Rich Korean beef shabu shabu)

467
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:14,022
This is just...

468
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,491
Goodness, this is...

469
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,632
I need a close-up shot.

470
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:18,601
- Can you eat that? - Korean beef is...

471
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,632
very delicious.

472
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:20,932
I'll take more than before.

473
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,142
(Yum)

474
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:26,802
What's wrong?

475
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:31,341
I'm the only one suffering.

476
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:32,612
(I shouldn't have done it. I'm the only one suffering.)

477
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:35,951
I came on the show to eat a lot of good food.

478
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,012
(I came here to eat good food.)

479
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,621
Instead, they're torturing us.

480
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,982
(Do they torture people like this?)

481
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:41,321
Gosh, there it is.

482
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:42,621
(The side dish arrives at that time.)

483
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:43,691
Oh, my. Does it look...

484
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,921
- this amazing? - Here's your braised monkfish.

485
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,021
This is the best.

486
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,791
(Braised monkfish with a lot of blue crab and seafood)

487
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,892
- Here's your deep-fried shrimp. - Goodness.

488
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,231
These look great.

489
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,532
- I'll put them here. - Thank you.

490
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,232
Gosh, I'm so glad that we ordered it.

491
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:57,632
It looks amazing.

492
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,142
The braised monkfish looks delicious.

493
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:05,682
Look at the meat.

494
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,212
Look at the meat.

495
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:08,852
Look at the meat falling apart.

496
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,822
(Usually a picky eater, Tae Hyun loses control from the first meal.)

497
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:16,491
This is spicy.

498
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,421
(Spicy taste that's different from the shabu shabu)

499
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:22,132
- It's delicious. - It's spicy yet delicious.

500
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:24,462
The fish head tastes the best.

501
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:26,602
That's amazing.

502
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,232
Look at the meat.

503
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,572
- It's filled inside. - It whets the appetite.

504
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,841
- Seriously, it looks so good. - It must be delicious.

505
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,942
(I want a bite too.)

506
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,542
It looks even tastier because the coating isn't thick.

507
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:43,182
Eating first is definitely better.

508
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:44,952
I'm starving.

509
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:47,282
Aren't you hungry now that we're here?

510
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:49,651
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Really?

511
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,252
- The loser will get a head. - Okay.

512
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,822
The loser gets to eat.

513
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,462
- Sang Uk. - Yes?

514
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,662
We're both from Chungcheong Province.

515
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,432
- Shall we turn around and play? - Okay.

516
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:02,002
- The loser gets to eat. - Play it fair.

517
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,832
- The loser gets to eat. - Play it fair.

518
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:05,902
Ready or not...

519
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,141
(He cheats openly for the freeloader rock-paper-scissors.)

520
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:10,111
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

521
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:11,611
(Scissors? Then I'll play...)

522
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,482
(Then I'll play rock! Rock?)

523
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,552
- Tae Kyun. - Yes.

524
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:18,822
- Tae Kyun. - Yes.

525
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,282
I said that the loser gets to eat.

526
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:24,122
(Oh...)

527
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:26,561
(Tae Kyun gets a chance to freeload.)

528
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,462
(He doesn't know that Sang Uk cheated.)

529
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,561
- I mean... - The loser gets to eat?

530
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:31,591
I thought that he won on purpose.

531
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,731
- Why didn't you listen to him? - Thank you.

532
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,871
I told you three times that the loser gets to eat.

533
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,731
Who lets the loser eat?

534
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,071
(Who lets the loser eat?)

535
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:42,011
We told you that the loser gets to eat.

536
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,111
- This is... - Thank you for the food.

537
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:45,011
It tastes better than fried food that I had in Japan.

538
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,982
(A bite of crunchy deep-fried shrimp head)

539
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,012
There's no meat inside.

540
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,982
How could you?

541
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,422
- Goodness. - He only gave me the coating.

542
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,051
- He's right. - He only gave me the coating.

543
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,392
I knew it.

544
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,091
That explains why he gave it to me so willingly.

545
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,291
Goodness.

546
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,892
That's not nice.

547
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:04,191
This is still rare.

548
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,932
I can't eat even after winning?

549
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,772
(One Bite Kim gets a chance to freeload for the first time.)

550
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,242
Even that looks delicious.

551
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,112
(Impressed)

552
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,342
(Exclaiming)

553
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:22,482
- Is it good? - It's really good.

554
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,811
- My goodness. - Even the coating is amazing.

555
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,382
(Even the coating is amazing.)

556
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:27,921
(In pain)

557
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:28,951
The taste...

558
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:32,622
of the deep-fried shrimp lingers on the palate.

559
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,261
It's driving me crazy.

560
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,432
My stomach keeps begging for more food,

561
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,761
but no food is coming in.

562
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,001
Would you like to play for the tail this time?

563
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:41,102
(Another chance to freeload)

564
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:44,031
There's some meat on it. Right?

565
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,201
There's some meat on it.

566
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:46,641
- This is what's at stake. - It has some meat on it.

567
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:48,811
- This looks good. - Yes, it has some meat on it.

568
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,611
The honor of the athletic group depends on it.

569
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:52,041
You'll play memorize your time tables.

570
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,011
(Time tables battle with the athletic group's pride at stake)

571
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,111
Time tables?

572
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,612
Memorizing the time tables isn't easy.

573
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:57,881
Let's start.

574
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:59,281
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

575
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,752
(A time tables battle for the freeloaders)

576
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,552
- Eight times four. - Thirty...

577
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,692
Yes!

578
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,092
(Goodness, Sang Uk...)

579
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,392
(8 times 1 is 8, 8 times 2 is 16, 8 times 3 is...)

580
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,132
You didn't even take turns.

581
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,031
(Things aren't working out for Sang Uk today.)

582
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,872
The answer is 32.

583
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:18,841
I'm sorry, but...

584
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,802
(Two Bite Kim eats the tail after the head.)

585
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,012
He ate the whole tail.

586
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:26,812
The head and the tail taste different.

587
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:27,942
Do they?

588
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,981
It tastes different from the head.

589
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,752
(Gulping water repeatedly)

590
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:35,222
When do we eat the kalguksu?

591
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,321
- Can we add it in now? - One scoop?

592
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:38,352
(Right now)

593
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:40,962
It looks insanely good.

594
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,162
The noodles look very healthy.

595
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,192
He said that...

596
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,232
- it was made with chlorella. - Chlorella?

597
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,431
- This looks authentic. - It won't even make you burp.

598
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:49,531
The color looks nice.

599
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:50,632
(The color looks clearly healthy.)

600
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,302
My goodness.

601
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:55,712
Did you just curse?

602
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,242
I've never done this in front of food.

603
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:01,011
Goodness. The smell.

604
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,481
(Blowing)

605
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:03,482
Dong Hyun.

606
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,522
Is it because of the noodles?

607
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:07,022
They're very delicious.

608
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:09,752
They're completely different from noodles made with flour.

609
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:10,992
Chlorella?

610
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,122
Goodness.

611
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,162
It's so good.

612
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,461
Isn't it delicious?

613
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:19,732
Right?

614
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:22,401
We should take out the noodles fast. They're perfectly...

615
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,632
- Right? - al dente.

616
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:27,172
(While they enjoy the course meal of vegetables, meat, and kalguksu)

617
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,241
Why is the steam coming towards me?

618
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:30,242
(Why is the steam coming towards me?)

619
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,141
- Why is it coming towards us? - I know.

620
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,211
(They were losing their mind from hunger.)

621
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,941
I really need to try some.

622
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,081
Would you like a spoonful?

623
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:37,412
How about a spoonful?

624
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,181
Or get as much as you can with chopsticks.

625
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:41,521
- Why would I not? - Another game?

626
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:44,092
Since the time tables are hard to memorize,

627
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:45,721
- let's go with addition. - What do you mean?

628
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,261
- Addition? - "Let's add."

629
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,561
But that's way too easy.

630
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:50,991
- Let's add. - The game will last too long.

631
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,232
- The game won't end. - We'll play all night long.

632
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,462
Start.

633
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,101
- Let's add. - Let's add.

634
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:57,432
(Baseball team versus fencing team, Let's Add)

635
00:21:57,872 --> 00:21:58,872
Nine plus eight.

636
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,554
- Let's add. - Let's add.

637
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:01,895
(Baseball team versus fencing team, Let's Add)

638
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:03,424
Nine plus eight.

639
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,535
Eighteen.

640
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:08,635
Nine plus eight.

641
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:09,664
Eighteen.

642
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,575
(His unspoken feeling slips out.)

643
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,034
(Sang Uk is definitely showing off his skills today.)

644
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:16,404
This isn't rock-paper-scissors.

645
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,875
I meant 17.

646
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,545
I thought that you graduated from elementary school.

647
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:22,414
You became an athlete when you were in middle school.

648
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:23,514
During competition,

649
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:25,515
things don't go well when you're too desperate.

650
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,854
- Right. - You feel too much pressure.

651
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:28,355
How could you answer 18?

652
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:29,785
Do you want chopsticks or a spoon?

653
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:30,954
It's up to you, but you get to eat once.

654
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:32,124
- Use the spoon. - I'll use the ladle.

655
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,324
Go ahead.

656
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:35,594
First, I'd like some monkfish.

657
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,494
- Monkfish? - Monkfish and shabu shabu?

658
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:38,524
Please add some fish roe.

659
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,534
It doesn't matter. Once I eat it...

660
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:41,695
Do they separate automatically?

661
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:43,765
Two strands of mung bean sprouts.

662
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:45,804
He's a meat eater.

663
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,075
(Two pieces of meat)

664
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,874
(He made a tower of meat carefully.)

665
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,405
Once you wrap everything together...

666
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:52,775
Shall I eat it now?

667
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,215
Can you eat it in one go?

668
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:55,845
(Yes)

669
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,445
- His jaw made a sound. - Be careful.

670
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,284
He ate it all.

671
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,424
(Kim Tae Kyun of one bite)

672
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,255
- He ate it all. - I didn't know he could do it.

673
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,864
- Goodness. - He ate it all.

674
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:12,265
- He ate it so neatly. - There's more room in his mouth.

675
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:13,835
- Oh, my. - It's huge.

676
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:15,864
I can't believe that you ate this.

677
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,505
(I can't believe that you ate this.)

678
00:23:17,735 --> 00:23:19,835
The spicy shabu shabu tastes good.

679
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:21,435
Did I say 9 plus 8 is 18? Gosh.

680
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:24,005
Sir, could we get the bill?

681
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,114
(The 3 of them went wild from their 1st meal.)

682
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,374
How much is it?

683
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,375
It's 109 dollars.

684
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:30,615
- It's very cheap. - Isn't it a good price?

685
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,785
That's very cheap.

686
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,384
Did he exclude something?

687
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:34,385
- No. - It's very cost-effective.

688
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,125
For us, it's like paying ten dollars each.

689
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,025
Here's the quiz.

690
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:41,025
Today’s shabu-shabu originated...

691
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:46,194
in Osaka in the 1950s, created by Miyake Chuichi,

692
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:49,265
who was running a Western-style beef restaurant at the time.

693
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,264
"Miyake Chuichi?"

694
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,435
Miyaki-san.

695
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:54,974
The idea of shabu shabu came to him...

696
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,075
after seeing his employee...

697
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,215
do this with a bucket.

698
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:01,215
What did he do?

699
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:03,514
Do you know what "shabu" means?

700
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,014
- "Shabu." - Dong Hyun.

701
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,585
In Japan,

702
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:08,114
when they wash the dishes,

703
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,555
they say, "Shabu shabu."

704
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,685
You know the writing in comic books?

705
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,525
It says, "Shabu shabu."

706
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,294
"Shabu" means shaking.

707
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:18,225
- It probably means shaking. - "Shabu."

708
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,664
We shake the meat to eat it.

709
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:21,194
That's why it's called shabu shabu.

710
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,294
(An onomatopoeia to describe the shaking movement)

711
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,334
However,

712
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:25,035
- With the bucket. - inside the bucket...

713
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:28,005
Did he see someone wash vegetables by shaking them?

714
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,004
With the water pouring down.

715
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,145
This is hard.

716
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:33,745
Could it be something like this?

717
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:35,945
Maybe he was thawing...

718
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,645
frozen meat in a bucket.

719
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,485
The sight of pieces of meat coming off one at a time?

720
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,085
Isn't there "shabu" in fencing too?

721
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,255
- That's "sabre." - "Sabre."

722
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:46,754
It's "sabre."

723
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,755
- The same word exists in fencing. - Yes, sabre.

724
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:49,925
Shabu.

725
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,994
(Shabu)

726
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:53,835
Let's think about it fundamentally.

727
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,595
Like that in a bucket.

728
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:58,534
Maybe he saw someone washing vegetables and meat together...

729
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:01,775
in a bucket because he couldn't be bothered to do it separately.

730
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:05,814
"Won't it be delicious to cook them together?"

731
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:07,314
Yes, that sounds the most reasonable.

732
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:08,915
- While washing them together? - Yes.

733
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:10,714
- Let's go with washing. - Thawing is...

734
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,314
part of washing because it involves removing blood.

735
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:13,985
Aren't we going to eat?

736
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,185
- Could you please hurry? - Seriously.

737
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,424
- I mean... - Let's go with thawing and washing.

738
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:19,895
Okay, here's our answer.

739
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,355
After seeing his employee put...

740
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:27,394
vegetables and meat in one bucket of water,

741
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,634
he thought of shabu shabu.

742
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,405
He saw him washing them.

743
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,474
- Washing? - Yes,

744
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,575
thawing and washing.

745
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:35,034
From seeing him washing and thawing,

746
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,575
he came up with the idea of shabu shabu.

747
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,775
That's incorrect.

748
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:41,015
- What's the answer? - What is it?

749
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:42,345
The answer is...

750
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:45,515
after seeing his employee rinsing a wet towel.

751
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,384
This is too difficult.

752
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,525
- So that was it. - By the way...

753
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,424
- We were in the right direction. - Right.

754
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,524
Now we'll play an individual game.

755
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:53,954
- Individual game? - Keep watching us.

756
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:55,055
That will be so much fun.

757
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,465
I have a high chance of losing.

758
00:25:57,795 --> 00:26:00,064
One of the indispensable ingredients in shabu-shabu is...

759
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,994
- mushrooms. - Mushrooms?

760
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,834
Choose the mushroom that actually exists...

761
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,335
from the following options.

762
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:06,835
- One of them doesn't exist? - Okay.

763
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,505
Number one, lion's mane mushroom.

764
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:11,345
This is hard.

765
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:13,975
This is about guessing the correct answer.

766
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:15,985
Number two, hoof fungus.

767
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,245
Number three, giraffe neck mushroom.

768
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:19,784
- I bet it exists. - Me too.

769
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,314
- It exists. I've heard of it. - It sounds like it exists.

770
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,315
- I bet it exists. - I know this one.

771
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,454
Does anyone want to pick lion's mane mushroom?

772
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,325
- I bet it exists. - It sounds like it exists.

773
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,694
- Lion's mane mushroom must exist. - I agree.

774
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:30,895
I think they're named based on their shape.

775
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:32,734
I think I've heard of "hoof fungus."

776
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:33,735
Hoof fungus.

777
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,664
I'll follow the public opinion.

778
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:37,535
I pick number two, hoof fungus.

779
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:39,834
If lion mane's mushroom exists, I will win, right?

780
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:40,835
Yes.

781
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,105
"Giraffe neck?"

782
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,704
I have to go with that.

783
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:46,045
One of the mushrooms that exists is...

784
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,814
number two, hoof fungus.

785
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,714
- I'm saved. - Hoof fungus exists.

786
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,144
- I thought that it'd exist. - Hoof fungus exists.

787
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:52,344
It will be 1 of you 2.

788
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,415
- Since last week, you and I... - Goodness.

789
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:56,555
You played rock-paper-scissors well.

790
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,725
- Do you want to switch? - It's your last chance.

791
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:01,494
No, I've failed too many times after switching.

792
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,224
- You never know. - I've failed so many times.

793
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:05,065
- Take your last chance. - No.

794
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,264
- I won't switch. - Are you sure?

795
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,495
I won't switch.

796
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,234
I'll tell you which mushroom doesn't exist.

797
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:11,264
The mushroom that doesn't exist.

798
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,804
- It'll be the person who pays. - It'll be the person who pays.

799
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,704
- Who will pay? - Between these options,

800
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:16,274
which mushroom doesn't exist?

801
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,675
(3. Giraffe neck mushroom, 1. Lion's mane mushroom)

802
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,214
Giraffe neck mushroom.

803
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:21,974
(Dong Hyun is picked to pay the bill.)

804
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,644
(The giraffe neck mushroom is fake.)

805
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,714
- I told you to switch. - No way.

806
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:26,954
(Tae Hyun is exempt from paying.)

807
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,084
It's always me who has to pay.

808
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:29,984
I've seen lion mane's mushroom.

809
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,385
- This is deep-fried giraffe neck. - This is...

810
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:33,595
- I know. - This is deep-fried giraffe neck.

811
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,054
I need to look it up.

812
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,294
- If giraffe neck mushroom... - That's funny.

813
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:38,125
Giraffe neck mushroom might exist.

814
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:40,534
When I looked up "giraffe neck mushroom," a giraffe came up.

815
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,364
(A giraffe with a long neck came up.)

816
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:44,265
(Kim Dong Hyun, please pay the bill.)

817
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,034
Here you go.

818
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,874
(Total: 109 dollars)

819
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,204
When I should lose, I win. When I should win, I lose.

820
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:50,305
(Dong Hyun pays for the shabu shabu.)

821
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,674
This is sad. I'm feeling unlucky today.

822
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,844
(Dong Hyun's day starts off with sadness.)

823
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:55,845
Again from the start.

824
00:27:56,545 --> 00:28:00,115
(Soon, it's close to the end of lunch break.)

825
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,755
Will I finally get to eat?

826
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,794
Thankfully, I'm good at playing games.

827
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:09,094
- So I got to eat a little. - Right.

828
00:28:09,095 --> 00:28:11,325
- You're good at playing games. - You must be very hungry.

829
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,035
I'm starving.

830
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,995
There are many fun things on every alley.

831
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:16,405
A concrete jungle.

832
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,375
- It makes me dizzy. - It's a real concrete jungle.

833
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:24,374
(What is today's second LMR restaurant?)

834
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,415
- Where is it? - Gosh, I'm hungry.

835
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:28,214
- Are we there yet? - Is it what I think it is?

836
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:29,344
(A small restaurant hidden in the concrete jungle)

837
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:30,384
Is this the place?

838
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,685
What's with the blue ribbons?

839
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,985
- Goodness. - Blue Ribbons...

840
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:35,855
It received 14 blue ribbons.

841
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:37,754
- Gosh. - Is this the right place?

842
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,825
- It is. - This is the place.

843
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:40,194
Look at all these.

844
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,294
- That's insane. - The food has to be good here.

845
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,224
It even received one in 2014.

846
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,965
The fan is outside the restaurant.

847
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:48,135
It must be for people who are waiting.

848
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:49,835
People in the waiting line.

849
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,364
Once you write down your name, we'll call you.

850
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:56,575
(Busy office workers also have to wait.)

851
00:28:56,975 --> 00:29:01,344
(A place that gets packed during lunchtime every day)

852
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,845
More dried laver at Table Four.

853
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,385
(There's even a microphone for ordering.)

854
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:16,425
(Providing a hearty meal for office workers in Seolleung)

(LMR 2, sundae gukbap)

857
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,374
- Hello. - Hello.

858
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,005
(The restaurant owner comes to take their order.)

859
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,145
Are you running it...
- as the second generation? - Yes.

860
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:34,944
Did your mother start the business?

861
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,715
My parents started the restaurant.

862
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,144
It's been 30 years.

863
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,855
- At this place? - Yes, at this place.

864
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:42,724
(Sundae gukbap restaurant)

865

(Sharing 30 years with office workers in Seolleung)

866
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,525
(It became the oldest tasty restaurant in Samsung-dong.)

867
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:54,594
They started it in the 90s.

868
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,695
That's when I was in elementary school.

869
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:58,505
What should we order here?

870
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,504
(They scan the menu first.)

871
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:01,935
What's osorigamtu?

872
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:03,645
It's pig stomach.

873
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:05,174
- Is that called osorigamtu? - Yes.

874
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,215
I wonder why.

875
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,914
It was that part that was eaten quickly...

876
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:10,714
by those who slaughtered pigs in the past.

877
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:12,855
They took it out quickly.

878
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:14,755
First of all,

879
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,124
we should get a sundae combo.

880
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,024
- Yes, let's get one sundae combo. - We'll get that.

881
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,525
- Large size? - Of course.

882
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:21,624
- Large? - Yes.

883
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:22,825
It's only for two people.

884
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:24,965

Shall we get one large combo and gukbap?

00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,794
Can we get one gukbap each...

887
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,064
- and one large combo? - Large.

888
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:31,634
I'll bring one large combo and two gukbap.

889
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,375
- Okay. - I'm so hungry.

890
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,334
My mouth is watering.

891
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,444
- Excuse me. - The food is here.

892
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,875
The large combo looks amazing.

893
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:40,245
- That's a lot. - Goodness.

894
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,414
- Look how fatty it is. - Sundae is white.

895
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:43,415
Yes.

896
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:44,985
(Glossy and dazzling sundae combo)

897
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:49,955
(From chewy and firm sundae made from scratch)

898
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,895
(Moist and light head meat)

899
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:57,724
(Special cuts, pig's uterus...)

900
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:00,335
(and osorigamtu)

901
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:04,704
(A texture haven, sundae combo)

902
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,835
- We made this from scratch. - This is...

903
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:09,845
Look how bouncy it is every time it moves.

904
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:11,404
This is so elastic...

905
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,645
that it won't fall even if I flip it.

906
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:14,174
- Don't do it. - No.

907
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,484
Don't do it.

908
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:18,544
- I heard you. - Don't do it.

909
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,754
- That's not... - Even if I flip, it won't fall off.

910
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:20,884
We don't need to see it.

911
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:21,885
Stop it.

912
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:22,924
It's very elastic.

913
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:23,954
You're really strange.

914
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:25,224
It won't fall off even if you flip it.

915
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:27,325
Of course, it would fall off.

916
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:29,494
- My goodness. - Can I take a look?

917
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,725
(Stealing the sundae)

918
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,695
- Doesn't it look delicious? - It has no odor.

919
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,334
The smell increases my appetite.

920
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:38,034
- Did you get your appetite again? - Yes.

921
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,575
- He got his appetite back. - I got it.

922
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,604
Thank you for the food.

923
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,144
It's like Open, Sesame. The appetite keeps coming back.

924
00:31:43,145 --> 00:31:44,404
I controlled the amount.

925
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,704
I'll start with pig's uterus.

926
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,474
I'm curious about how it tastes.

927
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,174
(Sang Uk's first choice is pig's uterus.)

928
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,345
I can't believe that people eat pig's uterus.

929
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:52,315
It must be very chewy.

930
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,885
I've never seen it before.

931
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,815
It's really chewy.

932
00:31:56,885 --> 00:32:01,825
(Tae Kyun also starts with pig's uterus.)

933
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:04,094
- Good? - It looks delicious.

934
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:06,565
- Seriously, isn't it good? - The texture is insane.

935
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:07,995
It's crunchy.

936
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:09,065
- What? It is? - Yes.

937
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,034
How is it crunchy?

938
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,535
You have to chew it twice.

939
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,934
- Like crunch, crunch. - On both sides?

940
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,475
(Pig's uterus with a unique texture)

941
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:17,844
I'll make a wrap with it.

942
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:19,144
With some rice?

943
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,875
(Tae Kyun is making himself a wrap.)

944
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,185
What's that?

945
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:26,255
With some salted squid.

946
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:30,624
The way he makes his wrap is similar to mine.

947
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,424
(Tossing neatly into his mouth)

948
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:33,525
It must be good.

949
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:34,854
I should taste each of them.

950
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,665
(Hurry and make yourself a wrap.)

951
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:37,995
How is it, Tae Kyun?

952
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:39,795
It must be good.

953
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:43,004
It's very light.

954
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,505
Also, it doesn't have...

955
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:46,834
- any unpleasant pork smell. - It doesn't.

956
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:47,835
- Not at all? - No.
- Seriously. - Not at all?

957
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,075
It has no unpleasant smell at all.

958
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:51,574
It always smells at a sundae gukbap restaurant,

959
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:53,314
but it doesn't smell here at all.

960
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:54,915
(Light head meat without any unpleasant smell)

961
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,985
- This is amazing. - That's meat.

962
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,785
I'll make the wrap with this.

963
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,185
- With this? - I like doenjang.

964
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:03,254
(Salted shrimp is key.)

965
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:05,084
Does sundae have glass noodles inside?

966
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,224
It's glass noodles.

967
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,524
(Neatly eating all in one bite)

968
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,355
What do we call this? Usually, it's rough.

969
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,865
This isn't. The inside is filled...

970
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:13,335
This is hot. I'll put it in front of you.

971
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,335
- Be careful. - There's more.

972
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:16,404
(Korean fast food, sundae gukbap arrives.)

973
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:17,634
Season it with salted shrimp.

974
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,574
- Mix the sauce in before eating. - Thank you.

975
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:20,575
Okay.

976
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:26,774
(Firm and bouncy sundae...)

977
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:30,184
(and thick, savory broth)

978
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:32,645
(They make a fantastic harmony.)

979
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:34,985
(Cooked in a hot earthenware pot)

980
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:39,425
(Increased the volume with green onions and a sauce)

981
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:45,495
(The best cure for hangover, sundae gukbap)

982
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:49,835
Look at this. There's a lot in the gukbap.

983
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,364
- Solid ingredients. - You're right.

984
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,505
- It's packed. - There's a lot in it.

985
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,105
Gosh, it smells amazing.

986
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,714
It smells like very delicious sundaeguk.

987
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:02,045
- Right? - It must wrap the palate.

988
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,585
This is insane.

989
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,284
Look how packed it is. There's a lot of food in it.

990
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:09,215
You don't need to season it at all.

991
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,185
- I should've had this. - It's not bland either.

992
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,324
- It's slightly spicy. - It smells so good.

993
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:15,195
In my opinion, this represents the soul of Samsung-dong.

994
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:16,794
I should've chosen this.

995
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,394
(An exclamation rising from the core)

996
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:22,034
(Sang Uk is also completely satisfied.)

997
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:24,205
(Come on, radish kimchi.)

998
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:26,775
(Crunchy)

999
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:28,375
The radish kimchi is so good.

1000
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:30,905
It's the perfect radish kimchi for sundae gukbap.

1001
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,044
I should've eaten this.

1002
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,075
(It's driving the audience crazy.)

1003
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:38,115
This can be my grave.

1004
00:34:38,915 --> 00:34:40,184
My grave.

1005
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:41,954
- It's the ultimate hangover soup. - Exactly.

1006
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,125
Why didn't I choose this when I love sundae gukbap?

1007
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,324
You don't like sundae gukbap.

1008
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,325
It turns out that I'm a fan.

1009
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,324
- I just haven't had it lately. - What?

1010
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:51,495
I didn't realize how good it was,

1011
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,194
so I hadn't been eating it.

1012
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,594
I'm certain I'm a fan though.

1013
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,304
(Like a former loved one he once had to part ways with)

1014
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,265
I love spicy sundae gukbap.

1015
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,834
I usually don't eat this, but even this is incredible.

1016
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,044
- The sundae? - Yes.

1017
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,105
(Meanwhile, Sang Uk targets the sundae.)

1018
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,375
The filling is something else.

1019
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,745
- What's the usual filling? - It tastes completely different.

1020
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,515
How is it different?

1021
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:12,744
The texture...

1022
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:14,455
- is pretty much the same. - Right.

1023
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,725
But the flavors are completely different.

1024
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,325
- Tell us how! - This isn't your ordinary sundae.

1025
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,594
- You... - This isn't your ordinary sundae.

1026
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:22,855
Have you been hit by sundae before?

1027
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:24,995
- We know that it's different. - Like this?

1028
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,294
Normally, the sundae filling is dry,

1029
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,334
and it breaks down in your mouth.

1030
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:32,634
This filling stays intact.

1031
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:35,204
- The filling remains combined. - Yes, combined.

1032
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,774
(The premium sundae is chewy without being dry.)

1033
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:39,045
The meat's not fatty either.

1034
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,915
The meat...

1035
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,275
- Don't you... - isn't fatty or heavy.

1036
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,845
Ever have just one piece of meat?

1037
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,754
(Embarrassed)

1038
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,754
Don't you ever pick up just one piece of meat?

1039
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,285
That'll leave a lot of room left.

1040
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:51,954
- I prefer... - This is what I see...

1041
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:53,424
when I see you eat.

1042
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:55,054
Out comes clean chopsticks and spoons.

1043
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:57,265
It's like a penthouse within the Maebong Tunnel.

1044
00:35:58,395 --> 00:35:59,934
That's what I picture.

1045
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,835
It's like a penthouse within the Maebong Tunnel.

1046
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,205
He opens his mouth wide,

1047
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:05,234
- and that surprises me. - Only having a single piece...

1048
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:07,175
leaves too much room left in my mouth.

1049
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,534
I can't properly taste the flavors...

1050
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:09,704
- or enjoy the texture. - You were right.

1051
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,645
I bet sound will bounce off from inside your mouth.

1052
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:15,874
What's that?

1053
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,415
Why did you stack those?

1054
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,444
Is that sundae sushi?

1055
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:20,484
Is that a dolmen?

1056
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:21,784
- That's sundae and... - Is that sundae sushi?

1057
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:22,954
- Is that a dolmen? - Here we go.

1058
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:24,125
(They're seeing a lot of rare sights today.)

1059
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:27,854
This is how you can enjoy a variety of textures and flavors.

1060
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,594
Check out his sense of balance.

1061
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,794
He didn't drop anything.

1062
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:31,965
I can't believe he didn't drop anything.

1063
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,964
He's used to holding a bat and a ball.

1064
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,435
(Tae Kyun continues to showcase his stacking skills.)

1065
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,405
Isn't this how you want to enjoy it?

1066
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:42,504
(A work of art)

1067
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:43,844
He literally has a big mouth.

1068
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:45,774
You have great balance. How do you keep that steady?

1069
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,974
He makes sure everything is centered.

1070
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:49,114
That's a real skill, if you ask me.

1071
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:52,045
(That's nothing to be impressed by.)

1072
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:54,114
Would it be all right for us to answer a quiz?

1073
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,415
Wait, right now?

1074
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,855
Should we give them a chance to taste this?

1075
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,024
- What are we playing for? - Have them add numbers.

1076
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:02,094
You'll get the chance to eat whatever you want.

1077
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,165
- Just one piece? - Yes.

1078
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:04,664
- That one. - Sure.

1079
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:06,434
- Rock-paper-scissors? - We'll go around in a circle.

1080
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,295
- Yes, one at a time. - In this direction.

1081
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:10,634
- Do we add the numbers? - Just like that?

1082
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:13,104
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1083
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,934
- Six and seven. - That's 13.

1084
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:17,474
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1085
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:18,944
- Seven and six. - That's 13.

1086
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,344
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1087
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:22,814
- Eight and four. - That's 12.

1088
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:25,114
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1089
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,654
- Nine and nine. - That's 18.

1090
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:29,114
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1091
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,524
- Two and six. - Eight.

1092
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,854
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1093
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:34,325
- Six and seven. - Four...

1094
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,725
- Six and seven. - Four...

1095
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,465
(Dong Hyun's out.)

1096
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:41,934
(Devastated)

1097
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:43,364
(But I really wanted some.)

1098
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,004
The game will go on and on if it's just us.

1099
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:46,264
We'll play a different game.

1100
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,875
Multiply the numbers this time.

1101
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,774
- The times tables? - Are you good at that?

1102
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,605
Rather than multiplying, add the numbers.

1103
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:54,274
- That's what we just did. - We added the numbers just now.

1104
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,314
(Sorry about that... Were you adding the numbers?)

1105
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,915
What did you think we were doing just now?

1106
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,115
The times tables...

1107
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:00,214
- We added the numbers just now. - But you said "times tables."

1108
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,454
(That's odd. They said "times tables.")

1109
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:02,814
- Unbelievable. - You said "times tables."

1110
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:03,825
Is that so?

1111
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:05,425
I mean...

1112
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:07,754
That's the chant, but they had to add the numbers.

1113
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:08,755
I'm tipsy.

1114
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:11,225
(What's wrong with him?)

1115
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:12,695
What game should we play?

1116
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,134
Multiply, not add. Memorize the times tables.

1117
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:17,104
Adding the numbers is more difficult.

1118
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,405
That's just what we think.

1119
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:20,834
- No way. It's tougher. - It's true.

1120
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:22,605
I know I can ace the 31 game.

1121
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,005
- The 31 game? - Yes.

1122
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:25,904
Is there a secret to that game?

1123
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:27,414
- The 31 game? - You just call it as you see fit.

1124
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:29,215
There's a secret to it. I actually calculated the odds.

1125
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,144
- I think there's a secret to it. - Whoever says 31 loses.

1126
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,314
- Okay. - Right. Would you like to go first?

1127
00:38:33,315 --> 00:38:34,384
- One. - Two.

1128
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:35,554
- Three, four. - Five.

1129
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,124
- Six. - Seven.

1130
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,285
- Eight, nine. - Ten.

1131
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:40,324
- Eleven. - Twelve.

1132
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:42,024
- Then, 13. - I say, 14, 15, 16.

1133
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,265
- Seventeen. - Eighteen.

1134
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,625
- You won. - Nineteen.

1135
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,765
Then, 20, 21, 22.

1136
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:48,894
(I won?)

1137
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,105
- Yes, you won. - Then, 23.

1138
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:52,004
I say, 24, 25, 26.

1139
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:54,034
- You lost. - Wait. 26 is the losing number.

1140
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:55,734
I figured it out.

1141
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:57,505
Shall we continue? I said 26.

1142
00:38:58,905 --> 00:38:59,915
Then, 27.

1143
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:01,245
Then, 28, 29, 30.

1144
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:02,715
Thirty-one.

1145
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,084
- I figured it out. - What's the secret?

1146
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,344
- I got it. - Is there a secret to it?

1147
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,384
- Yes. - I just went with the flow.

1148
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,054
- There's a secret to it. - Do you know what it is?

1149
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,984
- Without a doubt. - Without a doubt?

1150
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,424
- Can you beat Yi Kyung? - I could crush him.

1151
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:13,524
- Go ahead, then. - Can you beat me?

1152
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,024
I'm great at mind games.

1153
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:17,724
Play for his chance to taste the food.

1154
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:18,764
- Will you agree to that? - Sure.

1155
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,135
I should get something too if I win.

1156
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:23,304
- It's over for you here. - You won't get to eat here.

1157
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,404
(If he loses, sundae will be off the table.)

1158
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,234
- You won't even get a chance. - Let me have the broth.

1159
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:27,235
No way.

1160
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:30,104
- The choice is yours. - Okay.

1161
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,805
You see,

1162
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:33,744
my thing as an athlete...

1163
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:34,745
was never losing...

1164
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,444
to the same opponent twice.

1165
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:37,544
(Cicada Kim was known for never losing to the same opponent twice.)

1166
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:40,155
- I'll win for sure. - Who should go first?

1167
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:41,585
- I'll go first. - Sure.

1168
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:44,324
- One, two. - Three, four.

1169
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,684
- Five, six. - Seven, eight.

1170
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:47,095
- Nine, ten. - Then, 11, 12.

1171
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,624
Wait, I lost. Hold on.

1172
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,894
- Okay, I got it. - Seriously?

1173
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:52,925
- Did you end at 12? - Yes, 12.

1174
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,535
Then, 14. No, 12.

1175
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:58,234
- I said 12. - Then, 13, 14.

1176
00:39:58,235 --> 00:39:59,634
- What was that? - I said 13, 14.

1177
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:01,075
- He won. - Then, 15.

1178
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:03,675
- I say 16, 17, 18. I won. - Then, 19.

1179
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:05,604
I'll go 20, 21, 22.

1180
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:06,615
Then, 23.

1181
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:08,774
I say 24, 25, 26.

1182
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:09,944
- I won. - Then, 27.

1183
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:12,344
I'll go 28, 29, 30. See? I won.

1184
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:14,214
(Yi Kyung lost.)

1185
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,754
It goes like this. Since you lose if you say 31,

1186
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:21,594
you'll win by saying 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.

1187
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,924
You'll win for sure. You have to say them all though.

1188
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:27,394
Did you figure this out yourself or look it up?

1189
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:31,104
I stayed up all night trying to figure it out.

1190
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:33,404
I get like that after I lose to someone.

1191
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:35,274
- That's true. - I won't lose a second time.

1192
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,305
Dong Hyun, go ahead.

1193
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,875
You should be rewarded for figuring that out.

1194
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:40,314
Dong Hyun, I strongly recommend...

1195
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:41,414
- this one. - Okay.

1196
00:40:41,415 --> 00:40:42,974
No, this one.

1197
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,414
Can't I have both?

1198
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:45,885
- Doesn't he only get one piece? - Just the one.

1199
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,255
This is like the head of a shrimp.

1200
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,055
- What's the best dip? - The salted shrimp.

1201
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:52,155
- Salted shrimp. - It's so good.

1202
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,455
(He dips it in the salted shrimp as recommended by Sang Uk.)

1203
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:56,194
- The salted shrimp. - How's the texture?

1204
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,264
- That's nice. - How is it?

1205
00:40:58,265 --> 00:41:00,494
- Don't you have to bite down hard? - That's right.

1206
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:01,694
Your teeth doesn't cut through it easily.

1207
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:03,094
- What kind of texture is that? - It's good.

1208
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:05,105
- It's fascinating. - How is it like a drill?

1209
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:06,834
It's really fascinating.

1210
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:08,834
- That's so good. - You pause more than three times.

1211
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,844
It's like having layers of something.

1212
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,844
The liver that's served with sundae. You know how that tastes.

1213
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:15,845
You can taste that too.

1214
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:18,414
- There's a variety of flavors. - Exactly.

1215
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:19,685
It's like cutting through layers.

1216
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:21,085
You stacked them into a pile again.

1217
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:27,894
(His passion for art hasn't faded.)

1218
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:28,925
Next...

1219
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,095
That's the biggest perilla leaf.

1220
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:32,925
I bet he'll add them all.

1221
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,034
(Masterclass, Starting with the foundation)

1222
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:35,935
All right. The meat.

1223
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:37,664
Have you studied construction?

1224
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,604
(Have you studied construction?)

1225
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:41,174
The foundation is solid.

1226
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,445
- The squid goes in the middle. - That will be a healthy wrap.

1227
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:45,944
Isn't this a packed meal all on its own?

1228
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:47,875
Lastly, I'll top it off with another piece of meat.

1229
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,214
(Completing the perfect packed meal)

1230
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,545
Then, the salted shrimp.

1231
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:52,185
I'll add some shrimps.

1232
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,584
Is that the shrimp?

1233
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,255
It must also look good. Do you see the shrimp?

1234
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:58,585
(Here I go.)

1235
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:01,554
To the penthouse.

1236
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:05,095
(Tae Kyun, you can really eat it all.)

1237
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:07,135
- There's room left. - I know.

1238
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:10,434
If you chew on the food when your mouth is full of it,

1239
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:11,835
- How can you talk right away? - the food...

1240
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:14,774
(How is that possible?)

1241
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,245
The aroma of the food travels to your nose.

1242
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:20,975
That's when the food gets more interesting.

1243
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,484
I'll do what he just did. Like this?

1244
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:25,114
(Sang Uk also adds some meat.)

1245
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:26,755
- How... - Tae Kyun, this is huge.

1246
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:28,485
- Tell me about it. - I have a small mouth.

1247
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,624
- No way. - I don't think I can eat this.

1248
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,754
(The one-wrap challenge tackled by small-mouthed Sang Uk.)

1249
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:34,554
(Here he goes!)

1250
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:35,624
(The best that he can)

1251
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,624
(Pushing and folding)

1252
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,025
- Goodness. - His mouth is like a baby's.

1253
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,295
It needs more training.

1254
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:45,135
There's a certain elegance...

1255
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:47,234
to the way they eat. Tae Kyun eats a lot,

1256
00:42:47,235 --> 00:42:48,775
and he became a legend in his field.

1257
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:51,145
Sang Uk still competes and is the best player in his field.

1258
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:53,005
And then,

1259
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:56,785
you both use that energy to be the best at your game.

1260
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:59,284
- It'll be around 100 dollars. - We're a table of 2...

1261
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,954
- but ordered... - No way.

1262
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:04,554
You two ate a number of dishes today,

1263
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:05,784
but the total is 96 dollars.

1264
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:06,824
(Sundae gukbap, Sundae combo, soju, and beer)

1265
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,225
- That's great. - Well, this...

1266
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,925
Here's the quiz to see who'll pay for the meal.

1267
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:17,164
"Osorigamtu" was one of the parts that you just ate.

1268
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:18,765
I asked about that earlier.

1269
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:20,834
That's the stomach of a pig.

1270
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,105
- That's right. - What?

1271
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,574
"Osorigamtu" is the name...

1272
00:43:24,575 --> 00:43:28,415
of a military title from the Joseon period.

1273
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:30,314
- Osori? - So,

1274
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:32,414
how did the stomach of a pig...

1275
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:34,755
get to be called "osorigamtu?"

1276
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:39,984
(Before ordering the food, )

1277
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,995
(Dong Hyun asked what osorigamtu was.)

1278
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:44,995
It's a good thing I didn't ask about it in detail.

1279
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,765
- I wonder why. - A "mugwa."

1280
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:50,094
- You know radish. - Right.

1281
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:52,534
Mugwa means the type of radish.

1282
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:54,034
Oh, I see. Radish.

1283
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:55,775
No, mungwa.

1284
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:57,505
Mungwa.

1285
00:43:57,506 --> 00:43:59,675
- Science or liberal arts. - Scholars or military personnel.

1286
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,075
- Mugwa. - There's mugwa and mungwa.

1287
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:05,284
Osorigamtu was a title...

1288
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:07,814
given to those holding military positions.

1289
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:11,785
Many people had to gather to catch a pig.

1290
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,324
Someone strong...

1291
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:18,664
and skilled in fighting...

1292
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:21,964
got the chance to eat the stomach first.

1293
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:24,365
It was that priceless. That's why it was given the name.

1294
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:25,864
- Go for it. - Only someone strong...

1295
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:26,975
could have that part.

1296
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,635
- Go for it. - It makes sense.

1297
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,805
Sang Uk, tell me what you think.

1298
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:34,075
What is your answer?

1299
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,544
Osori is also a badger, a type of animal.

1300
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:39,214
Is the pig's stomach similar to the badger's?

1301
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,654
(Pig's stomach and badger's stomach)

1302
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:42,655
A badger with an important title.

1303
00:44:43,315 --> 00:44:45,224
Osori is a type...

1304
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,194
- of an animal, right? - It's like a ferret.

1305
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:50,154
Since they mentioned the military title,

1306
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,725
it probably has nothing to do with the animal.

1307
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:53,695
Is the stomach the heaviest organ of a pig?

1308
00:44:54,035 --> 00:44:55,135
Is that why the strongest person got to have it?

1309
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:58,405
The stomach was the heaviest organ...

1310
00:44:58,535 --> 00:45:00,574
- of a pig, - Okay.

1311
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:05,105
And the most important title was the military title.

1312
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:07,614
That was why it was called osorigamtu.

1313
00:45:07,615 --> 00:45:08,674
- I'll go with that. - Okay. Go for it.

1314
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:09,944
- It sounds plausible, right? - Okay. Yes.

1315
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:11,685
- Good. It was the most important. - Okay.

1316
00:45:12,415 --> 00:45:13,954
(Answering the quiz)

1317
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:15,654
- Pigs eat a lot. - Yes.

1318
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:18,255
- So their stomach is so important. - Okay.

1319
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,524
Is that correct?

1320
00:45:19,525 --> 00:45:20,824
(Was it a question, not an answer?)

1321
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:22,224
- That's new. - The stomach is so important.

1322
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:24,564
The stomach is the most important organ for a human too.

1323
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:25,695
- It's the most essential organ. - Right.

1324
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:28,164
The stomach is the most important organ of a pig.

1325
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:29,964
As for a military title,

1326
00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:31,834
while many people can write and all,

1327
00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:32,904
the military title...

1328
00:45:32,905 --> 00:45:34,404
- was the most important one. - Yes. Because they fought.

1329
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:35,835
That was why...

1330
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:38,475
it was called osorigamtu.

1331
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:41,144
Of all government positions, the most important one...

1332
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:42,974
- was the military title. - Yes.

1333
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:45,544
It was called osorigamtu...

1334
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:49,854
because the stomach was the most important organ of a pig.

1335
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:51,325
That was exactly what I meant.

1336
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:53,585
The reason you just said...

1337
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:56,555
I think I got it.

1338
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:58,024
It's...

1339
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,165
- incorrect. - Gosh.

1340
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,635
(Disappointed)

1341
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:03,964
What is the answer? I was correct, right?

1342
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:06,804
It was because they fought for the osorigamtu...

1343
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:11,344
just like how they fought to have the hat made of badger skin.

1344
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:12,774
- Is it a 1-on-1 match now? - That was hard.

1345
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:14,215
- Okay. Let's do it. - Okay.

1346
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:17,914
- It'll be an easier one. - An easier one.

1347
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:21,185
Each region of Korea is famous for different types of sundae.

1348
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:24,684
Of different types of sundae, the Byeongcheon sundae...

1349
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,424
was first created when the factories to make this was built...

1350
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:28,155
in Byeongcheon in the 1960s.

1351
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:32,064
They started making sundae by filling the pigs' intestines...

1352
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:35,534
that was left with vegetables and clotted pig's blood.

1353
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:38,304
Which product did these factories make?

1354
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:39,505
- Is this easy? - Yes.

1355
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:41,035
- I got it. - Okay.

1356
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:42,135
Sausages.

1357
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:45,045
- Sausages. - He's smart when it comes to food.

1358
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,275
Sausages.

1359
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,575
You must be close.

1360
00:46:48,415 --> 00:46:49,715
- Incorrect. - I got it.

1361
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,315
(I'm in trouble.)

1362
00:46:51,515 --> 00:46:53,755
(If it wasn't sausages, it has to be...)

1363
00:46:54,085 --> 00:46:56,155
Fishcake sticks.

1364
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:57,554
- Fishcake sticks? - Fishcake sticks?

1365
00:46:57,555 --> 00:46:59,425
(Come on. It can't be fishcake sticks.)

1366
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,255
- Franks. - Franks?

1367
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,295
- Incorrect. - I got it. Ham!

1368
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,794
Correct.

1369
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:06,024
(Ham)

1370
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:07,195
- He's good. - Gosh.

1371
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:08,734
You opted for the fishcake sticks.

1372
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:09,994
(He hit a walk-off home run.)

1373
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,204
How could it be fishcake sticks after sausages?

1374
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,264
I thought I had no chance.

1375
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,175
I thought I was in trouble when sausage wasn't the answer.

1376
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:17,044
When he said the fishcake sticks,

1377
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:18,875
I was like, "Yes!"

1378
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,204
What comes after sausages is ham.

1379
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,344
He never misses it.

1380
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:23,785
I think this show is very helpful.

1381
00:47:24,715 --> 00:47:26,344
- It's so helpful. - Eating is not all we do.

1382
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:27,514
You're right.

1383
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,154
Gosh. I got to learn all these.

1384
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:30,654
- Thanks for the food, Sang Uk. - Thank you.

1385
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:32,324
- It was good. - Thanks for the food.

1386
00:47:32,325 --> 00:47:34,424
(Sang Uk pays for the lunch.)

1387
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:36,895
- It's such a cost-effective meal. - Thank you.

1388
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:41,195
(Total: 96 dollars)

1389
00:47:41,465 --> 00:47:42,694
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1390
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:45,634
(It was a good meal.)

1391
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:47,174
(Lunch recommendations in Seolleung)

1392
00:47:47,175 --> 00:47:48,604
(Shabu shabu: Add extra meat and vegetables.)

1393
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:49,974
(It's super rich. It digests well, so it's perfect for lunch.)

1394

(Sundae gukbap: You should stack up sundae into a tower.)

1395
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:52,875

1396
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:54,244
(The sun is setting before they know it.)

1397
00:47:54,245 --> 00:47:55,844
In fact, it's 7pm,

1398
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:57,915
which is time for dinner.

1399
00:47:58,915 --> 00:48:00,484
There is a flood of workers going home.

1400
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:02,714
(In the evening, it's crowded with people who got out of work.)

1401
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:05,124
- Exactly. - It's time to eat dinner.

1402
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:09,725
(At Seolleung, many workers enjoy dinner after work.)

1403
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,864
(What are the members' dinner menus?)

1404
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:16,234
Last week, we went of 1 of Seoul's 3 best chicken places.

1405
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,004
- I see. - Seoul's top three chicken places.

1406
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:20,364
There's a tuna place which is 1 of the top 3.

1407
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:22,174
- Tuna? - Tuna sounds good.

1408
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:23,704
I love tuna.

1409
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:27,005
At this place, we can taste the tuna from Malta,

1410
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:31,285
the vacation spot in the Mediterranean.

1411
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:34,185
- That sounds precious. - It's not an ordinary place.

1412
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:36,215
(Nice.)

1413
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,455
- From Malta? - From Malta.

1414
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,825
Does the tuna drink malt beer there?

1415
00:48:42,095 --> 00:48:44,824
(Let's quickly move on to the next menu recommendation.)

1416
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:46,594
In this neighborhood...

1417
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:47,834
Idong ribs?

1418
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:50,134
- There's a place famous for it. - I see.

1419
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,205
I heard it was very cost-effective.

1420
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:54,735
- That's great. - They've reduced the retail margin.

1421
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:55,904
(By reducing the retail margin, )

1422
00:48:55,905 --> 00:49:00,175
(this Idong ribs have become famous for its cost-effectiveness.)

1423
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:03,044
Then the dinner menus in Seolleung...

1424
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:05,844
are the cost-effective Idong ribs and tuna.

1425
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:07,085
Which one do you want?

1426
00:49:07,815 --> 00:49:09,355
Both of them sound delicious.

1427
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:12,254
- As I contend for victory today, - Okay.

1428
00:49:12,255 --> 00:49:13,784
I'll follow these two's choice.

1429
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,825
- Really? Will you let them choose? - Yes.

1430
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:18,194
Which victory do you contend for?

1431
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:19,695
For food or for the quiz?

1432
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,735
It can't be the quiz.

1433
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,334
- Which one? - It's the food.

1434
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,405
It's the quiz, of course.

1435
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:26,504
(Look at him!)

1436
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,074
(Dumbfounded)

1437
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:30,074
You've become a hilarious person.

1438
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:31,744
- We'll match over the quiz. - I was curious...

1439
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:33,844
about which victory you were talking.

1440
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,744
(Interesting)

1441
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:37,184
Make your choices now.

1442
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:38,645
Where do you want? I'm fine with both.

1443
00:49:38,915 --> 00:49:39,984
I'll choose the meat, then.

1444
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:41,214
(It's the meat, then.)

1445
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,914
I'll choose Idong whelk. I mean Idong ribs.

1446
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:44,654
- "Idong whelk." - "Idong whelk."

1447
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:46,185
What is Idong whelk?

1448
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:48,254
- I'll win today. - "Idong whelk."

1449
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,194
I want the meat too.

1450
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,325
- The ribs? - The Idong ribs.

1451
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:53,194
I'll follow them to the battleground.

1452
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:54,864
(The athletic group finally joins the meat battle.)

1453
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:56,564
- What about you? - We'll go for the tuna.

1454
00:49:56,565 --> 00:49:59,064
We'll enjoy the essence of tuna in Seolleung.

1455
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,105
I'll show you how tuna can be cost-effective.

1456
00:50:01,635 --> 00:50:04,044
(Super excited)

1457
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:06,005
For the dinner menu recommendations in Seolleung,

1458
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:07,744
these three will have Idong ribs.

1459
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:10,274
Tae Kyun, Dong Hyun, and Sang Uk.

1460
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:11,414
For tuna,

1461
00:50:11,415 --> 00:50:14,214
- Tae Hyun and I will have it. - Okay.

1462
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,354
Which one do we have first?

1463
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,584
That was really tough.

1464
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,184
For dinner, we'll go to the tuna place first.

1465
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,695
(For dinner, we'll go to the tuna place first.)

1466
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:22,024
The tuna place?

1467
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:23,155
(Tuna first?)

1468
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:24,494
- Don't worry. - It's an appetizer.

1469
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:25,925
We'll finish it within one hour.

1470
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:27,834
- Sounds good. - Good.

1471
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:29,835
- They're smart. - Tell them to get the coals ready.

1472
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:32,264
- Already? - Tell the Idong ribs place.

1473
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,034
Let's go and have the tuna first.

1474
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:35,404
- Okay. - Good.

1475
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,035
(Let's go to have tuna, DMR1)

1476
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,305
It has become dark in Seolleung.

1477
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:40,474
It feels great.

1478
00:50:40,475 --> 00:50:41,774
The sun has set already?

1479
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,414
As you can see, people have left work.

1480
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,184
The restaurants must be crowded...

1481
00:50:45,185 --> 00:50:47,115
with the people enjoying a drink after work.

1482
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,985
Right. They are coming out to the streets now.

1483
00:50:50,155 --> 00:50:51,485
Look how crowded it is.

1484
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,725
They share their complaints and relieve stress like that.

1485
00:50:54,795 --> 00:50:56,555
This is such a trendy place.

1486
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:59,624
- It's very energetic. - Where is this?

1487
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,065
- I'm a bit excited. - Right. I'm excited too.

1488
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:03,435
The tuna place is... What?

1489
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:04,905
- Where is it? - It's here.

1490
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:07,004
Gosh. Is the name of the place the island?

1491
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:08,405
It's a unique name.

1492
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,974
- It's here. - It's located at an unusual spot.

1493
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:13,504
(They enter the tuna place with the name that excites them.)

1494
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:15,045
(M Tuna)

1495
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:20,314
- Welcome. - Hello.

1496
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:21,815
(As soon as they enter, )

1497
00:51:22,555 --> 00:51:26,285
(they see the luxurious decor that suits Seolleung.)

1498
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:29,794
(The tuna in an amazing color...)

1499
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,225
(grabs their attention.)

1500
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:39,235
(You can enjoy various dishes using tuna here.)

1501
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,605
I've come to the best tuna place in Korea.

1502
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:45,945
(Lawyer Han Moon Chul chose this place as a great restaurant.)

1503
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:49,545
(DMR 1: Tuna)

1504
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:52,244
- Why is it so big in here? - Gosh. Hello.

1505
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:53,984
(Surprised)

1506
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,655
It's not a place you can visit every day.

1507
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:57,924
It's a proper and fancy raw fish restaurant.

1508
00:51:57,925 --> 00:52:00,355
- The vibe is a bit... - At a place like this...

1509
00:52:01,225 --> 00:52:02,995
This place is so fancy.

1510
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:05,765
I shouldn't have said it could be cost-effective.

1511
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,534
I'm so surprised. Actually,

1512
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:09,495
I've never been to a tuna restaurant before.

1513
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:11,264
Tuna lovers go to the restaurants...

1514
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:12,764
- specialized in tuna. - They do.

1515
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:16,035
But to go to a place that specializes in tuna,

1516
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:18,044
after having a piece or two,

1517
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,705
- don't you get sick of it? - A piece or two?

1518
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,544
- Tae Hyun. - Gosh.

1519
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:23,045
- A piece or 2? - A piece or 2?

1520
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:25,614
You can enjoy it in various ways.

1521
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,414
- You can wrap it with dried laver. - Yes.

1522
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:30,054
- It's amazing. - You can have it with wasabi.

1523
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:31,124
- There are radish sprouts too. - I...

1524
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,884
- Yes, the radish sprouts. - will have it just piece by piece.

1525
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:34,154
There's a hand roll too.

1526
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:35,625
- It's rolled with the dried laver. - Right.

1527
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:39,495
(I see.)

1528
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:41,164
The owner is here.

1529
00:52:41,165 --> 00:52:42,734
- Hello. - Hello.

1530
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:44,505
(It's time to order now that they've learned about variations.)

1531
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:46,804
- Hello. - He's the head.

1532
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,775
- Nice to meet you. - It's Mr. Park.

1533
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:51,374
(He opens the menu board right away.)

1534
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,674
- It's market price. - How...

1535
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:54,145
We don't know what to order.

1536
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:56,275
(Fitting for the fancy atmosphere, )

1537
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,614
(the prices are very high.)

1538
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:00,644
- How many people is it for? - For one person.

1539
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,014
- Is it this price per person? - Yes.

1540
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,914
Dong Hyun, if we had it, we'd be dead.

1541
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:04,984
(The jaw-dropping prices)

1542
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,684
Look at the prices.

1543
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:08,795
- We only use one type of tuna. - Yes.

1544
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,325
We use tuna that is from 300kg to 400kg.

1545
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:13,194
It's as big as a bull.

1546
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:14,394
(They only use huge tuna between 300kg and 400kg from Malta.)

1547
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:16,195
We serve all sorts of parts just like beef.

1548
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:19,334
Such tuna is very expensive, right?

1549
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:21,305
- It's around 12,000 dollars. - Right.

1550
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:22,875
They auction it.

1551
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:24,075
That's crazy.

1552
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:26,604
What should we order for the two of us?

1553
00:53:26,605 --> 00:53:28,744
- Course Jin will do. - Course Jin?

1554
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:29,814
Okay. We'll order two servings of the Course Jin.

1555
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:31,984
- Two Course Jin. - Okay.

1556
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:34,214
- Okay. I'll prepare for it. - Thank you.

1557
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:35,385
Thank you.

1558
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:36,615
I'm curious.

1559
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:38,884
Handsome Guys...

1560
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:41,324
must be well off to come to a fancy place like this.

1561
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:42,924
- What? We pay for it. - We pay for it.

1562
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:44,124
We're the ones paying for it.

1563
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,524
Tae Kyun, we pay for it.

1564
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:48,164
That means you're well off too.

1565
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:49,865
That's why I study all night.

1566
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:51,364
- It's to win. - I see.

1567
00:53:51,365 --> 00:53:52,904
By the way, didn't you study history?

1568
00:53:52,905 --> 00:53:54,064
- He knows history well. - For the Korean history...

1569
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,934
I got the certificate too.

1570
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:57,034
Then we shouldn't have a quiz...

1571
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:58,144
- on history. - Why not?

1572
00:53:58,145 --> 00:53:59,774
We had quizzes on history before,

1573
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:01,514
- but it was all right. - Was it?

1574
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:03,015
Was it all right?

1575
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:05,515
That's why I got a level 5 certificate, not level 1.

1576
00:54:06,015 --> 00:54:07,655
- It doesn't matter at all. - I'm confident, then.

1577
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:10,185
- Hello. - It's here.

1578
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,155
Gosh. It's so pretty.

1579
00:54:12,685 --> 00:54:14,254
(It's surely amazing.)

1580
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:15,425
- Gosh. - What is that?

1581
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:17,625
- Look at the color. Amazing. - Its color is...

1582
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:20,164
- This is the tuna belly. - The upper belly.

1583
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,665
This is the back part.

1584
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:23,565
This is the tuna belly.

1585
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:26,364
This is the tuna shoulder.

1586
00:54:26,365 --> 00:54:28,504
- This is the head. - The head.

1587
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:29,805
This is wild halibut.

1588
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:33,775
(The first course is filled with premium tuna parts.)

1589
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:35,615
What is the most premium part?

1590
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:37,745
The tuna shoulder is the most premium.

1591
00:54:38,115 --> 00:54:39,144
- The shoulder. - The shoulder.

1592
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:40,485
Do they have shoulders, though?

1593
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:43,254
The fish swim like this.

1594
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:45,085
- The gills. - Yes. The gills.

1595
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:46,424
We can only get 1kg of this out of 200kg of meat.

1596
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:49,055
(It's a precious part where only 1kg is collected from a 200kg tuna.)

1597
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,095
Which order should we eat this?

1598
00:54:51,265 --> 00:54:52,824
You can enjoy it however you like it as it's so fresh and good.

1599
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,495
You can dip it in any sauce too.

1600
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,494
But there's a way to enjoy it even more.

1601
00:54:56,495 --> 00:54:57,504
How?

1602
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:58,634
Grab a marbled piece.

1603
00:54:58,635 --> 00:54:59,764
- A fatty one. - This?

1604
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:00,805
- Yes, that one. - Yes.

1605
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:03,035
Always put fresh wasabi on the fish.

1606
00:55:03,535 --> 00:55:05,704
This is garlic that smells less.

1607
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,614
- This is green tea salt. - That's it.

1608
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:08,714
- Why do they have it? - The green tea salt.

1609
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:10,244
- As for the garlic... - Dip it in the salt.

1610
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:11,944
(Amazed)

1611
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,314
Have as is like ribeye.

1612
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:14,584
(Fold it and it's ready to eat.)

1613
00:55:14,585 --> 00:55:16,115
Have it as is without the soy sauce.

1614
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:17,884
- Eat it now? - Yes.

1615
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,925
The salt has a nicer finish the more you chew.

1616
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,755
- Gosh. That must be so good. - It looks so tasty.

1617
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,054
We use such good ingredients,

1618
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:25,525
so they taste good with any sauce.

1619
00:55:28,335 --> 00:55:31,665
(Tae Hyun takes a bite after him.)

1620
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,805
It tastes so different thanks to the chef.

1621
00:55:38,175 --> 00:55:39,245
If we had it without his explanation...

1622
00:55:39,405 --> 00:55:41,614
The garlic with the salt...

1623
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:43,314
- changes everything. - It reduces the greasiness.

1624
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:46,115
- It's such an amazing tip. - It must be.

1625
00:55:46,185 --> 00:55:47,985
It's not the taste of fish I expected.

1626
00:55:49,285 --> 00:55:51,625
- I'm so jealous. - It looks so tasty.

1627
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,654
Let's move on to the second method. Place the white kimchi.

1628
00:55:53,655 --> 00:55:55,255
- The white kimchi. - The white kimchi.

1629
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:56,855
Here's the tuna head.

1630
00:55:57,055 --> 00:55:58,064
- The tuna head. - Yes.

1631
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,795
Dip it in the sesame oil and place it on the white kimchi.

1632
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:02,065
Dip it in the sesame oil and place it on the white kimchi.

1633
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:03,395
Add some wasabi too.

1634
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,435
(Wasabi)

1635
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:06,064
(Fixated)

1636
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:07,264
- Try it. - Like this?

1637
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:08,305
Yes.

1638
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:10,435
Gosh. It looks so pretty.

1639
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:15,745
- That must be tasty. - Nice.

1640
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:21,384
That looks so good. We have to remember the combination.

1641
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:22,854
I'm telling you the methods...

1642
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:24,324
because it changes the flavor every time you have it.

1643
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:26,184
That's true. It's completely different.

1644
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:27,355
- Right? - The one...

1645
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:28,994
I had with garlic...

1646
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,924
and this one with white kimchi taste so different.

1647
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:33,065
The fattier part...

1648
00:56:33,195 --> 00:56:34,795
(Gulping)

1649
00:56:35,065 --> 00:56:36,235
Can I have this?

1650
00:56:36,795 --> 00:56:37,804
(Cabbage)

1651
00:56:37,805 --> 00:56:38,805
It's lettuce.

1652
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:40,204
I want to imagine as if I was having tuna.

1653
00:56:40,205 --> 00:56:41,934
I want to put it in my mouth with you.

1654
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:43,674
You can have a piece of cabbage.

1655
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:45,004
I'll take a piece of cabbage.

1656
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:46,304
- That's good. - We can have it like this.

1657
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:47,974
- Let's have it together. - It's an imaginary food.

1658
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:49,174
- Let's do it. - Look at us while eating it.

1659
00:56:49,175 --> 00:56:50,614
- Look at us while eating yours. - Wait.

1660
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,645
Okay.

1661
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:57,755
(Cabbage, tuna)

1662
00:56:57,955 --> 00:56:59,825
- Gosh. It's great. - Is this how it tastes?

1663
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,425
- It's so tender. - How can it be so crunchy?

1664
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:05,125
- It's crazy. - It's amazingly sweet.

1665
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:06,765
This one also tastes different.

1666
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,334
- For this one... - Dip it in the sesame oil sauce.

1667
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:09,894
- The tuna belly. - The sesame oil sauce.

1668
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:11,764
Do I add wasabi to it too?

1669
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,635
Yes. It's better to put wasabi all the time.

1670
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:15,275
It looks so pretty.

1671
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:17,805
- It's premium. - Right?

1672
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:19,344
It looks like a fan.

1673
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,645
(He enjoys the tuna belly's flavor right away.)

1674
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:30,555
That's my favorite tuna part.

1675
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:32,555
- What is this? - Gosh.

1676
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:34,754
- There's cartilage. - It's collagen.

1677
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:35,755
- What? - It's good, right?

1678
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,324
(The tuna belly is filled with collagen.)

1679
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:38,524
Gosh. This is...

1680
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,965
I thought tuna was too greasy.

1681
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:42,795
But it doesn't feel greasy at all.

1682
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:44,165
It tastes so good.

1683
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:46,834
(Drooling)

1684
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:48,434
I'll get going after showing you one thing.

1685
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,505
- Okay. - Yes.

1686
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,904
The wild halibut goes well with the marinated crab.

1687
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:52,944
Add the crab meat.

1688
00:57:52,945 --> 00:57:53,974
- Good gracious. - My goodness.

1689
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,145
(Place the marinated crab on the wild halibut.)

1690
00:57:56,745 --> 00:57:58,315
I've never thought of such a combination.

1691
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:00,515
- I'll close the doors now. - Thank you.

1692
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:06,625
- What? - That must be so good.

1693
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,825
Usually, it's hard to taste the marinated crab very well.

1694
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,225
Suddenly, the fish meat turns into the crab meat.

1695
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:14,495
Goodness.

1696
00:58:14,496 --> 00:58:15,934
The halibut and crab meat combo is crazy.

1697
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,635
- I'll keep having it like this. - I see.

1698
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:19,605
Please leave some for me. I want to try it.

1699
00:58:20,535 --> 00:58:22,804
- Why? Just a piece. Please. - Okay.

1700
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:24,074
- I've never had it before. - This?

1701
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:25,105
- Yes. - No way.

1702
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,275
If I win, I'll mix everything up and drink it.

1703
00:58:28,015 --> 00:58:29,274
- I... - What? Why?

1704
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:30,445
The winner gets to eat.

1705
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:31,745
You shouldn't eat this.

1706
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:32,884
- I knew it. - Why not?

1707
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,244
You shouldn't have something like this.

1708
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:35,254
Why not?

1709
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:36,554
(He uses his chopsticks faster than ever before.)

1710
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,584
Why?

1711
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:39,954
(What?)

1712
00:58:39,955 --> 00:58:41,255
What do you mean? It's up to me.

1713
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,194
- Come on. - I'm so happy.

1714
00:58:43,195 --> 00:58:45,325
He's having more deliberately.

1715
00:58:45,665 --> 00:58:47,095
- I really wanted to try it. - This is...

1716
00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:48,965
- This one? - No.

1717
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:50,864
Stop talking and be quiet.

1718
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,035
I want the pickled victory onion.

1719
00:58:52,705 --> 00:58:54,004
- The pickled victory onion? - The pickled victory onion.

1720
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:55,035
Okay.

1721
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:56,334
(The second course is here.)

1722
00:58:56,335 --> 00:58:57,875
- It's here. Mr. Park. - Look at that.

1723
00:58:57,975 --> 00:58:59,005
(Amazed)

1724
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:01,745
- Gosh. - It's the sea urchin roe.

1725
00:59:01,945 --> 00:59:03,145
Isn't this beef?

1726
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:04,944
It's tuna cheek.

1727
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:07,085
(Of course, there are tuna parts, including the cheek meat.)

1728
00:59:07,985 --> 00:59:09,185
This is rice.

1729
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:10,714
That's raw Yeongdeok snow crab.

1730
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:12,024
(Next to them is Yeongdeok snow crab.)

1731
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:13,384
- Did you score it? - Yes. When I put it...

1732
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:15,054
in the ice water after scoring it, it blooms like this.

1733
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,624
(Yeongdeok snow crab that has bloomed splendidly)

1734
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:17,894
What is this that looks like ham?

1735
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,495
It's ice cream tuna.

1736
00:59:19,995 --> 00:59:21,264
- Is it caviar? - Yes. I put caviar on it.

1737
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:22,265
- It's caviar. - Yes.

1738
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:25,035
(It also comes with various other tuna dishes...)

1739
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:28,074
(and natural seafood.)

1740
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:30,205
- Do you want me to demonstrate? - Yes.

1741
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:32,645
This is tuna cheek, and this is tomato sauce.

1742
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:34,305
- What? - Tomato sauce?

1743
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:36,845
It'll taste better than steak tartare.

1744
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:38,914
- Tomato sauce? - Just dip it in the sauce?

1745
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:39,944
Yes. Dip it in the sauce only.

1746
00:59:39,945 --> 00:59:40,985
- Just the sauce? - Yes.

1747
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:45,685
Is it similar to ssamjang?

1748
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:48,125
- It's a bit spicy. - Yes.

1749
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:51,194
I added gochujang to the tomato sauce.

1750
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:52,394
(Surprised)

1751
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:54,365
It tastes just like beef.

1752
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:55,994
I came up with the sauce while eating raw beef.

1753
00:59:55,995 --> 00:59:57,094
So I adapted it.

1754
00:59:57,095 --> 00:59:58,304
(The tuna cheek with the tomato sauce tastes like beef.)

1755
00:59:58,305 --> 00:59:59,405
It looks so good.

1756
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:01,305
I have to have it.

1757
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,035
- That's... - The steak tartare.

1758
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:04,705
It's a dim sum made with tuna.

1759
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:06,505
- It's a dim sum. - A tuna dim sum?

1760
01:00:07,505 --> 01:00:09,475
(They put them in their mouths at the same time.)

1761
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:11,585
If you find tuna greasy...

1762
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,184
I've never tasted anything like it before.

1763
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,414
It's something new.

1764
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,014
I can't even explain it. Hold on.

1765
01:00:17,015 --> 01:00:18,384
- How should I... - What is it similar to?

1766
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:19,785
How should I describe it? It's...

1767
01:00:19,985 --> 01:00:21,294
What did you wrap it with?

1768
01:00:21,295 --> 01:00:22,824
I wrapped it with a perilla leaf.

1769
01:00:22,825 --> 01:00:24,154
- There's tuna in it. - Pickled perilla leaves?

1770
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:25,164
- Right? - Yes.

1771
01:00:25,165 --> 01:00:26,725
I've never had anything like it before.

1772
01:00:26,895 --> 01:00:28,695
It's totally new and different.

1773
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:31,264
Lastly, I'll make a happy combo.

1774
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:32,435
- "A happy combo?" - Yes.

1775
01:00:32,605 --> 01:00:33,634
"A happy combo?"

1776
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:35,575
- Goodness. - Dip it in the soy sauce.

1777
01:00:35,705 --> 01:00:37,475
It uses three ingredients like the skate combo.

1778
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,145
- A happy combo. - Gosh.

1779
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:41,914
Add shrimp and sea urchin roe.

1780
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:43,744
(Fatty tuna belly, shrimp, and sea urchin roe)

1781
01:00:43,745 --> 01:00:44,915
I'm going to make that combo.

1782
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:46,544
There will be none left.

1783
01:00:46,545 --> 01:00:48,514
The combo is gone.

1784
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:49,814
- It's gone. - It's gone.

1785
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:50,885
(The happy combo is sold out.)

1786
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:53,054
You only serve two pieces each.

1787
01:00:53,055 --> 01:00:55,924
The longer you chew, the happier you get.

1788
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:57,225
(How does the happy combo taste?)

1789
01:00:58,265 --> 01:00:59,395
- Gosh. - Chew it for a long time.

1790
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:05,665
I know how tuna tastes and how shrimp tastes.

1791
01:01:05,965 --> 01:01:07,265
- I know how sea urchin roe tastes. - Yes.

1792
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:09,805
But when eaten together, it's a different dish.

1793
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:13,175
Gosh. It drives me nuts to enjoy it only with my eyes and ears.

1794
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:15,114
It's killing me. I'll cover my ears.

1795
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:16,144
(He'd rather give up his ability to hear.)

1796
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:18,315
- What should we do now? - Please.

1797
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:20,714
- Should I leave some for you? - Yes. Thank you.

1798
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:21,784
(Do you want a quiz for the freeloaders?)

1799
01:01:21,785 --> 01:01:23,254
- It makes you happy. - I'd really appreciate it.

1800
01:01:23,255 --> 01:01:24,484
- Tae Hyun. - You have to try it.

1801
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:25,625
Tae Hyun, you have to leave it for us.

1802
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:27,684
Remember your original intention, Tae Hyun.

1803
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,495
You said you'd only have two pieces.

1804
01:01:29,795 --> 01:01:31,564
- Tae Hyun. - I'll leave it just in case.

1805
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:33,194
You might not be able to eat it.

1806
01:01:33,195 --> 01:01:34,934
Do you want a quiz for that?

1807
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,195
- Yes. I beg you. - Okay.

1808
01:01:36,535 --> 01:01:38,365
- I beg you. - Please.

1809
01:01:38,435 --> 01:01:39,965
- Please. - Please.

1810
01:01:40,105 --> 01:01:41,604
I left a piece.

1811
01:01:41,605 --> 01:01:42,704
Here.

1812
01:01:42,705 --> 01:01:44,775
- I really love this one. - This?

1813
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:47,144
- I'll place the tuna belly. - And the tomato sauce.

1814
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:48,515
- I'll put this on it too. - The tomato sauce?

1815
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:49,974
Just give us every piece while you're at it.

1816
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:52,014
I'll give you this too. It's a jackpot to win this.

1817
01:01:52,015 --> 01:01:53,144
Gosh. It's a jackpot, indeed.

1818
01:01:53,145 --> 01:01:54,985
That's a whole serving of the tuna.

1819
01:01:55,315 --> 01:01:56,614
Gosh. Only one winner...

1820
01:01:56,615 --> 01:01:58,185
- gets to have them all. - Okay.

1821
01:01:58,325 --> 01:01:59,524
It's a quiz on slogans.

1822
01:01:59,525 --> 01:02:00,654
- Slogans. Good. - Slogans?

1823
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,154
- What is a slogan? - Something like "Never trust fire."

1824
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,155
- I see. - I see.

1825
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:04,395
You shouldn't have told him.

1826
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,695
"Don't have regrets like A, and save up like B."

1827
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:10,495
I've heard of it before.

1828
01:02:11,038 --> 01:02:12,038
It's a quiz on slogans.

1829
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:13,207
- Slogans. Good. - Slogans?

1830
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,677
- What is a slogan? - Something like "Never trust fire."

1831
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:15,678
- I see. - I see.

1832
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:16,908
You shouldn't have told him.

1833
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:20,148
"Don't have regrets like A, and save up like B."

1834
01:02:21,648 --> 01:02:22,988
I've heard of it before.

1835
01:02:23,848 --> 01:02:24,858
- I got it. - What?

1836
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:28,957
Don't have regrets like the grasshopper,

1837
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,127
and save up like the ant.

1838
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:32,197
- Gosh. That's awesome. - Goodness.

1839
01:02:32,198 --> 01:02:34,227
- That was too easy. - Amazing.

1840
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:36,197
- You should have gotten it, then. - Why are you...

1841
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:37,727
You should have gotten it. What are you talking about?

1842
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:39,268
No. I don't think it's correct.

1843
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:40,637
- Incorrect. - What?

1844
01:02:40,638 --> 01:02:41,967
(Incorrect)

1845
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,008
Hold on.

1846
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:45,038
Please say it again. "Don't have..."

1847
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:48,707
(Utilizing his maximum brain power)

1848
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,008
- I got it. - Okay.

1849
01:02:50,248 --> 01:02:51,447
Don't have regrets like the grasshopper,

1850
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:52,648
and save up like the ant.

1851
01:02:54,078 --> 01:02:55,518
- You're truly amazing! - Why?

1852
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:58,218
- You're really amazing. - He said, "the ant."

1853
01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:00,457
(Exactly)

1854
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:01,657
- You said the same thing. - Did I?

1855
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:02,927
- Incorrect. - I got it.

1856
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:03,958
Okay.

1857
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:05,958
Don't have regrets like Nolbu...

1858
01:03:06,998 --> 01:03:09,027
- Heungbu... - Who was the other one?

1859
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:10,897
Patjwi.

1860
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:11,937
- No. - It's Heungbu.

1861
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:14,168
Heungbu! And saves up like Heungbu.

1862
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:15,268
Hey.

1863
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:18,208
Heungbu is too broke to save up anything.

1864
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:19,907
- Okay. - He saves up and in the end...

1865
01:03:19,908 --> 01:03:20,908
I got it!

1866
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:23,847
Don't have regrets like the ant, and save up like the grasshopper.

1867
01:03:23,848 --> 01:03:25,118
Did the grasshopper save up too?

1868
01:03:25,878 --> 01:03:26,947
- Incorrect. - Since when?

1869
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:28,718
- What are you talking about? - But it's...

1870
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:31,888
It's so unpleasant to be a part of them.

1871
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,758
I'm not like them.

1872
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:36,887
Among the answers you've given...

1873
01:03:36,888 --> 01:03:38,257
- Is there a correct answer? - One is correct.

1874
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:39,297
(Among the answers they've given, one is correct!)

1875
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:41,097
- It must be an ant. - You're looking for insects.

1876
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:42,227
Insects? All right.

1877
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:44,797
- Nice. He gave you everything. - Let me answer.

1878
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:46,938
Why aren't you saying "Cicada," your favorite insect?

1879
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:49,308
You should say, "Cicada."

1880
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,408
Don't have regrets like a wasp, and save up like a honeybee.

1881
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:54,138
Is it incorrect? It's incorrect.

1882
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:56,177
- Incorrect. - Let me answer.

1883
01:03:56,178 --> 01:03:57,247
(It's Sang Uk's turn.)

1884
01:03:57,248 --> 01:03:59,677
- Don't have regrets like a hare. - He said that we needed insects.

1885
01:03:59,678 --> 01:04:02,017
(He just said that the blanks were insects.)

1886
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,717
(I forgot about that.)

1887
01:04:03,718 --> 01:04:05,617
A hare? Hold on.

1888
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:09,357
It has the head, thorax, and abdomen like an insect. It's an insect.

1889
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,897
- How... - A hare loses to a tortoise.

1890
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:14,657
- He mixed things up. - In that case...

1891
01:04:14,658 --> 01:04:16,398
- I guess it's incorrect. - I'm really sorry,

1892
01:04:16,598 --> 01:04:17,928
but would you give us one correct answer?

1893
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:20,238
You're for it, right? It's a good idea.

1894
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:21,707
- It's a good idea. - Let's hear one correct answer.

1895
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,408
- Answer quickly, okay? - Okay.

1896
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:25,137
- "Ant" is correct. - Let me answer.

1897
01:04:25,138 --> 01:04:26,578
- Save up like an ant. - We don't know the first one.

1898
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,177
Who was the pied piper

1899
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:29,347
(The pied piper)

1900
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,948
Frog.

1901
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:33,478
Don't have regrets like a frog.

1902
01:04:33,548 --> 01:04:37,587
(Ppillilli, ribbit, ribbit, ppillillilli)

1903
01:04:37,588 --> 01:04:40,717
(They sing the theme song of an animated series.)

1904
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:44,528
(It might bring rain to the Rainbow Hill.)

1905
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:45,598
"Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog?"

1906
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,097
Yes. "Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog."

1907
01:04:47,098 --> 01:04:48,468
(A frog isn't an insect, so it's incorrect!)

1908
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:51,438
If we exclude an ant, what other insects are there?

1909
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:53,937
- Which insect is considered lazy? - Regrets.

1910
01:04:53,938 --> 01:04:55,007
A lazy insect.

1911
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:57,138
Don't have regrets like a mayfly.

1912
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:58,507
- A tiger moth. - Let me answer.

1913
01:04:58,508 --> 01:04:59,607
Don't have regrets...

1914
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:00,778
- Let me answer. - like a tiger moth,

1915
01:05:00,808 --> 01:05:01,877
and save up like an ant.

1916
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:03,847
- Don't have regrets like a fly. - A fly?

1917
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:05,647
Don't have regrets like a fruit fly.

1918
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:06,918
Don't have regrets like a cicada nymph.

1919
01:05:07,518 --> 01:05:09,018
Don't have regrets like a water strider.

1920
01:05:09,588 --> 01:05:11,287
(Tae Kyun stayed quiet as incorrect answers flooded in.)

1921
01:05:11,288 --> 01:05:12,288
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1922
01:05:12,718 --> 01:05:14,158
- Tae Kyun was faster. - I'll yield.

1923
01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:15,858
You'll yield?

1924
01:05:16,258 --> 01:05:18,727
- Go ahead. - I forgot because of you. Gosh.

1925
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:22,167
Why did you shout, "Let me answer?" I just thought of something.

1926
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,397
- What are you talking about? - I forgot.

1927
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:25,167
Why would you think after shouting, "Let me answer?"

1928
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,037
I mean... Let me answer.

1929
01:05:27,038 --> 01:05:29,168
Don't have regrets after a flood, and save up like an ant.

1930
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:30,807
(A flood?)

1931
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:32,578
- A flood? - Where did a flood come from?

1932
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:35,107
A flood can wipe out the nest ants build so diligently.

1933
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:36,877
That makes sense, but...

1934
01:05:36,878 --> 01:05:39,447
Like I said earlier, both of them are insects.

1935
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:42,388
It sounds like a grasshopper. Which insect is considered lazy?

1936
01:05:42,618 --> 01:05:45,118
You know, there must be a flow.

1937
01:05:45,258 --> 01:05:47,057
It must be an insect that's the opposite of an ant.

1938
01:05:47,058 --> 01:05:49,588
Otherwise, it could be an insect that's similar to an ant.

1939
01:05:50,188 --> 01:05:51,327
Is it really a cicada?

1940
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:52,997
Don't have regrets like a cicada. Cicadas only live for a week.

1941
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:54,057
Why would it be a cicada?

1942
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:56,527
Don't have regrets like a cicada, and save up like an ant.

1943
01:05:56,528 --> 01:05:57,927
It'll be incredible if it's correct. He's Cicada Kim.

1944
01:05:57,928 --> 01:05:59,367
(Don't have regrets like a cicada, and save up like an ant.)

1945
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:00,368
Correct.

1946
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:02,408
What?

1947
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:03,738
A cicada?

1948
01:06:04,008 --> 01:06:06,078
- Gosh, I'm stressed out. - What's this?

1949
01:06:06,738 --> 01:06:09,548
(Chirping)

1950
01:06:09,808 --> 01:06:12,347
(Chirping)

1951
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:14,177
- No way. - It's a cicada.

1952
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,017
I'll stick to his back as if I was a cicada.

1953
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:18,018
(The flippant cicada is back.)

1954
01:06:18,518 --> 01:06:20,588
- For goodness' sake. - Cicada Kim!

1955
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:23,128
It's Cicada Kim!

1956
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,098
This is our Korean Cicada Kim!

1957
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,997
- It was a cicada. - Cicada Kim.

1958
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:31,197
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1959
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:32,337
(Cicada Kim gets some food.)

1960
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:34,468
- Try it. The happy combo. - I'll try the happy combo first.

1961
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:35,767
- Eat it with a spoon. - Like this?

1962
01:06:35,768 --> 01:06:36,837
- Yes. - Shouldn't I dip it in a sauce?

1963
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:38,677
- It's already dipped in it. - It's the best.

1964
01:06:38,678 --> 01:06:39,708
It's already dipped in soy sauce.

1965
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:43,907
It's game over.

1966
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:46,217
(I'm jealous.)

1967
01:06:46,218 --> 01:06:47,848
I taste the sea urchin roe first.

1968
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:50,687
- It melts. - And the shrimp is so tasty.

1969
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:53,258
Then I taste the salty tuna.

1970
01:06:53,988 --> 01:06:56,688
You chewed it for a long time before swallowing.

1971
01:06:56,928 --> 01:06:58,498
- It must be tasty. - That's right.

1972
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:00,858
- It's so nice. - I'm curious about this one.

1973
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,997
No way. I should eat it with some crabmeat.

1974
01:07:05,998 --> 01:07:07,498
- You can't do that. - You can't do that.

1975
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,308
- You can only eat what we gave you. - I see. I'm sorry.

1976
01:07:11,138 --> 01:07:13,277
I had to test my luck. I guess it isn't allowed. Okay.

1977
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:15,648
Why did I get so worked up when I couldn't even eat?

1978
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:17,547
That's right. It just happens.

1979
01:07:17,548 --> 01:07:18,848
- How about this? - As for that piece...

1980
01:07:18,978 --> 01:07:21,448
- Dip it in oil. - Oil?

1981
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:23,747
- Like this? - Garlic and salt...

1982
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,958
- It's incredible. - Yes.

1983
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:26,858
- It's completely different. - It must be good.

1984
01:07:27,288 --> 01:07:29,758
- It explodes in your mouth. - It's so fatty.

1985
01:07:30,688 --> 01:07:31,727
(The next dishes enter.)

1986
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:32,758
Chef Park.

1987
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:33,858
There are more dishes.

1988
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:36,597
- To my favorite person... - Gosh, what are these?

1989
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,367
- It looks like tataki. - I see.

1990
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:39,437
It's called carpaccio.

1991
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:40,767
- I cooked it like an Italian dish. - Carpaccio?

1992
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:43,567
Yes. This is negitoro. It's made with the belly.

1993
01:07:43,568 --> 01:07:44,568
This is incredible.

1994
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:47,538
- Is this tuna as well? - Yes, it's minced tuna.

1995
01:07:47,638 --> 01:07:49,207
- Minced tuna. - What was it called again?

1996
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,648
(He eats it in one go.)

1997
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:53,818
It's nice.

1998
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:58,858
I'm tasting many of these dishes for the very first time.

1999
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,218
This must be why people love tuna.

2000
01:08:01,628 --> 01:08:03,557
- I had no idea. - It's nice that we get...

2001
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:06,858
an explanation on each tuna dish.

2002
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,927
Now, I feel like the price isn't so bad.

2003
01:08:09,928 --> 01:08:11,127
What's that? Braised ribs?

2004
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,137
- Yes. - You know,

2005
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:13,567
there's enough food for everyone.

2006
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:14,568
There's so much food.

2007
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:18,307
- The soup must be so refreshing. - It must be so refreshing.

2008
01:08:18,308 --> 01:08:19,308
(Jealous)

2009
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:21,107
Since we're almost done with the course meal,

2010
01:08:21,108 --> 01:08:22,507
shall we solve the quiz as we eat?

2011
01:08:22,508 --> 01:08:24,308
- Okay. - Yes. As we eat..

2012
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,918
Please let it be a hard one.

2013
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:28,717
The price is neat. It's 334 dollars.

2014
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:30,018
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2015
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:31,588
Is it a drawing?
(A poster appears.)

2016
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:34,588
- Look at this. It'll be hard. - What is it?

2017
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:37,627
The first tuna can in Korea was released...

2018
01:08:37,628 --> 01:08:39,497
- in 1982. - The prince of the sea.

2019
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:41,967
In the beginning, it had the image of luxury food.

2020
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:43,727
Starting from Chuseok of 1984,

2021
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:46,037
the company promoted...

2022
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:49,868
the tuna can set as a holiday gift and grew the market gradually.

2023
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,107
In that case, which word goes in the blank...

2024
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:55,477
of the photo you're seeing?

2025
01:08:55,478 --> 01:08:56,607
A tuna can.

2026
01:08:56,608 --> 01:09:00,478
"Tuna lives in the pure water of the South Pacific."

2027
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:03,647
"Being the prince of the sea, it's expensive."

2028
01:09:03,648 --> 01:09:06,287
"Until now, it has only been enjoyed by people of the rich countries."

2029
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:08,258
- It's so easy. - It didn't sound strange at all.

2030
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:09,827
- Shall we say it right away? - "Prince" is correct.

2031
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:11,358
- Here. - I said it out loud to check.

2032
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:13,927
Yes. It sounds similar.

2033
01:09:13,928 --> 01:09:14,928
(Yi Kyung seems to be unsure about something.)

2034
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:16,198
- It might be incorrect. - Hold on.

2035
01:09:16,868 --> 01:09:19,568
You're right. Is it the same word as this one?

2036
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:21,667
This is nothing, right?

2037
01:09:21,668 --> 01:09:22,868
(What did Yi Kyung see?)

2038
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:26,938
(There's a phrase, "The noble of the sea.")

2039
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:29,847
- It's something like a prince. - "Being the leader of the sea."

2040
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:32,377
"It has only been enjoyed by people of the rich countries."

2041
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:33,917
Isn't it "The noble of the sea?"

2042
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,247
- Why would they tell us outright? - Seriously.

2043
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:37,348
That can't be the answer.

2044
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:39,318
Isn't it too outright?

2045
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:44,357
You can't do that. Hold on.

2046
01:09:44,358 --> 01:09:45,658
They always make it thick.

2047
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:47,498
You can't do that.

2048
01:09:47,499 --> 01:09:48,727
The emperor of the sea.

2049
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:50,167
- Hello? - That's right. The king.

2050
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:52,468
- Well... - Do only five ribs remain?

2051
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,037
Is the supply limited? Okay.

2052
01:09:55,038 --> 01:09:56,367
- We'll be there soon. - It can't be "The prince."

2053
01:09:56,368 --> 01:09:57,767
- Okay. - The prince of the sea.

2054
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:59,537
- "The prince" doesn't seem right. - The supply is limited.

2055
01:09:59,538 --> 01:10:01,948
- "The emperor" makes more sense. - That's right.

2056
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:03,648
Idong ribs.

2057
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:05,347
The emperor.

2058
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:07,278
(What could it be if it isn't "The noble?)

2059
01:10:07,678 --> 01:10:08,718
The treasure of the sea.

2060
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,987
The treasure of the sea. Something valuable.

2061
01:10:12,988 --> 01:10:15,357
- I prefer "Gold" or "Treasure." - Okay.

2062
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:18,327
Since it was as expensive as such things,

2063
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:20,398
only those in the rich countries could enjoy it.

2064
01:10:20,658 --> 01:10:22,727
- A treasure island. We say that. - Shall we go with that one?

2065
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:23,967
Okay. Let's go.

2066
01:10:23,968 --> 01:10:24,968
Treasure.

2067
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:26,498
It's the most plausible.

2068
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:27,897
Treasure.

2069
01:10:27,898 --> 01:10:31,807
(Answer: Treasure)

2070
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:32,808
Incorrect.

2071
01:10:33,738 --> 01:10:35,577
- We're saved. - What happens now?

2072
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,147
- We're saved. - Does that mean that we won't pay?

2073
01:10:37,148 --> 01:10:38,448
The bill is hefty.

2074
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:39,848
Take turns to give an answer.

2075
01:10:40,178 --> 01:10:42,647
Then I'll go with the one I said first.

2076
01:10:42,648 --> 01:10:44,147
Let me answer. The emperor.

2077
01:10:44,148 --> 01:10:45,287
(Answer: The emperor)

2078
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:46,387
- Incorrect. - "The noble."

2079
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:48,118
- It's "The noble." - "The noble?" Correct.

2080
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:49,828
I was right.

2081
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:52,098
I mentioned it from the beginning.

2082
01:10:52,358 --> 01:10:54,128
- Is it "The noble?" - It was a mistake, right?

2083
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:55,468
It was a mistake, right?

2084
01:10:56,528 --> 01:10:58,027
It was a mistake, right? Be honest.

2085
01:10:58,028 --> 01:11:00,397
No, it wasn't a mistake. You guys did it to throw us off.

2086
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:01,398
It was a mistake.

2087
01:11:01,538 --> 01:11:03,537
- It was a trick question. - It was a mistake.

2088
01:11:03,538 --> 01:11:04,538
Was it a mistake?

2089
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,407
As soon as I received it, I said,

2090
01:11:07,408 --> 01:11:08,478
"It's 'The noble.'"

2091
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:11,648
How could you guys do that? We almost got ruined.

2092
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:14,618
Hey, we should get another quiz. This is ridiculous.

2093
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:17,447
Had we gotten it right,

2094
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:19,257
you would've said that it was thanks to the mistake.

2095
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:20,657
No way. We would've accepted it.

2096
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:22,388
- Wouldn't you have thrown a fit? - Of course not.

2097
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:25,197
- "This is absolutely ridiculous!" - Tae Hyun.

2098
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,827
We're athletes.

2099
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:28,997
- We like fair play. - Fair play. That's right.

2100
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:30,597
We would've accepted it.

2101
01:11:30,598 --> 01:11:32,297
That was incredible. Yi Kyung is scary.

2102
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:34,737
- Come on. - I expected to see the main event.

2103
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:35,937
Let's go to the next location for the main event.

2104
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:37,207
- Let's go and see it. - Yes. Let's go.

2105
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,877
- Let's go. - I hope you get a difficult one.

2106
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:39,907
Of course.

2107
01:11:39,908 --> 01:11:41,277
- Tae Hyun, thank you for the food. - Good.

2108
01:11:41,278 --> 01:11:42,777
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2109
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:43,778
- Tae Hyun. - Okay.

2110
01:11:43,848 --> 01:11:44,848
All right.

2111
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:48,587
(Total: 334 dollars)

2112
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,647
Thank you for the food. Oh, yes.

2113
01:11:50,648 --> 01:11:52,987
Tae Hyun is the noble of Handsome Guys.

2114
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:54,858
The noble. Here comes the noble.

2115
01:11:58,228 --> 01:12:01,058
(They move for the second DMR.)

2116
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:04,968
(DMR 2, Idong ribs)

2117
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:08,707
We drove here from a busy street.

2118
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:09,708
It's another busy street.

2119
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:10,807
There are so many busy streets in Korea.

2120
01:12:10,808 --> 01:12:13,908
I feel like the neighborhood is full of busy streets.

2121
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:16,907
(Which restaurant sells cost-effective Idong ribs?)

2122
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:19,848
Seriously. There are so many restaurants.

2123
01:12:20,018 --> 01:12:21,718
- It's a food street. - I love it.

2124
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,447
This place is no joke.

2125
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:24,448
Hello.

2126
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,717
- Fried chicken sounds delicious. - We've had fried chicken often.

2127
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:27,917
- Fried chicken. - Hello.

2128
01:12:27,918 --> 01:12:28,927
(Cheering)

2129
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,328
- Hello. - Hello.

2130
01:12:31,028 --> 01:12:33,097
- It looks delicious. - Are you Oh Sang Uk?

2131
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,298
Yes. Enjoy the food.

2132
01:12:34,428 --> 01:12:36,327
Gosh, this is insane!

2133
01:12:36,328 --> 01:12:38,328
(Smiling)

2134
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:40,068
Where is it?

2135
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:41,398
- This must be the place. - This must be the place.

2136
01:12:41,468 --> 01:12:42,567
- Rib fingers. - What?

2137
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:44,138
The sign reads, "Rib fingers."

2138
01:12:44,338 --> 01:12:45,807
- But... - "Korean rib fingers."

2139
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:48,177
It's my first time seeing a sign that just says, "Rib fingers."

2140
01:12:48,178 --> 01:12:49,847
It's a sign of a tasty restaurant.

2141
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:50,848
It smells amazing.

2142
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,417
- It's a brazier. - It's insane.

2143
01:12:52,418 --> 01:12:53,418
- Look. - Isn't that it?

2144
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:54,577
Look at the meat.

2145
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:55,748
Look.

2146
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:57,848
We're looking at the Idong ribs.

2147
01:12:58,018 --> 01:12:59,387
(The slabs of beef ribs adds charisma to the restaurant.)

2148
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:00,658
Look at the color of the meat.

2149
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:05,188
(Sniffing)

2150
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:06,397
Suddenly,

2151
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:08,097
(His nostrils flare as soon as they enter the restaurant.)

2152
01:13:08,098 --> 01:13:09,727
my stomach began to love.

2153
01:13:09,728 --> 01:13:10,797
- This is incredible. - Gosh.

2154
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:12,768
(The smell stimulates the stomach.)

2155
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:17,507
(It has the chewy texture...)

2156
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:20,078
(and smoky flavor.)

2157
01:13:21,308 --> 01:13:24,508
(DMR 2, Idong ribs)

2158
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:26,948
It's cheap.

2159
01:13:27,218 --> 01:13:29,387
- It's really cheap. - You're right. The price...

2160
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:32,388
- Seriously. It's so cost-effective. - It really is very cost-effective.

2161
01:13:33,318 --> 01:13:34,718
It's Korean beef.

2162
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:36,188
How is Korean beef so cheap?

2163
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:37,888
It could cost 100 dollars.

2164
01:13:37,928 --> 01:13:39,697
- Sir. - Yes?

2165
01:13:39,698 --> 01:13:40,857
- Hello. - Please come this way.

2166
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:42,097
(They check with the owner right away.)

2167
01:13:42,098 --> 01:13:44,098
- Sir. - Hello.

2168
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:45,597
We checked the menu,

2169
01:13:45,598 --> 01:13:46,897
- and the price... - It's so cheap.

2170
01:13:46,898 --> 01:13:48,608
How is the price so cheap?

2171
01:13:48,738 --> 01:13:52,077
- We get meat from the butchers... - I see.

2172
01:13:52,078 --> 01:13:53,877
And separate the meat ourselves.

2173
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:55,647
- That explains the meat we saw. - Yes.

2174
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:57,678
Is that so? Do you get a whole slab of ribs?

2175
01:13:57,708 --> 01:14:00,217
Yes, we get a whole slab of ribs.

2176
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:01,348
(Does he get a whole slab of ribs? Yes.)

2177
01:14:03,688 --> 01:14:06,458
(He gets whole slabs of ribs.)

2178
01:14:08,688 --> 01:14:10,927
(He cleans it...)

2179
01:14:10,928 --> 01:14:14,798
(and cuts it up.)

2180
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:22,007
(Eliminating a step in the distribution process...)

2181
01:14:22,008 --> 01:14:25,938
(is the secret behind the cheap price.)

2182
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,477
We use all the meat we receive for the day.

2183
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:31,077
Then the meat must be very fresh.

2184
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:33,778
Is there a good cut you recommend for today?

2185
01:14:33,918 --> 01:14:35,447
A menu that represents the restaurant...

2186
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:37,087
is the marbled ribs.

2187
01:14:37,088 --> 01:14:38,717
- The supply is limited. - It's limited.

2188
01:14:38,718 --> 01:14:40,087
Yes. So I recommend the marbled ribs.

2189
01:14:40,088 --> 01:14:42,657
Another item many people order is...

2190
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,327
the Idong ribs.

2191
01:14:44,328 --> 01:14:45,697
- Idong ribs. - Idong ribs.

2192
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:49,098
- Idong ribs are often marinated. - That's right.

2193
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:50,967
Since we get a whole slab of ribs,

2194
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:52,968
- we can keep them plain. - They must be delicious.

2195
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:56,007
Then we'll order three servings of Idong ribs,

2196
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:57,707
- three servings of marbled ribs, - Okay.

2197
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,137
- and one meat sashimi. - One meat sashimi.

2198
01:14:59,138 --> 01:15:00,878
- We'll order those items first. - Okay.

2199
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,647
Please give us three cans of Coke Zero.

2200
01:15:02,648 --> 01:15:04,148
You're obsessed with zero-sugar drinks.

2201
01:15:04,548 --> 01:15:06,318
I can already picture it. There'll be a lot of smoke.

2202
01:15:07,218 --> 01:15:08,577
- You know that, right? - I'm so hungry.

2203
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:10,017
- The oil will drop. - Yes.

2204
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:11,717
The oil will drop on the charcoal and create smoke.

2205
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:13,787
Then there'll be a flame.

2206
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:16,357
I'll fill this place with smoke.

2207
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,458
Okay.

2208
01:15:18,128 --> 01:15:19,627
- The three of them... - There are woodae ribs too.

2209
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:22,028
The three of them will create quite a picture as they eat meat.

2210
01:15:22,128 --> 01:15:23,327
Here comes Coke Zero.

2211
01:15:23,328 --> 01:15:24,468
(The side dishes get set up first.)

2212
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:27,138
It's bound to be tasty.

2213
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:28,398
What did you get?

2214
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:32,108
Salt and specks of pepper.

2215
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,007
- This is... - It's just salt.

2216
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:37,108
Yes. When I dip grilled meat...

2217
01:15:37,308 --> 01:15:38,878
in this salt and eat it...

2218
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,718
Even the salt smells different.

2219
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,648
I can smell that the combination is perfect.

2220
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:45,018
Gosh, pepper.

2221
01:15:45,518 --> 01:15:48,057
(Salt sommelier)

2222
01:15:48,058 --> 01:15:49,988
(Nodding)

2223
01:15:50,058 --> 01:15:51,127
We'll eat until the salt disappears.

2224
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:52,557
Did you guys get a dish or something?

2225
01:15:52,558 --> 01:15:54,528
I could feel it the moment I saw this salt.

2226
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,698
Quality meat only needs salt.

2227
01:15:56,828 --> 01:15:59,267
Tae Hyun, you shouldn't be that way just because you had your food.

2228
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:00,938
To be honest, I'm not very jealous.

2229
01:16:01,038 --> 01:16:03,638
- We don't really want to eat. - I have no interest whatsoever.

2230
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:06,308
Do you know what I looked for the moment when I walked in here?

2231
01:16:06,378 --> 01:16:07,707
There are some barbecue restaurants...

2232
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:09,278
that give ice cream as dessert.

2233
01:16:09,878 --> 01:16:10,977
- So I thought, - The one you scoop out?

2234
01:16:10,978 --> 01:16:12,677
"Is there ice cream somewhere?"

2235
01:16:12,678 --> 01:16:14,418
- But I didn't see it anywhere. - Shall we go and buy it?

2236
01:16:14,748 --> 01:16:15,988
He's slicing meat.

2237
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:18,717
- He's slicing meat now. - He's slicing meat.

2238
01:16:18,718 --> 01:16:22,688
(The blue trio can only see the meat.)

2239
01:16:27,758 --> 01:16:30,568
(He prepares the meat on the spot.)

2240
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:36,008
(Beef of nice colors)

2241
01:16:42,908 --> 01:16:47,848
(Marbled ribs that got scored on both sides)

2242
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:52,618
(Raw meat that got sliced right away)

2243
01:16:55,888 --> 01:16:57,458
I'm looking forward to the meat.

2244
01:16:58,628 --> 01:17:00,128
Eat it comfortably.

2245
01:17:00,558 --> 01:17:02,898
(The meat gets served amidst expectations.)

2246
01:17:03,428 --> 01:17:04,727
Which cut is this?

2247
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:06,097
- Ribs. - Marbled ribs.

2248
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:08,037
Okay. Your meat sashimi is here.

2249
01:17:08,038 --> 01:17:09,407
(Raw meat)

2250
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:11,938
The meat sashimi has such an incredible color.

2251
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,838
- Look at the color. - Give us another pair of tongs.

2252
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,477
It's long, so I don't know if it's fit.

2253
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:18,048
- It'll fit. - One more.

2254
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:19,848
Like this? Okay.

2255
01:17:19,948 --> 01:17:21,277
We pay attention to the color, right?

2256
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:22,987
- The color is no joke. - It's so pretty.

2257
01:17:22,988 --> 01:17:24,348
The color is so pretty.

2258
01:17:25,448 --> 01:17:27,888
- Let's put it here. - Let's grill two ribs.

2259
01:17:35,028 --> 01:17:36,467
(The blue team trio becomes serious once the meat enters.)

2260
01:17:36,468 --> 01:17:37,597
This won't do.

2261
01:17:37,598 --> 01:17:38,598
(The blue team trio becomes serious once the meat enters.)

2262
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:40,667
(The other two members watch.)

2263
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:41,867
Seriously,

2264
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:43,608
there are a legendary baseball player.

2265
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:45,508
The number one fencer in the world,

2266
01:17:46,138 --> 01:17:48,138
and the number six MMA fighter in the world.

2267
01:17:48,638 --> 01:17:50,008
I'll cut it.

2268
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:53,148
It's nice for cutting.

2269
01:17:53,278 --> 01:17:54,678
It gets cooked quickly.

2270
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:57,618
Since the meat is high-quality. I can cut it easily.

2271
01:17:57,788 --> 01:17:59,688
- I can cut it easily. - Thank you for the food.

2272
01:18:01,188 --> 01:18:02,728
(Reaching)

2273
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:05,897
- Sashimi. - Meat sashimi.

2274
01:18:05,898 --> 01:18:07,458
(Raw meat will soothe their hungry stomachs.)

2275
01:18:07,698 --> 01:18:09,467
I know this because I've sliced a lot of meat...

2276
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:11,198
on "Unexpected Business."

2277
01:18:11,398 --> 01:18:12,568
You ran a butchershop.

2278
01:18:12,738 --> 01:18:13,898
It's high-quality meat.

2279
01:18:14,168 --> 01:18:15,298
Really?

2280
01:18:16,468 --> 01:18:18,838
(The former butchershop owner approves of it.)

2281
01:18:19,638 --> 01:18:22,348
(It gets dipped into a sauce for a bite.)

2282
01:18:24,108 --> 01:18:26,078
- Thank you for the food. - Eat the raw meat first.

2283
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:29,947
- How is it? - Is it different?

2284
01:18:29,948 --> 01:18:31,188
It's so nice.

2285
01:18:32,088 --> 01:18:33,117
He eats three pieces at a time.

2286
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:34,218
How is the sauce?

2287
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,327
He eats three pieces at a time.

2288
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:38,258
- Are you going to be like that? - There he goes again.

2289
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:40,127
- I need to fill up my mouth. - His mouth is big.

2290
01:18:40,128 --> 01:18:41,457
That's right. His mouth is like a penthouse.

2291
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,427
Then I'll eat two pieces at a time.

2292
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:45,568
- You can eat it like that. - That's right.

2293
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:48,267
- It's tasty. - It doesn't smell. It's clean.

2294
01:18:48,268 --> 01:18:49,438
The sauce is nice.

2295
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:50,968
It looks tasty.

2296
01:18:51,668 --> 01:18:53,977
Sesame oil, gochujang, and garlic.

2297
01:18:53,978 --> 01:18:55,238
Sang Uk is working hard.

2298
01:18:55,308 --> 01:18:56,877
A bite for the junior who's grilling meat diligently.

2299
01:18:56,878 --> 01:18:58,148
(A bite for the junior who's grilling meat diligently)

2300
01:19:00,178 --> 01:19:01,317
He's a warmhearted senior.

2301
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:04,148
(He has a lot of love for a junior athlete.)

2302
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:06,058
Gosh, the raw meat is tasty.

2303
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:07,988
- The sauce... - It's fresh.

2304
01:19:08,688 --> 01:19:09,827
Look at Dong Hyun.

2305
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,627
Athletes who do individual sports are like that.

2306
01:19:11,628 --> 01:19:13,257
I eat on my own.

2307
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:14,627
- I survive alone. - He's selfish.

2308
01:19:14,628 --> 01:19:15,967
It goes into his own mouth.

2309
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:17,198
(Like always, he puts the cooked meat in his own mouth.)

2310
01:19:17,368 --> 01:19:18,428
(Exclaiming)

2311
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:20,368
Oh, my gosh.

2312
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:21,967
This is incredible.

2313
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:23,467
It gets cooked very quickly.

2314
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,038
- I mean... - Hurry up and eat.

2315
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:28,037
- At this moment... - I'll eat this one.

2316
01:19:28,038 --> 01:19:29,047
(Tae Kyun dips it in salt.)

2317
01:19:29,048 --> 01:19:30,177
I just need to dip it in salt.

2318
01:19:30,178 --> 01:19:31,548
It's amazing with salt.

2319
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,148
- The texture is so nice. - Yes.

2320
01:19:38,588 --> 01:19:39,717
The ribs...

2321
01:19:39,718 --> 01:19:41,457
have been scored, right?

2322
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,557
- Thanks to the grooves, - That's right.

2323
01:19:43,558 --> 01:19:45,228
- juice explodes in my mouth. - Yes.

2324
01:19:45,388 --> 01:19:48,228
(While grilling meat, Sang Uk takes a bite as well.)

2325
01:19:49,268 --> 01:19:50,967
(Impressed)

2326
01:19:50,968 --> 01:19:51,997
It's really tasty.

2327
01:19:51,998 --> 01:19:54,037
It's much better than what you get at an expensive beef restaurant.

2328
01:19:54,038 --> 01:19:56,168
I think it's more tender.

2329
01:19:56,468 --> 01:19:57,638
I need to eat two pieces at a time.

2330
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:06,578
(2 pieces in 1 bite)

2331
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:19,327
This is the time to move the meat to the side...

2332
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:20,997
and begin grilling the next batch of meat.

2333
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:23,598
(They quickly move on to the next batch of meat.)

2334
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:26,397
- It's so tasty. - Is someone chasing you guys?

2335
01:20:26,398 --> 01:20:27,398
(Laughing)

2336
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:29,237
You guys should eat...

2337
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,667
- with class. - Here.

2338
01:20:30,668 --> 01:20:31,807
Four remain.

2339
01:20:31,808 --> 01:20:33,577
- It's hot. - You need to cut it.

2340
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,678
- Cut it. - What's wrong with you guys?

2341
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:37,047
- It's like the reels. - I mean...

2342
01:20:37,048 --> 01:20:38,447
Relax.

2343
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:39,617
Wait.

2344
01:20:39,618 --> 01:20:40,848
Please.

2345
01:20:41,848 --> 01:20:43,787
- Please put more on this side. - Okay.

2346
01:20:43,788 --> 01:20:45,417
All the pieces are going to that side.

2347
01:20:45,418 --> 01:20:48,357
(The grill burns up.)

2348
01:20:48,358 --> 01:20:51,528
(Startled)

2349
01:20:51,628 --> 01:20:52,697
(Burning)

2350
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:53,757
I'll help you.

2351
01:20:53,758 --> 01:20:54,797
- Should you be doing that? - Shouldn't you keep it down?

2352
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:56,067
Take out the meat for now.

2353
01:20:56,068 --> 01:20:57,527
- Should you be doing that? - Shouldn't you keep it down?

2354
01:20:57,528 --> 01:20:59,497
- Take out the meat for now. - Put it back down.

2355
01:20:59,498 --> 01:21:01,097
What are you guys doing?

2356
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:03,207
- What? Put it back down. - Put it back down.

2357
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,238
Put it back down.

2358
01:21:04,668 --> 01:21:06,138
Take out the meat for a moment.

2359
01:21:06,378 --> 01:21:07,838
- It's hot. - Take it out.

2360
01:21:08,638 --> 01:21:09,647
(Embarrassed)

2361
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:10,948
We're only good at eating.

2362
01:21:11,878 --> 01:21:14,048
Shall we use two grills? We'll do that.

2363
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:15,578
He really is an expert.

2364
01:21:15,948 --> 01:21:17,988
The owner took care of the situation.

2365
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:19,658
It's a bit burnt.

2366
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:21,087
Hey, wait.

2367
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:22,157
(He takes a bite without a break.)

2368
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:23,287
Chew your food.

2369
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:25,897
It's beyond eating in a hurry.

2370
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:27,597
How did they eat three servings of ribs...

2371
01:21:27,598 --> 01:21:29,698
in less than eight minutes?

2372
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:31,567
- Done in eight minutes. - Hold on.

2373
01:21:31,568 --> 01:21:33,167
It's much tastier when it's a bit undercooked.

2374
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:34,337
- You're right. - It's tender.

2375
01:21:34,338 --> 01:21:35,568
I like my meat like that.

2376
01:21:35,668 --> 01:21:37,267
The crispy one is here.

2377
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,707
(The blue team trio eats meat at an alarming speed.)

2378
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:41,377
- Idong ribs are here. - What's this?

2379
01:21:41,378 --> 01:21:42,747
Idong ribs.

2380
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:44,048
(Idong ribs)

2381
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,447
- I see. - Idong ribs.

2382
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:49,847
- What's this? - What's this?

2383
01:21:49,848 --> 01:21:50,917
Marbled ribs.

2384
01:21:50,918 --> 01:21:52,287
- Marbled ribs. - Marbled ribs?

2385
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:53,757
Didn't you know what you were eating?

2386
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:54,917
We were just eating it.

2387
01:21:54,918 --> 01:21:56,087
- Seriously. - Idong ribs.

2388
01:21:56,088 --> 01:21:57,428
(It's good as long as it's tasty.)

2389
01:21:58,058 --> 01:21:59,798
We need to start grilling.

2390
01:22:00,558 --> 01:22:02,258
It's my first time seeing Idong ribs.

2391
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:04,228
Gosh, what's up with this bone?

2392
01:22:10,938 --> 01:22:12,838
The big pieces are tastier.

2393
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:15,948
Idong ribs must be a bit thinner.

2394
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:22,347
(Chewing and humming sounds)

2395
01:22:22,348 --> 01:22:23,748
No one is judging the taste.

2396
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:26,017
(Laughing)

2397
01:22:26,018 --> 01:22:28,358
They are only humming.

2398
01:22:28,588 --> 01:22:30,288
The sizzling sounds and humming sounds.

2399
01:22:30,328 --> 01:22:33,098
(Humming)

2400
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:36,197
There's nothing to say about the taste of the ribs.

2401
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:38,628
- That's right. - The taste is just clean.

2402
01:22:38,998 --> 01:22:41,668
Are the Idong ribs different from the marbled ribs?

2403
01:22:42,098 --> 01:22:44,238
The marbled ribs look neat.

2404
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:46,677
These ones look unruly.

2405
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:47,708
(Eating)

2406
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:49,708
What does that even mean?

2407
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:51,907
- What does that even mean? - He asked you to judge the taste.

2408
01:22:51,908 --> 01:22:54,078
- Not the appearance? - That was a new review.

2409
01:22:54,718 --> 01:22:56,448
Neat versus unruly.

2410
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:58,217
- The taste? - No, the appearance.

2411
01:22:58,218 --> 01:23:00,587
- I think this is tastier. - Which one is better?

2412
01:23:00,588 --> 01:23:02,457
- This is tastier. - It smells the same.

2413
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,357
I bet Idong ribs are tastier.

2414
01:23:04,358 --> 01:23:05,727
It's a bit chewy.

2415
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:09,328
It has more texture than what we had earlier.

2416
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:10,967
- Yes. That's why... - Right?

2417
01:23:10,968 --> 01:23:12,227
I think we'll be able to eat more of it.

2418
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:14,468
The taste is clean and the ribs are meatier.

2419
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:18,767
- I prefer marbled ribs. - The one we had earlier?

2420
01:23:18,768 --> 01:23:21,938
It was a thick piece of meat that had been scored.

2421
01:23:22,008 --> 01:23:23,977
The juice exploded in my mouth.

2422
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:25,248
Still, it was tender.

2423
01:23:25,378 --> 01:23:27,547
- It was more... - Can we order another serving?

2424
01:23:27,548 --> 01:23:28,917
Of course. Order it.

2425
01:23:28,918 --> 01:23:31,248
Please give us another serving of marbled ribs.

2426
01:23:31,348 --> 01:23:33,218
- Would you like the short ribs? - Yes. The short ribs.

2427
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:34,618
Can we get a portion of the special cuts as well?

2428
01:23:35,388 --> 01:23:36,428
Should we order two portions?

2429
01:23:36,728 --> 01:23:38,657
- We should... - Will you give us two portions?

2430
01:23:38,658 --> 01:23:40,597
We have to eat the seasoned meat as well.

2431
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,927
- The seasoned meat tastes great. - What should we do then?

2432
01:23:41,928 --> 01:23:43,027
We should just have a little bit of the special cuts...

2433
01:23:43,028 --> 01:23:44,567
- and go for the seasoned meat. - We need two portions at least.

2434
01:23:44,568 --> 01:23:45,568
Right.
(We'll just get two portions of the special cuts.)

2435
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:48,137
- Do you have the sesame oil sauce? - Yes.

2436
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:49,837
(The extra orders of meat continue to get served.)

2437
01:23:49,838 --> 01:23:50,867
Here's your meat.

2438
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:51,938
Thank you.

2439
01:23:52,608 --> 01:23:54,938
The flow can't be stopped. It needs to be placed right away.

2440
01:23:55,108 --> 01:23:56,147
Right.

2441
01:23:56,148 --> 01:23:57,647
This is just a work of art.

2442
01:23:57,648 --> 01:24:00,777
(Meat tossing)

2443
01:24:00,778 --> 01:24:01,918
Let's just cut it three times.

2444
01:24:02,348 --> 01:24:03,617
- Like this? - Like this?

2445
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:04,718
Let's finish it at once.

2446
01:24:04,818 --> 01:24:07,188
Even people taking refuge would eat slower than that.

2447
01:24:08,118 --> 01:24:10,388
It makes no sense at all. I've been checking time.

2448
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,088
They ate seven portions.

2449
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:13,858
It would be amazing to eat this at once.

2450
01:24:13,928 --> 01:24:14,957
Did it take them around 19 minutes?

2451
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:15,967
(Current time: 10:47pm)

2452
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:16,968
(Meat grilling: 10:20pm, Finishing ribs: 10:28pm)

2453
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,238
The way I see it, hamburgers aren't fast food.

2454
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:21,197
Ribs are fast food.

2455
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:22,608
I feel alive now.

2456
01:24:23,008 --> 01:24:24,268
- I finally got to eat. - Right.

2457
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:25,808
I'll have the raw beef while we're waiting.

2458
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:30,277
(The meat goes up endlessly as if it was fast food.)

2459
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:32,207
I think we can just eat a piece of this each.

2460
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:33,278
Should we not cut it?

2461
01:24:33,678 --> 01:24:35,278
- Without cutting it? - Right.

2462
01:24:35,518 --> 01:24:36,547
Like that?

2463
01:24:36,548 --> 01:24:38,217
That's considered a steak in other countries.

2464
01:24:38,218 --> 01:24:39,218
Gosh.

2465
01:24:39,219 --> 01:24:41,218
That was really spicy.

2466
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:43,388
There's more left.

2467
01:24:43,758 --> 01:24:44,927
Gosh, it's this big.

2468
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,057
(It's hard to catch up with their eating speed.)

2469
01:24:46,058 --> 01:24:47,797
- It's really big. - That would be better.

2470
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:49,528
(It's hard to catch up with their eating speed.)

2471
01:24:54,968 --> 01:24:56,307
Gosh, this place is...

2472
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:57,337
It's good.

2473
01:24:57,338 --> 01:24:59,708
(Their fast food eating show carries on.)

2474
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:02,507
I feel great now. I've found some peace now.

2475
01:25:02,508 --> 01:25:05,077
- They look better now. - But...

2476
01:25:05,078 --> 01:25:06,278
I forgot how I just ate the food.

2477
01:25:06,948 --> 01:25:08,377
What happened? I don't remember what happened.

2478
01:25:08,378 --> 01:25:09,788
I can't remember what these are after getting to my sense.

2479
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:11,017
You guys went wild.

2480
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:12,048
- Right? - Yes.

2481
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,187
It would be great to have some rice with some doenjang stew now.

2482
01:25:14,188 --> 01:25:16,458
- The doenjang stew is here. - Gosh, it looks amazing.

2483
01:25:16,988 --> 01:25:18,628
- That looks great. - One here and one there.

2484
01:25:19,228 --> 01:25:21,498
Also, our seasoned ribs are really good.

2485
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:22,698
Just a moment.
Should we get one portion? Is that allowed?

2486
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:24,698
Yes.

2487
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:25,997
Please give us one portion.

2488
01:25:25,998 --> 01:25:27,997
- Would you like one portion? - We'll try it.

2489
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,367
Here are the seasoned ribs.

2490
01:25:29,368 --> 01:25:30,538
So it's served like this?

2491
01:25:31,768 --> 01:25:33,178
That looks great.

2492
01:25:33,478 --> 01:25:35,608
- Right. Seasoned ribs. - It was sliced thinly.

2493
01:25:37,678 --> 01:25:39,147
It has to be grilled quickly as it will burn.

2494
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:40,278
- Right. - What a waste of a grill.

2495
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:43,987
- This is amazing. - I'll serve it to you.

2496
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:46,017
I feel like this will be amazing with the rice.

2497
01:25:46,018 --> 01:25:47,087
(While the seasoned ribs get grilled nicely...)

2498
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:48,158
I can tell after seeing them be grilled.

2499
01:25:48,318 --> 01:25:49,787
Sir, please give us a raw egg too.

2500
01:25:49,788 --> 01:25:51,358
What? A raw egg?

2501
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,858
- A raw egg? - It will be amazing in here.

2502
01:25:52,928 --> 01:25:55,128
- A raw egg? - Try what I make with it.

2503
01:25:55,228 --> 01:25:57,098
- A raw egg will be put in? - It will be put in here.

2504
01:25:57,598 --> 01:25:58,627
It was bearable.

2505
01:25:58,628 --> 01:25:59,767
(Raw egg)

2506
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:00,938
- I've never seen that. - Same here.

2507
01:26:03,068 --> 01:26:05,268
(The raw egg gets added into the doenjang stew!)

2508
01:26:05,768 --> 01:26:07,378
(Stirring)

2509
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:09,777
(Looking intently)

2510
01:26:09,778 --> 01:26:12,208
It becomes a different color.

2511
01:26:14,178 --> 01:26:16,647
Tae Kyun seems to have his own formula.

2512
01:26:16,648 --> 01:26:18,748
(Formula Kim is certain about his eating formulas.)

2513
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:22,357
(He indifferently cuts in the meat as well.)

2514
01:26:22,358 --> 01:26:23,988
There are people who do it like that.

2515
01:26:25,028 --> 01:26:26,158
I'm curious about that.

2516
01:26:28,358 --> 01:26:30,498
Tae Kyun's eyes of excitement have changed.

2517
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:32,327
He's licking his lips.

2518
01:26:32,328 --> 01:26:33,668
(He picks up a big spoonful.)

2519
01:26:35,838 --> 01:26:36,967
(Placing a piece of the seasoned ribs)

2520
01:26:36,968 --> 01:26:38,068
Gosh, that looks good too.

2521
01:26:38,438 --> 01:26:39,607
Gosh, it can be eaten like that.

2522
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,177
The doenjang hangover stew...

2523
01:26:41,178 --> 01:26:43,148
and a piece of the seasoned ribs.

2524
01:26:45,778 --> 01:26:47,747
(A taste combination that makes your mouth water...)

2525
01:26:47,748 --> 01:26:49,818
(even by just imagining it)

2526
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:52,717
This is amazing.

2527
01:26:52,718 --> 01:26:54,317
(Dong Hyun goes for the original taste...)

2528
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:55,918
(with the white rice.)

2529
01:26:56,288 --> 01:26:57,388
No way.

2530
01:26:58,388 --> 01:27:00,227
If we started out with the seasoned ribs,

2531
01:27:00,228 --> 01:27:01,427
don't you think we would have stuck with this?

2532
01:27:01,428 --> 01:27:02,898
- I agree. Yes. - Right?

2533
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:04,127
- Right. - Just this...

2534
01:27:04,128 --> 01:27:05,267
It's so good.

2535
01:27:05,268 --> 01:27:06,467
This is a totally different taste.

2536
01:27:06,468 --> 01:27:07,667
This with the seasoned ribs.

2537
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:09,037
That isn't Dong Hyun's style.

2538
01:27:09,038 --> 01:27:10,237
- No. - No?

2539
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:11,667
- I like it simple with the rice. - Gosh, it's hot!

2540
01:27:11,668 --> 01:27:13,338
- These two are different. - I don't like mixing things.

2541
01:27:14,108 --> 01:27:16,248
I feel like the doenjang will taste stronger than the seasoning.

2542
01:27:17,548 --> 01:27:18,708
It's okay. You won't die.

2543
01:27:19,578 --> 01:27:20,777
It's okay. You won't die.

2544
01:27:20,778 --> 01:27:21,778
"You won't die?"

2545
01:27:22,448 --> 01:27:24,848
- Drink some of the Coke! - It will taste like Coke then!

2546
01:27:25,088 --> 01:27:26,488
- Turn out the fire! - Right.

2547
01:27:27,388 --> 01:27:29,587
- Gosh. - I'm tearing up.

2548
01:27:29,588 --> 01:27:30,927
(Teary)

2549
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:32,288
The inside of your mouth hasn't been trained enough.

2550
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:34,998
- Gosh. - They're all cooked.

2551
01:27:36,098 --> 01:27:39,068
(The demonstration of the one that has been trained)

2552
01:27:39,868 --> 01:27:41,968
- The seasoned ribs are amazing. - They're amazing.

2553
01:27:42,398 --> 01:27:43,667
That was a perfect way to end things.

2554
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:45,568
- Right. - That was amazing.

2555
01:27:45,938 --> 01:27:46,978
Gosh!

2556
01:27:47,408 --> 01:27:48,737
It was a great battle that lasted for an hour.

2557
01:27:48,738 --> 01:27:50,307
- The seasoned ribs are number one. - Gosh, that was great.

2558
01:27:50,308 --> 01:27:51,807
The seasoned ribs are the best.

2559
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,818
All right.

2560
01:27:53,178 --> 01:27:54,917
- Shall we get the bill now? - Yes.

2561
01:27:54,918 --> 01:27:55,947
I'm excited about how much it will cost.

2562
01:27:55,948 --> 01:27:58,188
- Right. - It's 561 dollars.

2563
01:27:58,818 --> 01:28:00,218
- That's a good price. - That's a good price.

2564
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:02,487
It would have definitely been more than 1,000 dollars...

2565
01:28:02,488 --> 01:28:03,628
- at a different place. - Right.

2566
01:28:04,088 --> 01:28:06,197
- You all enjoyed your meal. - Right.

2567
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,128
- It's 561 dollars. - We'll play for the bill again.

2568
01:28:08,398 --> 01:28:09,428
Okay.

2569
01:28:09,568 --> 01:28:12,328
All right. It's the bottom of the 9th with 2 outs.

2570
01:28:12,838 --> 01:28:14,198
It's the final match of the Summer Games.

2571
01:28:14,368 --> 01:28:15,938
It's the title match for me.

2572
01:28:16,768 --> 01:28:18,138
I hope you pass out after getting a hit.

2573
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:20,978
- Gosh! - What's wrong with you?

2574
01:28:21,278 --> 01:28:22,337
Come on!

2575
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:24,008
He could place his bet on someone else.

2576
01:28:24,148 --> 01:28:25,847
- What's wrong with you? - I really hope that happens.

2577
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:26,977
When cows are raised,

2578
01:28:26,978 --> 01:28:30,218
they are distinguished by their tags on their ears.

2579
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,957
With this method, the tags easily fell off...

2580
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,488
and needed to be replaced often.

2581
01:28:35,888 --> 01:28:38,088
That was why owners struggled with this method.

2582
01:28:38,628 --> 01:28:41,198
Just like the use of human fingerprints,

2583
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:43,897
a new method was developed in 2021...

2584
01:28:43,898 --> 01:28:46,467
that used this part of the cow...

2585
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:50,637
that had a jagged pattern.

2586
01:28:50,638 --> 01:28:52,568
- This one seems easy. - I know this.

2587
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:54,007
Which part is this?

2588
01:28:54,008 --> 01:28:55,507
- This one seems easy. - It's easy.

2589
01:28:55,508 --> 01:28:56,508
I got it!

2590
01:28:57,278 --> 01:28:58,347
(I got it!)

2591
01:28:58,348 --> 01:28:59,647
- You will answer it right away? - Stop!

2592
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,677
- Stop! - We aren't against each other.

2593
01:29:00,678 --> 01:29:02,277
- We have to discuss it. - We aren't against each other.

2594
01:29:02,278 --> 01:29:03,817
- We weren't? - No!

2595
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,487
- We're on the same team. - But...

2596
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:06,817
What do you think it is?

2597
01:29:06,818 --> 01:29:07,818
The sole.

2598
01:29:08,258 --> 01:29:09,588
- The sole? - The sole.

2599
01:29:09,988 --> 01:29:12,558
- This one is too easy. - I don't think it's the sole.

2600
01:29:12,858 --> 01:29:15,258
The soles all look the same.

2601
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,428
Their hooves are stuck on the ground.

2602
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:19,538
- Won't they look the same? - They have wrinkles inside.

2603
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:21,598
What do cow soles look like?

2604
01:29:22,268 --> 01:29:23,437
- What? - What do their soles look like?

2605
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:26,068
Their hooves are like this and there's a space in between.

2606
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:27,378
- The tongue. - They're white,

2607
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:29,138
wrinkly, and jagged.

2608
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,477
(Whispering)

2609
01:29:31,478 --> 01:29:32,607
- And jagged. - The tongue of the cow.

2610
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:33,748
He keeps saying it's the tongue.

2611
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:35,518
It's jagged.

2612
01:29:35,978 --> 01:29:37,447
- It's jagged. - Come on, Tae Hyun.

2613
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:39,287
- There are lines. - Fine.

2614
01:29:39,288 --> 01:29:40,487
Aren't I precise?

2615
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:41,757
I think I've seen it...

2616
01:29:41,758 --> 01:29:43,127
- as I've eaten so much beef. - They're all different?

2617
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,557
I think I've seen it as well.

2618
01:29:45,558 --> 01:29:46,558
I remember seeing it.

2619
01:29:46,559 --> 01:29:47,597
- Right. - Right?

2620
01:29:47,598 --> 01:29:49,157
"Lift up your back leg." They checked it like this.

2621
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:50,167
Wasn't that for a horse?

2622
01:29:50,168 --> 01:29:51,298
- Wasn't that for a horse? - Was it a horse?

2623
01:29:52,028 --> 01:29:54,297
They have a piece of steel...

2624
01:29:54,298 --> 01:29:55,637
- hammered to their hooves. - That's a horseshoe.

2625
01:29:55,638 --> 01:29:56,837
- Right. - Right.

2626
01:29:56,838 --> 01:29:57,907
- That was why... - That's for a horse.

2627
01:29:57,908 --> 01:29:59,008
I thought it was the nose.

2628
01:29:59,538 --> 01:30:01,378
Cows have a lot of wrinkles on their noses.

2629
01:30:01,808 --> 01:30:03,207
It's too obvious to think about their hooves...

2630
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,548
when we think about human fingerprints.

2631
01:30:04,908 --> 01:30:07,417
It might not have been given as a question...

2632
01:30:07,418 --> 01:30:09,018
if it was that obvious.

2633
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:10,388
What does the tail look like?

2634
01:30:11,048 --> 01:30:12,087
- The tail doesn't sound right. - The tail...

2635
01:30:12,088 --> 01:30:13,687
- Is that so? - The tail lifted...

2636
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:14,688
and the anus?

2637
01:30:15,158 --> 01:30:16,557
- I don't think it's the anus. - That sounds off.

2638
01:30:16,558 --> 01:30:17,558
- That doesn't sound right. - Right.

2639
01:30:17,559 --> 01:30:18,728
It's the sole.

2640
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,657
- We have to go low. - Right.

2641
01:30:20,658 --> 01:30:21,927
- Right. - What could it be then?

2642
01:30:21,928 --> 01:30:23,627
Isn't it the anus if you're going low?

2643
01:30:23,628 --> 01:30:25,098
- Is it the sole? - Right.

2644
01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:26,228
Okay.

2645
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:28,098
Let's get it over with quickly. Answer for us, Tae Kyun.

2646
01:30:28,498 --> 01:30:29,538
- We got it. - Okay.

2647
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:30,708
The answer is...

2648
01:30:31,168 --> 01:30:33,508
the inside of the cow's sole and...

2649
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,208
Just say it's the sole.

2650
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:37,948
- The cow's sole! - The sole?

2651
01:30:38,048 --> 01:30:39,717
We'll go against each other if we get it wrong.

2652
01:30:39,718 --> 01:30:40,877
(Answer: Cow sole)

2653
01:30:40,878 --> 01:30:41,947
- Please! - We're at the meat restaurant.

2654
01:30:41,948 --> 01:30:43,347
(Which team will pay?)

2655
01:30:43,348 --> 01:30:44,618
We'll win the gold medal if we get this right.

2656
01:30:44,948 --> 01:30:46,018
The sole.

2657
01:30:46,318 --> 01:30:47,717
Go for the tongue right away when you go against each other.

2658
01:30:47,718 --> 01:30:49,588
(Will the sole really be the answer?)

2659
01:30:51,288 --> 01:30:52,587
That is incorrect!

2660
01:30:52,588 --> 01:30:54,898
(That is incorrect!)

2661
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:56,928
It's incorrect?

2662
01:30:57,468 --> 01:30:58,567
Do you know the answer?

2663
01:30:58,568 --> 01:31:00,237
- What should we do then? - Go for it right away.

2664
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:01,838
We should take turns to say the answer.

2665
01:31:02,798 --> 01:31:04,067
- Take turns. - We'll each take turns.

2666
01:31:04,068 --> 01:31:05,238
You might not get a chance.

2667
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:06,938
- I'll go for the nose. - I'll go for the ear.

2668
01:31:06,978 --> 01:31:07,978
I'll go for the nose.

2669
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:09,007
- I'll go for the ear. - The ear?

2670
01:31:09,008 --> 01:31:11,848
- There are no more parts. - Yes. There aren't any more parts.

2671
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:14,548
- We should take turns. - The tongue.

2672
01:31:15,418 --> 01:31:16,947
Nose, ear, and tongue.

2673
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:18,148
Is there one that is right?

2674
01:31:19,248 --> 01:31:20,318
There...

2675
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:23,357
is one that is right.

2676
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,187
(There is one that is right.)

2677
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,228
- Hey! - Hey!

2678
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:28,058
You know that beef tongue is expensive, right?

2679
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:30,167
- I told you to change your answer! - You know it's expensive, right?

2680
01:31:30,168 --> 01:31:31,227
The tongue of a live cow?

2681
01:31:31,228 --> 01:31:32,698
Will their mouths be opened up like this to check?

2682
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,097
- Is it a dead cow? - You'll regret it.

2683
01:31:35,098 --> 01:31:36,467
- A dead cow? - Gosh.

2684
01:31:36,468 --> 01:31:37,537
It could be the tongue if it's a dead cow.

2685
01:31:37,538 --> 01:31:39,007
You got it wrong because you didn't change your answer.

2686
01:31:39,008 --> 01:31:40,178
Why do I think it's the nose?

2687
01:31:40,608 --> 01:31:42,108
Shall we switch answers? No.

2688
01:31:42,478 --> 01:31:44,078
- No. I'll keep my pride. - Shall we switch?

2689
01:31:44,748 --> 01:31:45,777
- Switch answers. - Use this chance!

2690
01:31:45,778 --> 01:31:47,577
- Really? - The ear could be worth it.

2691
01:31:47,578 --> 01:31:48,578
(A trade opens all of a sudden.)
- The ear. - Shall we switch?

2692
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:50,987
- Go for it. - What about the tongue?

2693
01:31:50,988 --> 01:31:52,218
The tongue doesn't seem right.

2694
01:31:52,748 --> 01:31:53,788
Hey!

2695
01:31:53,888 --> 01:31:55,287
- I gave you that answer. - That's a no.

2696
01:31:55,288 --> 01:31:56,458
- The ear? - Will you switch?

2697
01:31:56,728 --> 01:31:58,187
- Just do it. - The ear seems to be worth it.

2698
01:31:58,188 --> 01:31:59,257
Will you trade off the ear?

2699
01:31:59,258 --> 01:32:01,157
I'll give you my answer.

2700
01:32:01,158 --> 01:32:02,757
- Deal? - Let's switch.

2701
01:32:02,758 --> 01:32:03,867
- Okay. - Let's switch.

2702
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:04,997
(The trade has been made.)

2703
01:32:04,998 --> 01:32:05,998
We'll see now.

2704
01:32:05,999 --> 01:32:07,067
Really?

2705
01:32:07,068 --> 01:32:09,238
If it's the tongue, these two just wasted their time.

2706
01:32:09,338 --> 01:32:11,807
- Well... - Will you not go for the tongue?

2707
01:32:11,808 --> 01:32:13,908
It's never the tongue.

2708
01:32:14,308 --> 01:32:15,638
Then it's...

2709
01:32:15,808 --> 01:32:16,947
- Ear, nose, and tongue? - Ear, nose, and tongue.

2710
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,508
- Ear, nose, and tongue. - Hold on.

2711
01:32:18,648 --> 01:32:20,718
- Let's smile for once. - The part that is used...

2712
01:32:21,178 --> 01:32:23,417
- like the human fingerprint. - Gosh.

2713
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:24,488
This is the part...

2714
01:32:25,218 --> 01:32:26,387
- Please. - in question.

2715
01:32:26,388 --> 01:32:28,558
(Will it be a decision of regret not to make the trade?)

2716
01:32:29,018 --> 01:32:30,857
(What is the result of the trade?)

2717
01:32:30,858 --> 01:32:31,887
- It's the nose. - Yes!

2718
01:32:31,888 --> 01:32:33,598
(Answer: Nose)

2719
01:32:33,728 --> 01:32:34,757
- It's the nose. - Yes!

2720
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,297
(Sang Uk gets exempted from paying.)

2721
01:32:36,298 --> 01:32:37,298
(Chuckling)

2722
01:32:37,299 --> 01:32:38,928
(Sighing)

2723
01:32:40,038 --> 01:32:41,498
I'm feeling stressed out.

2724
01:32:41,698 --> 01:32:43,708
I said it was the nose.

2725
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:46,208
The nose is like the fingerprint.

2726
01:32:47,508 --> 01:32:48,837
I still have another chance.

2727
01:32:48,838 --> 01:32:49,977
Then it's you and me left.

2728
01:32:49,978 --> 01:32:51,908
The last duel of the day.

2729
01:32:52,248 --> 01:32:54,178
- It's the sky-blue battle. - Forget about the previous one.

2730
01:32:54,748 --> 01:32:56,048
- Go for it. - Keep thinking about it.

2731
01:32:56,278 --> 01:32:57,287
That was a great meal.

2732
01:32:57,288 --> 01:33:00,618
The cow works as a silent worker at farms...

2733
01:33:01,058 --> 01:33:04,558
and is known as a part of riches in a farming society.

2734
01:33:05,328 --> 01:33:08,098
When it dies, it becomes food for human beings.

2735
01:33:08,598 --> 01:33:11,927
This is why there is the saying,

2736
01:33:11,928 --> 01:33:13,768
"Only this is useless from the cow."

2737
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:15,867
"What is this?"

2738
01:33:15,868 --> 01:33:16,868
- I got it! - I got it!
Gosh.

2739
01:33:17,868 --> 01:33:18,868
- I got it! - I got it!

2740
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:20,137
(Calling out at the same time)

2741
01:33:20,138 --> 01:33:21,338
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2742
01:33:21,778 --> 01:33:23,377
(Glaring)

2743
01:33:23,378 --> 01:33:24,678
I know this one.

2744
01:33:25,008 --> 01:33:26,778
I have to win this no matter what.

2745
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,948
- I would've lost with this one. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2746
01:33:29,348 --> 01:33:30,848
Do you know the answer though?

2747
01:33:31,048 --> 01:33:32,288
I don't know the answer. I'm just going for it.

2748
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:33,588
Look away from each other.

2749
01:33:34,858 --> 01:33:36,658
Rock-paper-scissors!

2750
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:40,228
(The Handsome Guys are at it again.)

2751
01:33:41,258 --> 01:33:43,897
(He is clueless.)

2752
01:33:43,898 --> 01:33:46,097
I can't believe us.

2753
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:47,368
(Embarrassed)

2754
01:33:47,768 --> 01:33:48,998
Are we swindlers or what?

2755
01:33:50,168 --> 01:33:51,168
Gosh.

2756
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,537
I'll play rock-paper-scissors fairly this time.

2757
01:33:54,538 --> 01:33:55,638
- Why? - I'll play fairly this time.

2758
01:33:56,078 --> 01:33:58,547
- We kept fooling you. - Why? Was it a prank?

2759
01:33:58,548 --> 01:33:59,677
(What is it?)

2760
01:33:59,678 --> 01:34:02,678
Do it again. "Rock-paper-scissors." This was how I played.

2761
01:34:02,818 --> 01:34:04,218
- I'll be conscientious. Let's play. - Okay.

2762
01:34:04,318 --> 01:34:05,788
- "Rock-paper-scissors." - "Rock-paper-scissors."

2763
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:07,587
- I won fairly this time. - Right.

2764
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:09,088
- Okay. - Fair and square.

2765
01:34:09,388 --> 01:34:10,988
I think I'll get it wrong though.

2766
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:12,688
I'm certain I'll get it wrong.

2767
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:13,957
(He feels unconfident even after winning his chance.)

2768
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:15,027
You're taking too long.

2769
01:34:15,028 --> 01:34:17,797
- One, two, three... - No. I'll go with the eyes.

2770
01:34:17,798 --> 01:34:19,298
- The eyes. - The eyes might be useless.

2771
01:34:20,038 --> 01:34:21,438
What did you think it was?

2772
01:34:21,838 --> 01:34:24,008
Is this not it? This isn't something that's eaten.

2773
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:26,707
- I was going to go with cowhide. - Cowhide?

2774
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,877
Cowhide leather is used for so many things.

2775
01:34:28,878 --> 01:34:30,777
- It's useful. - But it isn't eaten.

2776
01:34:30,778 --> 01:34:32,708
- That wasn't my answer. - I got nervous for nothing.

2777
01:34:33,048 --> 01:34:34,517
I thought you knew the answer.

2778
01:34:34,518 --> 01:34:36,017
It was him that said his answer.

2779
01:34:36,018 --> 01:34:38,287
- "I got nervous for nothing." - That wasn't my answer.

2780
01:34:38,288 --> 01:34:39,518
He was thinking of cowhide?

2781
01:34:40,658 --> 01:34:42,287
There were times when this happened during fights.

2782
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:44,157
I got really nervous, but the opponent was terrible.

2783
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:45,357
(The terrible one)

2784
01:34:45,358 --> 01:34:47,058
"Why did I feel nervous and not sleep for this?"

2785
01:34:47,128 --> 01:34:48,128
Incorrect!

2786
01:34:48,798 --> 01:34:50,367
- I got it! - What?

2787
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,097
We can throw out answers now.

2788
01:34:52,098 --> 01:34:53,498
We can give any kind of answer. I got it!

2789
01:34:54,338 --> 01:34:56,068
The lung? "'Only the lung is useless from the cow."

2790
01:34:56,138 --> 01:34:57,168
Incorrect.

2791
01:34:57,938 --> 01:34:58,938
The cow's...

2792
01:34:59,838 --> 01:35:01,038
testicles!

2793
01:35:02,408 --> 01:35:03,408
- Incorrect. - I got it!

2794
01:35:03,548 --> 01:35:04,977
- Poop! - Poop?

2795
01:35:04,978 --> 01:35:06,817
"'Only the poop is useless from the cow."

2796
01:35:06,818 --> 01:35:08,818
- But... - I was going to say that one.

2797
01:35:09,348 --> 01:35:10,447
I was going to say that one.

2798
01:35:10,448 --> 01:35:12,488
Everything else is eaten.

2799
01:35:12,618 --> 01:35:14,487
- Poop isn't eaten though. - I was going to say that one.

2800
01:35:14,488 --> 01:35:16,358
Poop is used as manure.

2801
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,728
- Right. It's used as manure. - I got it! It's urine then.

2802
01:35:19,188 --> 01:35:20,357
- Urine isn't used as a drink. - Urine?

2803
01:35:20,358 --> 01:35:21,358
(Poop isn't used as food either.)

2804
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:22,397
- Incorrect. - Gosh.

2805
01:35:22,398 --> 01:35:23,897
The cow's... What was this called again?

2806
01:35:23,898 --> 01:35:24,997
You have to say it.

2807
01:35:24,998 --> 01:35:25,998
- The nose ring? - What is it?

2808
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:27,597
The thing that cows have.

2809
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,198
- The stapler. - This!

2810
01:35:29,298 --> 01:35:30,938
The thing made out of steel!

2811
01:35:31,168 --> 01:35:33,378
- I got it! - This is the only thing left!

2812
01:35:33,878 --> 01:35:35,237
This is the only thing left!

2813
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:39,107
- This is it! - He got it!

2814
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:40,277
- Aren't I right? - He got it!

2815
01:35:40,278 --> 01:35:41,477
- I got it. - This is it!

2816
01:35:41,478 --> 01:35:43,147
- You have to say its name! - Hold on.

2817
01:35:43,148 --> 01:35:44,187
- The thing that is here. - Gosh.

2818
01:35:44,188 --> 01:35:45,217
Hold on!

2819
01:35:45,218 --> 01:35:47,788
You can't go over there to ask.

2820
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:50,927
Don't tell him, sir!

2821
01:35:50,928 --> 01:35:52,527
(Excited to watch)

2822
01:35:52,528 --> 01:35:54,997
There's so much on the line. You can't tell him.

2823
01:35:54,998 --> 01:35:56,358
- You can't tell him. - The nose ring.

2824
01:35:56,528 --> 01:35:57,698
I got it!

2825
01:35:58,228 --> 01:36:01,898
Time out! This is... Gosh.

2826
01:36:02,168 --> 01:36:04,167
This is controversial. The owner told him the answer.

2827
01:36:04,168 --> 01:36:05,907
- The nose ring! - The nose ring.

2828
01:36:05,908 --> 01:36:07,607
- Right. - The nose ring.

2829
01:36:07,608 --> 01:36:08,738
The nose ring.

2830
01:36:09,078 --> 01:36:10,677
- The owner told him. - Really?

2831
01:36:10,678 --> 01:36:12,007
- Yes. - Incorrect!

2832
01:36:12,008 --> 01:36:14,747
(Incorrect!)

2833
01:36:14,748 --> 01:36:17,287
- I got it! It's my turn! - I got it!

2834
01:36:17,288 --> 01:36:18,747
We should take turns. I got it!

2835
01:36:18,748 --> 01:36:20,317
- The cow ring. - The cow ring?

2836
01:36:20,318 --> 01:36:21,517
- Yes. - Incorrect!

2837
01:36:21,518 --> 01:36:23,288
The cow nose ring!

2838
01:36:23,788 --> 01:36:25,287
(That's the same thing.)

2839
01:36:25,288 --> 01:36:26,458
This is the only answer.

2840
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:30,467
- The nose thing? - I was faster.

2841
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:32,027
But isn't that the answer?

2842
01:36:32,028 --> 01:36:33,267
Everything else was mentioned.

2843
01:36:33,268 --> 01:36:35,137
- I thought that was the answer too. - Right.

2844
01:36:35,138 --> 01:36:36,767
- Would you like a hint or not? - Sorry?

2845
01:36:36,768 --> 01:36:37,807
- Would you like a hint or not? - Listen to the hint.

2846
01:36:37,808 --> 01:36:39,137
We need a hint.

2847
01:36:39,138 --> 01:36:40,277
(Please give us a hint.)

2848
01:36:40,278 --> 01:36:42,037
We need a hint.

2849
01:36:42,038 --> 01:36:43,408
We need a hint to answer this one.

2850
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,807
First of all, it isn't a body part of the cow.

2851
01:36:45,808 --> 01:36:46,847
It's not a body part?

2852
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,178
- It's not a body part. - It's something that can't be seen.

2853
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:50,447
- It's an act. - An act!

2854
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:51,648
(Hint: An act instead of a body part)

2855
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,718
- It's an act. - I got it!

2856
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:55,718
How did they say it exactly at the same time?

2857
01:36:56,258 --> 01:36:57,657
- I got it. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2858
01:36:57,658 --> 01:36:59,488
This is a matter of pride.

2859
01:36:59,858 --> 01:37:01,098
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2860
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,828
The cow's backsteps!

2861
01:37:07,038 --> 01:37:09,897
I must win! I can't lose!

2862
01:37:09,898 --> 01:37:13,137
Me losing to a guy like him? That can't happen.

2863
01:37:13,138 --> 01:37:14,437
(The backsteps got Tae Hyun good.)

2864
01:37:14,438 --> 01:37:16,637
- That was just amazing. - Gosh.

2865
01:37:16,638 --> 01:37:18,277
I got it!

2866
01:37:18,278 --> 01:37:19,448
The cow's ruminating!

2867
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:21,217
(Crying)

2868
01:37:21,218 --> 01:37:23,278
"Only the ruminating is useless from the cow." No?

2869
01:37:23,488 --> 01:37:24,618
That is incorrect.

2870
01:37:24,848 --> 01:37:27,618
One of you has done this today.

2871
01:37:28,358 --> 01:37:29,487
- What? - This was done by one of you.

2872
01:37:29,488 --> 01:37:30,787
(Here's the answer.)

2873
01:37:30,788 --> 01:37:31,828
This act?

2874
01:37:33,528 --> 01:37:38,597
"Only this is useless from the cow."

2875
01:37:38,598 --> 01:37:41,368
"Only the yawn is useless from the cow."

2876
01:37:41,598 --> 01:37:42,698
I got it!

2877
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:44,467
- What? - Moo!

2878
01:37:44,468 --> 01:37:46,978
(Moo!)

2879
01:37:47,538 --> 01:37:48,838
You kept doing that while we were eating.

2880
01:37:50,748 --> 01:37:52,448
I got it! The cow's sigh?

2881
01:37:52,578 --> 01:37:53,748
- Sigh? - Yes.

2882
01:37:53,978 --> 01:37:55,647
(They're getting closer!)

2883
01:37:55,648 --> 01:37:56,788
The sigh.

2884
01:37:57,948 --> 01:37:58,988
- Incorrect! - What?

2885
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:00,287
- It must be similar. - I got it!

2886
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:01,417
The steam.

2887
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:02,658
What is it called when there's steam coming out?

2888
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:07,198
- The snort! - Incorrect!

2889
01:38:07,328 --> 01:38:10,298
I got it! The yawn.

2890
01:38:10,528 --> 01:38:11,697
- The yawn? - Yes.

2891
01:38:11,698 --> 01:38:12,928
"Only the yawn useless from the cow."

2892
01:38:13,768 --> 01:38:14,768
Correct!

2893
01:38:15,998 --> 01:38:19,608
(He finally got the answer.)

2894
01:38:20,078 --> 01:38:22,638
(Yawning)

2895
01:38:23,038 --> 01:38:24,078
It was the yawn?

2896
01:38:24,548 --> 01:38:26,308
(Being cheeky to the max)

2897
01:38:26,878 --> 01:38:29,317
- The yawn of the cow. - I should yawn a lot now.

2898
01:38:29,318 --> 01:38:30,787
(The person to pay is Tae Kyun.)

2899
01:38:30,788 --> 01:38:32,788
- Thank you for the meal. - My gosh.

2900
01:38:33,488 --> 01:38:35,058
"The cow nose ring!"

2901
01:38:35,588 --> 01:38:37,428
"The cow's backsteps!"

2902
01:38:38,228 --> 01:38:40,227
Right. There was that one too.

2903
01:38:40,228 --> 01:38:42,227
- "The cow's backsteps!" - "It's the act of a cow."

2904
01:38:42,228 --> 01:38:43,928
"The cow's backsteps!"

2905
01:38:43,998 --> 01:38:45,797
That was when I thought...

2906
01:38:45,798 --> 01:38:47,438
I was never going to lose today.

2907
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:51,008
I couldn't lose after hearing the cow's backsteps.

2908
01:38:51,538 --> 01:38:53,338
It was the Seolleung Battle today.

2909
01:38:54,078 --> 01:38:56,407
- The Seolleung Battle. - The final was amazing.

2910
01:38:56,408 --> 01:38:57,578
I lost all my energy.

2911
01:38:57,808 --> 01:39:00,417
I lose all my energy after a quiz.

2912
01:39:00,418 --> 01:39:01,578
Why did I put my life on this?

2913
01:39:02,178 --> 01:39:03,348
I feel a bit embarrassed.

2914
01:39:03,748 --> 01:39:05,618
- You feel that way after it's over. - Right.

2915
01:39:05,748 --> 01:39:07,158
"Why did I go that far?"

2916
01:39:07,988 --> 01:39:10,728
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy. - "The cow's backsteps."

2917
01:39:10,828 --> 01:39:13,058
But listen up, Tae Kyun.

2918
01:39:13,598 --> 01:39:16,228
You two were so funny toward the end.

2919
01:39:16,798 --> 01:39:21,537
As the older one, I want to pay for you.

2920
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:22,737
(Everyone gets surprised.)

2921
01:39:22,738 --> 01:39:23,837
- I'm serious. - Why?

2922
01:39:23,838 --> 01:39:27,237
You two were just hilarious together.

2923
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:28,778
- I laughed so much. - He's paying for the show.

2924
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:30,547
- Tae Hyun never disappoints. - No.

2925
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,248
I just found it so funny.

2926
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:35,648
I think I laughed the most today out of the whole year.

2927
01:39:35,778 --> 01:39:37,217
What if I lost?

2928
01:39:37,218 --> 01:39:39,517
I would've decided to pay even if you lost.

2929
01:39:39,518 --> 01:39:40,518
- Really? - Well,

2930
01:39:40,519 --> 01:39:42,417
you two were just hilarious.

2931
01:39:42,418 --> 01:39:43,858
- Did we try that hard? - Well...

2932
01:39:44,588 --> 01:39:45,757
Did we put our lives on this?

2933
01:39:45,758 --> 01:39:48,797
Our well-intentioned competition...

2934
01:39:48,798 --> 01:39:50,397
- developed each other. - Right.

2935
01:39:50,398 --> 01:39:52,367
- That was just... - He's crying so much.

2936
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,497
- It was so funny. - Seriously.

2937
01:39:54,498 --> 01:39:55,738
It was so funny.

2938
01:39:56,638 --> 01:39:59,808
- Thank you, Tae Hyun! - Thank you, Tae Hyun!

2939
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:01,378
Thank you.

2940
01:40:01,808 --> 01:40:03,177
That was so funny.

2941
01:40:03,178 --> 01:40:04,178
(Tae Hyun gladly decides to pay for the meal.)

2942
01:40:04,179 --> 01:40:05,908
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2943
01:40:06,148 --> 01:40:07,617
Thank you.

2944
01:40:07,618 --> 01:40:10,118
- That was great. - Thank you.

2945
01:40:10,448 --> 01:40:11,547
That was a great meal, Tae Hyun.

2946
01:40:11,548 --> 01:40:12,617
