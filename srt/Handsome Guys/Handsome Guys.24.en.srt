1
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:16,727
(Is it broth...)

2
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:17,728
(or mixed with the sauce?)

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,057
(Deep-fried...)

4
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:20,327
(or grilled?)

5
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:22,268
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,897
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,598
(and regret)

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,708
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,607
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,777
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:43,487
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:44,918
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:50,558
This station is Mullae.

14
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:56,097
(The location that Handsome Guys are visiting today)

15
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,868
(Mullae Station)

16
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,807
(We came to Mullae-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu in April.)

17
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,178
There are still cherry blossoms in the air.

18
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:09,547
Is it finally spring?

19
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:11,608
Look how clear the sky is.

20
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:13,277
The sky is clear.

21
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,717
Yes, I was waiting for such weather.

22
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,518
That's why we're on our own this week.

23
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:21,018
- Really? - You know what?

24
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:22,888
- We're in trouble. - What's the matter?

25
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:24,228
The word has spread.

26
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:25,958
That we sponge off guests?

27
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:29,097
- I told you to be careful. - Seriously.

28
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:30,767
- They decided not to come. - We should've been careful.

29
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:32,868
- No one came as a guest. - Goodness.

30
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,798
Today, we're in...

31
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,868
- Mullae-dong, right? - Mullae-dong.

32
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:38,337
It's called Mullae-dong.

33
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,538
Don't you know this place?

34
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:42,108
I'm not familiar with Mullae-dong.

35
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,148
- Mullae? - It's very popular these days.

36
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,307
Yes, it's hip.

37
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,447
- Really? - So you know, Sang Uk.

38
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,648
Yes, it has many trendy restaurants.

39
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,087
- Are they considered vintage? - Yes.

40
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:53,558
- There are many places like that. - In the past, steel...

41
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,157
Steel?

42
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,227
Steel and industrial goods were manufactured here.

43
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:59,358
- That's right. - I see what happened here.

44
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,198
As steel factories disappeared,

45
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:04,697
they were replaced by places like cafes.

46
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,768
- Like Seongsu-dong? - Isn't it what happened?

47
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:08,637
They're similar,

48
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:11,068
but Mullae feels older than Seongsu-dong.

49
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:12,838
Things have been preserved.

50
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:15,238
The exterior and interior are completely different.

51
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:20,278
(The hip interior has a great vibe.)

52
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:23,618
There are many trendy stores and shop owners.

53
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,588
There are many cafes.

54
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,587
Artists came to this neighborhood...

55
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,328
and opened galleries.

56
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:30,958
That sounds fun.

57
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,798
So naturally, many MZers come here...

58
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,867
to go on dates.

59
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:36,868
I see.

60
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:38,368
At the same time,

61
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,998
people who make steel are still everywhere.

62
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:43,068
The vibe must be quite strange.

63
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,637
The past, the present,

64
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:48,178
- and art reside in this place. - Really?

65
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:49,808
- That sounds amazing. - Yes.

66
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,048
(And so, in Mullae...)

67
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,517
Where are we going today?

68
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:53,678
(What shall we eat in Mullae?)

69
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:57,748
(Where the old, the new, and art exist in harmony)

70
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,918
(Food that has been loved for a long time)

71
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:07,658
(New and rising food)

72
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,968
(And it's full of artistic-looking food.)

73
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,968
(Among them, what will Handsome Guys recommend in Mullae?)

74
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:20,238
I did some research on social media.

75
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:22,108
There's a famous pork bulgogi restaurant here.

76
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,548
- Pork bulgogi? - Pork bulgogi is one...

77
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:26,477
- of athletes' favorite food. - We eat a lot of it.

78
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,878
He's recommending a dish with protein.

79
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,847
It's the best menu...

80
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:32,358
with carbs, protein, and vegetables.

81
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:35,357
It's grilled on the spot, and the portion is generous.

82
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,658
And the main branch is here.

83
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,887
- Is it a chain restaurant? - Yes.

84
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:38,957
- If it's a chain... - The main branch is here.

85
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,827
- So it's better than average. - It's the best.

86
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:42,567
In my opinion, each of us will eat...

87
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,168
about three bowls of rice.

88
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,397
- It's perfect with rice. - Each of us.

89
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,967
Dong Hyun suggested pork bulgogi.

90
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,037
I love pork bulgogi.

91
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,168
(The first LMR, pork bulgogi)

92
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:50,568
What else?

93
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,067
What do you think, Sang Uk?

94
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,577
- He really sounds like an expert. - I've eaten a lot here.

95
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,747
I've eaten a lot here.

96
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,908
What did your friends usually eat here?

97
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:01,148
Japanese ramen.

98
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,588
It's very popular here.

99
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:04,218
You can't eat here without waiting.

100
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:06,257
(A ramen restaurant which is that famous?)

101
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,388
Is it that famous?

102
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:08,857
Ramen is...

103
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:09,887
- Its broth is the best. - Exactly.

104
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:11,057
(The second LMR, ramen)

105
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,157
(Today's LMR)

106
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:13,328
(Lunch Menu Recommendation)

107
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,797
(Pork bulgogi versus Japanese ramen)

108
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,868
- I made my choice. - Okay.

109
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,738
- I'll go with ramen. - What?

110
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,338
Ramen?

111
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,508
What's the reason?

112
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,368
Actually, I'm craving mazesoba.

113
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:26,978
- Mazesoba is delicious. - I'm craving mazesoba so much.

114
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,578
- Mazesoba? - Can you also get mazesoba there?

115
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:29,647
Yes.

116
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,078
I'm going to order mazesoba or tonkotsu ramen...

117
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,878
with eight slices of char siu.

118
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:37,617
That will replace the protein in pork bulgogi.

119
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:38,618
That sounds amazing.

120
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,987
Ramen wrapped in char siu sounds excellent.

121
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,687
- Char siu? - You also put dried laver on top.

122
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:43,227
- Right before it sinks, - Yes.

123
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:45,158
- you wrap the noodles with it. - That's right.

124
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,397
- Ramen sounds good. - Eight char siu slices? How insane.

125
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,898
With wood ear mushrooms and bamboo shoots.

126
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,097
Mazesoba sounds good too.

127
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,538
I want to get ramen.

128
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:54,168
- You pick ramen? - Ramen.

129
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,337
I'd like pork bulgogi.

130
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,467
- You want pork bulgogi? - Yes.

131
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,067
You recommended ramen, but you want pork bulgogi?

132
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,407
Let me explain.

133
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,537
The pork bulgogi restaurant used to be a transport cafe.

134
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,607
It means that the place has a lot of experience.

135
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:04,608
Definitely.

136
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:05,647
- Okay. - I need to go there.

137
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,147
- How about you, Yi Kyung? - Is it 2 against 2?

138
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:08,378
- Yes. - Just pick anywhere.

139
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,087
(Thinking)

140
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,817
- Ramen wrapped in char siu is good. - Let me think.

141
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:14,787
In this weather with the wind and these members...

142
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,327
(The weather, the wind, and Handsome Guys)

143
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:17,988
I'll eat pork bulgogi at the main branch.

144
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,158
- Okay. - That sounds good.

145
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,428
Since it's the main branch?

146
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,897
Dong Hyun, Sang Uk, and I will get...

147
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:25,168
pork bulgogi today.

148
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,437
Seung Ho and Tae Hyun will get ramen.

149
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,668
- Okay. - I can't wait.

150
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,367
Today, while enjoying...

151
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,708
the view of Mullae,

152
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,007
we'll go to the pork bulgogi restaurant first.

153
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,237
(The first LMR is pork bulgogi.)

154
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,238
This is great.

155
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:36,948
- This is important. - Yes.

156
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,677
- This is the best. - Have you had...

157
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:40,117
- breakfast? - No.

158
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:41,247
- And you? - I haven't eaten anything.

159
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:43,017
I did 50 burpees before coming here.

160
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,248
Burpees? You worked out.

161
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,517
The pork bulgogi will have a strong smell.

162
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:47,557
(Smiling)

163
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,158
Let's get pork bulgogi first...

164
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,757
- in Mullae-dong. Let's go. - Okay.

165
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:51,788
- Let's go. - Let's go.

166
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:53,227
- That sounds good. - Seung Ho.

167
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,128
I keep imagining what you said. It's driving me crazy.

168
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,998
I love pork bulgogi too, but...

169
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:00,938
- The weather is beautiful. - It's nice.

170
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,007
- Doesn't the sun feel nice? - There's some wind, but...

171
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,008
It's nice out.

172
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,137
Like this? It still exists.

173
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,407
- Is it a steel factory? - Isn't it still here?

174
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,107
- I see. - They're still manufacturing it.

175
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:12,007
They roll the steel or cut it.

176
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,578
They weld as well.

177
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:16,987
- There's a row of factories. - Right. It's a steel shop.

178
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:18,488
(When you follow the old steel factory street)

179
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:20,258
What kind of place is it?

180
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:21,787
- Something like this. - What's this?

181
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:22,888
This is exactly what I mean.

182
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:23,928
Right.

183
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,058
That's surprising.

184
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:26,828
As I said, they're side by side.

185
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,998
The exterior hasn't changed, but the inside turned into a cafe.

186
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:30,268
- Right? - Yes.

187
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,638
It's so unexpected that they go well together.

188
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,937
It has a nice vibe.

189
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,368
It's so fascinating here.

190
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,967
A lounge cafe, a lamb skewer restaurant.

191
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,207
Next to it, it says, "Cutting Metal."

192
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,538
- "Metal." - Look, there is another one.

193
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,108
How did it turn out like this?

194
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:44,407
Take a look here.

195
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:45,848
- Look at this. - "Mullae Artist Village?"

196
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,777
(A sign that introduces Mullae Artist Village)

197
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,018
It was an ironwork complex since the 1960s.

198
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,317
In the 2000s, artists...

199
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:56,088
who needed work space moved here.

200
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:59,898
They created workroom and galleries next to steel factories.

201
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,928
Popular shops and restaurants probably moved in after that.

202
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,068
(Understanding Mullae-dong)

203
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,168
(Another charm in Mullae)

204
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,468
Let's start searching for hidden artworks.

205
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,068
That sounds very romantic.

206
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,078
(I found one.)

207
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:18,208
(From time to time, you find artworks while walking in Mullae.)

208
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:23,747
This sculpture.

209
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:24,787
- Can you stand in the front? - Take a photo.

210
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:25,987
This looks amazing.

211
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,417
It's a welding helmet.

212
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:28,917
(A big welding helmet sculpture in the middle of the street)

213
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,288
- What a smart idea. - It looks cool.

214
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:33,398
(Fascinated)

215
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:35,558
It's an artwork.

216
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:37,067
It's used while welding.

217
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,068
- Right. - That's hip.

218
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,538
It's used by welders.

219
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,337
I like the vibe in Mullae.

220
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,568
- The vibe in Mullae. - It's really nice.

221
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,708
There's a good vibe on every street.

222
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:48,908
- Is this the place? - That's it.

223
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,978
- This is the place. - Is it?

224
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,377
- It looks like a transport cafe. - It's the main branch.

225
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:55,418
(It's marked as the main branch which guarantees good food.)

226
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,447
- Is it open 24 hours? - It's a real transport cafe.

227
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,458
I'm hungry.

228
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,758
- This restaurant looks amazing. - Shall we go in?

229
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,858
Incredible.

230
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,227
- It looks amazing. - Pork bulgogi? What a great vibe.

231
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,428
(Let's go to the amazing pork bulgogi restaurant.)

232
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,598
(The center of Mullae, the intersection)

233
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,098
(Next to it, there's one restaurant.)

234
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,408
(The place welcomes you with the Mullae vibe.)

235
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:21,878
(Meat grilled with the master artisan's spirit)

236
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,547
(Put it on some lettuce...)

237
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,818
(and eat it as a wrap.)

238
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,958
(Day and night)

239
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:37,087
It's a great place for a simple lunch.

240
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:40,697
I've been coming here for eight years.

241
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:43,027
(From office workers to frequent customers of 8 years)

242
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:46,238
(Ironworkers and taxi drivers)

243
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:50,538
(Everyone's comfort food)

244
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,908
(LMR 1, pork bulgogi)

245
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:58,508
Gosh, there's mother-of-pearl in the back.

246
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,648
We used to have it at my house.

247
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,618
- You did? - Yes.

248
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,858
- We had it. - Rich families used to have it.

249
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:10,528
Isn't this fancier? I heard that mother-of-pearl was expensive.

250
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:12,897
Water? Thank you.

251
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:14,458
- Hello. - Hello.

252
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,267
Sir, I heard that this was...

253
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,967
the main branch. How long has it been?

254
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:23,007
We've been running this restaurant for 12 years.

255
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,408
My parents has been running it since 1993.

256
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:28,508
- In 1993? - It's been about 32 years.

257
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,747
Wasn't it originally a transport cafe?

258
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,778
Yes.

259
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:35,547
You started it as a transport cafe, but before that,

260
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,317
wasn't it another steel factory? I can tell from the structure.

261
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:39,957
Yes, that steel up there is...

262
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,558
- about 50 years old. - Really?

263
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:46,527
(It started off as a transport cafe of 33m².)

264
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,328
A steel factory was...

265
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,267
turned into a transport cafe.

266
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:51,568
At first, we wanted to get rid of it.

267
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:55,197
However, it's as old as a 50-year-old...

268
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,408
- Right. - person.

269
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:59,838
It'd be like removing time you spent here.

270
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,937
What about this? Can we open it?

271
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:03,447
We got it from the trash.

272
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,547
- Really? - This?

273
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:05,877
But this is very expensive.

274
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:09,688
In the beginning, we had nothing to decorate the restaurant.

275
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:13,258
My brother-in-law found it on the street.

276
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,727
He had the idea of putting up the doors on the wall.

277
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:19,228
Later on, this material became...

278
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,657
quite famous.

279
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:23,197
- It came into light. - This is very expensive now.

280
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,367
Yes, it costs up to thousands of dollars.

281
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,738
Antiques are priceless these days.

282
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,507
Mother-of-pearl was expensive back in your day...

283
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,808
during the Imjin War.

284
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:34,338
It was expensive.

285
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,407
- Back in his day. - Seriously.

286
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,508
It was also expensive back then.

287
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:39,948
Only the three of us will eat.

288
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,748
We'd like 2 special and 1 regular.

289
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:45,117
- Why don't we start with these? - Would that be enough?

290
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,617
- You can always order more meat. - Exactly.

291
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,957
Then let's get three special.

292
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,387
Instead of ordering more meat later? Three special?

293
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,897
There is no self-control, is there?

294
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:54,927
I'm controlling myself by ordering three special.

295
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:56,797
Okay, three special, please.

296
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,698
- All right. - Three special. Thank you.

297
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:02,837
Here's the problem. I'm trying to control myself,

298
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,737
but seeing Seung Ho eat ramen will drive me crazy.

299
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,908
I'm just going to be myself.

300
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:10,877
Why do I get carried away...

301
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,547
- Your stomach got bigger. - and end up eating?

302
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,548
(Tae Hyun shares some news.)

303
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,048
No one told me to eat a lot,

304
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,248
- but I beg for food. - Hand me your chopsticks.

305
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,088
Seriously.

306
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,788
- Without making a fuss? - What about you, Seung Ho?

307
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:22,658
What are you talking about?

308
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,157
I won't take yours.

309
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,098
- Don't cross the line. - Okay, I won't take yours.

310
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,058
- "Don't cross the line?" - He misunderstood.

311
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,398
I thought that he wasn't going to eat.

312
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,437
- I saw the meat on the grill. - Here it is.

313
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:35,767
(The side dishes are served first.)

314
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,537
Gosh, I'm hungry. Look at the garlic.

315
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:38,807
Yes, these are the basic side dishes.

316
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,207
(Simple side dishes that are perfect with pork bulgogi)

317
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,037
This garlic with some meat...

318
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,708
(Garlic and ssamjang are a must when eating meat.)

319
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,677
(Doenjang soup with napa cabbage that never fails)

320
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,147
This is perfect.

321
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,587
(Soon, pork bulgogi is served.)

322
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:52,047
This is what it looks like.

323
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,088
All right.

324
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:59,158
(Marinated meat according to their secret recipe)

325
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:02,098
(After grilling it once roughly)

326
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,668
(When the order comes it, it goes on the grill over charcoal.)

327
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:10,538
(1st heating)

328
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,778
(Massaging it with burning fire)

329
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,188
(Here's a pork bulgogi meal.)

330
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,618
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

331
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,788
Do you have any wet wipes?

332
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,728
You have to wash your hands at our restaurant.

333
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,697
Is there a sink in the restaurant?

334
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:33,758
Is there? Goodness.

335
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:35,698
I'll be back.

336
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,367
- It's because... - We should go too.

337
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:38,627
We have to wash hands before eating pork bulgogi.

338
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,797
- I should go too. - Gosh, this is fascinating.

339
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:41,897
(Why is Seung Ho going?)

340
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:44,268
I see. There it is.

341
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:46,578
Pork bulgogi is always eaten as wraps.

342
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,538
- Right. - This is very...

343
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:50,448
It's unusual to find a sink here.

344
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:54,948
Sir, is there a sink...

345
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:58,347
- for ironworkers who come here? - Exactly.

346
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:02,057
Also, taxi drivers grab their steering wheel.

347
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,257
It's better than using wet wipes.

348
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,087
Is there usually a sink at a transport cafe?

349
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:06,628
Yes, most of them do.

350
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,497
(Where you can feel the restaurant's consideration)

351
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,768
I see.

352
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,068
- This is amazing. - Washing hands is better.

353
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,468
Why did Seung Ho go there?

354
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,107
Wait, Seung Ho is on our team. Or is it Sang Uk?

355
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:21,208
Who is on our team?

356
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:23,447
Is it Sang Uk? Who is on our team?

357
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,008
- Sang Uk. - Sang Uk is on our team.

358
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,148
It looks like Seung Ho is on our team.

359
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:28,378
Why did you go there?

360
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:31,347
Seriously.

361
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,388
(Dong Hyun, being clean is important.)

362
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,117
(They start eating.)

363
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:35,218
Thank you for the food.

364
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,488
- Enjoy. - Enjoy your food.

365
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,158
Tae Hyun, look at this.

366
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:44,067
It's well cooked over the fire.

367
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:46,838
The fat is proportional to the meat.

368
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,568
- This is the tasty part. - The color looks incredible.

369
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:53,407
(The taste makes his heart flutter.)

370
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:56,077
(Yi Kyung stuffs his mouth with two pieces.)

371
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,048
- It's so good. - I should make a wrap.

372
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,047
You don't taste the smoke in the beginning.

373
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,078
It keeps increasing.

374
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,518
It tastes excellent. It's nice and greasy.

375
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:04,918
(3 pieces of meat)

376
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:06,388
Three pieces?

377
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,118
(Seasoned green onions)

378
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:09,758
(Garlic)

379
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,328
(Ssamjang)

380
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,797
You put some garlic and seasoned green onions so neatly.

381
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:16,928
(Eating the wrap neatly)

382
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,038
It's so delicious.

383
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:26,438
(Dong Hyun also makes a wrap with his clean hands.)

384
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,908
This is really...

385
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,908
coated with soy sauce.

386
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,147
Isn't it nice and sweet?

387
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:37,788
(Pork bulgogi coated with sweet soy sauce marinade)

388
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,518
Here's what I think. You should grab it like this.

389
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,457
Do this.

390
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,457
(Yi Kyung's wrap making on live)

391
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,628
Add a clove of garlic.

392
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:48,858
Put some ssamjang carelessly.

393
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,168
That looks good.

394
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,997
(Eating it all in one go)

395
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,098
That's it.

396
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:58,438
As you said, it tastes better the more you chew it.

397
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:01,808
There's a nice mix of fat and meat.

398
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:02,907
Look at this.

399
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:03,977
(Their eyes are fixed on it.)

400
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,348
To be honest, I regret it a little.

401
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,018
(Laughing)

402
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,147
It hasn't been 20 minutes since they started eating.

403
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,158
This isn't what I wanted a moment ago.

404
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:16,228
I wanted ramen more than this.

405
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,888
Washing your hands increased...

406
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,227
- your appetite. - I'm always ready.

407
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:23,668
Gosh, the white radish salad.

408
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,627
The meat would be more delicious with that.

409
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:26,898
It's nice and sour.

410
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,007
The white radish salad gives a kick to it.

411
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,008
- Seriously. - It'll be gone quickly.

412
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,037
(Adding white radish salad to the pork bulgogi)

413
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,138
It's game over.

414
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:38,448
(One wrap)

415
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,477
(Washing off the palate with some soup)

416
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,218
- It's tasty. - This is nice.

417
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,517
Doesn't it go very well with the soup?

418
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,688
The soup is perfect.

419
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,787
Eating soup after each wrap...

420
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,298
washes the palate and keeps you eating.

421
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:58,467
The food explains why they've been running...

422
00:15:58,468 --> 00:15:59,898
the restaurant for over 30 years.

423
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,098
They have experience.

424
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,208
At this rate, they would order more meat.

425
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:06,408
If you want, order more in advance.

426
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,307
- Ma'am. - Yes?

427
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,247
Can we get three more orders of meat...

428
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:11,777
and a bowl of rice?

429
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,778
- What for? - You get unlimited rice refills.

430
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,147
- Unlimited? - Really?

431
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,218
Really?

432
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,288
(Quietly, Seung Ho...)

433
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,818
(He takes the empty white radish salad dish.)

434
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:25,128
(He goes off somewhere.)

435
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:29,028
Seung Ho is bringing us more white radish salad.

436
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:30,528
Goodness.

437
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:31,968
(He's the service king in this area.)

438
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,567
Gosh, thank you.

439
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:34,597
(A refill of white radish salad)

440
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,438
Seung Ho, you won five brownie points.

441
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:37,968
And you know what?

442
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:40,807
To avoid interfering with your eating,

443
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,108
I didn't mention a word about the quiz.

444
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,448
Don't try to sweet-talk.

445
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:48,277
- Don't try to sweet-talk. - You should be proud of me.

446
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,418
Proud of you?

447
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:51,718
I'm waiting patiently.

448
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:53,118
Wait.

449
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:56,558
- Here's more pork bulgogi. - Thank you.

450
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:58,557
This is enough.

451
00:16:58,558 --> 00:16:59,728
Thank you.

452
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:02,198
We should eat it when it's hot.

453
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,698
I can't stand this. I'll wash my hands.

454
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:08,098
(Tae Hyun can't resist and gets ready to eat.)

455
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,068
Look, this is the best part.

456
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,138
- That's it. - Right.

457
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:13,937
This looks insane.

458
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,107
(Moving the hands carefully to make a wrap)

459
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,147
- Garlic is a must. - Definitely.

460
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,308
(Moving the hands carefully to make a wrap)

461
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:20,148
It's hot.

462
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:21,647
(Their wrap eating resumes.)

463
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:22,878
You have to eat it with this.

464
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,087
It's the best pork bulgogi...

465
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,488
- that I had recently. - Really?

466
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,797
(Tae Hyun returns after washing his hands.)

467
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:34,998
- Okay. - Okay.

468
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:36,598
You know what's interesting?

469
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,998
When I eat wraps,

470
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:40,737
I prefer the wrap to be slightly open.

471
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:43,638
I like to taste the meat first.

472
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,468
- With the meat on top? - Like this.

473
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:47,578
Like this.

474
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:50,408
It's very good.

475
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,178
Who asked?

476
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,417
- Yes? - When Dong Hyun eats wraps...

477
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:54,418
Yes?

478
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,047
- When Dong Hyun eats wraps... - Yes?

479
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,017
(Ma'am?)

480
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,057
(She answered Seung Ho when he raised his hand.)

481
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,517
Gosh, thank you.

482
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,728
I was just joking.

483
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,228
I was trying to make fun of Dong Hyun.

484
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:11,828
(Despite Seung Ho's attack, )

485
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:15,568
(their pork bulgogi eating isn't affected.)

486
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,638
(They look dejected.)

487
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:20,208
Give us the quiz.

488
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,178
The quiz for the freeloaders.

489
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,047
- You know initial letter quiz? - Initial letter quiz.

490
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:29,418
Say 5 words that start with given letters within 5 seconds.

491
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,218
- Five within five seconds? - Yes.

492
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:33,588
The initial letters are...

493
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:34,958
O and J.

494
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:44,668
- I got it. - Go ahead.

495
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,337
Chair, etiquette,

496
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,197
citron, will, and woman.

497
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:50,407
Correct.

498
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,068
- Will and woman. - Correct.

499
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,908
(Seung Ho wins.)

500
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:56,378
- You did it in 1 go? - In 1 go.

501
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,608
That was concentration.

502
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,647
He survived.

503
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,718
You washed your hands.

504
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,518
That was a lot of concentration.

505
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,388
Try it with this.

506
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,128
- I'm sorry, Tae Hyun. - Don't be.

507
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:13,498
Strong will makes all the difference.

508
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:16,397
- Desperation makes it possible. - Will.

509
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,927
(He won pork bulgogi with his will.)

510
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:18,968
Definitely.

511
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:25,808
(The appetite he held back explodes.)

512
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,948
Everything is excellent.

513
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,578
It's seasoned perfectly.

514
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,488
- I agree. - It's neither salty nor bland.

515
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:39,287
Unless someone stops you,

516
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,917
- you can't stop eating it. - Have some.

517
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,158
(Is that so?)

518
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:43,528
Stop.

519
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,088
No.

520
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:46,928
Seriously.

521
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,028
It's impossible to stop eating it.

522
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:51,798
Dong Hyun, you have something on here.

523
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,337
(He's not aware of it yet.)

524
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:55,498
- Right here. - What?

525
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:58,138
- Do I have something on me? - The other side.

526
00:19:58,538 --> 00:19:59,838
- What could it be? - It's off.

527
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:01,978
It's normal. You've been eating like this.

528
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:04,807
- You've been eating like this. - Tae Hyun.

529
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:07,018
- I didn't eat like that. - When dogs eat...

530
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:09,247
(Copy and paste)

531
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:10,317
It's normal to have food...

532
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,787
- all over your face. - Tae Hyun.

533
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,317
You're saying that because you want to eat.

534
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,558
- You can't control yourself either. - Right.

535
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,527
What a great meal. I'm done.

536
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,657
(The meal is over.)

537
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,057
You guys ate everything today.

538
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:24,228
(Clean)

539
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,268
Pork bulgogi in Mullae. Give us the Quiz for the Bill.

540
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,937
A Korean American wrote about how to eat like a local...

541
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:36,408
at a Korean restaurant on his blog, and it became the talk of the town.

542
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,107
He wrote, "Instead of waiting to be seated,"

543
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:42,118
"take a seat at any table."

544
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:46,147
"To call the server, either press the call button..."

545
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,317
- "or say, 'Excuse me, ma'am'." - I know it.

546
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:50,558
I know it.

547
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:55,958
He also said that this must be done after making an order.

548
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,067
- What is this? - After making an order?

549
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,798
- Or after the meal? - After making an order.

550
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,968
(Oh, right.)

551
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,207
- I have an answer. - What?

552
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,208
- I think I know. - I have one too.

553
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,977
(What kind of gesture is it?)

554
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,107
- What's that? - To serve the food quickly?

555
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,178
Quickly.

556
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,248
I thought of setting the table with chopsticks and spoons.

557
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:14,417
- No way. - After making your order...

558
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:16,118
- The utensils are here. - No.

559
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,687
This is something funny.

560
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:20,187
It's something that Koreans would relate to.

561
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:22,457
- As he said, "Please serve fast." - Please serve quickly.

562
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,328
- "When will it be served?" - As soon as you order?

563
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:25,557
- Or... - I mean,

564
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,397
after making your order,

565
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:28,558
you say, "Please serve quickly."

566
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:30,328
Or...

567
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,227
What did we do after making the order?

568
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,697
- Us? - What do we do these days?

569
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,598
- After the order... - "When is the food coming?"

570
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:36,737
After ordering,

571
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:37,908
we ask for the quiz.

572
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,567
(A smooth maneuver to interfere)

573
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:40,708
That's it.

574
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:42,108
That's the answer.

575
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,207
How about this?

576
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,378
"Please give me a lot."

577
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,847
"Please give me a lot."

578
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,277
- That's affectionate. - "Can I get free beverage?"

579
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,378
That sounds affectionate.

580
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,918
After making the order...

581
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:52,717
After ordering your food...

582
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,257
"Thank you. Enjoy your food?"

583
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,888
(Nothing comes to mind.)

584
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:57,458
- Quickly. - After making the order...

585
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:58,888
We usually say, "Quickly."

586
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:01,258
I have a strong feeling about this.

587
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:02,697
I usually don't say this,

588
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,298
- but I'm very convinced. - Right.

589
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:06,898
Only athletes would ask for a lot of food.

590
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:08,368
Okay, if you agree, go for it.

591
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:09,968
I'll just win the individual game.

592
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,868
You're so confident about the individual game.

593
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:14,477
Yi Kyung didn't lose once.

594
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,577
I never lost individual games.

595
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,108
- You're right. - Give it a try.

596
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,177
- We got it. Say it, Sang Uk. - Show us, Sang Uk.

597
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:20,378
- You're right. - We got it.

598
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,117
Something like, "When is the food coming?"

599
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:25,648
- "How long will it take?" - "Please serve me quickly."

600
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,887
- Urging. - An urging comment.

601
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,988
- An urging comment. - That's right.

602
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,239
Something like, "When is the food coming?"

603
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,740
- "How long will it take?" - "Please serve me quickly."

604
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,869
- Urging. - An urging comment.

605
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,440
- An urging comment. - That's right.

606
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
(Anticipating a little)

607
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,810
Right? Yes.

608
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,210
- Could it be? - Right?

609
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,820
- They all mean the same. - Could it be?

610
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,750
- An urging comment. - That's right.

611
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,420
That's incorrect.

612
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,590
The answer must be asking for a lot of food.

613
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,520
- "Please give me a lot?" - Is it an individual game now?

614
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,430
- Wait. What is it? - Is it an individual game now?

615
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,929
I got it.

616
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,999
- "Please give me a lot." - That was my answer.

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,029
"Please give me a lot?"

618
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,570
(I was going to say that.)

619
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,900
- Incorrect. - Go ahead, Dong Hyun.

620
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,340
Isn't that the answer?

621
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,810
- I got it. - Yes?

622
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,340
Setting the table with chopsticks.

623
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,710
- It's not totally correct. - What?

624
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,510
- It must be similar to the answer. - Incorrect.

625
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,580
I know the exact answer.

626
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,850
(Seung Ho figured it out from the wrong answers.)

627
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,219
(Something is missing in Dong Hyun's answer.)

628
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,519
(In that case...)

629
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,990
I got it.

630
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,260
Putting chopsticks and spoon on a napkin.

631
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,389
- Correct. - Okay!

632
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,459
This is it.

633
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,530
- Goodness. - I said that from the beginning,

634
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,799
- but you disagreed. - I know.

635
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
I was...

636
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,730
going to do that today.

637
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,239
I told you that I watch a lot of YouTubers who travel.

638
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
They're intrigued by how we put a napkin under eating utensils.

639
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,609
- They find it interesting. - That's understandable.

640
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,179
(Putting spoons and chopsticks on a napkin)

641
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,280
(A unique part of Korean culture)

642
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,320
Thank you for the food again today.

643
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,020
He's the strongest player in individual games.

644
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,489
- Thank you again. - He's the strongest player.

645
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,820
You should do mixed martial arts.

646
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,359
You're good at 1-on-1 games.

647
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
He seems invincible.

648
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,729
This is more about the sense of pride than the amount.

649
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,500
- Of course. The start. - You both look...

650
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,069
very confident.

651
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,430
- I'm 100 percent sure. - That's...

652
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,969
- I'm 100 percent sure. - Both of you...

653
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,299
Can you be more than 100 percent sure?

654
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,369
- No. - No?

655
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,039
They look down at each other.

656
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,739
- They don't think they'll lose. - Neither of them.

657
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,809
Neither of them.

658
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,980
- It's strange. - Isn't that what you think?

659
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,050
- Give us the question. - Here we go.

660
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,520
Unlike ordinary restaurants, transport cafes used to provide...

661
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,450
a special service.

662
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,720
They sold items like gloves for drivers,

663
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,729
exchanged coins,

664
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,730
and provided this at a low price.

665
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,330
- At a low price? - What did they provide?

666
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,629
I got it.

667
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,670
(I got it.)

668
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,400
Car wash.

669
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,740
That sounds reasonable.

670
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,070
- Gosh. - That sounds reasonable.

671
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,340
While the drivers ate, their cars were washed.

672
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,450
Correct.

673
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,249
Correct.

674
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,820
(Kim Dong Hyun made it!)

675
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,920
(Celebrating their victory)

676
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,589
Car wash.

677
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,259
I'll wash your car while you eat.

678
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,289
(Expressing the joy of victory with his entire body)

679
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,329
(Oh Sang Uk pays the bill for pork bulgogi.)

680
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,630
I thought that it was coffee.

681
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,069
- Car wash. - I'm good at 1-on-1 games.

682
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,129
A moment ago, it was 3 against 1.

683
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,900
I never lost 1-on-1 games.

684
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,339
(Annoying him)

685
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
One-on-one.

686
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
Whenever you lose to Dong Hyun,

687
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,040
you can't forget it until you go to bed the next day.

688
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,580
- His way of teasing you. - You can't stop thinking about it.

689
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,180
(Here you go!)

690
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,450
(A gold medalist in acting annoying)

691
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,420
Take this bill.

692
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,589
This isn't about money.

693
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,629
(Feeling furious)

694
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,999
Right. It has nothing to do with paying.

695
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,260
Not at all.

696
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,069
Okay.

697
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,930
Thank you. The total is 63 dollars.

698
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,339
(Total: 63 dollars)

699
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,510
Thank you.

700
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,110
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

701
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,609
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you so much.

702
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,079
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

703
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,150
- Bye. - That was amazing.

704
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,579
Thank you, Sang Uk.

705
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,049
I'm so full.

706
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,350
This is incredible.

707
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,060
(Sneezing)

708
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,029
Does the sun make you sneeze too?

709
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,229
- Yes. - Really?

710
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,859
Who doesn't sneeze in the sun?

711
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,929
- Me. - I don't.

712
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,329
I heard that there was a 50 percent chance.

713
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,769
- Fifty percent. - How can the sun make you sneeze?

714
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,599
No, the chances are much less.

715
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,269
(ACHOO syndrome is sneezing in response to sudden bright lights.)

716
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,640
Is it being allergic to the sun?

717
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,770
Which way should we go?

718
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,680
What is it?

719
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
- Gosh, what is it? - Are we going in an alley?

720
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,380
(Handsome Guys entered the alley.)

721
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,350
- Right. - This looks like Kerning City.

722
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,219
- Oh, my. - "Kerning City?"

723
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,319
(Kerning City is an imaginary city from a video game...)

724
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
How is it possible...

725
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:45,889
(that's popular among MZers.)

726
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,160
Is it from a video game?

727
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,359
- Yes, a video game. - A video game.

728
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,459
(An alley that would appear in a video game)

729
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,529
- There are back doors... - The black bundle.

730
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,760
- since they are hanoks. - The black bundle.

731
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,100
- Look at the briquette. - Why is there so much?

732
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,299
- The amount is... - Seriously.

733
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
It's amazing.

734
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:00,469
(Deep into the mysterious alley in Mullae-dong)

735
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,639
I like alleys like this.

736
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,139
The ramen restaurant is hidden in a place like this.

737
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,179
(They're on their way to the hidden ramen restaurant.)

738
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
How did we even find it?

739
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,750
I'm good at finding it.

740
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,909
(Exclaiming)

741
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,980
(Surprised)

742
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,989
(Surprised)

743
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,049
What's the matter?

744
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,720
(Everyone stops.)

745
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
What?

746
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,390
This is where we shot a scene in "Marry My Husband."

747
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,189
- What? - We shot a scene...

748
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,360
- in "Marry My Husband." - Really?

749
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,930
Right here.

750
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,370
("Marry My Husband" starring Yi Kyung)

751
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
(The alley where it was shot)

752
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,480
It was shot here.

753
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,939
Yes, it's a popular spot for shooting dramas.

754
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,949
I see.

755
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,249
This place has...

756
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,320
- many pretty alleys like this. - I was so surprised just now.

757
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,820
It does look pretty.

758
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,150
There are so many tasty restaurants on every alley.

759
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,319
What? This is the place.

760
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,390
What's this?

761
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,920
This looks amazing.

762
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,689
- Shall we go inside? - Let's go.

763
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,529
(The place where Handsome Guys are visiting)

764
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,030
- It looks amazing. - Hello.

765
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,599
(Awarded Blue Ribbons 5 years in a row)

766
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,640
(The second LMR in Mullae-dong)

767
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,770
(Ramen)

768
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,539
(Although it's hidden at the end of an alley, )

769
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,140
(it's well-known among gourmets.)

770
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,750
(The restaurant is full every day.)

771
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,280
I came here because I heard that it was a famous place.

772
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,090
The broth is very rich and heavy.

773
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,820
This is my second time eating it.

774
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,560
It's savory without being heavy. It's very delicious.

775
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,059
The taste can be strong.

776
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,429
It gets more and more flavorful.

777
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,400
So I keep eating it.

778
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,270
Do you recommend it for lunch?

779
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,370
Yes, I do.

780
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,470
- I definitely recommend it. - Me too.

781
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,440
(Handsome Guys will verify now.)

782
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,610
- Welcome. - Hello.

783
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,650
(Welcome)

784
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,850
Hello.

785
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,279
You know so many nice places.

786
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
(LMR 2, Ramen)

787
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,490
- You won't be eating. - Right.

788
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,719
This place isn't ordinary.

789
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,459
- The alley is... - This looks incredible.

790
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,629
Sir.

791
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,900
How did you end up running a business here?

792
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,530
My original occupation wasn't a cook.

793
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,970
- Then... - I'm...

794
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,930
a photographer.

795
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,200
- Are you a photographer? - Yes.

796
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,569
Are you just running the restaurant now?

797
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,039
Yes, the work is too busy.

798
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
- Is it in full swing? - Yes.

799
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:20,080
- I'm firm about food. - Gosh.

800
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,249
That's impressive.

801
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,649
Eight years ago,

802
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,250
good ramen restaurants in Korea were rare.

803
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,250
So I went to study in Japan.

804
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,590
Simply for ramen?

805
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,219
In Korea, there's no gyokai ramen.

806
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,360
- "Gyokai?" - Gyokai and tonkotsu.

807
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,260
Gyokai ramen is made with seafood.

808
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,730
Chicken broth, pork broth, and seafood broth are separate.

809
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,730
- I blend these two. - What?

810
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,240
- Is it a mix? - Yes.

811
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,100
It's called double soup.

812
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,610
It's made by mixing the two.

813
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,810
(Fascinated)

814
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:53,510
I'd say that it's more like soup than broth.

815
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,179
Then it must be very gooey.

816
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,649
- Is it thick? - Yes.

817
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,750
- It's thick and gooey. - Really?

818
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,589
- I can't imagine it. - Let me tell you this.

819
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,420
I was a mixed martial artist in Japan.

820
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,790
In which country did you not do mixed martial arts?

821
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,789
I was an international athlete,

822
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,029
so I've been to many places.

823
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,159
I've had ramen in Japan.

824
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,600
Suddenly, I got curious.

825
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,670
- You'll stay being curious. - Will I?

826
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,500
If I get a chance, I'd like to try it.

827
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,969
When you come back next time...

828
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,010
(Try it next time.)

829
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,510
How could you be discouraging like them?

830
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,840
After the shoot...

831
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,610
Gyokai tonkotsu ramen has milky broth.

832
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,949
Milky broth? And...

833
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,620
Torishio ramen has clear broth.

834
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,350
- Is it made with seafood? - Yes.

835
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,050
He knows a lot.

836
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,720
Behind him, the thin noodles are for ramen.

837
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,230
- Is mazesoba at the bottom? - Yes.

838
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,889
You're an expert.

839
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,100
- I love ramen so much. - You're an expert.

840
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,960
Then hurry up and order.

841
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,400
Sir.

842
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,129
Could we get one gyokai tonkotsu ramen,

843
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,170
one Torishio ramen,

844
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,540
- and one mazesoba, please. - Okay.

845
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,970
Two slices of char siu for tonkotsu ramen.

846
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,610
- One slice for Torishio ramen. - Okay.

847
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,149
Six slices and three slices.

848
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,209
(That many?)

849
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,379
There are other ingredients in the ramen anyway.

850
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,719
(The ramen expert's ordering method is different.)

851
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,690
- I'll prepare those now. - Yes, please.

852
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,749
Sir,

853
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,320
are you warming up the bowls?

854
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,430
Yes, to maintain the right temperature,

855
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,930
I always keep the bowls warm.

856
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,960
To keep the bowls warm?

857
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,970
To keep them at the right temperature for the food.

858
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
- It's a whisk. - What's that?

859
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,300
(This is the double soup blending with a whisk.)

860
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,470
Does it really make the broth thick?

861
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,239
It makes the broth creamier.

862
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,539
This is fascinating. I've never seen this before.

863
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,580
Oh, my.

864
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,509
The whisk is so fascinating.

865
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,050
Since it's an open kitchen, they must put in more care.

866
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,879
(Cook the noodles until they become plump.)

867
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,990
It's like watching YouTube.

868
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,589
(Gyokai tonkotsu is taking its shape.)

869
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,859
Tae Hyun, that's char siu.

870
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,119
Yes, that's...

871
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,629
I've never seen such big slices of char siu.

872
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,829
- Why... - As they ordered more...

873
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,930
That's...

874
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,930
Char siu is cured for a week.

875
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,600
After grilling it, it's aged for about three days.

876
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,040
Aged meat is your favorite.

877
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,710
So you make everything from scratch.

878
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,939
That's mazesoba.

879
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,439
I've never had it before.

880
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,840
She's putting on the egg yolk.

881
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,410
You're an expert.

882
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,180
The food is served quickly.

883
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,719
- By the way... - Here's your tonkotsu ramen.

884
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,519
- Thank you. It's tonkotsu. - What?

885
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,949
- I've never seen such a thing. - Tonkotsu.

886
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,920
- The ramen looks incredible. - Look at tonkotsu ramen.

887
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,420
I've never seen such a thing.

888
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,830
(Gyokai tonkotsu with 6 slices of char siu)

889
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,369
Here's your mazesoba.

890
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,499
Can I take a look at the broth?

891
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,229
Mazesoba looks really amazing.

892
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,799
- Goodness. - This is insane.

893
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,870
I added three slices of char siu for free.

894
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,670
Thank you.

895
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,279
Usually, I don't take photos of food,

896
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,649
but this is phenomenal.

897
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,650
How is this possible?

898
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:44,119
I didn't order extra char siu...

899
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,919
- expecting it to look like this. - How is this possible?

900
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,819
I was very full. It's hard to believe.

901
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,919
I don't feel full anymore.

902
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
Now I'm hungry again.

903
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,389
(The ramen beginner who is smacking his lips)

904
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,859
It's hard to believe.

905
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,460
You know why I'm not digging in right away?

906
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,999
That's the clear broth.

907
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,929
- I want to try that first. - First?

908
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,970
Okay.

909
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,669
The brown things in the ramen are delicious.

910
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,940
This is Torishio ramen.

911
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,469
- Oh, my. - Look at the chicken breast.

912
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,570
The meat is hanging on the edge in every dish.

913
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,509
(Torishio with 3 more slices of char siu)

914
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,609
This is bacon.

915
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,550
The rest is pork shoulder char siu.

916
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,379
Let's start, Tae Hyun. I'll dip it in the broth.

917
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,789
- It's like clear broth... - I just want to taste the broth.

918
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,790
Gosh, this is...

919
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,250
This is...

920
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,459
I've never had ramen like this.

921
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I know.

922
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,830
(Trying the broth first)

923
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,289
What is this?

924
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,930
This is no ramen.

925
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,270
(Dwelling on it)

926
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
(Slurping)

927
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,240
Wait, let me taste it again.

928
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,540
What does it remind you of?

929
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,379
Spicy chicken soup?

930
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,709
Chicken gomtang from last week?

931
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,849
Chicken gomtang from that restaurant?

932
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,619
- Sir, is Torishio... - Chicken bone broth.

933
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,680
Chicken bone broth.

934
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't know how to describe it.

935
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,819
There's a flavorful taste.

936
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,489
- Is it citron? - I'm good at recognizing it.

937
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,490
- I'm even better. - What is it?
I'm very good at it.

938
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,400
- I'm an expert. - No, there's no citron in it.

939
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,799
Then what is it?

940
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,059
I'm really good at recognizing.

941
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,399
Shall I try some broth?

942
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,799
- No, that's not necessary. - Just the broth.

943
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,169
We'll try to figure it out first.

944
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,370
- Okay. - Give us a chance.

945
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,439
I'm very good at recognizing tastes.

946
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Look at the noodles.

947
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:16,540
These noodles are...

948
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,610
(After blowing on them, )

949
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,080
(he devours them directly.)

950
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,550
(Humming in surprise)

951
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,720
What is it?

952
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,030
- This is frustrating. - It's really frustrating.

953
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,829
- Can you tell us? - Please tell us.

954
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,629
It's hard to describe.

955
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,730
It tastes so good.

956
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,740
Among all the ramen with clear broth that I've tried,

957
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,040
this is absolutely the best.

958
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,870
How so? What is it like?

959
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,540
It's hard to tell from looking at it.

960
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,340
Can I let them taste the broth?

961
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,509
It's up to you.

962
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,750
- I won't eat anything else. - Yi Kyung.

963
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,380
Taste it and savor it until the end.

964
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,319
(Find the secret to the broth.)

965
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,389
It's not that hot.

966
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,390
(Find the secret to the broth.)

967
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,060
- Isn't there an aftertaste? - What?

968
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,259
This is for Dong Hyun.

969
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,529
I need to scoop it myself.

970
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,930
- There should be depth... - It's dried bonito flakes.

971
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,230
- Dried bonito flakes? - That's correct.

972
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:13,330
Right? I'm correct.

973
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,129
- Okay. - The taste of dried bonito flakes?

974
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,200
Come, Dong Hyun.

975
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,669
(Dong Hyun finally gets a bite.)

976
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,670
(Exclaiming)

977
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,239
- It's subtle. - Isn't there an aftertaste?

978
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
You can taste it.

979
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,880
- At the end... - You taste the dried bonito flakes.

980
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,039
- Isn't there... - You can take it.

981
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,650
A spicy kick to it?

982
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,950
This is nice.

983
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,450
(Flavor from dried bonito flakes)

984
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,089
(Spiciness is added with red peppers.)

985
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,249
- Try some of this. - I just did.

986
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
It's so good.

987
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,389
I tried it too.

988
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,390
This chicken... Isn't it chicken?

989
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,360
- It's chicken breast. - That's right.

990
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,530
(Without paying attention, he eats the chicken breast.)

991
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,029
(How does it taste?)

992
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,029
The chicken breast melted in my mouth.

993
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,039
Right.

994
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,570
- Isn't it normally dry? - Isn't it dry?

995
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,540
I know because I've had chicken breast for 30 years.

996
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,480
- This is... - Goodness.

997
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,009
Can you eat some with char siu?

998
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,210
Wait. Tae Hyun...

999
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,050
Is Tae Hyun really eating like that?

1000
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,180
- Gobble it up. - I'll take a photo of this.

1001
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,250
- For when I have no appetite. - Can you eat it all?

1002
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,289
(He takes a hearty bite wrapped in char siu.)

1003
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,490
Is Tae Hyun eating like that?

1004
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,459
The meat would taste...

1005
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
(Runaway Train Tae Hyun)

1006
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:14,490
It'd taste so good with ramen.

1007
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,130
It's different from ramen I've tried before.

1008
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,060
One bowl of that ramen...

1009
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,129
would be refreshing and hearty.

1010
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,240
I'm going to taste some tonkotsu ramen.

1011
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
- Tonkotsu ramen. - It looks so delicious.

1012
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,410
- Is this tonkotsu ramen? - Yes.

1013
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,939
This broth is very thick.

1014
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,279
That one.

1015
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,679
It's thick. It was made with the whisk.

1016
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,710
Try more broth.

1017
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,949
And it'd be rich.

1018
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,520
(He has a spoonful of the thick broth first.)

1019
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,419
This isn't a broth.

1020
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,520
- What is it, then? - Is it a soup?

1021
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,660
- Yes, it's like a soup. - Right, a soup.

1022
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,329
The soup that's served with old-fashioned pork cutlet?

1023
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,300
Exactly. It's just like that.

1024
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,230
But it tastes nothing like that.

1025
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,039
- I should try this next. - There's dried fish powder in it.

1026
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,570
- Right. - Dried fish powder?

1027
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,609
- It's in here. - No wonder...

1028
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,509
- it tastes like fish cakes. - Right.

1029
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,179
This reminded me of chueotang.

1030
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,780
Hey, that makes sense.

1031
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,209
All we can do is imagine the flavors and...

1032
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,020
I can't quite imagine the flavors which is driving me crazy.

1033
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,589
It must be like pasta.

1034
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,260
(Like cream pasta)

1035
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,490
Have it with dried laver.

1036
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,029
- Here you go. - Noodles with dried laver?

1037
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,499
- Right. - Wrap the noodles with it.

1038
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,430
The dried laver is the kick.

1039
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,769
The meat looks incredible.

1040
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,100
(All in one mouthful?)

1041
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,500
My gosh.

1042
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,040
Tae Hyun, didn't you say I ate my food messier earlier?

1043
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,210
That's exactly how you were like just now.

1044
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,420
You can't help it.

1045
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,789
(It must be that good...)

1046
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,719
You know, that...

1047
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,020
- That looks good. - Tae Hyun.

1048
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,119
Why don't we let them try each of the broth?

1049
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,429
I really want them to try this.

1050
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,630
- I'm down with that. - Just the broth?

1051
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,729
It's so good with the garlic.

1052
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,929
If you do this... Guys, here's an example.

1053
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,169
- You'll be disqualified. - This isn't allowed.

1054
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,670
- That's a thick broth. - How about this?

1055
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,669
That was your second attempt, and now you're disqualified.

1056
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,969
- Sure. - Dong Hyun, you're up.

1057
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,140
I won't play any tricks.

1058
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,509
It's so good.

1059
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,609
(The fair Cicada Kim tries the broth.)

1060
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,610
(Exclaiming)

1061
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:15,650
Dong Hyun,

1062
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,209
- you're spilling it. - What?

1063
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,380
It's all over your pants.

1064
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,349
- It's fine. I'll have it later. - You'll have it later?

1065
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,720
I can taste the dried fish powder.

1066
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,320
It tastes as if there are ground fish cakes in it.

1067
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,859
Guys, it's even better with that.

1068
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,230
Now I'll try the mazesoba.

1069
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,460
This is the real deal. I mean it.

1070
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,769
I haven't had it before.

1071
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,670
Maintain the thick consistency.

1072
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,039
Mazesoba tastes the best...

1073
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,370
when you have the noodles with the dried laver flakes.

1074
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,510
Of course. That's why I spread them out.

1075
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,870
Yes, do that.

1076
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,439
Wait, the smell.

1077
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Whatever.

1078
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,150
How is it?

1079
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,520
- So that's what you mean. - That's what I mean.

1080
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,719
- Go ahead. - This is the boss.

1081
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,089
You should have the dishes in this order.

1082
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,489
You can tell that this has stronger flavors.

1083
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,790
That's definitely the order.

1084
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,389
Go ahead and tell us how it is.

1085
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,859
(Slurping)

1086
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,930
Goodness.

1087
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,100
When has Tae Hyun gobbled something up like this?

1088
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,700
(Pondering)

1089
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,939
What did you put in the mazesoba?

1090
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,339
Compared to the other dish, what did you add that's special?

1091
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,409
This is made with over 30 ingredients.

1092
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,649
- Thirty? - Yes.

1093
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,250
No wonder it's hard to explain the flavors.

1094
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,249
The sauce was made in a Chinese-style manner.

1095
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,259
Exactly. It does taste like Chinese food.

1096
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
You can taste a combination...

1097
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:34,890
of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine.

1098
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,060
Also, I recommend...

1099
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,729
- you having this with vinegar. - Right.

1100
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,699
- Add some in right now. - Really?

1101
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,199
Tell us how it is with the vinegar.

1102
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,400
- In goes the vinegar. - I bet this will taste different.

1103
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,610
It's on the heavier side, but this will give it some balance.

1104
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,580
Just watching them eat without being able to taste the food...

1105
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,509
- Why? What is it? - My gosh.

1106
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,850
What now?

1107
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,550
- It's now balanced. - What?

1108
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,920
- It's now balanced. - Really?

1109
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,050
- Did it do the trick? - What did I tell you earlier?

1110
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,559
You must mix rice into this.

1111
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,689
Then, you have it with the char siu.

1112
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,889
(Seung Ho's way of eating mazesoba: 1. With vinegar, 2. With char siu)

1113
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,959
That'd be insane.

1114
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,199
- Exactly. - Can we have a bowl of rice?

1115
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,459
- Also... - It's now balanced.

1116
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,469
I saw that you had...

1117
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,969
- a Codd-neck bottle soda. - What's that?

1118
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,299
- Sang Uk, you know what it is. - Of course, I do.

1119
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,309
- Can we also have a bottle? - Let us have one too.

1120
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,609
The marble makes a sound.

1121
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,309
- Do you know what this is? - I don't.

1122
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,040
Let me show you. Like this,

1123
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,910
take this piece and aim it right here.

1124
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,419
Shoot.

1125
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
(Place on the lid and shoot.)

1126
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:33,479
The bubbles will rise up.

1127
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,150
(The dropped marble then releases carbonation.)

1128
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,420
Why do they make bottles this way?

1129
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,189
I think it's to prevent people from drinking it too fast.

1130
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,160
Yes, exactly. It won't pour out.

1131
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,960
Let me see. Where is it?

1132
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,759
Right here.

1133
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,199
The marble stays there...

1134
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,670
- to stop the liquid. - How do you drink it?

1135
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,039
(They end up doing the unthinkable.)

1136
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,940
If I'm to recommend one...

1137
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,139
(Standing guard while keeping watch)

1138
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,540
- Really? - Have some more.

1139
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,380
- Really? - Have some more.
(Staring)

1140
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,050
I can see you, you know.

1141
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,549
- Thank you. - Sang Uk, that's against the rules.

1142
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,759
- You had a lot. - Only one will get the chance.

1143
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,330
Be the fastest one to apologize from the heart.

1144
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,759
- I'm sorry. - You'll get the mazesoba...

1145
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,130
- Okay, you. - Hold on.

1146
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I'm sorry.

1147
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,030
- You know you did wrong, right? - Yes.

1148
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,970
- Sang Uk drank it all. - I'm sorry.

1149
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,870
I'll give you about this much...

1150
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,039
since we need some to mix the rice with.

1151
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,340
(Apology King Sang Uk gets to try the mazesoba.)

1152
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,539
Does it taste the way you remember?

1153
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,949
- It does. - How is it?

1154
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,180
Like a Japanese-style jjajangmyeon.

1155
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,949
- It's like that. - He's right.

1156
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,349
Like chili pepper japchae?

1157
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,990
No, it's not like that.

1158
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
- Smelling it is for free. - I can't tell.

1159
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,560
I haven't mixed rice into this dish before.

1160
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,059
How is it?

1161
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,330
I remember this smell.

1162
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,060
I smell chili oil and garlic.

1163
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,329
(Anyway, it tastes amazing.)

1164
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,470
The chef is truly skilled.

1165
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,169
Compared to what you can have in Japan...

1166
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,840
In Japan, the dish is sweeter.

1167
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,209
The mazesoba in Japan is sweet.

1168
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,940
Japanese dishes tend to be sweet.

1169
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
What I first smelled was...

1170
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,480
chili oil and garlic.

1171
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,519
Chef, thank you so much.

1172
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,020
(A double thumb up)

1173
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,389
When do we get a bite?

1174
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,319
- Isn't it our turn now? - How long do we have to wait?

1175
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,689
Now, it's time...

1176
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,530
- for the freeloaders. - A freeloading chance.

1177
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,830
Gosh, this is good.

1178
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,229
Celebrities with four-syllable names.

1179
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,329
- Four syllables? - Yes.

1180
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,660
Four syllables? Sunwoo Jae Deok.

1181
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,430
- This is easy. - Dokgo Young Jae.

1182
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Sunwoo Jung A.

1183
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,470
Sunwoo Yong Yeo.

1184
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,909
- I was going to say that. - Go ahead.

1185
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,410
- It's your turn. - Hwang Seung Ho Jae.

1186
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,140
Hwang Seung Ho Jae.

1187
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,509
- Who's Hwang Seung Ho Jae? - Don't you know him?

1188
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,009
He sang "I Feel Only You."

1189
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,179
- You and me... - Who's that?

1190
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,419
They're looking him up.

1191
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,349
He entered the stage of a music show...

1192
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,050
on a large motorcycle.

1193
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,320
("I Feel Only You" by Hwang Seung Ho Jae)

1194
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,760
(A large motorcycle)

1195
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,659
(Entering "Top 10 Songs")

1196
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,929
(Hwang Seung Ho Jae, Debuted in 1994)

1197
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,770
(A talented artist who studied pansori and jazz)

1198
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,870
We approve.

1199
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,569
- Five, four, three - Kim...

1200
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,339
- two, one. - Kim Suhanmu.

1201
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,410
Kim-Na-Park-Lee.

1202
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,239
(Kim-Na-Park-Lee)

1203
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,480
Kim-Na-Park-Lee?

1204
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,950
I couldn't think of anyone.

1205
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:17,110
- Is he out? - He's out.

1206
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,549
- Please continue. - Okay.

1207
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,049
- Is it my turn? - Five, four, three...

1208
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,150
Hwangwoo Seul Hye.

1209
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,959
Hwangwoo Seul Hye!

1210
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,820
We filmed a movie together.

1211
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,029
- Five... - Five, four, three...

1212
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,900
- Two, one. - Eulji Mundeok.

1213
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
Incorrect.

1214
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,300
Eulji Mundeok?

1215
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,870
What should I have?

1216
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,300
No way. I finally get to freeload!

1217
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,369
(Happy, Unhappy)

1218
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,640
Scatter the scallions on top.

1219
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,879
(He quickly tries the broth first.)

1220
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,050
Have just the broth first.

1221
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,449
- Isn't it amazing? - It hits you...

1222
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,479
on the back of the throat.

1223
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,620
With a piece of char siu that's wrapped around the noodles.

1224
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,750
- Goodness. - It's hot!

1225
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,589
- Goodness. - It's hot!

1226
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,220
Hey!

1227
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,290
- It's hot. - I told you it was hot.

1228
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,160
- Who wants this? - Forget it.

1229
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,929
- It's mine! - It's done for.

1230
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,229
- Unbelievable. - It's mine!

1231
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,100
This is what people do when they don't want to share.

1232
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,670
We all wanted to do that but never did it.

1233
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,439
But Yi Kyung actually did it.

1234
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,069
You could tell it was hot.

1235
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,579
- But... - There's a teeth mark on the meat.

1236
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,980
It was that hot. I had to save myself first.

1237
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,850
You picked up a lot of it when it obviously looked hot.

1238
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,620
(Moaning)

1239
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,949
(Moaning)

1240
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,220
You made some weird sounds just now.

1241
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,259
(It's too good that he doesn't care about his image.)

1242
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,830
I get why you cured the meat for a week.

1243
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,629
I'd love a slice of that char siu.

1244
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,929
- It's been seasoned evenly. - I'm curious too.

1245
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,400
(Gosh...)

1246
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,669
I'd love some of that soda.

1247
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,439
Can we play a game for a sip?

1248
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,109
- To win a sip of the soda? - What?

1249
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,139
The Codd-neck bottle soda.

1250
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
How about the times table?

1251
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:54,309
- Sure. - Good.

1252
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,409
- This is a matter of pride. - I'd win, no questions asked.

1253
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,419
I once competed in a math competition. Let's go.

1254
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,680
Hold on a second. Do you know the nine times table?

1255
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,489
When was the last time I multiplied numbers?

1256
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,620
This is a game I must win.

1257
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,989
Was it back in sixth grade?

1258
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,790
He's at a major disadvantage. Can we play another game?

1259
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,330
- No, this is fine. - Okay.

1260
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,699
- You go 1st. - Should I go 1st?

1261
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,529
- Go ahead. - And go.

1262
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,029
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1263
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,500
- What's 9 times 6? - That's 54.

1264
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,670
- Memorize your times tables. - What's 3 times 6?

1265
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,609
- It's 18. - Memorize your times tables.

1266
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,669
What's 6 times 9?

1267
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,469
- That's 54. - Memorize your times tables.

1268
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,479
What's 7 times 4?

1269
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,210
- It's 28. - Memorize your times tables.

1270
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,310
What's 4 times 7?

1271
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,410
Thirty... No, twenty...

1272
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:34,580
Unbelievable. 7 times 4 is the same as 4 times 7.

1273
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,249
How can you ask 7 times 4 and then fail to answer the next one?

1274
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,859
- What did I say? - "Thirty... No, twenty..."

1275
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,889
(Shattered mentally)

1276
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,890
He rose above it.

1277
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,799
(Dong Hyun lost.)

1278
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,529
- I'll enjoy. - Seven times four.

1279
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,830
I wanted the soda.

1280
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,129
- I'll open it for you. - Thanks.

1281
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,370
Let me do it. I wanted to try this.

1282
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,299
- I'll push it in. - Dong Hyun can't drink it.

1283
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,710
An athlete should do it with one hand.

1284
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,910
Why can't you do this?

1285
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,340
Can you do it with one hand?

1286
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,450
(Shaking)
It'll be my turn next.

1287
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,880
Is this why you cling on to your opponents?

1288
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,620
- Hold on a second. - Right?

1289
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,420
I got it halfway in.

1290
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,689
Sang Uk can do it.

1291
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,919
- I did it wrong. - His muscles are built differently.

1292
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,990
- His muscles are built differently. - This is tough.

1293
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,690
Should this even be a contest?

1294
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,960
- Come on. - Should this even be a contest?

1295
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,730
Come on.

1296
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,500
- A clear victory. - That's the second time.

1297
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,940
Because he grips the sword like this,

1298
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,169
- his muscles in this area are huge. - I see.

1299
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,339
- Check this out. - Here.

1300
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,679
This is what I did.

1301
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,609
Come here. Let's compare our hands.

1302
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,779
(A powerful grip honed through fencing)

1303
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,710
Check his hand out right here.

1304
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,750
- He's been using the sword so much. - Look at his thumb.

1305
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,420
That's why it's so easy for him.

1306
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,550
Thank you for the drink.

1307
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,590
Our Sang Uk is...

1308
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,790
- How is it? - It's incredible.

1309
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,529
Nothing tastes better than a win.

1310
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,960
Something you probably won't know.

1311
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,829
I shouldn't have asked.

1312
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,800
Did you hear Sang Uk? "Something you won't know."

1313
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,339
He said,

1314
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,569
"Something you probably won't know."

1315
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,100
- That's true. - Right.

1316
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,639
You guys were so funny.

1317
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,080
- Can you show us the bill? - Right.

1318
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,040
What's the total amount?

1319
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,850
- Right. - It's 92 dollars.

1320
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,579
How about a quiz for you two?

1321
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,750
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1322
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,049
This is something you'd say when you're flirting with someone.

1323
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,460
In Korea, you'd say, "Want to come in for some ramyeon?"

1324
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,860
There are similar phrases in other countries too.

1325
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,030
- Which of these is not the same? - It's multiple choice.

1326
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,729
Number one, Thailand.

1327
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,270
Do you want to watch a horror movie together?

1328
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,670
Number two, Vietnam.

1329
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,270
Can you repair my bicycle?

1330
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,439
Number three, Indonesia.

1331
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,340
Do you want to go to a quiet corner together?

1332
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,210
Isn't that too obvious?

1333
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,980
Number four, Hong Kong.

1334
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,980
- Can you scratch an itch for me? - What?

1335
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,749
This is hard.

1336
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,979
How would you know where it itches?

1337
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,579
- This is hard. - It is?

1338
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,949
- It's hard to choose. - It's hard.

1339
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,349
Indonesia is?

1340
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,659
Do you want to go to a quiet corner together?

1341
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,689
To a quiet corner.

1342
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,330
This is weird. We say this a lot in martial arts.

1343
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,429
- We say this a lot. - Take them to the corner.

1344
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,599
Vietnam is, "Do you want to ride the bicycle together?"

1345
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,130
It's "Can you repair my bicycle?"

1346
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,100
- Okay. - That really means...

1347
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,770
It's literally asking you to fix it.

1348
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,269
The chain came off.

1349
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,210
- It came off. - The chain came off.

1350
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,010
In Vietnam,

1351
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,310
so many people ride motorcycles.

1352
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,349
They ride motorbikes more than bicycles.

1353
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,220
Everyone, young or old, rides a motorbike.

1354
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,950
I think number four is weird.

1355
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,220
All other answers are about going somewhere.

1356
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,420
But Hong Kong asks you to scratch right now.

1357
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,659
That's right. You don't go anywhere.

1358
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,089
- You go to see a movie. - Right.

1359
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,529
Bicycle... He's telling me not to say anything.

1360
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,000
- Don't say anything. - But I want you to get it right.

1361
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,800
(Team Bulgogi 3-Person Individual Match)

1362
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:35,399
- Me too. - Me too.

1363
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,729
I want him to get it right.

1364
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,940
- I want that too. - Please.

1365
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,140
I'll go for Vietnam.

1366
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,769
- Shall we go with Vietnam? - Yes.

1367
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,809
(Vietnam - Can you repair my bicycle?)

1368
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,010
- Let's go with Vietnam. - I'm sure it's number four.

1369
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,510
- Vietnam. - Yes.

1370
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,210
Answer is number two, Vietnam.

1371
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,920
Can you repair my bicycle?

1372
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,419
- Answer is... - It could be the answer.

1373
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,089
(Vietnam - Can you repair my bicycle?)

1374
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,190
Correct.

1375
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,960
That's it. The answer is correct.

1376
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,429
- Right? - Amazing!

1377
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,899
(Answer is number 2, Vietnam.)

1378
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,899
- Great job! - Nice work.

1379
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,970
Nice work.

1380
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,970
Nice work.

1381
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,000
Let's get into the individual match.

1382
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,539
(I hope it's not me.)

1383
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,739
- Great job. - Thank you.

1384
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,439
I think Sang Uk is a bit worried.

1385
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,809
- Not at all. - Are you sure?

1386
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,239
Then...

1387
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,110
The team who didn't get to eat will do the Quiz for the Bill.

1388
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:28,419
Look at the shape of instant noodles we often eat.

1389
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,589
When ramyeon first came out, they were all in square shapes.

1390
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,319
- Why did some become round? - I got it!

1391
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,759
To make them fit into round pots.

1392
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,159
- Correct. - Yes!

1393
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,559
You knew it.

1394
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,600
This was the quickest reaction my brain has ever made.

1395
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,030
- Simultaneously. - Right.

1396
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,569
We've come to this point.

1397
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,540
It was between Dong Hyun and Sang Uk before.

1398
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,639
This last battle is between Sang Uk and Yi Kyung.

1399
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,909
- Who will win? - Ramen!

1400
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,910
Will he pay for the first time?

1401
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:53,110
- It will be the 1st time you pay. - It will be my 1st.

1402
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,709
- Sang Uk, speed is the key. - Yes.

1403
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,450
(Will Sang Uk pay again, after his first payment before?)

1404
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,920
The noodles of many ramyeon have a yellowish color.

1405
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,989
- Yellow? - When ramyeon first came out,

1406
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:04,819
nutritional deficiency became an issue.

1407
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,889
- It's because they added this... - I got it.

1408
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,330
I got it. Cheese, milk.

1409
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,460
- Cheese? Incorrect. - Milk?

1410
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,630
I got it. Protein?

1411
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,229
Protein. Incorrect.

1412
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,230
Calcium.

1413
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,899
Calcium? Incorrect.

1414
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,000
I got it.

1415
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,700
- It's yellow. - Vitamin.

1416
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,570
Correct!

1417
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,309
It was vitamin.

1418
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,340
(Sang Uk is also free from paying.)

1419
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,179
He got it at, "It's yellow."

1420
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,909
- This was so hard. - Great.

1421
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,280
- It was so difficult. - Great.

1422
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,619
Yi Kyung is paying for the first time.

1423
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,850
- I'm paying for the 1st time. - It's his 1st.

1424
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,690
I never dreamed I'd be paying here.

1425
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,889
I wanted this individual match.

1426
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,289
Thanks to Yi Kyung, we really had a delicious meal.

1427
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,629
Thanks for saying that.

1428
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,400
At least I tasted the food.

1429
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,130
(He happily pays for the food.)

1430
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,199
I'm happy to pay today.

1431
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,539
(Receipt is for 92 dollars.)

1432
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,969
Thanks for the food.

1433
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,210
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

It's time to...

1444
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,416
- Hello. - There are more people.

1445
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:22,946
- You must be getting off work. - Thank you.

1446
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,146
I got off work.

1447
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:25,985
You're going for some drinks.

1448
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,155
They have already gathered together over there.

1449
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,355
Hello.

1450
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:31,686
- The atmosphere is changing here. - Right.

1451
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:39,436
(By day, it's all work in these alleys.)

1452
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:42,036
(By night, )

1453
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:46,536
(they turn into spaces for unwinding and connection.)

1454
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:49,705
I get why this area is trending.

00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,746
(Mullae-dong is where contrasts coexist.)

1456
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,876
- This must be the place. - Where is it?

1457
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:55,945
- Jokbal? - There are so many jokbal places.

1458
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,145
- Look over here. - So many.

1459
00:51:57,146 --> 00:51:58,716
Look here.

1460
00:51:59,086 --> 00:52:00,186
Really?

1461
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,625
- It's here. - I feel like I ate a few days ago.

1462
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:06,256

(The hottest hip spot in Mullae-dong.)

1467
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,545
(Average of 50 teams visit per day.)

1468
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:25,646
(This is a famous place with an hour-wait during peak hours.)

1469
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,815
(I saw it on a show and visited. Waited about an hour. Tasted great.)

1470
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:29,786
(Went for the opening and got in. Fried jokbal was crispy and great!)

1471
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,885

(Today's first Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1473
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,825
(DMR 1. Deep-Fried Jokbal)

1474
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:39,695
- Hello. - Hello.

1475
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:41,256
- Please come to me. - Oh, okay.

1476
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,426
- The menu is special. - I looked at the menu.

1477
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:46,195
How does this menu work?

1478
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,795
This is regular jokbal, right?

1479
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:49,005
- It's basic jokbal. - Basic jokbal.

1480
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:51,065
- It's shishito pepper fried jokbal. - This is deep-fried jokbal.

1481
00:52:51,066 --> 00:52:53,176
- Shishito pepper fried jokbal? - Yes.

1482
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:54,535
- You deep fried the jokbal? - Yes.

1483
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:58,776
I tried crispy pata in the Philippines.

1484
00:52:59,046 --> 00:53:01,476
It was good, just a little heavy.

1485
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:04,886
So I paired it with fried shishito peppers on top.

1486
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,655
What is this? Maewumyeon?

1487
00:53:06,656 --> 00:53:09,056
- Maewumyeon? - Think of it as bibim naengmyeon.

1488
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:10,425
So it feels like makguksu...

1489
00:53:10,426 --> 00:53:11,556
- when you eat it together? - That sounds great.

1490
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:12,895
It feels like makguksu.

1491
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,095
- Then... - Yes?

1492
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:15,896
- We should... - One plain jokbal.

1493
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,265
One fried shishito pepper jokbal.

1494
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,596
- And one maewumyeon. - Okay!

1495
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,135
- That will be our order. - I'll get them ready.

1496
00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:21,296
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1497
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,805
This place looks like...

1498
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:25,005
Seems like this place was a metal shop too.

1499
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,836
- The interior is like that. - It feels like that.

1500
00:53:26,876 --> 00:53:28,705
It's basically all exposed concrete.

1501
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,445
Is this the trend these days?

1502
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:32,645
You'd think it wouldn't match,

1503
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,215
- but it totally works. - I agree.

1504
00:53:34,216 --> 00:53:35,416
(This place is full of that effortlessly hip vibe.)

1505
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:39,385
(This jokbal just keeps getting more intriguing.)

1506
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,456
- Oh, my! - Amazing!

1507
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:43,856
- It looks tasty. - So this is what it looks like.

1508
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:45,225
I've never seen a deep-fried jokbal in my life.

1509
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:47,696
- It looks so crispy. - This is first time for me.

1510
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,566
(Slow-cooked jokbal, sweet, savory, and full of flavor)

1511
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,136
(First, it is coated in a smoky fire.)

1512
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:57,706
(Then, it is cut apart.)

1513
00:53:58,306 --> 00:54:02,606
(Second, it is covered with batter.)

1514
00:54:03,546 --> 00:54:05,916
(Into the oil it goes.)

1515
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,685
(Jokbal is deep fried until crispy.)

1516
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:11,015
(It is topped with shishito peppers to cut through the greasiness.)

1517
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:13,215
This is really amazing.

1518
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,356
That must take the jokbal's texture to the next level.

1519
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:20,955
Even the plain jokbal is insanely glossy and shiny.

1520
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:22,566
(Springy and tender)

1521
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:26,296
This is bibim... I mean maewumyeon.

1522
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:29,666
(It's time for the first Dinner Menu Recommendation.)

1523
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:35,376
You're not supposed to eat this right now.

1524
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,515
- This a fantastic combination. - This change makes it feel weird.

1525
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:41,346
It feels weird.

1526
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,646
- I'd like to make a suggestion. - Yes?

1527
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:45,886
- When we go to the next restaurant, - Yes?

1528
00:54:45,956 --> 00:54:48,516
You can order as many dishes as you want.

1529
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:52,526
We'll give you a quiz, and whoever gets it right first...

1530
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:54,196
gets to start eating.

1531
00:54:55,496 --> 00:54:58,266
Out of the 5 of you, only 3 get to eat.

1532
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:00,135
- That means... - I see.

1533
00:55:00,136 --> 00:55:02,135
If you get it wrong at the second restaurant too,

1534
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,735
- still no food? - That could happen.

1535
00:55:03,736 --> 00:55:05,375
Someone could go hungry tonight.

1536
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:06,905
- Oh, no. - Hey, wait a minute.

1537
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:09,175
I like this. I think it'll be fun.

1538
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:10,606
- I think so too. - This is nice.

1539
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:12,445
I love this.

1540
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:14,845
The food is out, and the quiz starts right away.

1541
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:15,915
- I like this. - I love this feeling.

1542
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,515
- My competitive side's kicking in. - Right.

1543
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:19,155
- Right. - The food is out already.

1544
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:20,156
(Which one of them will get the jokbal?)

1545
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:22,786
- Okay. - So now it's jokbal on the line.

1546
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:24,426
And only three get to eat, right?

1547
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:26,695
- I have to get the right answer. - We have to get it right.

1548
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:27,756
Quickly!

1549
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,325
- Before the food gets cold. - Yes!

1550
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,866
I'll give you the first question really fast.

1551
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:32,395
I'll give you the first part of a proverb.

1552
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:33,536
I'm so bad at this.

1553
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:36,266
If you know the rest, raise your hand and then answer.

1554
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:37,936
- Let's do this. - Okay.

1555
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,006
- A slick tongue... - I got it.

1556
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:41,176
He didn't hear.

1557
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:42,445
- You can't say it twice. - What did he say?

1558
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:43,575
- No. - You can't ask.

1559
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:44,576
- No. - Okay, just ignore it.

1560
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:46,315
- No, that's not right. - You can't do that.

1561
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:47,445
- You have to answer. - You can't do that.

1562
00:55:47,446 --> 00:55:48,545
- That's not right. - He just called out.

1563
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:49,945
- I'll answer. - Just say anything.

1564
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,316
A slick tongue...

1565
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:52,986
(Yes, say something.)

1566
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:54,755
- What? - This is really difficult.

1567
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:55,825
A slick tongue is...

1568
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:56,926
Kim Dong Hyun.

1569
00:55:57,926 --> 00:55:59,756
- Incorrect. - That's a wrong answer?

1570
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,396
(Laughing)

1571
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,026
Is it "A silver tongue travels a thousand miles?"

1572
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:06,836
That's words without feet.

1573
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,306
It has something to do with knowing a depth of ten fathoms.

1574
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,376
A slick tongue and ten fathoms.

1575
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:13,775
It's something like that.

1576
00:56:13,776 --> 00:56:15,005
(You may know the depths of ten fathoms...)

1577
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:16,105
(but not what's going on in Dong Hyun's head.)

1578
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,205
- This is a good question. - It's really difficult.

1579
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:18,975
- A silver tongue... - If no one knows the answer,

1580
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,976
- lets take turns answering. - Say what comes to your head.

1581
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:22,216
No one knows.

1582
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:23,445
Dong Hyun.

1583
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,515
(His 3rd try)

1584
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:26,085
- If the context fits, it counts? - Yes.

1585
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:27,255
- A slick tongue... - Yes.

1586
00:56:27,256 --> 00:56:28,585
(A slick tongue...)

1587
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:29,686
can get you killed.

1588
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,795
A slick tongue might seem like nothing, but...

1589
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:33,856
Correct.

1590
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:38,865
(Dong Hyun answered correctly.)

1591
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:40,096
Is it really "A slick tongue can get you killed"?

1592
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,336
It's accurate.

1593
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:44,205
(I'm not going hungry today.)

1594
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:45,576
This is exactly what you'd call "a slick tongue," right?

1595
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,576
- How can he get it right? - Unbelievable.

1596
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:50,345
- He's a genius. - Right.

1597
00:56:50,346 --> 00:56:52,046
He knows it because he hears things like that all the time.

1598
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:53,575
- Things like that? - Getting killed.

1599
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,716
(Having a slick tongue)

1600
00:56:56,886 --> 00:56:58,416
He's so funny.

1601
00:56:58,546 --> 00:56:59,585
His slick tongue.

1602
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:01,085
Dong Hyun, show us you eating.

1603
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:02,526
(Will he show us a deep-fried jokbal eating show?)

1604
00:57:03,456 --> 00:57:04,485
- Really. - I wonder...

1605
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:05,596
how deep-fried jokbal tastes.

1606
00:57:05,896 --> 00:57:08,966
This doesn't feel like typical fried food.

1607
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:11,465
It's barely greasy. It's crispy outside and juicy inside.

1608
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,636
- Oh, just the skin. - Just the skin is deep-fried.

1609
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:15,505
- Crispy outside, juicy inside. - The inside part is really...

1610
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:16,535
(It looks amazing.)

1611
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:18,265
- This is amazing. - You eat it like bossam.

1612
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:21,436
(Crispy outside, juicy inside)

1613
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:24,545
(He takes fresh lettuce.)

1614
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:25,546
(He adds one piece of deep-fried jokbal.)

1615
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,446
(Adding a shishito pepper)

1616
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:29,746
That looks so amazing.

1617
00:57:30,486 --> 00:57:32,086
He also wraps it so well.

1618
00:57:33,256 --> 00:57:34,485
This has to make a noise.

1619
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:35,925
Crack, just like an armbar.

1620
00:57:35,926 --> 00:57:36,956
- What? - Armbar?

1621
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:38,995
Hey, if you do an armbar, that's the end.

1622
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:40,155
- That's the end. - Right.

1623
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,056
That would have ended everything.

1624
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,425
(Apply armbar to a lettuce)

1625
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:46,366
(Dong Hyun's new move is ssambar.)

1626
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:49,665
(He locks the ssambar and into the mouth it goes.)

1627
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,466
Oh, my.

1628
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:53,876
(Enjoying)

1629
00:57:55,006 --> 00:57:56,076
(Savoring)

1630
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,575
If I had heard the proverb after seeing this,

1631
00:57:58,576 --> 00:57:59,646
I would've gotten the right answer.

1632
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:02,745
(Moved)

1633
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:04,486
Does frying it make a difference?

1634
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:06,116
- This is... - Yes?

1635
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:08,815
(What did Dong Hyun think of the deep-fried jokbal?)

1636
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:09,856
Incredible.

1637
00:58:11,056 --> 00:58:13,356
You noticed I was really startled for a second?

1638
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:14,925
When we have pork belly...

1639
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:15,995
There's pork belly with its skin.

1640
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:16,996
- It's really tasty. - Five-layer pork belly.

1641
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:18,195
- Five-layer pork belly. - I know that.

1642
00:58:18,196 --> 00:58:19,895
When you cook it all the way,

1643
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,696
- the skin becomes really tasty. - It becomes crispy.

1644
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,136
- It becomes crispy. - Right.

1645
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,305
When you chew, it's different from regular bossam.

1646
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:27,976
The last bite has that crispy feel.

1647
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:30,606
But it still has the fragrance of original jokbal.

1648
00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:33,515
The inside part is really savory and tender.

1649
00:58:33,516 --> 00:58:36,116
(Crispy skin on the outside is followed by tender, savory meat.)

1650
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,846
(Mouth watering)

1651
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:41,756
Thanks to the shishito peppers, it adds a peppery fragrance.

1652
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:43,426
It's the best.

1653
00:58:43,926 --> 00:58:47,325
(When it's this good, you go for round two.)

1654
00:58:47,326 --> 00:58:48,495
It's not spicy at all.

1655
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:50,266
- Not spicy at all. - It looks so good.

1656
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:52,196
It has that thick peppery aroma but it's not spicy at all.

1657
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:54,096
It's like eating a vegetable.

1658
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,336
So good.

1659
00:58:55,337 --> 00:58:56,736
It has a kick when I swallow it.

1660
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:58,305
It's so good.

1661
00:58:58,306 --> 00:58:59,635
Shishito pepper was a total game changer.

1662
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,705
We were actually...

1663
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:02,175
It's not the slick tongue.

1664
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,876
I think you can kill someone with your description.

1665
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:06,815
I want more of just this part.

1666
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:08,015
- Which part? - The skin.

1667
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:09,086
- Just the skin? - Yes.

1668
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:11,016
Eat it all up before the next round.

1669
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:12,286
- Look at this. - What?

1670
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,386
They're stuck together!

1671
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:15,825
I'll eat it in one go.

1672
00:59:15,826 --> 00:59:17,386
(It's a collaboration of the skin and shishito pepper.)

1673
00:59:17,486 --> 00:59:18,656
(So good!)

1674
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:20,055
(Laughing)

1675
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,056
Listen.

1676
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:23,465
Dong Hyun, give us the signal.

1677
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:24,466
Can we go ahead...
with the next question?

1678
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:26,466
- We can? - The next question?

1679
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:27,636
We should have asked sooner.

1680
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:30,366
I'll give you the next question.

1681
00:59:30,836 --> 00:59:32,976
You can find dishes similar to Korean jokbal...

1682
00:59:33,176 --> 00:59:35,476
in some other countries too.

1683
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:38,906
Boiled, then deep-fried, there is koleno from the Czech Republic.

1684
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:41,176
Roasted until crispy,

1685
00:59:41,346 --> 00:59:43,246
Germany's Schweinshaxe is another classic.

1686
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,886
I think I heard about Schweinshaxe from somewhere.

1687
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,086
These dishes also differ not just in how they're cooked,

1688
00:59:49,156 --> 00:59:51,225
but in the cuts they use.

1689
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:52,256
How are the cuts different?

1690
00:59:54,096 --> 00:59:56,765
These dishes also differ not just in how they're cooked,

1691
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:58,895
but in the cuts they use.

1692
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,036
How are the cuts different?

1693
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:03,935
- The cuts are different. - Yes.

1694
01:00:03,936 --> 01:00:05,466
(He doesn't care at all.)

1695
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,306
- I got it. - We have to name the cuts.

1696
01:00:07,506 --> 01:00:10,676
In other countries, jokbal dishes are made with thigh meat.

1697
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,175
Incorrect.

1698
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,676
- I got it. - You know?

1699
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,146
- Koleno and Schweinshaxe... - Yes?

1700
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,656
Use pork belly.

1701
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,155
Incorrect.

1702
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:24,556
I got it. They...

1703
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:26,626
They use the whole leg.

1704
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:28,825
We use... what do you call this?

1705
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,966
- This is the foot. - The toes.

1706
01:00:31,196 --> 01:00:32,266
This part?

1707
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,065
- Incorrect. - What is this?

1708
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,566
Front or back leg? How far does it go?

1709
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,466
- You can't tell him. - It's so chewy.

1710
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:42,506
- It's so chewy. - What?

1711
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:45,445
(Everyone knows it's chewy.)

1712
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:46,646
What do you mean it's chewy?

1713
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:48,616
Don't you understand Korean?

1714
01:00:48,676 --> 01:00:50,286
It's really chewy.

1715
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,686
Tae Hyun, it's like...

1716
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:54,186
- I got it. - This is...

1717
01:00:54,386 --> 01:00:56,125
- Up until here for Korea. - Yes.

1718
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:57,185
Until here for other countries.

1719
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,825
(Jokbal goes from toes to the knee. Abroad, it starts above the knee.)

1720
01:00:58,826 --> 01:00:59,826
- Incorrect. - I got it.

1721
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:00,995
So, it's all to do with the feet.

1722
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:03,396
For Korea, it's until the foot.

1723
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:07,495
Schweinshaxe uses everything above the foot.

1724
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:08,535
I got it.

1725
01:01:08,536 --> 01:01:09,835
(Jokbal uses up to the foot. Abroad, they skip the foot and go upward.)

1726
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:10,866
Correct.

1727
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,235
It's because I like this.

1728
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:16,176
But Schweinshaxe didn't have this.

1729
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:19,375
It's this part, the foot.

1730
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,646
- This is the tasty part. - They don't use that.

1731
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:24,185
(Schweinshaxe and koleno use the leg above the ankle.)

1732
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:26,085
(Jokbal uses the whole leg including the foot.)

1733
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,415
- We didn't need to fight. - Good.

1734
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:29,956
- We didn't need to fight. - That's right.

1735
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,725
Weren't you on the same team?

1736
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:33,326
- We were one team. - That's right.

1737
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:37,465
(He wraps a piece of fried jokbal with lettuce.)

1738
01:01:37,466 --> 01:01:38,596
This is not possible.

1739
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,996
(A full wrap)

1740
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,966
- This looks tasty. - Yes.

1741
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:46,676
Sang Uk gets to eat right away.

1742
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,646
(Enjoying)

1743
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,175
(Depressed)

1744
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:56,386
It's just a little crispy, barely enough to notice.

1745
01:01:56,686 --> 01:01:58,616
- But that is what makes it amazing. - Right.

1746
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:00,015
- Did you add the shishito pepper? - Not yet.

1747
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,515
- You have to add it. - I do?

1748
01:02:01,516 --> 01:02:03,686
You have to add the pepper for sure. There's a reason for that.

1749
01:02:03,856 --> 01:02:05,686
You guys are having a good day aren't you?

1750
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,895
They nearly had a falling out at first.

1751
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,166
They were arguing and fighting just a while ago.

1752
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,866
- You're good friends now. - Enjoy the food.

1753
01:02:13,236 --> 01:02:14,436
Sang Uk, enjoy the food.

1754
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,206
(Crunchy)

1755
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:20,935
Could you eat this now?

1756
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:22,276
I forgot about that.

1757
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,676
- Both of you, try this. - It's maewumyeon.

1758
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:26,246
Maewumyeon!

1759
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:30,416
(The bright red seasoning stimulates the appetite.)

1760
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:38,126
(Eyes shaking)

1761
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:39,355
- It's just right. - So good.

1762
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:40,495
(Enjoying)

1763
01:02:40,496 --> 01:02:41,625
How is it?

1764
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:43,195
There is tomato here.

1765
01:02:43,196 --> 01:02:44,766
- Eat it together. - Tomato?

1766
01:02:44,796 --> 01:02:46,695
- Isn't it spicy? - Let me try.

1767
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,765
It isn't spicy.

1768
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:49,405
Bibim naengmyeon tastes great with meat.

1769
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:50,965
(Combining noodles, deep-fried bossam, and tomato)

1770
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:52,036
That's right.

1771
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,806
- It's the tomato. - This is amazing.

1772
01:02:58,676 --> 01:02:59,715
This is so good.

1773
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:00,716
(I want to eat it too.)
- This is really good. - Okay.

1774
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:04,146
- Let's go with the last question. - Let's do it.

1775
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:06,215
It's for the last remaining place.

1776
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,586
(Eating Show Star Selection Quiz)

1777
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:12,126
A Korean-style driver's diner just opened in Manhattan, New York.

1778
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,256
And it got a lot of buzz.

1779
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:18,166
It wasn't just the food. They had something...

1780
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:20,796
that was really common in Korea, which attracted more attention.

1781
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:22,935
What is this something?

1782
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:24,366
Something in a driver's diner?

1783
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:27,536
I got it. Is it instant mix coffee?

1784
01:03:28,076 --> 01:03:29,905
- Mix coffee? - You know, that thing.

1785
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,746
The mini coffee vending machine.

1786
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:34,146
- That seems like the answer. - It makes sense.

1787
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:35,615
Vending machine?

1788
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:36,845
(Am I losing this final chance to eat deep-fried jokbal?)

1789
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:37,916
It makes sense.

1790
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,316
That thing you just press to get coffee.

1791
01:03:41,286 --> 01:03:42,286
Correct.

1792
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:43,926
He's right?

1793
01:03:44,926 --> 01:03:47,525
(Disappointed)

1794
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:48,595
That's incredible.

1795
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:51,266
(Laughing)

1796
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,466
I was thinking about sikhye and ice cream.

1797
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:58,065
(Korean-style driver's diner in New York)

1798
01:03:58,066 --> 01:03:59,535
(After a meal, you get a 25-cent coin to grab...)

1799
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,005
(a coffee or yulmu tea from the mini vending machine.)

1800
01:04:01,006 --> 01:04:02,475
(From the interior to the menu, it has 120% authentic Korean vibes.)

1801
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:03,946
(Local people are loving it.)

1802
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:07,076
(He finally gets to taste the food he's been curious about.)

1803
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:09,215
You have something about mix coffees.

1804
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:10,245
- That's true. - Mix coffee.

1805
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,515
You get all the answers about mix coffees.

1806
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:13,585
- Right. - I thought you won't eat it.

1807
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:14,715
But you're eating it right away.

1808
01:04:14,716 --> 01:04:17,156
That's the really tasty part. I was going to tell you that.

1809
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:20,696
This part is really tasty.

1810
01:04:20,996 --> 01:04:23,226
This is like chicken.

1811
01:04:23,366 --> 01:04:24,566
- It's not jokbal. - Right.

1812
01:04:24,896 --> 01:04:26,366
They turned pork into chicken.

1813
01:04:26,736 --> 01:04:28,935
The part that you ate is the tastiest.

1814
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,906
This is really good.

1815
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,976
Now I know what taste you were talking about.

1816
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,105
- You're finished? - Yes.

1817
01:04:35,106 --> 01:04:36,406
Then, why did you start eating it?

1818
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,575
He was curious.

1819
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,316
Yes, I was just curious.

1820
01:04:40,616 --> 01:04:41,976
I wasn't hungry.

1821
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,586
I was curious about this too.

1822
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:45,646
Unbelievable.

1823
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:47,285
(Tae Hyun makes a wrap.)

1824
01:04:47,286 --> 01:04:48,816
(He has to taste what he's curious about.)

1825
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,286
I'm doing the armbar too.

1826
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:52,486
(Crunchy)

1827
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:57,696
(The wrap goes straight into his mouth.)

1828
01:04:57,926 --> 01:04:59,266
He's eating.

1829
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:02,806
I have to try the shishito peppers.

1830
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:08,676
(He takes a bite of shishito pepper on its own.)

1831
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:12,406
Hey!

1832
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:14,476
Shishito pepper is the star!

1833
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:17,386
(They acknowledge the shishito pepper.)

1834
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:21,415
(Shishito pepper brought Tae Hyun's appetite to life.)

1835
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,826
You aren't giving us any food?

1836
01:05:23,026 --> 01:05:24,256
(Exclaiming)

1837
01:05:24,856 --> 01:05:27,126
- It's good. - What's the part you want?

1838
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,296
- Jokbal is not the star. - It's the shishito pepper.

1839
01:05:29,566 --> 01:05:30,566
- Right. - True.

1840
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:32,225
Can we order more of just shishito pepper?

1841
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:33,265
Yes.

1842
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:34,766
- Please give us one more serving. - Coming up.

1843
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,265
It's hot.

1844
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,605
(They get an additional order of fried shishito peppers.)

1845
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,175
This is it.

1846
01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:41,305
There are so many.

1847
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:43,146
(A mountain of fried shishito peppers)

1848
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:44,876
These shishito peppers are so tasty.

1849
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:46,245
Although I'm really full...

1850
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,746
They were freshly made too.

1851
01:05:48,646 --> 01:05:52,916
(Shishito peppers are tastier when they're hot.)

1852
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:55,186
(Eating)

1853
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:58,186
(Chewing)

1854
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:03,266
(Everyone enjoys the shishito peppers.)

1855
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:09,165
(Dong Hyun's face suddenly falls.)

1856
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,906
(Breathing hard)

1857
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:14,406
(His face turns red.)

1858
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,346
You must've gotten a spicy one.

1859
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,885
(He's suffering after eating a spicy shishito pepper.)

1860
01:06:22,886 --> 01:06:23,886
It's spicy.

1861
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:26,115
Are some shishito peppers spicy?

1862
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,055
Yes. The spicy ones are hidden.

1863
01:06:28,056 --> 01:06:29,086
Why is that?

1864
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:31,556
The ones that get a lot of sunlight become spicy.

1865
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,156
Is that so?

1866
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:35,226
I didn't get a spicy one.

1867
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:37,065
- Me neither. - I got one.

1868
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:38,265
I can't eat spicy food.

1869
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:40,496
(Only Dong Hyun got a spicy shishito pepper.)

1870
01:06:41,336 --> 01:06:42,735
No, I can eat it.

1871
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:43,936
Why are you eating more?

1872
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:47,706
Are you eating more after that?

1873
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:50,806
Whenever someone says something...

1874
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:52,106
This one is tasty too.

1875
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:56,386
(He got a spicy one 2 times in a row.)

1876
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,146
You need to be good-hearted.

1877
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:00,255
(Laughing)

1878
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:02,756
Teasing has no effect on me because I ate with you.

1879
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,486
Gosh, it's spicy.

1880
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:07,796
- Okay. Let's go. - It was good.

1881
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:10,196
- The bill, please. - I'll give you the bill first.

1882
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:12,425
- It was neat. - I wonder how much it is.

1883
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:13,466
It can't be a lot.

1884
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:14,966
It's 90 dollars.

1885
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:16,635
- Not bad. - All right.

1886
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:18,736
I see that Mullae-dong is a good neighborhood.

1887
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,305
Let's decide on who'll pay with a quiz.

1888
01:07:21,306 --> 01:07:22,405
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1889
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:23,776
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1890
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:26,875
In the Tang dynasty of China,

1891
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,945
this item was first used...

1892
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:30,945
in the form of pig bristles attached...

1893
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,486
to a pig bone.

1894
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:37,056
What's this item that became essential in the modern world?

1895
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:40,156
Pig bristles attached to a pig bone?

1896
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:42,865
- Essential in the modern world? - Yes.

1897
01:07:42,866 --> 01:07:45,466
What came to my mind was a brush.

1898
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:48,165
You make a brush by attaching pig bristles to bamboo.

1899
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,906
- A brush? It's plausible. - Yes.

1900
01:07:50,636 --> 01:07:51,736
Then it must be a pen.

1901
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:53,606
- In the modern world... - It's a pen.

1902
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,675
A brush isn't essential.

1903
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:58,745
But a brush evolved into a pen.

1904
01:07:58,746 --> 01:07:59,916
Pens are essential in the modern world.

1905
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,745
- That'll be number 1. - Number 1.

1906
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,886
- That'll be number one. - Yes.

1907
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,186
- They're quite stiff. - Bamboo and pig bristles.

1908
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,586
- If by any chance... - We're set.

1909
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:09,886
- What is it? - We're set.

1910
01:08:10,426 --> 01:08:12,325
We're set. Tae Hyun, I'm 100 percent sure of this one.

1911
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:13,555
- What is it? Tell me. - I'm 100 percent sure.

1912
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,596
A toothbrush.

1913
01:08:15,026 --> 01:08:16,325
They used a toothbrush that was made of stiff pig bristles back then.

1914
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,025
- You said that. - That makes more sense.

1915
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:19,265
- You mentioned stiffness. - Go with that one.

1916
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:21,166
- A toothbrush. - I waited for you...

1917
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:22,905
to give me such an answer.

1918
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:25,135
- That's right. Tae Hyun, that's it. - I didn't want an evolved item.

1919
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:26,435
- That's right. - It was used back then as well.

1920
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,905
People brushed their teeth back then as well.

1921
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:29,335
- That's right. - It's an essential item now.

1922
01:08:29,336 --> 01:08:30,405
Did they use pig bristles...

1923
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,205
- to brush their teeth? - You mentioned stiffness.

1924
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:34,315
That gave me an idea. This is teamwork.

1925
01:08:34,316 --> 01:08:36,045
- This is teamwork. How is it? - A toothbrush?

1926
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:37,415
- A toothbrush. - A toothbrush.

1927
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:39,245
- Are they hygienic? - It makes more sense than a pen.

1928
01:08:39,246 --> 01:08:41,256
Did they use pig bristles to brush their teeth?

1929
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:43,356
Are they hygienic?

1930
01:08:44,326 --> 01:08:46,725
Tae Hyun, what did you do during the Imjin War?

1931
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:49,195
During the Imjin War, I butchered a pig with a knife...

1932
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:50,595
and plucked out the bristles.

1933
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:52,095
- He made his kids' toothbrushes. - I remember doing that.

1934
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:53,795
He made his kids' toothbrushes.

1935
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,795
- I saw him make them. - That's right. I remember.

1936
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:58,036
One for Su Chan, one for Su Bin...

1937
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,906
The best clue is "An essential item in the modern world."

1938
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:05,176
A toothbrush is totally essential.

1939
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:06,416
Let's go with this answer.

1940
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:07,646
- Let's go. - Yes. We're set.

1941
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:08,875
- We don't need to worry. Tae Hyun. - No, we don't.

1942
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,746
You won't regret it even if we get it wrong, right?

1943
01:09:10,986 --> 01:09:12,786
I got it. A toothbrush.

1944
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,486
A toothbrush.

1945
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:18,655
Pig bristles are soft enough for the teeth despite being stiff.

1946
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:21,425
(Answer: Toothbrush)

1947
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:22,456
It's...

1948
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:28,796
- Is it correct? - It's correct.

1949
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:33,575
You don't disappoint. Tae Hyun.

1950
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:35,735
- You're an expert. - Is it a toothbrush?

1951
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:38,606
You have good judgment.

1952
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:41,246
Tae Hyun, you're an expert.

1953
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:43,145
You make the right calls.

1954
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:45,415
- When I spout nonsense, - A brush didn't sound right.

1955
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,456
You weed it out.

1956
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:50,286
After avoid paying all along, I might end up doing it twice today.

1957
01:09:51,126 --> 01:09:52,625
I'll give a quiz on the capitals.

1958
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:53,725
(The last question, Capital Quiz)

1959
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:55,195
- It'll be hard. - It'll be hard.

1960
01:09:55,196 --> 01:09:57,696
- I think Yi Kyung will do well. - It's a quiz for Seung Ho.

1961
01:09:57,966 --> 01:10:00,495
The country is Brazil.

1962
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,566
I got it.

1963
01:10:02,296 --> 01:10:03,966
He has been there.

1964
01:10:04,306 --> 01:10:05,966
This is too much.

1965
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:09,375
He visited Brazil to film a variety show.

1966
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,305
Still, he might not know the capital.

1967
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:12,745
- Hold on. - It can't be easy.

1968
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:14,876
- Let me ask you a question. - I know the answer.

1969
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:17,845
Did you pick out this question ahead of time?

1970
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,586
- Yes. - You didn't know about his visit.

1971
01:10:20,086 --> 01:10:21,585
- To where? - Brazil.

1972
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:22,715
- When did he visit? - Recently.

1973
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:24,025
- Did you visit recently? - Yes.

1974
01:10:24,026 --> 01:10:25,085
(How were we supposed to know that?)

1975
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:26,156
You got lucky.

1976
01:10:26,696 --> 01:10:28,425
Here's the thing. If you picked this question...

1977
01:10:28,426 --> 01:10:30,365
so that I'd answer correctly...

1978
01:10:30,366 --> 01:10:31,995
- It's okay. - Then I won't answer.

1979
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:34,065
- Seung Ho, just answer. - You haven't answered yet.

1980
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:35,535
- But I... - Your answer might be incorrect.

1981
01:10:35,536 --> 01:10:36,735
- It can't be helped. - Here's the thing.

1982
01:10:36,736 --> 01:10:40,475
I always think about the situation my opponent is in.

1983
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:42,035
I want a fair match.

1984
01:10:42,036 --> 01:10:43,175
Seung Ho,

1985
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:44,606
you aren't in the position to do that.

1986
01:10:44,976 --> 01:10:46,545
That wasn't the intention.

1987
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,945
If you feel that way, I can give you a different question.

1988
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:50,686
- Would that be necessary? - For goodness' sake.

1989
01:10:50,816 --> 01:10:52,845
He's talking big.

1990
01:10:52,846 --> 01:10:54,215
He's feeling good on the inside.

1991
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,686
- Seung Ho... - Are you enjoying it?

1992
01:10:57,526 --> 01:10:58,855
I know Seung Ho well.

1993
01:10:58,856 --> 01:11:00,255
He says, "I'll yield."

1994
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,055
But he thinks, "Oh, yes!"

1995
01:11:02,056 --> 01:11:04,326
- No, Dong Hyun. I'm serious. - He's like that.

1996
01:11:04,596 --> 01:11:05,925
Then you can pass the question.

1997
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:06,965
- Pass it. - Yes.

1998
01:11:06,966 --> 01:11:07,966
Would that be necessary?

1999
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:10,436
I was about to be moved.

2000
01:11:10,806 --> 01:11:12,405
I was so moved by his gesture.

2001
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,136
I don't pass the ball. I shoot it.

2002
01:11:15,236 --> 01:11:18,376
There's no goalkeeper. You need to shoot it.

2003
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:19,945
I'll give it a go...

2004
01:11:19,946 --> 01:11:21,315
- since I used up too much time. - Okay.

2005
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:22,545
What's the capital of Brazil?

2006
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:23,986
It'll be hilarious if he gets it wrong.

2007
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:27,085
- Rio. - Rio?

2008
01:11:27,086 --> 01:11:28,286
Rio de Janeiro.

2009
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:30,626
Rio wasn't the answer I had in mind.

2010
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:32,626
Incorrect.

2011
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:35,295
- Hurry up and say, "I got it." - For goodness' sake.

2012
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:36,625
- It's my turn. - I know the answer.

2013
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,925
The two of us were like...

2014
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,466
- I know it too. - Gosh, you were too confident.

2015
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,435
His answer was incorrect.

2016
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:43,806
(Wasn't it Rio?)

2017
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,635
- Sao Paulo. - Sao Paulo.

2018
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:46,876
That's the only city I know.

2019
01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:48,875
- Incorrect. - I don't know the answer.

2020
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:50,006
- Is it my turn? - What other cities are there?

2021
01:11:50,746 --> 01:11:51,846
Brasília.

2022
01:11:52,076 --> 01:11:53,576
Brasília?

2023
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:56,015
- Is there such a city? - Yes.

2024
01:11:56,016 --> 01:11:57,016
(Answer: Brasília)
Correct.

2025
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:00,855
- For goodness' sake. - Seriously.

2026
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:03,826
- Brasília. - I'm surprised that you know it.

2027
01:12:03,926 --> 01:12:06,285
- Did you visit the city? - I didn't visit Brasília.

2028
01:12:06,286 --> 01:12:08,495
- I had no idea. - I didn't know about Brasília.

2029
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:09,595
Brasília?

2030
01:12:09,596 --> 01:12:11,825
- It's confusing. - It's really confusing.

2031
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:12,965
Brasília.

2032
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:14,235
- Rio de Janeiro... - Is Sao Paulo in Brazil as well?

2033
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:15,665
- held many events. - I've heard of Sao Paulo.

2034
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,036
The Summer Games were held in Rio de Janeiro.

2035
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:19,775
- Okay. - Yi Kyung is paying a lot today.

2036
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:21,836
- I paid twice in a row. - He paid twice.

2037
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:25,346
I paid twice in a row. I didn't even eat the food.

2038
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:27,716
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2039
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,815
- Give it to me. - This is nice.

2040
01:12:30,816 --> 01:12:31,945
I'm glad that you enjoyed the food.

2041
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:34,186
It's 45 dollars each, so the total is 90 dollars.

2042
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,485
Thank you.

2043
01:12:35,486 --> 01:12:38,856
(Yi Kyung pays for DMR 1.)

2044
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,395
(After the first DMR)

2045
01:12:40,396 --> 01:12:43,025
It seems like I'll pay today, so eat as much as you want.

2046
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,096
Okay.

2047
01:12:44,366 --> 01:12:46,095
Mullae-dong is Lee Yi Kyung's neighborhood.

2048
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,096
(He paid 2 times in a row.)

2049
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,266
Lee Yi Kyung's neighborhood.

2050
01:12:48,336 --> 01:12:50,935
- This place is atmospheric. - It's so atmospheric.

2051
01:12:50,936 --> 01:12:52,006
My goodness.

2052
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,305
It's like France or Italy.

2053
01:12:54,306 --> 01:12:56,546
Look at the signboard that's hung sideways.

2054
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:00,775
- What an idea. - There are only three tables.

2055
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:01,815
(The signboard shows the vibe of the Mullae Artist Village.)

2056
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,386
These signboards say "Industry" and "Machine industry."

2057
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:06,486
- How unique. - This is...

2058
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,985
- This is the chicken restaurant. - This is it.

2059
01:13:08,986 --> 01:13:09,986
- Is this the place? - This is it.

2060
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:12,485
- What? - See? The neighborhood is small.

2061
01:13:12,486 --> 01:13:13,496
(The location of the second DMR is nearby.)

2062
01:13:14,196 --> 01:13:15,295
This is it.

2063
01:13:15,296 --> 01:13:16,965
It was on "The Must-Try Restaurants."

2064
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:18,626
- It's a famous restaurant. - It's a famous restaurant.

2065
01:13:18,696 --> 01:13:20,995
- This area is so atmospheric. - If it weren't for the show,

2066
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,235
I wouldn't have known about this neighborhood.

2067
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,566
Mullae-dong is so charming.

2068
01:13:24,106 --> 01:13:26,236
- It's vintage. - I grew up on this food.

2069
01:13:26,266 --> 01:13:28,305
- Shall we go inside? - I'm curious.

2070
01:13:28,306 --> 01:13:29,636
Heebab was here as well.

2071
01:13:30,576 --> 01:13:32,546
(In the restaurant-filled alleys of Mullae-dong, you can find...)

2072
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,476
(a chicken!)

2073
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:39,516
(A line forms at 5pm.)

2074
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:42,616
(The restaurant is always full!)

2075
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:48,325
(Many Mukbang YouTubers and food shows visit the place.)

2076
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:51,166
(What kind of food does this place serve?)

2077
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,636
(It's more special since it's unfamiliar.)

2078
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:59,406
(The revolt of the chicken giblets!)

2079
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,636
(The new world of grilled chicken)

2080
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,116
(DMR 2, Chicken giblets)

2081
01:14:08,116 --> 01:14:10,245
It's 49 dollars for 730g.

2082
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,386
Seriously, this is...

2083
01:14:12,686 --> 01:14:14,716
- How is the price so cheap? - It's chicken.

2084
01:14:14,856 --> 01:14:17,925
I don't know if it's because we've been to Hannam-dong,

2085
01:14:17,926 --> 01:14:20,896
but the price seems to be a bit lower.

2086
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:22,925
It'll be nice for people...

2087
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,526
to have a drink after work.

2088
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:27,066
We must eat this one.

2089
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:30,036
- We must devour it. - Seriously.

2090
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:32,265
Seung Ho's combat ability is at its max.

2091
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:33,836
Let's order first.

2092
01:14:34,276 --> 01:14:35,536
- Sir. - Okay.

2093
01:14:36,436 --> 01:14:38,005
- Thank you. - Hello.

2094
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,576
If you feel awkward, why don't you sit next to me?

2095
01:14:39,946 --> 01:14:41,145
- Okay. - Please take a seat.

2096
01:14:41,146 --> 01:14:42,146
(Owner, Choi Seong Min)

2097
01:14:42,147 --> 01:14:43,446
Let's get acquainted.

2098
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,885
This place was an iron foundry...

2099
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:48,716
like other places, right?

2100
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:50,185
- That's right. - I see.

2101
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,725
We renovated an iron foundry.

2102
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:54,426
(They renovated an iron foundry and opened a restaurant.)

2103
01:14:54,526 --> 01:14:57,725
What made you want to sell chicken giblets?

2104
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,326
The thing is,

2105
01:14:59,526 --> 01:15:01,696
I used to be a food blogger.

2106
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:04,235
- A food blogger. - You're an expert.

2107
01:15:04,236 --> 01:15:05,335
- Yes. - He's an expert.

2108
01:15:05,336 --> 01:15:07,005
While looking around to get an idea for a restaurant,

2109
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:10,475
I found a grilled chicken restaurant in Yeosu.

2110
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:12,146
- It was so tasty. - I see.

2111
01:15:12,276 --> 01:15:14,375
- I started off with that idea. - A grilled chicken restaurant.

2112
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,545
- We're curious about something. - Okay.

2113
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:19,145
We're unfamiliar with chicken giblets.

2114
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:20,615
Which cut is the chicken honey meat?

2115
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:23,956
It's a cut that's shaped like an oyster.

2116
01:15:24,126 --> 01:15:26,956
In English, it's called chicken oyster.

2117
01:15:27,826 --> 01:15:31,565
There's a concave spot behind the wings.

2118
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:33,495
That part is cut into the shape of an oyster.

2119
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,165
It tastes as good as honey.

2120
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,535
- Chicken honey meat. - Chicken honey meat.

2121
01:15:36,536 --> 01:15:37,635
- I'll prepare delicious food. - Okay.

2122
01:15:37,636 --> 01:15:38,736
- Thank you. - Okay.

2123
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:39,906
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2124
01:15:40,776 --> 01:15:42,875
Since the neighborhood has...

2125
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:45,575
a lot of iron foundries, the restaurant has this vibe.

2126
01:15:45,576 --> 01:15:46,875
The iron foundry vibe.

2127
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,875
Perhaps the table was made at a neighboring iron foundry.

2128
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:51,215
- Sir. Is it true? - Yes?

2129
01:15:51,216 --> 01:15:54,885
Did you get this table made at an iron foundry nearby?

2130
01:15:54,886 --> 01:15:56,316
I got it made at an iron foundry in front of the restaurant.

2131
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:58,656
I see. All of these?

2132
01:15:59,156 --> 01:16:01,395
- Where else would he go to? - Seriously.

2133
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:02,656
- He had it made. - That's right.

2134
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:04,526
- I see. - I had a hunch.

2135
01:16:04,696 --> 01:16:06,425
It was made at an iron foundry in front of the restaurant.

2136
01:16:06,426 --> 01:16:07,436
(They saw an iron foundry in front of the restaurant.)

2137
01:16:09,396 --> 01:16:12,505
(The semicircle tables were made to order.)

2138
01:16:12,506 --> 01:16:14,275
I haven't seen such tables elsewhere.

2139
01:16:14,276 --> 01:16:15,775
They were made to order.

2140
01:16:15,776 --> 01:16:17,176
There's only one side.

2141
01:16:17,376 --> 01:16:18,905
- It's sturdy. - Only three people...

2142
01:16:18,906 --> 01:16:20,445
can eat here, right?

2143
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:22,315
I must answer correctly here.

2144
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:24,785
- I really want to eat here. - I must answer correctly here.

2145
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:26,245
Let's yield to Seung Ho.

2146
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:27,455
- Help me out as well. - Good.

2147
01:16:27,456 --> 01:16:28,815
Yes. Yi Kyung too.

2148
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:30,556
- I won't answer even if I know. - Seriously.

2149
01:16:31,326 --> 01:16:33,025
- We'll be nice. - All right. Give us the question.

2150
01:16:33,026 --> 01:16:34,326
- The first question is... - Okay.

2151
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:36,155
- about an idiom. - For goodness' sake.

2152
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:37,965
- I won't be able to answer. - An idiom.

2153
01:16:37,966 --> 01:16:39,366
- Here comes an idiom. - Okay.

2154
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:41,235
Even the river water...

2155
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:42,765
(Even the river water)

2156
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,705
Flows

2157
01:16:44,706 --> 01:16:47,036
(Even the river water flows)

2158
01:16:47,176 --> 01:16:50,176
Under the Third Han River Bridge

2159
01:16:51,046 --> 01:16:52,675
It must be "Has hierarchy."

2160
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:54,346
Even the river water has hierarchy.

2161
01:16:54,816 --> 01:16:55,916
Seung Ho.

2162
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:58,115
Even the river water has hierarchy.

2163
01:16:58,116 --> 01:17:00,215
- It's obvious. - Seriously.

2164
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:01,715
- You don't need the meaning. - I know.

2165
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:03,485
(Seung Ho is confused.)

2166
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:05,786
"Has hierarchy" is 100 percent correct.

2167
01:17:06,286 --> 01:17:07,926
Isn't it "Even the cold water has hierarchy?"

2168
01:17:08,826 --> 01:17:10,865
"Even the river water has hierarchy" doesn't sound right.

2169
01:17:10,866 --> 01:17:13,436
To be honest, I'm upset.

2170
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,765
Everyone told me...

2171
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:18,236
to say, "Even the river water has hierarchy."

2172
01:17:18,336 --> 01:17:19,505
I didn't do that.

2173
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:20,805
- It isn't like that. - I mean...

2174
01:17:20,806 --> 01:17:22,335
It might be correct.

2175
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:23,336
The first part is too short, so give us the meaning.

2176
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:24,405
Please give us the meaning.

2177
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,505
- Please give us the meaning. Sorry. - Seriously.

2178
01:17:26,506 --> 01:17:27,545
It means,

2179
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:30,745
- "Don't be wasteful." - "Don't be wasteful."

2180
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,185
The idiom begins...

2181
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:33,655
- with "Even the river water..." - That's right.

2182
01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:35,155
My goodness.

2183
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:37,426
I got it. Even the river water can dry up.

2184
01:17:37,556 --> 01:17:38,955
Even the river water can dry up.

2185
01:17:38,956 --> 01:17:41,655
(Even the river water can dry up.)

2186
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:42,755
Incorrect.

2187
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:44,265
- I got it. - No way.

2188
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:46,065
Even the river water can gather and create waves.

2189
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,196
Incorrect.

2190
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:49,095
Isn't it "Even rainwater can gather and create the sea?"

2191
01:17:49,096 --> 01:17:51,005
- Is that it? - You got confused.

2192
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:53,105
Even rainwater... That must be it.

2193
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:54,236
(There isn't such an idiom.)

2194
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:55,635
Are Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun, and I...

2195
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:56,946
- the remaining ones? - Yes.

2196
01:17:57,276 --> 01:17:58,445
- Even the river water... - Let's do this.

2197
01:17:58,446 --> 01:18:01,116
Tae Hyun, give a similar answer.

2198
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,445
I don't have a clue.

2199
01:18:02,446 --> 01:18:04,946
I guess Seung Ho really wants to answer correctly.

2200
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:07,555
- Don't get it right. - You want to answer correctly.

2201
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:09,986
Even the river water...

2202
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,755
runs dry at times,

2203
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:13,856
so don't squander away.

2204
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,556
Incorrect.

2205
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:17,766
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,

2206
01:18:18,826 --> 01:18:21,136
you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.

2207
01:18:21,736 --> 01:18:23,195
- You remember it. - That's right.

2208
01:18:23,196 --> 01:18:24,566
How do you remember it?

2209
01:18:24,906 --> 01:18:26,166
Two people remain.

2210
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,436
- Did you go? - Yes, I did.

2211
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:31,075
- It's very simple. - Really?

2212
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:32,205
- I got it. - Okay.

2213
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:33,976
Even the river shouldn't be used continuously.

2214
01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:36,445
- Incorrect. - I got it.

2215
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,115
Even the river water ends if you keep using it.

2216
01:18:38,116 --> 01:18:39,685
(Even the river water ends if you keep using it!)

2217
01:18:39,686 --> 01:18:40,755
I like it. It's simple.

2218
01:18:40,756 --> 01:18:41,885
- Incorrect. - It can't get simpler than that.

2219
01:18:41,886 --> 01:18:43,015
- Hold on. - I got it.

2220
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:45,085
Even the river water diminishes if you keep using it.

2221
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:47,225
(Even the river water diminishes if you keep using it.)

2222
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:48,326
Correct.

2223
01:18:48,956 --> 01:18:50,225
Oh, no.

2224
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:53,126
Dong Hyun is on fire today.

2225
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:56,035
- You should've told me. - No one knew that it was an answer.

2226
01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,235
I just threw it out there.

2227
01:18:57,236 --> 01:18:58,936
No one knew that it was an answer.

2228
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:01,375
- I just threw it out there. - It diminishes.

2229
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:02,376
(No one thought of it.)

2230
01:19:02,377 --> 01:19:03,505
The exact idiom is this.

2231
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:04,675
It's a bit different.

2232
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:07,015
Even the river water diminishes if you use it.

2233
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:08,846
- That's right. - It diminishes.

2234
01:19:09,276 --> 01:19:10,815
- My goodness. - It diminishes.

2235
01:19:10,816 --> 01:19:12,985
- For goodness' sake. - It diminishes if you use it.

2236
01:19:12,986 --> 01:19:14,115
I didn't know that there was such an idiom.

2237
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,985
Dong Hyun is on fire today.

2238
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:17,086
- Gosh. - Dong Hyun.

2239
01:19:17,126 --> 01:19:18,755
- Today... - I paid a lot last time.

2240
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:20,395
- So the luck is on my side. - That must be it.

2241
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:21,996
Why isn't luck on my side?

2242
01:19:22,696 --> 01:19:23,726
It has been too long.

2243
01:19:23,766 --> 01:19:26,326
- I'll give a quiz, your favorite. - That's right. I prefer a quiz.

2244
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:30,636
This word comes from the phrase, "Stirred with a cock's tail."

2245
01:19:30,736 --> 01:19:33,406
- I don't have a clue. - I don't have a clue either.

2246
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:34,575
Let me answer.

2247
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:35,676
Cocktail.

2248
01:19:35,836 --> 01:19:37,745
- Correct. - What? Why?

2249
01:19:37,746 --> 01:19:39,405
- Cocktail. - Cocktail.

2250
01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:40,615
Is "Cock" the same as "Chicken?"

2251
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:42,276
Is that why it's called a cocktail?

2252
01:19:43,046 --> 01:19:44,646
Is that really the reason?

2253
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,415
- The last spot... - Cocktail.

2254
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:47,656
I'll go to that side.

2255
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:51,086
- Seung Ho is likely to eat. - That's right.

2256
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,155
If I don't get to eat...

2257
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:54,826
Cocktail was close.

2258
01:19:56,056 --> 01:19:57,625
(The chicken giblets get served.)

2259
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,226
It's the medium-sized assorted giblets.

2260
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:00,935
I'll put it here.

2261
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:02,795
It's less than 50 dollars, right?

2262
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,865
That's right. It's the medium-sized assorted giblets.

2263
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,875
- This is the neck. - That's right.

2264
01:20:06,876 --> 01:20:07,905
(Assorted giblets)

2265
01:20:07,906 --> 01:20:09,875
- What are the cuts? - Okay.

2266
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:12,545
- This is the drumstick. - Okay.

2267
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:15,315
- This is the neck. - Neck.

2268
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,516
This is the chicken tender.

2269
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:19,545
This is the cartilage.

2270
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:21,315
- It sounds delicious. - This is the abdominal wall.

2271
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,455
- Abdominal wall is nice. - Yes.

2272
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:23,655
- And there are... - We get a variety.

2273
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:25,525
- the gizzards and hearts. - Gizzards.

2274
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:27,396
- There's everything. - The hearts look cute.

2275
01:20:27,526 --> 01:20:30,895
And here's the chicken honey meat you ordered in addition.

2276
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:32,395
Please put it here.

2277
01:20:32,396 --> 01:20:34,836
(Chicken honey meat and neck)

2278
01:20:35,336 --> 01:20:36,905
- What is this? - Are they pre-grilled?

2279
01:20:36,906 --> 01:20:38,635
- Is it hot? - No, it isn't.

2280
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:40,036
(The additional menu is lightly grilled.)

2281
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:45,245
(Cooking the chicken honey meat and neck first)

2282
01:20:45,246 --> 01:20:46,405
He told us to flip them over often.

2283
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,616
(Flipping over often)

2284
01:20:48,976 --> 01:20:52,585
- It does look tasty. - That's right.

2285
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:54,415
If you tell me to pay for all previous rounds...

2286
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,656
and eat this, I'll do it.

2287
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:57,326
That's how much I want to eat.

2288
01:20:57,526 --> 01:20:58,625
(They cook the neck, )

2289
01:20:58,626 --> 01:20:59,785
(the cut that gets sold only 30 servings a day.)

2290
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:02,556
The neck must be the most delicious.

2291
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:05,026
- This one. - It's a nice cut.

2292
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:06,496
You can eat it.

2293
01:21:06,826 --> 01:21:08,196
Dip it in salt.

2294
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:11,005
The winners should clink them. Cheers.

2295
01:21:11,006 --> 01:21:12,765
- The juice is dripping. - It's dripping.

2296
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:15,006
(The winners clink the chicken neck.)

2297
01:21:16,536 --> 01:21:17,705
(What's this?)

2298
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,345
The texture must be nice.

2299
01:21:19,346 --> 01:21:20,546
(What's this?)

2300
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:26,486
(Oh, my)

2301
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,715
It's so tasty.

2302
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:30,855
(Blissful)

2303
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:32,926
The taste must be savory and clean.

2304
01:21:33,726 --> 01:21:34,925
It's insane.

2305
01:21:34,926 --> 01:21:35,956
(Gulping)

2306
01:21:36,026 --> 01:21:38,165
Despite all the food we had, the taste is new!

2307
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,166
(Despite all the food they had, the taste is new!)

2308
01:21:39,796 --> 01:21:42,136
Is it your first time stuffing your face with it?

2309
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:43,496
(Sticking out his tongue)

2310
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,036
You know,

2311
01:21:45,106 --> 01:21:48,875
we talk about how a nice cut of beef is...

2312
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:50,876
well-marbled and juicy.

2313
01:21:51,146 --> 01:21:53,616
Why is this juicier?

2314
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,646
When you put it in the mouth...

2315
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,246
There's some pepper sprinkled on it.

2316
01:21:58,746 --> 01:22:03,316
The cooked surface has the smell of pepper, chicken, and charcoal.

2317
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:06,485
It's like barbecued chicken.

2318
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:09,325
When you chew it, it's incredibly tender.

2319
01:22:09,326 --> 01:22:13,166
Let me say this as well. It's more precious than beef.

2320
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:15,736
When I chew it, I forget that it's chicken.

2321
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,466
Look at the juice dripping.

2322
01:22:18,536 --> 01:22:19,536
(The juice drips.)

2323
01:22:19,537 --> 01:22:20,605
The juice.

2324
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:22,006
(The juice drips.)

2325
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:26,706
(He can't hold it any longer, so he puts it in his mouth.)

2326
01:22:30,716 --> 01:22:32,146
Some people will be obsessed.

2327
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:33,985
It's a new experience.

2328
01:22:33,986 --> 01:22:35,755
It looks tasty.

2329
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:36,985
(It looks tasty.)

2330
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:38,156
I don't know...

2331
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:40,755
how many of you...

2332
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:43,396
won't get to eat. But you'll regret it.

2333
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,066
Shall I give you a quiz right away?

2334
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:48,066
- Okay. Let's go. - Why is it...

2335
01:22:48,636 --> 01:22:49,836
The one last spot.

2336
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,105
These days, we're giving...

2337
01:22:52,106 --> 01:22:54,536
LMRs and DMRs for the workers.

2338
01:22:55,036 --> 01:23:00,046
In the 1980s, a newspaper had a segment that showed...

2339
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:03,375
a recommended dish of the week and its recipe...

2340
01:23:03,376 --> 01:23:05,016
once a week.

2341
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:07,256
- In the 80s? - In the 80s?

2342
01:23:08,186 --> 01:23:10,285
In line with the food culture of the era,

2343
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:13,326
it was published under the name of "'Blank' Calendar."

2344
01:23:13,586 --> 01:23:15,626
What was the name of the segment?

2345
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:17,666
- I got it. - Okay.

2346
01:23:18,096 --> 01:23:19,595
"Houseguest Calendar?"

2347
01:23:19,596 --> 01:23:21,465
"Houseguest Calendar." Incorrect.

2348
01:23:21,466 --> 01:23:22,836
- I got it. - Okay.

2349
01:23:23,536 --> 01:23:24,835
"Snack Calendar."

2350
01:23:24,836 --> 01:23:26,966
"Snack Calendar?" Incorrect.

2351
01:23:27,676 --> 01:23:28,835
"Food Calendar."

2352
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:30,875
"Food Calendar" is incorrect.

2353
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:31,945
I'll give you a hint.

2354
01:23:31,946 --> 01:23:32,975
Family.

2355
01:23:32,976 --> 01:23:34,545
I got it. "Family Calendar."

2356
01:23:34,546 --> 01:23:36,975
Family. "Family Calendar."

2357
01:23:36,976 --> 01:23:38,146
Incorrect.

2358
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:39,615
"Gourmet Calendar."

2359
01:23:39,616 --> 01:23:41,515
("Gourmet Calendar!")

2360
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,585
That must be it.

2361
01:23:42,586 --> 01:23:44,686
- Incorrect. - You're nearly there.

2362
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:46,325
I got it. "Lunchbox Calendar."

2363
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:47,756
(He tries right away.)

2364
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,556
It must be correct.

2365
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,796
Lunchbox.

2366
01:23:51,466 --> 01:23:52,595
Correct.

2367
01:23:52,596 --> 01:23:55,265
("Lunchbox Calendar!")

2368
01:23:55,266 --> 01:23:58,705
(When school meals weren't common, the segment was created...)

2369
01:23:58,706 --> 01:24:02,305
(to ease the housewives' struggle of thinking up a lunchbox menu.)

2370
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:03,476
Correct.

2371
01:24:04,276 --> 01:24:06,245
(Everyone looks in one direction.)

2372
01:24:06,246 --> 01:24:07,646
I thought it was "Good Food Calendar."

2373
01:24:07,746 --> 01:24:08,816
All right.

2374
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:11,245
(Sang Uk is happy, but Seung Ho is sad.)

2375
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:12,645
Sang Uk feels uncomfortable about getting it right.

2376
01:24:12,646 --> 01:24:14,255
- Sang Uk is wary. - No.

2377
01:24:14,256 --> 01:24:16,156
Eat passionately.

2378
01:24:16,186 --> 01:24:17,626
- "Lunchbox Calendar." - All right.

2379
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:20,426
My goodness.

2380
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,725
Was it "Lunchbox Calendar?"

2381
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:23,895
- Gosh. - I took it out.

2382
01:24:23,896 --> 01:24:25,466
I feel bad for Seung Ho.

2383
01:24:25,596 --> 01:24:28,165
Because of the new rules, some people can't eat at all.

2384
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:29,535
Seriously.

2385
01:24:29,536 --> 01:24:31,336
(Because of the changed rules, Seung Ho couldn't eat at all.)

2386
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:34,676
(When they discussed the changed rules, )

2387
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:38,676
(he was so happy.)

2388
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:41,175
I didn't know that it'd be me.

2389
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:44,085
The smell is insane.

2390
01:24:44,086 --> 01:24:45,145
I'm sorry.

2391
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,215
(He suddenly apologizes.)

2392
01:24:46,216 --> 01:24:47,685
- Don't be sorry. - Try it.

2393
01:24:47,686 --> 01:24:49,285
- Eat passionately. - Try the one I saved.

2394
01:24:49,286 --> 01:24:50,356
It's good, right?

2395
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,156
Try it. Try the one I saved.

2396
01:24:53,786 --> 01:24:54,925
It's good, right?

2397
01:24:54,926 --> 01:24:55,996
Hey.

2398
01:24:56,126 --> 01:24:58,026
It's good, right?

2399
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,096
(He's cute.)

2400
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,435
(Sang Uk, is it tasty?)

2401
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:04,335
If you close your eyes, you'll think that it's beef.

2402
01:25:04,336 --> 01:25:05,666
- Right? - That's right.

2403
01:25:05,906 --> 01:25:08,476
- The neck meat is unrivaled. - It's unbelievably good.

2404
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:11,046
I get why they sell only 30 servings a day.

2405
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,675
Who wants to try it?

2406
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:15,045
I think it's ready.

2407
01:25:15,046 --> 01:25:16,715
- I think you can eat it. - It's the chicken abdominal wall.

2408
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:18,246
- The abdominal wall. - It's a beer snack.

2409
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:21,755
- Try it. - It looks like pork.

2410
01:25:21,756 --> 01:25:23,056
(At a glance, it looks like pork.)

2411
01:25:23,716 --> 01:25:27,496
(The chicken abdominal wall is chewy and savory.)

2412
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,496
- Dong Hyun. - Thank you.

2413
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:32,566
- I've seen such a cut of pork. - Thank you.

2414
01:25:33,096 --> 01:25:34,096
It looked similar.

2415
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:35,465
I'll eat it with salt.

2416
01:25:35,466 --> 01:25:38,435
(He tries the abdominal wall with salt.)

2417
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:39,606
- What? - I'm curious about the texture.

2418
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:40,905
What's the texture like?

2419
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:42,006
It's my first time eating the chicken abdominal wall.

2420
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:44,875
Beef thin skirt is really chewy, right?

2421
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:45,976
- It has the same texture. - What?

2422
01:25:46,076 --> 01:25:47,346
It's totally chewy.

2423
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,015
- But it's a different animal. - It's so chewy.

2424
01:25:50,016 --> 01:25:51,386
(He hurriedly takes a bite since he's curious.)

2425
01:25:52,116 --> 01:25:55,056
(He understands perfectly as soon as he eats it.)

2426
01:25:56,086 --> 01:25:57,255
It's so chewy.

2427
01:25:57,256 --> 01:25:58,685
The cut is this big, right?

2428
01:25:58,686 --> 01:25:59,786
(That's right.)

2429
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:02,825
- It's incredibly chewy. - That's right.

2430
01:26:02,826 --> 01:26:04,996
- It's incredibly chewy. - It's very chewy.

2431
01:26:05,196 --> 01:26:07,065
- Chewing gum. - Yes, it's incredibly chewy.

2432
01:26:07,066 --> 01:26:08,466
Right? In your mouth...

2433
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,766
I thought there wouldn't be much to eat since it was so small.

2434
01:26:11,506 --> 01:26:12,566
- Seriously. - But the texture is insane.

2435
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:14,676
It's nice. I can lose weight.

2436
01:26:15,476 --> 01:26:16,775
But this isn't even fattening.

2437
01:26:16,776 --> 01:26:17,776
(Laughing)

2438
01:26:17,777 --> 01:26:19,576
It isn't fattening at all.

2439
01:26:19,676 --> 01:26:21,615
- Not at all. - It isn't fattening at all.

2440
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:22,746
You can eat 100 servings.

2441
01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:24,886
We'll give you a chance...

2442
01:26:25,016 --> 01:26:27,215
- to try each cut. - A bite.

2443
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,216
You'll be able to try each cut.

2444
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:31,226
Sang Uk travels around the world,

2445
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,456
so he wants to give a quiz on the capitals.

2446
01:26:33,556 --> 01:26:36,396
(Thus came Sang Uk's Capital Quiz.)

2447
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:38,265
What's the capital of Argentina?

2448
01:26:38,266 --> 01:26:39,495
(Argentina)

2449
01:26:39,496 --> 01:26:40,526
It's easy.

2450
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:41,936
Do you know?

2451
01:26:41,937 --> 01:26:43,636
Is this your idea of a difficult quiz?

2452
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:45,205
- Say the answer. - Hurry up.

2453
01:26:45,206 --> 01:26:46,536
Hurry up and answer. Please.

2454
01:26:47,006 --> 01:26:48,075
- Hurry up. - I'll answer cleanly.

2455
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:49,105
- Okay. - Go ahead.

2456
01:26:49,106 --> 01:26:50,576
I got it. Buenos Aires.

2457
01:26:50,676 --> 01:26:52,075
Darn it!

2458
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:53,606
I got it. Buenos Aires.

2459
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,976
(For goodness' sake)

2460
01:26:56,246 --> 01:26:57,316
Darn it!

2461
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,516
Please stop acting big.

2462
01:27:00,686 --> 01:27:02,355
Stop acting big.

2463
01:27:02,356 --> 01:27:03,386
Seriously.

2464
01:27:03,486 --> 01:27:05,286
Buenos Aires was the answer in my mind.

2465
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:07,655
But after asking you if it was your idea of a difficult quiz,

2466
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,626
I kept thinking. It could've been like Rio de Janeiro.

2467
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,766
- I knew the answer. - Buenos Aires.

2468
01:27:13,296 --> 01:27:14,966
It has that texture.

2469
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,036
(He tries the abdominal wall.)

2470
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:17,466
- Oh, my. - Isn't it incredible?

2471
01:27:18,006 --> 01:27:19,665
- I told you. - I...

2472
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,906
It's chewy.

2473
01:27:21,306 --> 01:27:23,076
It's incredibly chewy.

2474
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:25,745
As for this one,

2475
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:27,346
- dip the top part. - Go ahead.

2476
01:27:27,446 --> 01:27:29,016
Dip the top part in salt.

2477
01:27:29,216 --> 01:27:30,275
The back side.

2478
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:31,345
Did you dip it in salt?

2479
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,886
Eat the skin first.

2480
01:27:33,446 --> 01:27:35,056
- No. Eat it in one bite! - No.

2481
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,215
(No. Eat it in one bite!)

2482
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,955
Eat it in one bite. Don't listen to Dong Hyun.

2483
01:27:38,956 --> 01:27:40,755
- Why would you do that? - Don't listen to Dong Hyun.

2484
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,756
- Shall I eat the whole thing? - Eat it in one bite.

2485
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,195
Why did you try to cut it?

2486
01:27:45,196 --> 01:27:47,596
- It's good, right? - It's amazing, right?

2487
01:27:47,936 --> 01:27:48,936
It's tasty.

2488
01:27:49,636 --> 01:27:51,236
- This... - The bill.

2489
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,536
I bet the total is under 200 dollars.

2490
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:54,706
- What? - What's wrong?

2491
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,606
It isn't 200 dollars.

2492
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,845
It's a bit over 80 dollars.

2493
01:27:58,846 --> 01:28:00,045
What? Is that right?

2494
01:28:00,046 --> 01:28:01,716
It's less expensive than jokbal.

2495
01:28:02,046 --> 01:28:03,645
- He didn't miss anything. - No.

2496
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:05,486
We ate more than 1kg of meat.

2497
01:28:06,716 --> 01:28:08,516
That means the total is low...

2498
01:28:08,786 --> 01:28:10,386
as long as Seung Ho doesn't eat.

2499
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,756
That's what the data suggests.

2500
01:28:13,326 --> 01:28:14,425
- Let's decide on who'll pay... - Okay.

2501
01:28:14,426 --> 01:28:15,555
With a quiz.

2502
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,165
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2503
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,226
In Korea,

2504
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:22,295
a chicken's cry is expressed...

2505
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:24,606
as "Kkokkodek" or "KKokkiyo."

2506
01:28:26,706 --> 01:28:29,036
Is this a quiz on the foreign expressions?

2507
01:28:29,206 --> 01:28:31,045
However, each country has...

2508
01:28:31,046 --> 01:28:33,675
a different expression for a chicken's cry.

2509
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,176
How are we supposed to know that?

2510
01:28:35,846 --> 01:28:37,645
It must be a multiple-choice question!

2511
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:38,786
- That's right. - Yes.

2512
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:41,185
Please pick the incorrect pair...

2513
01:28:41,186 --> 01:28:43,615
of the country and the chicken's cry.

2514
01:28:43,616 --> 01:28:44,985
- It's a multiple-choice question. - Give me a memo pad.

2515
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,055
- We can do this. - I'll write it down.

2516
01:28:46,056 --> 01:28:47,086
You've gone abroad often, right?

2517
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:49,055
(What?)

2518
01:28:49,056 --> 01:28:50,555
- I... - Having gone abroad often...

2519
01:28:50,556 --> 01:28:52,266
has nothing to do with it.

2520
01:28:52,596 --> 01:28:54,165
- Number one, the US. - Okay.

2521
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:55,166
(1. The US)

2522
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,566
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2523
01:28:56,796 --> 01:28:57,866
Excuse me?

2524
01:28:58,006 --> 01:29:00,005
- Cock-a-doodle-doo? - I've never heard it before.

2525
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:01,376
Number one is correct.

2526
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,606
- Why would you tell them? - Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2527
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:06,906
- It sounds similar. - Is that right?

2528
01:29:07,206 --> 01:29:09,445
- Cock-a-doodle-doo. - Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2529
01:29:09,446 --> 01:29:10,945
You made it strange.

2530
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:12,215
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2531
01:29:12,216 --> 01:29:13,885
- You made it strange. - Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2532
01:29:13,886 --> 01:29:15,686
Okay. This is hard.

2533
01:29:15,986 --> 01:29:17,086
- Number two. - Okay.

2534
01:29:17,356 --> 01:29:18,485
- France. - France?

2535
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:19,556
How would we know?

2536
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:21,296
Cocorico.

2537
01:29:21,826 --> 01:29:23,495
- Cocorico. - Cocorico.

2538
01:29:23,496 --> 01:29:25,495
- Isn't it Mexican? - It isn't French, is it?

2539
01:29:25,496 --> 01:29:26,595
Cocorico.

2540
01:29:26,596 --> 01:29:27,965
(The accent has the South American vibe.)

2541
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:29,535
- Isn't it for another country? - Mexico.

2542
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,065
- It's South American. - It's Mexican.

2543
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:32,066
- It's South American. - Seriously.

2544
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:33,535
- Cocorico. - Cocorico.

2545
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:34,935
Is it "Cocorico" in French?

2546
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,376
Number three, Spain.

2547
01:29:37,676 --> 01:29:39,845
- Quiquercoro. - That must be correct.

2548
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:42,016
- Quiquercoro. - Quiquercoro.

2549
01:29:42,046 --> 01:29:43,675
- Is it this one? - Quiquercoro.

2550
01:29:43,676 --> 01:29:45,816
- Number four, Germany. - Is it France?

2551
01:29:47,246 --> 01:29:49,715
Kikeriki.

2552
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:51,226
- It's German. - Kikeriki.

2553
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,256
- I studied German in high school. - Kikeriki.

2554
01:29:53,386 --> 01:29:55,026
- He majored in German! - I studied German.

2555
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:57,596
Judging by what I heard in class,

2556
01:29:57,826 --> 01:30:00,766
"Kikeriki" is German.

2557
01:30:00,866 --> 01:30:02,035
Then I'll take out Germany.

2558
01:30:02,036 --> 01:30:03,036
- Okay. - Let's take out Germany.
Take out the US as well.

2559
01:30:04,037 --> 01:30:06,066
Let's approach it as a Nonsense Quiz.

2560
01:30:06,466 --> 01:30:08,935
If they made up the chicken sound,

2561
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,306
the most plausible one is the answer.

2562
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:13,376
Let's say I came up with this question.

2563
01:30:13,546 --> 01:30:17,115
Then I would've picked the most unlikely ones.

2564
01:30:17,116 --> 01:30:20,015
Number one, cock-a-doodle-doo. "It doesn't seem to match."

2565
01:30:20,016 --> 01:30:21,716
"Let's make it a choice since it's correct."

2566
01:30:21,986 --> 01:30:23,915
- It's number 2 or 3. - You should choose one.

2567
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:25,985
- You led us so far. - Okay.

2568
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:28,095
What do you think is the closest to the chicken sound?

2569
01:30:28,096 --> 01:30:29,426
- The chicken sound? - Yes.

2570
01:30:29,656 --> 01:30:31,095
- Cocorico. - Right?

2571
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:33,765
Then I think we should go with that one.

2572
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:34,766
Cocorico.

2573
01:30:34,767 --> 01:30:36,965
You should trust Dong Hyun today.

2574
01:30:36,966 --> 01:30:38,435
- Okay. Go ahead. - France?

2575
01:30:38,436 --> 01:30:40,165
(Dong Hyun is on fire today, after all.)

2576
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:41,675
- I'll say the answer. - I don't know.

2577
01:30:41,676 --> 01:30:43,276
- The answer is... - One, two, three.

2578
01:30:43,976 --> 01:30:45,206
Number two, France.

2579
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:46,746
- Cocorico. - Cocorico.

2580
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:48,576
- Cocorico. - Yes.

2581
01:30:48,946 --> 01:30:50,775
- Cocorico. - We had to take a wild guess.

2582
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,416
We had to take a wild guess. Don't be sad.

2583
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:53,915
Which one isn't the right chicken sound?

2584
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:56,356
- France, Cocorico. - Don't be sad.

2585
01:30:56,816 --> 01:30:57,825
Let's go.

2586
01:30:57,826 --> 01:31:00,356
(Will it be correct?)

2587
01:31:01,426 --> 01:31:03,155
(France, Cocorico)

2588
01:31:03,156 --> 01:31:04,156
Your answer is...

2589
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:05,626
incorrect.

2590
01:31:06,726 --> 01:31:08,736
- Don't be sad. - All right.

2591
01:31:09,336 --> 01:31:11,506
We promised not to be sad, but I hoped that it'd be correct.

2592
01:31:12,706 --> 01:31:13,865
Then I choose number three.

2593
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:15,006
(Thank goodness)

2594
01:31:15,176 --> 01:31:16,275
- Then... - Would it be okay...

2595
01:31:16,276 --> 01:31:17,745
if we choose one each?

2596
01:31:17,746 --> 01:31:20,376
Why doesn't the one who answers correctly pay?

2597
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:22,216
That way, we'll be done in one go.

2598
01:31:22,546 --> 01:31:24,175
- I see. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2599
01:31:24,176 --> 01:31:25,585
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - The winner will choose first.

2600
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:27,115
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Choose an incorrect answer.

2601
01:31:27,116 --> 01:31:28,585
- That's right. - You need an incorrect answer.

2602
01:31:28,586 --> 01:31:30,186
- Yes. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2603
01:31:30,256 --> 01:31:31,355
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2604
01:31:31,356 --> 01:31:32,426
(He gets 3rd place.)

2605
01:31:32,556 --> 01:31:33,585
Rock-paper-scissors.

2606
01:31:33,586 --> 01:31:34,625
(1st place, 2nd place)

2607
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:36,325
- As for me... - No. He gets to choose first.

2608
01:31:36,326 --> 01:31:37,525
Hold on.

2609
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:38,526
- He did it naturally. - "As for me?"

2610
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:39,765
I must avoid the correct answer.

2611
01:31:39,766 --> 01:31:40,995
- I must avoid the correct answer. - What?

2612
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,535
No. You mustn't avoid the answer that isn't correct.

2613
01:31:43,536 --> 01:31:44,536
(Double negative)

2614
01:31:44,537 --> 01:31:46,305
Choose the correct chicken sound.

2615
01:31:46,306 --> 01:31:47,706
Yes. Choose the correct chicken sound.

2616
01:31:48,206 --> 01:31:49,375
What do you mean? I'm confused.

2617
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,736
Isn't it number four, kikeriki?

2618
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:52,245
Find the correct chicken sound.

2619
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:53,346
- That's right. - I choose number one.

2620
01:31:54,106 --> 01:31:57,245
(It's obvious from his face that he doesn't understand.)

2621
01:31:57,246 --> 01:31:59,286
I choose number one.

2622
01:31:59,946 --> 01:32:01,186
I choose number one.

2623
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:03,556
- I choose number four. - You get to choose last.

2624
01:32:04,116 --> 01:32:05,626
- Number two? - Be quiet.

2625
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:06,986
Kim Dong Hyun, wait.

2626
01:32:07,256 --> 01:32:08,925
But I need to understand. This is so confusing.

2627
01:32:08,926 --> 01:32:10,526
- My head aches. - You don't need to understand.

2628
01:32:10,626 --> 01:32:12,195
Only my choice remains.

2629
01:32:12,196 --> 01:32:13,665
You just need to wait.

2630
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:15,096
My choice will save...

2631
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:17,606
- either you or me. - But...

2632
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:18,836
Which one do you want?

2633
01:32:19,406 --> 01:32:20,406
Me?

2634
01:32:20,407 --> 01:32:23,705
I said that quiquercoro was... Why did I choose it?

2635
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:26,745
Hold on. Did I choose it because it was a chicken sound?

2636
01:32:26,746 --> 01:32:27,746
No. What am I saying?

2637
01:32:27,747 --> 01:32:29,846
- Why did he lead us earlier? - Why did I choose...

2638
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,716
Why did I choose number three earlier?

2639
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,856
Did I choose number three because it was a chicken sound?

2640
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:36,155
Did I do that?

2641
01:32:36,156 --> 01:32:37,156
(Who else?)

2642
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:38,455
- What am I saying? - You chose number two.

2643
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:40,356
This is confusing. The chicken sound...

2644
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:41,825
- The incorrect one. - What was the original question?

2645
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:43,456
- The chicken sound... - You chose the incorrect one.

2646
01:32:43,656 --> 01:32:44,866
- I see. - I think it's a matter of luck.

2647
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,895
In any case, we need to find the correct chicken sounds.

2648
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:48,866
- What does it mean? - I choose number three.

2649
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:50,666
I chose number three!

2650
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:51,936
I'm second place.

2651
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,405
What happens then? Is my answer number four?

2652
01:32:53,406 --> 01:32:54,935
You majored in German and your answer is number four.

2653
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,375
- That's right. - You said it was correct earlier.

2654
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:58,075
You said it seemed to be the chicken sound in German.

2655
01:32:58,076 --> 01:32:59,406
- That was why I chose number three. - Yes.

2656
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:01,216
- Okay. - That's right.

2657
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:03,816
If "Kikeriki" is the chicken sound in German,

2658
01:33:04,116 --> 01:33:05,616
- I don't pay. - That's right.

2659
01:33:06,886 --> 01:33:08,185
- So... - Yes?

2660
01:33:08,186 --> 01:33:10,215
Is there one answer that isn't the chicken sound?

2661
01:33:10,216 --> 01:33:11,326
Yes.

2662
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,086
- Then... - If it's incorrect.

2663
01:33:13,286 --> 01:33:14,286
Number three.

2664
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:15,795
- It was what I chose, right? - Yes.

2665
01:33:15,796 --> 01:33:17,525
- It was what I wanted, right? - How did we solve quizzes...

2666
01:33:17,526 --> 01:33:19,025
- with him for months? - Was it what I wanted?

2667
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,326
- Yes. - But you chose number four.

2668
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,535
You majored in German.

2669
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:24,135
You're certain. So you can take number four.

2670
01:33:24,136 --> 01:33:25,136
- Number 4. - Sang Uk chose number 1.

2671
01:33:25,137 --> 01:33:26,435
So I choose the remaining one, number three.

2672
01:33:26,436 --> 01:33:28,376
- Okay. - Let's leave it up to luck.

2673
01:33:28,476 --> 01:33:30,436
Will you tell us what the correct chicken sounds are?

2674
01:33:30,676 --> 01:33:32,045
Yes. I'll give you the answer.

2675
01:33:32,046 --> 01:33:33,545
- Will that person pay then? - I think he's wrong.

2676
01:33:33,546 --> 01:33:34,546
It's hard.

2677
01:33:34,547 --> 01:33:35,575
- No. - This is confusing.

2678
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,115
You won't pay if you get the correct chicken sound.

2679
01:33:37,116 --> 01:33:38,316
I'm so frustrated.

2680
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:42,286
Dong Hyun, all staff members are frustrated because of you.

2681
01:33:42,556 --> 01:33:44,085
Shall I visit an iron foundry?

2682
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:45,385
Just be quiet.

2683
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:47,456
- Shall I bring a metal pipe? - We explained multiple times.

2684
01:33:47,556 --> 01:33:49,155
I guess my brain doesn't work this way.

2685
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:50,156
(Still, he's the most frustrated.)

2686
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,166
Okay.

2687
01:33:51,896 --> 01:33:54,125
- Tae Hyun, tell me the result. - Okay.

2688
01:33:54,126 --> 01:33:55,395
Tell me whether or not I'll pay.

2689
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:57,265
It's confusing. Okay.

2690
01:33:57,266 --> 01:33:58,535
It'll take too long for me to understand.

2691
01:33:58,536 --> 01:34:00,236
- You should just tell him to pay. - Okay.

2692
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:02,036
- Tae Hyun. - Okay.

2693
01:34:03,036 --> 01:34:05,605
Number one, the US. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2694
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:06,906
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

2695
01:34:07,106 --> 01:34:08,215
It's correct.

2696
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:10,015
The chicken sound is correct.

2697
01:34:10,016 --> 01:34:11,986
- Yes, it's correct. - "Cock-a-doodle-doo" is correct.

2698
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:13,345
- Yes, it's correct. - That's right.

2699
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:14,485
I...

2700
01:34:14,486 --> 01:34:16,685
- It's confusing. - I told you that I was correct.

2701
01:34:16,686 --> 01:34:17,955
- Was I right earlier? - Yes.

2702
01:34:17,956 --> 01:34:19,656
- I was right earlier. - You...

2703
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:20,756
I was right.

2704
01:34:20,757 --> 01:34:23,096
It was the least likely one to be a correct chicken sound.

2705
01:34:23,956 --> 01:34:25,626
But number one was correct. Okay.

2706
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:29,365
This is my least favorite kind of brainwork.

2707
01:34:29,366 --> 01:34:30,366
- Okay. - It's okay.

2708
01:34:30,367 --> 01:34:32,205
One correct chicken sound remains.

2709
01:34:32,206 --> 01:34:33,236
Okay.

2710
01:34:33,636 --> 01:34:34,676
There's that.

2711
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,575
I won't ask.

2712
01:34:36,576 --> 01:34:37,605
- Just be quiet. - Okay.

2713
01:34:37,606 --> 01:34:38,675
(It's never-ending.)

2714
01:34:38,676 --> 01:34:39,876
- Number four, Germany. - Okay.

2715
01:34:40,646 --> 01:34:42,046
- Kikeriki. - Okay.

2716
01:34:42,316 --> 01:34:43,375
Kikeriki.

2717
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:45,215
(Dong Hyun chose number 4, kikeriki.)

2718
01:34:45,216 --> 01:34:46,885
- The chicken sound is... - I bet it's incorrect.

2719
01:34:46,886 --> 01:34:51,455
(Dong Hyun chose number 4, kikeriki.)

2720
01:34:51,456 --> 01:34:52,525
correct.

2721
01:34:52,526 --> 01:34:54,496
(It's a correct chicken sound.)

2722
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:57,195
(Thus, Dong Hyun is exempt from paying.)

2723
01:34:57,196 --> 01:34:58,566
- Then... - You pay.

2724
01:34:59,196 --> 01:35:00,726
- What? - You pay.

2725
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:03,295
Hold on.

2726
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:04,736
- Yes! - That can't be right.

2727
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,266
- Yes! - Yes!

2728
01:35:06,306 --> 01:35:08,575
Am I the one who needs to pay?

2729
01:35:08,576 --> 01:35:09,805
- It's you. - Is it me?

2730
01:35:09,806 --> 01:35:12,376
- Yes! - Yes!

2731
01:35:12,846 --> 01:35:14,675
I mean... Is that right?

2732
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:15,715
- Yes. - That's right.

2733
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:18,246
- That's right. - This is the perfect ending.

2734
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,416
- Is it really me? - Yes.

2735
01:35:20,486 --> 01:35:21,815
- Kikeriki. - I'm confused.

2736
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:23,355
(It was decided from the very beginning.)

2737
01:35:23,356 --> 01:35:25,556
Then I... How does it work?

2738
01:35:25,956 --> 01:35:27,725
You said that you'd accept Tae Hyun's words.

2739
01:35:27,726 --> 01:35:29,456
- Am I the one who needs to pay? - Yes.

2740
01:35:29,756 --> 01:35:30,855
You got it right.

2741
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,265
You asked Tae Hyun to tell you.

2742
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:33,325
Dong Hyun.

2743
01:35:33,326 --> 01:35:34,866
It's as we always say.

2744
01:35:35,166 --> 01:35:37,936
You'll know when you watch the episode.

2745
01:35:37,966 --> 01:35:40,165
- I'm so frustrated. - Do you think it's wrong?

2746
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:41,376
Are you wary?

2747
01:35:41,676 --> 01:35:43,175
Are you wary? Does something weigh on your mind?

2748
01:35:43,176 --> 01:35:44,305
Do you pay if you answer correctly?

2749
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:46,106
- Yes. - Germany was the correct answer.

2750
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:47,815
- Are you wary? - I'm frustrated.

2751
01:35:47,816 --> 01:35:49,115
- Are you frustrated? - Are you frustrated or wary?

2752
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:50,375
The shoot shouldn't drag on. Let's go.

2753
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:51,585
Okay.

2754
01:35:51,586 --> 01:35:54,045
I'll get too stressed out if the shoot drags on.

2755
01:35:54,046 --> 01:35:55,355
(Laughing)

2756
01:35:55,356 --> 01:35:56,855
- My thoughts are jumbled. - Are you wary?

2757
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:59,226
I'm very wary right now. But if the shoot drags on...

2758
01:36:00,426 --> 01:36:01,456
- That's right. - After all,

2759
01:36:01,696 --> 01:36:03,155
I get that you guys are frustrated.

2760
01:36:03,156 --> 01:36:04,926
But the owner is going...

2761
01:36:05,066 --> 01:36:06,095
(For goodness' sake)

2762
01:36:06,096 --> 01:36:09,135
So I don't think I can stay here any longer. Let's go.

2763
01:36:09,136 --> 01:36:10,735
- I'm so frustrated. - Dong Hyun.

2764
01:36:10,736 --> 01:36:11,806
- What? - Are you wary?

2765
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:13,466
- Dong Hyun. - Are you wary?

2766
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,305
- Just go ahead and pay. - I understand.

2767
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,775
It's your last chance. Think about it carefully.

2768
01:36:16,776 --> 01:36:19,676
That German chicken sound is correct.

2769
01:36:20,006 --> 01:36:21,006
(What?)

2770
01:36:21,007 --> 01:36:22,015
Hold on.

2771
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,446
(He senses that something is wrong.)

2772
01:36:23,816 --> 01:36:24,986
What is it exactly?

2773
01:36:26,516 --> 01:36:28,186
Do I pay or not?

2774
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,815
Just do as Tae Hyun says.

2775
01:36:29,816 --> 01:36:32,056
Tae Hyun told you.

2776
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:34,185
It's a matter of whether or not you understand.

2777
01:36:34,186 --> 01:36:35,356
I still don't understand.

2778
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:37,425
- How frustrating. - Just pay.

2779
01:36:37,426 --> 01:36:39,765
- Hurry up and pay. - The owner is frustrated.

2780
01:36:39,766 --> 01:36:40,896
(Then I'll pay.)

2781
01:36:41,266 --> 01:36:42,266
(Dong Hyun leaves.)

2782
01:36:42,267 --> 01:36:44,166
- Dong Hyun, aren't you wary? - What?

2783
01:36:44,436 --> 01:36:46,636
Explain to us why Yi Kyung should pay.

2784
01:36:47,306 --> 01:36:48,376
Should Yi Kyung pay?

2785
01:36:48,676 --> 01:36:49,975
- That's right. - Dong Hyun,

2786
01:36:49,976 --> 01:36:51,875
you're going back and forth so many times.

2787
01:36:51,876 --> 01:36:53,775
You don't understand.

2788
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:55,475
- Yi Kyung... - Okay.

2789
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,515
- So I don't need to pay. - Think about it carefully.

2790
01:36:57,516 --> 01:36:58,546
- Listen. - Listen.

2791
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:00,216
What was the original problem?

2792
01:37:01,086 --> 01:37:02,655
- The original problem. - The original problem...

2793
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:04,215
- was about finding... - The incorrect chicken sound.

2794
01:37:04,216 --> 01:37:05,655
- the incorrect chicken sound. - So...

2795
01:37:05,656 --> 01:37:08,495
you guys chose number two, and it was incorrect.

2796
01:37:08,496 --> 01:37:10,196
Is the number two chicken sound correct or incorrect?

2797
01:37:10,496 --> 01:37:12,125
It was about finding the incorrect one,

2798
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,925
- so the chicken sound is correct. - That's right.

2799
01:37:13,926 --> 01:37:15,295
So from the remaining three choices,

2800
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:16,695
- you had to find... - It was incorrect.

2801
01:37:16,696 --> 01:37:18,866
- the incorrect chicken sound. - That's right.

2802
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,605
- And... - What was number one?

2803
01:37:20,606 --> 01:37:22,675
- It's correct. - Number one was...

2804
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:24,576
- a correct chicken sound. - How about yours?

2805
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:26,446
My answer was...

2806
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:28,376
- a correct chicken sound. - Yes.

2807
01:37:29,146 --> 01:37:30,745
- That's why you need to pay. - Yes.

2808
01:37:30,746 --> 01:37:32,485
- You pay if it's correct. - That's why you need to pay.

2809
01:37:32,486 --> 01:37:34,285
Do you understand it or not?

2810
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:36,755
But Sang Uk's answer was also a correct chicken sound.

2811
01:37:36,756 --> 01:37:38,026
- Yes. - So was mine.

2812
01:37:38,556 --> 01:37:40,286
- Then why do I need to pay? - Exactly.

2813
01:37:40,556 --> 01:37:42,425
- Yi Kyung should pay. - That's right.

2814
01:37:42,426 --> 01:37:43,725
Everyone knows that.

2815
01:37:43,726 --> 01:37:45,795
- Yi Kyung should pay. - My goodness.

2816
01:37:45,796 --> 01:37:46,895
(He finally understands.)

2817
01:37:46,896 --> 01:37:49,496
You'll get scammed very easily.

2818
01:37:51,136 --> 01:37:52,306
Yi Kyung, you should pay.

2819
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:53,936
That's right.

2820
01:37:54,366 --> 01:37:57,335
(Oh, this is my card.)

2821
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:58,505
You should pay.

2822
01:37:58,506 --> 01:37:59,645
- That's right. - Do you understand?

2823
01:37:59,646 --> 01:38:01,815
Yi Kyung, go and pay with Dong Hyun's card.

2824
01:38:01,816 --> 01:38:04,275
I'll watch the episode...

2825
01:38:04,276 --> 01:38:06,746
and analyze the situation on paper.

2826
01:38:06,846 --> 01:38:08,416
I'll need to write things down.

2827
01:38:08,756 --> 01:38:10,655
- Go ahead. - Are you paying all three times?

2828
01:38:10,656 --> 01:38:12,655
- Seriously. - Gosh, today...

2829
01:38:12,656 --> 01:38:13,986
I didn't pay in the past.

2830
01:38:14,026 --> 01:38:16,125
- You did it in 1 go. - I did it in 1 go.

2831
01:38:16,126 --> 01:38:18,095
