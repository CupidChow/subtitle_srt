1
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,873
(Hongdae, Mapo-gu)

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:37,513
(The front of a dorm in Hongdae, 9am)

3
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:40,543
(A car arrives at the dorm in early morning.)

4
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:44,783
(Who is the first member to come to work?)

5
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:49,383
Hello.

6
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:50,923
What is it?

7
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:52,393
(Halting)

8
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,863
(A red carpet?)

9
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:57,833
Goodbye.

10
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,463
(He's leaving work early just like that?)

11
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,433
What is this?

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,373
(Standing awkwardly)

13
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:08,843
Come on in.

14
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,843
(Come in.)

15
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,243
You're treating me so well.

16
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:19,053
What is happening?

17
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,853
Life in Shortage...

18
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:23,853
Hello.

19
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,653
Strike a pose.

20
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,523
Okay. Is this the photo spot?

21
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:28,923
Well, sure.

22
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:31,393
I do this every now and then, especially in the year end.

23
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,993
Hello. Hi.

24
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,203
Hello.

25
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:39,673
Yes, well, what...

26
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,403
- You can go up now.
- What?

27
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:42,873
Go up.

28
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,073
- Is that it?
- Go up.

29
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,243
It was fun.

30
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:51,983
(A black car rolls in next.)

31
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,683
Red? What is this?

32
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,123
(Dressed in a shirt that makes him look like he's from film noir)

33
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,123
Hello.

34
00:01:58,693 --> 00:01:59,753
Red?

35
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,363
(Sneezing)

36
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:02,423
Excuse me.

37
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,393
Is it because of the sun?

38
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,563
(Making strange sounds)

39
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:11,933
Red?

40
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:12,973
(He gets serious again.)

41
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:15,473
A red carpet.

42
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,773
I should wave my hand.

43
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:19,743
(Dong Hyun has a photo time on the red carpet too.)

44
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:20,743
Okay.

45
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,643
(He clocks in.)

46
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,713
It's nice.

47
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:26,583
Hello.

48
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,283
(Thinking)

49
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,523
There's electricity.

50
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:34,493
(Checking if the air conditioner is working?)

51
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:41,363
(Who is the next member in the white car?)

52
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,343
(Showing off his long legs,)

53
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:51,173
(here he comes.)

54
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,613
(How long...)

55
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:59,053
(are his legs?)

56
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:05,023
(Walking in strides)

57
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:08,863
(He takes over the red carpet with his tall build.)

58
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,823
Strike a pose.

59
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,333
(His brake malfunctions.)

60
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,503
(Good morning.)

61
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:17,403
(Seung Ho, who only looks forward, clocks in!)

62
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:22,643
(Who will step on the red carpet next?)

63
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,213
Gosh, thank you for your hard work.

64
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,883
(Good morning.)

65
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,183
Do I walk?

66
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,113
Goodness.

67
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,753
(The fencing emperor in a suit comes back.)

68
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:36,783
Hello.

69
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,953
(The fencing emperor in a suit comes back.)

70
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:40,593
(Saying hi over the wall)

71
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,993
- Make a pose.
- Strike a pose.

72
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:45,493
(How will the fencing emperor pose on the red carpet?)

73
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,243
(Feeling shy)

74
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,683
(And the final member arrives.)

75
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:04,913
(Getting down)

76
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,413
What is this?

77
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,323
What's happening?

78
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,063
What is this?

79
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,093
(He's a bit confused.)

80
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,163
What is this?

81
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,363
Why a red carpet out of nowhere?

82
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,633
(Actor Cha quickly gets used to it and starts walking naturally.)

83
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,673
Today...

84
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:28,843
There should be a photo spot and a lot of cameras.

85
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,403
Strike a pose there.

86
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,913
(Actor Cha has a photo time too.)

87
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:34,543
It's been a while since I've done this.

88
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:38,083
(The national first love's cute pose...)

89
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,523
(that won over Su Ji)

90
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,653
You only prepared a red carpet.

91
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,893
(You only prepared a red carpet.)

92
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:50,493
You only got a red carpet.

93
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:51,563
(Lastly, Tae Hyun clocks in!)

94
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:52,763
My goodness.

95
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,863
- Do I go up?
- Yes.

96
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,563
What's happening?

97
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:58,773
It's strange.

98
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,603
You look cool, Sang Uk. A suit commercial.

99
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,143
- I'd love to shoot one.
- You'd get one right away.

100
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:05,713
How did you pose downstairs?

101
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:06,843
- Me?
- Yes.

102
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:07,913
You did this again, didn't you?

103
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:08,983
(You caught me.)

104
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,313
You always do this.

105
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,713
- Did you do this again?
- I saw the red carpet,

106
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,323
and it looked exactly like the fencing court floor.

107
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,353
I see.

108
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:18,693
- So did you do this again?
- Yes, I did that again.

109
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,753
Really?

110
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,393
My body was moving before I realized.

111
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,193
I opened my eyes, and I was striking that pose.

112
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,493
- You pierced right away.
- Yes.

113
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,093
What is this?

114
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,493
- Tae Hyun.
- Hi.

115
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,963
(Everyone stands up.)

116
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,073
Hello.

117
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:32,133
- Hello.
- Hello, Chairman.

118
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,433
- What...
- Hello, Tae Hyun.

119
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,343
The red carpet...

120
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:36,673
- Nice to see you.
- Me too.

121
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:37,843
- Tae Hyun.
- Hi.

122
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:40,043
(They shake hands one after another as if enchanted.)

123
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,313
You're dressed in a color that general managers like to wear.

124
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,653
Manager. Isn't this from the Fifth Republic of Korea?

125
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,753
The color during the Fifth Republic.

126
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:47,753
Like this...

127
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,483
- Is it?
- It's the color.

128
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,523
Yes. Look.

129
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,393
Seung Ho when he was a bodyguard.

130
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:55,823
It's just like him from his bodyguard days.

131
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,323
- I didn't know.
- Going back to your roots?

132
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,563
Yes. Just like back then.

133
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,693
How long have you had the life as a bodyguard?

134
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,163
"Had the life as?"

135
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,733
How should I say it?

136
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,133
(What kind of life are you talking about?)

137
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,173
Life...

138
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,973
Allow me to speak.

139
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,403
My life...

140
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:12,243
(Thinking)

141
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:14,543
Life... About 4 to 5 months?

142
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,343
It wasn't for that long.

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,453
It was for a short while, and yet, you went viral...

144
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:21,653
because you looked very handsome.

145
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:22,853
(He steals people's attentions just by wearing a suit.)

146
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,753
It looks like he's back to being a bodyguard.

147
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,693
It's so different from last week.

148
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,923
- The air-con works fine.
- The air-con works fine.

149
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,063
(Unlike last week, they're in a pleasant indoor environment.)

150
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,733
- We're dressed nicely too.
- Yes.

151
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,163
What are they going to make us do?

152
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,763
- What's there to be short of today?
- Our concept...

153
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,333
Why are we dressed in suits?

154
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,273
Is it shortage in spandex?

155
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:42,573
This is so nice.

156
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,673
Today,

157
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,743
- everyone is dressed nicely.
- Yes.

158
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:49,043
Your Life in Shortage today...

159
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:52,013
is Shortage in Fashion.

160
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,253
(Today's Life in Shortage: Shortage in Fashion)

161
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:54,853
- Fashion?
- What?

162
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:56,783
We went way overboard with fashion, though.

163
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,153
- Now...
- I have a bad feeling.

164
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,293
Please come in.

165
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,453
- Fashion?
- What's coming in?

166
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,793
I have a bad feeling.

167
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,533
Come on.

168
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,363
- You want us to go out in these?
- How do you do that?

169
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:10,533
In Hongdae?

170
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,473
(A mecca of buskers and fashion)

171
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,543
(Hongdae)

172
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:19,873
(Countless fashion has been worn by Team Handsome.)

173
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,513
(Team Handsome's fashion disappears in Hongdae?)

174
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:22,943
(Team Handsome minus fashion)

175
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,053
(I have to live just in my underwear.)

176
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:28,653
(For Team Handsome with Shortage in Fashion,)

177
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,723
(we've prepared luxurious three-striped slippers,)

178
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,093
(blue plaid shorts,)

179
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:33,893
(rose-patterned outfit,)

180
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,363
(cute and lovely pink ribbon,)

181
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,793
(an orangutan,)

182
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,763
(and a cherry blossom party in September.)

183
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:45,003
(Fashion zero, Team Handsome's Spring-Summer collection)

184
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,773
(Shall we live the life without fashion?)

185
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,843
It's embarrassing.

186
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,913
- Wait, please explain in detail.
- It's embarrassing.

187
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,643
By Shortage in Fashion, do you mean...

188
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,883
You shouldn't have told us to dress up like this.

189
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,153
That's way too much.

190
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:03,523
I should show off more.

191
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,323
We really...

192
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:06,923
I should show off more.

193
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,123
We were saying Sang Uk looks like he's in a suit commercial.

194
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,393
I think they'll get us out of these suits soon enough.

195
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,503
(Sighing)

196
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,503
Hold on a minute.

197
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,533
(Did he spot something?)

198
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,573
This is...

199
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,673
This is... Hold on.

200
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:26,043
(Short)

201
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:27,913
- This...
- Isn't that underwear?

202
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,843
- That's underwear.
- What...

203
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,113
Isn't this Dong Hyun's?

204
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,283
If you sit down...

205
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,123
- Sang Uk, look.
- It's Dong Hyun's.

206
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,393
If Sang Uk and I were to wear this...

207
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,053
It's too short.

208
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,363
- It's too short.
- It's a trunk.

209
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,893
It's too wide, so if you're not careful...

210
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,903
- Goodness.
- This won't pass the rating review.

211
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,863
- Safety pants...
- So...

212
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,473
- This...
- Let me explain.

213
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:54,233
Soon, we'll take away your outfits.

214
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,773
You'll change into these outfits...

215
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,543
and stay in them for 2 days and 1 night.

216
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:02,843
In one pair of clothes?

217
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,753
- Yes. And as you can see?
- One pair only?

218
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,353
The shorts all come in different designs.

219
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,023
Whoever wins first...

220
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:13,553
will get to choose the outfit first.

221
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,123
Even if you win, what can you take?

222
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,763
You should make some distinctions. They're all terrible.

223
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,863
No, that's way too short.

224
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,063
Those are longer.

225
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,933
- This is the worst.
- This is really...

226
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,643
To me, this is as good as cropped pants.

227
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,643
Hold on. Are these long pants?

228
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:31,943
(Today's customers gather hurriedly in bewilderment.)

229
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:33,373
- These...
- They're not.

230
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,573
- This...
- That's better at least.

231
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,043
- Better than the rest.
- That's the best option.

232
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,743
Honestly, my favorites are these two.

233
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,883
- This is fine too.
- These two.

234
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,923
- Those two are wearable.
- Yes, these look fine.

235
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,623
These two are rather hip.

236
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,193
Isn't that your phone case?

237
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,123
- What?
- Your phone case.

238
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,593
(No wonder he's attracted to it.)

239
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,363
- They're matched.
- That's why you like it.

240
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:53,593
This is really...

241
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,663
You must sit modestly.

242
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,163
That's crazy.

243
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,873
It's really smaller than my underwear.

244
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,373
It really is smaller than my underwear.

245
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,743
I prepared welcome drinks...

246
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,613
for you guys.

247
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,813
(Welcome drinks?)

248
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:07,943
Welcome drinks?

249
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,743
I was thirsty. My gosh!

250
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,043
- It's our favorite.
- It's Coca Cola.

251
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,313
- What's this?
- Nice.

252
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,383
It's our go-to drink.

253
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,053
You will now drink a can of coke each...

254
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,523
and have a competition to hold in your burp.

255
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,293
(A competition to pick the outfits)

256
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:21,253
(Hold In Your Burp)

257
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,523
How long you hold in your burp after drinking a can of coke...

258
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,933
will decide your rank.

259
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,063
- It starts once we finish the can?
- That's right.

260
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,903
The winner will choose the outfit,

261
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:32,433
- The winner gets to choose first.
- followed by the runner-up.

262
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,673
Instead of just holding it in,

263
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,503
we should sing a song or something.

264
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,443
Won't you burp right away if you sing?

265
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,043
- Are you going to time me first?
- Yes.

266
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,543
He'll start timing you once you're done drinking.

267
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,383
- I'll drink.
- Go on.

268
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,623
(Suddenly pausing)

269
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,423
You only drank that much?

270
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,193
Tae Hyun, this...

271
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,753
- Did you feel it right away?
- Is it very gassy?

272
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,493
How do you do this?

273
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,393
- It must be gassy.
- It looks hard.

274
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,233
He drinks fast.

275
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,963
I can't hold in my burp. I'm in big trouble.

276
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:06,633
(Exhaling)

277
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,543
- Didn't you burp in secret?
- I'm tearing up.

278
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,743
- I think he burped quietly.
- No.

279
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,413
I'm holding it in as I breathe out.

280
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,443
(Tears are welling up instead of a burp.)

281
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:16,583
He's holding it in.

282
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,753
Was coke always this sad?

283
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:23,753
You can drink it before acting a sad scene.

284
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,853
It's better to drink fast and measure the time.

285
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,923
(With teary eyes, he starts gulping down again.)

286
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,123
It's hard to hold it in.

287
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,963
(He finishes his coke!)

288
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,703
- Swallow it.
- It starts now.

289
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:38,133
- Yes, this much.
- Start singing.

290
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,433
You can do this much.

291
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,073
(Rest for a count.)

292
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,043
(Rest for two counts.)

293
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:46,973
- Sing.
- Say something.

294
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,213
(Rest for 3 and 4 counts.)

295
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,013
Is he letting out the gas like that?

296
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,953
(Butterfly)

297
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:53,253
(Butterfly)

298
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:54,653
That's how he does it.

299
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,483
That's how he holds it in.

300
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,853
I guess he can control it.

301
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:00,253
Keep singing.

302
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,763
(Fly to me)

303
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,033
You can't stop.

304
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,163
(Swallowtail butterfly, white butterfly)

305
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,103
(Dance as you fly to me)

306
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,673
Okay. Move on to the next person.

307
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,303
(Struggling)

308
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:16,743
You're holding it in for so long.

309
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,313
Do you credit it to his patience or...

310
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:19,913
I should avoid this.

311
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,783
You're holding it in for so long.

312
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,143
Seung Ho is winning.

313
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,813
Seung Ho is pretty much the winner.

314
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,683
- Bottoms up.
- I don't know.

315
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,553
Bottoms up at once.

316
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,083
Don't stop and keep drinking.

317
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:33,293
I feel dizzy.

318
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,593
Just let out your burp.

319
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,833
(He gulps down without stopping.)

320
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,963
Nice.

321
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,563
He drinks so well.

322
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,633
(His burp...)

323
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,573
(is released with a loud sound.)

324
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,403
He held it in so well.

325
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,413
(Seung Ho held it in well, but he ends here.)

326
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:53,473
(He summons a lion with his burp.)

327
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,843
You held it in for so long.

328
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,043
- The flower pants.
- His eyes have gone mad.

329
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,913
Put the can down.

330
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,353
Put the can down.

331
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:01,653
Start.

332
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:02,823
(He finishes his coke!)

333
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,193
- No, remove your hands.
- You have to sing.

334
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,353
Sing.

335
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:07,953
Sing.

336
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,163
- Remove your hands.
- You can't cover your mouth.

337
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,533
Sing.

338
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,333
- Don't cover your mouth.
- If you do that one more time,

339
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,503
we'll deduct five seconds from your record.

340
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,133
- Sing.
- Five seconds for each time.

341
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,333
- Sing.
- Start.

342
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,403
(The school bell rings)

343
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:22,943
(Covering his mouth)

344
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,743
(The school bell rings)

345
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,513
He technically burped.

346
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,143
- He burped.
- You burped.

347
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,513
(And that is Sang Uk's record.)

348
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,813
Measure properly.

349
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,283
(Okay.)

350
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:37,053
- Stop now.
- He burped long ago.

351
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:39,623
Why did you...

352
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:40,723
Are you okay?

353
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:43,663
He keeps burping.

354
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:46,263
- I can't stop.
- I think this is better.

355
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:47,663
I can't really drink coke either,

356
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,733
- but I'll try my best.
- Yes.

357
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,003
Just finish it in one shot.

358
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:54,173
(He starts drinking coke fast!)

359
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:57,643
I think...

360
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:00,813
either Yi Kyung or I will end up with this.

361
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,883
The taller guys will try to avoid this.

362
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,413
Yes, I can't wear that.

363
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,223
- That's technically underwear.
- It makes you tear up, right?

364
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,383
(Meanwhile, Yi Kyung bottoms up the coke!)

365
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,123
It's pretty wide.

366
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:15,123
(He turns on the song for Yi Kyung.)

367
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:19,393
("Destiny" by Monday Kiz and Lee Yi Kyung)

368
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,263
(The destiny)

369
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:23,933
(Cut off)

370
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,203
What are you doing?

371
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:26,603
(Breathing out)

372
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,103
(He takes a deep breath again.)

373
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:29,373
- See? That's what happens.
- Sing.

374
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,643
(Panting)

375
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,883
I'm feeling it.

376
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:42,823
It's coming.

377
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,893
(Laughing nervously)

378
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:56,303
(Panting)

379
00:14:56,403 --> 00:15:00,173
(What a sweet voice.)

380
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,973
(Burping)

381
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,043
That's it.

382
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,743
Are you throwing up?

383
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:07,973
(Fidgety)

384
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,843
(2nd burp)

385
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,513
(3rd burp)

386
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,253
(4th burp)

387
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,813
(5th burp)

388
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,083
(6th burp)

389
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:17,923
That was like throwing up.

390
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:19,493
Six consecutive burps.

391
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,053
(It's 7!)

392
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,923
- It really makes you tear up.
- Rock paper scissors.

393
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,763
(These two are the remaining contestants.)

394
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:26,963
- What's after that?
- It's you.

395
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,303
They're so funny.

396
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,103
- They have the lyrics ready.
- Yes.

397
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,443
(They're more interested in singing than holding in their burp.)

398
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:37,543
What's after that?

399
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,043
(I'm so excited.)

400
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,713
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You got it.

401
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:45,313
- You're still burping?
- I can't stop.

402
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:47,153
It's so gassy.

403
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,253
(Next is Fighter Dong Hyun's turn.)

404
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,583
I've done this many times.

405
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,023
- You've done it?
- Sung Hoon and I.

406
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,253
Sung Hoon did this too?

407
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,523
We even drank 500ml.

408
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,193
- Really? For holding in the burp?
- Yes.

409
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:58,333
- I'll finish this the fastest.
- Okay.

410
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,593
I can bottoms up.

411
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:05,633
(With Sung Hoon whom I respect,)

412
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:10,003
(I've honed my coke drinking skill.)

413
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,873
- Okay.
- Put it on the table. Sing.

414
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,673
(Holding in a burp is nothing.)

415
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,283
(I regret it)

416
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:24,283
(What...)

417
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,223
(happened?)

418
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,163
(The camera shakes badly.)

419
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:33,463
(Something just passed by.)

420
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:36,063
- You drank...
- It smells.

421
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,533
The lyrics happens to be "I regret it."

422
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,373
(I regret it)

423
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,203
I tried to hold it in,

424
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,943
but if I did, the next one could've been worse.

425
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:46,073
So I couldn't. How did you hold it in?

426
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,843
- That was amazing.
- Seung Ho is incredible.

427
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:48,943
You're amazing.

428
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,283
I have a feeling he's in last place. Right?

429
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:53,353
- You should try it.
- Not yet.

430
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,453
(Dong Hyun, please.)

431
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:57,823
- How did he hold it in?
- You can't help it. It won't stop.

432
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,623
Here I go.

433
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:00,893
(Tae Hyun, the final contestant, starts!)

434
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:02,663
- Yes. Show us what you've got.
- That's fast.

435
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,323
Drink fast.

436
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,863
He drinks so fast.

437
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,093
It's hard to drink fast too.

438
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,103
- Already?
- Hold on.

439
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,833
(I just heard something.)

440
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,673
He burped as he drank!

441
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,073
- He burped as he drank.
- Come on.

442
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,703
- You burped.
- It's over.

443
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,913
My goodness.

444
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,273
I heard a frog.

445
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,113
Let's hear him sing.

446
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:23,483
Let's finish it.

447
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,253
I heard a frog.

448
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:31,083
He couldn't sing at all.

449
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:34,393
(The song of a sad frog)

450
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,763
How did you guys hold it in?

451
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:40,133
You tried to hide it while drinking, but you got caught.

452
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,363
While you were drinking...

453
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,133
How did you hold it in?

454
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,063
I couldn't even finish drinking.

455
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,633
- It isn't easy, right?
- You guys are amazing.

456
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,903
- I'll announce the winner first.
- The winner.

457
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,773
- How did you do it?
- The winner is...

458
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,443
- Seung Ho.
- He was outstanding.

459
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:54,973
Your record is 1 minute 35 seconds.

460
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,953
In second place is Yi Kyung...

461
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,913
- with 52 seconds.
- I held it in for quite long.

462
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,023
- You did pretty well.
- In third place...

463
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:06,193
- is Sang Uk with 29 seconds.
- Sang Uk.

464
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:07,253
- Twenty-nine seconds.
- Twenty-nine seconds.

465
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,893
In fourth place is Dong Hyun...

466
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:10,923
with five seconds.

467
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,233
What about Tae Hyun?

468
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,733
- Tae Hyun?
- He's below zero.

469
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,463
His record was zero seconds.

470
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,703
He's still burping.

471
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,703
(5th place, Cha Tae Hyun: 0 seconds)

472
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,103
- We'll start with the winner.
- I can't stop burping.

473
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,033
- Seung Ho will choose his outfit.
- Go ahead.

474
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,373
Just like Yi Kyung said earlier,

475
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:26,843
it would've been nice if there were better options.

476
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,073
There aren't.

477
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,183
They're almost the same.

478
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,143
- That's a skirt.
- Try that on.

479
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,183
(Is this the back?)

480
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,613
- Is this yours?
- This is why...

481
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,613
- I'm on the fence.
- It's perfect!

482
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,623
It's a design he prefers.

483
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:36,983
I can't turn away from this.

484
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,893
From a story perspective, this suits you.

485
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,393
Exactly, and we all love a good story.

486
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,563
- We're all for good stories.
- Absolutely.

487
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,123
I'll...

488
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,763
- You should take it.
- I'll take this.

489
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,493
- I'll complete the story.
- That should be yours.

490
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,563
That should be yours.

491
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:50,003
I'll go next since I'm in second place.

492
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,303
I'll...

493
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:52,633
leave this behind...

494
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,803
for my older brothers.

495
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,543
(This is for the older members.)

496
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,603
I'll go with the most basic one.

497
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,143
This seems basic.

498
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,743
Will that cut my screen time?

499
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,013
(Will that cut my screen time?)

500
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,343
Will that cut my screen time?

501
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,583
That's possible.

502
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:06,913
The red one's a good choice.

503
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,053
Think about your screen time.

504
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,123
- Leave that.
- There are red flowers on the back.

505
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:12,453
Don't. Leave the red one.

506
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,993
I should wear the red one just like Dong Hyun.

507
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:16,293
That's a good one.

508
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,363
It's made of good fabric.

509
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,423
I'll choose this.

510
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,433
Sure.

511
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,663
That's the most basic one.

512
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:21,793
Sure.

513
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,833
(He didn't fall for it.)

514
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,073
- Considering what's left...
- Sang Uk, you're up.

515
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:28,303
There's not a big difference between 3rd place and 4th.

516
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,703
(Still, he shops carefully.)

517
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,443
The stars will look good on you.

518
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:33,643
That's pretty.

519
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:34,973
- That's nice.
- Right?

520
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,583
The fabric looks nice as well.

521
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,443
He's not even touching that one.

522
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,513
He won't even touch the one with red flowers.

523
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,613
Why don't you try that on?

524
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,683
Isn't it already on you?

525
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,983
Let's see how short it is.

526
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,293
I'll try it on.

527
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,323
Try it on top of your pants.

528
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,423
Let's see how short it is.

529
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:48,493
On you, it's...

530
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,763
I'm not kidding...

531
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,293
when I say my underwear is this length.

532
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,093
It comes up to here.

533
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,333
- That...
- Seriously.

534
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,803
(They're lost for words.)

535
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:56,933
Are you sure this isn't underwear?

536
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,433
It sits here without me pulling it up.

537
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,573
His legs are really long.

538
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,733
That...

539
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,143
You can't wear that. It'll be a disaster.

540
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,203
- What about Dong Hyun?
- I'd love it.

541
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,243
You're fine with this.

542
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:05,443
Sang Uk should choose first.

543
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,913
He might choose it.

544
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:09,343
(Of course, he doesn't choose it.)

545
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,743
- I'll take this one.
- Okay.

546
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:12,853
This has a nice feeling to it.

547
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:14,353
- Got it.
- It stretches.

548
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:15,823
- Dong Hyun...
- I like the fabric.

549
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,923
What will Dong Hyun choose?

550
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,153
Let me feel the fabric.

551
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,223
- This...
- Done. You made your choice.

552
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:21,923
Done. You made your choice.

553
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,923
(What?)

554
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,223
- Is it final?
- Wait, no.

555
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,693
(Why isn't it the big flowers?)

556
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:27,733
You said it was final.

557
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,803
You said it yourself.

558
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:29,963
- This is yours.
- What?

559
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,863
- This is for you.
- You said it was final.

560
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,203
Look at them bickering.

561
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,673
You...

562
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,073
This is perfect for you.

563
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,343
What's wrong?

564
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,343
(What's wrong with the choice I made?)

565
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,413
Don't you like this?

566
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,713
Make a deal or something.

567
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:45,613
Why should I when it's my turn to choose?

568
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,353
I won and chose this outfit.

569
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:48,583
- What are you talking about?
- Dong Hyun.

570
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,753
- Let's do this.
- Tell me.

571
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,723
- There's a feature on these pants.
- What is it?

572
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:53,253
I only just saw it.

573
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,693
Anyone who takes these...

574
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,523
has to wear them like Mom jeans.

575
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,833
(Mom jeans?)

576
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,393
That's how it should be worn.

577
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,963
- Highlight the feature.
- Show off the ribbon.

578
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,163
(Sighing)

579
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,333
Fine.

580
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,473
(Fine)

581
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,803
- What?
- He didn't fall for it.

582
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,403
- I got it.
- You can't fool him.

583
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,543
- I'll wear it like so.
- This is too short.

584
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:11,773
Does Tae Hyun have to wear these?

585
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,643
- Let me know if it's too much.
- It's fine.

586
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,613
Are you sure about me wearing these?

587
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,213
It could be...

588
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,213
risky.

589
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,253
- He's a father of three.
- Guys.

590
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:22,523
Come on, guys.

591
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,883
Can you share what makes this so risky?

592
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,723
You're all dead today. Forget it.

593
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:27,853
We're all dead?

594
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:30,323
Seung Ho, you first.

595
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,893
(Shortage in Fashion, Time to change)

596
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,133
Seung Ho, come on down.

597
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:37,603
(Excited)

598
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:43,703
(Hi!)

599
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:45,473
What did I tell you?

600
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:46,613
Seung Ho looks good.

601
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:49,383
- The design suits him.
- Tell me about it.

602
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:51,083
It's like he wore them on purpose.

603
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,653
You look good.

604
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:53,953
(Posing)

605
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:54,953
Look at him.

606
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:57,723
It's like he chose to wear this.

607
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,593
I saw Yi Kyung,

608
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:01,193
and he looked like he came straight from home.

609
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:03,123
His and mine look like pajamas.

610
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:05,463
- So wear this instead.
- It felt homey.

611
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:06,493
Here.

612
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,033
I'll...

613
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,503
I'll wear that boring outfit.

614
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,433
(I'll let you have the floral pants.)

615
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,473
You should be the man of the hour today.

616
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,643
I'll let you take center stage.

617
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:18,343
This is too flashy.

618
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,773
I must say this is comfortable.

619
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,313
You look like you came from home.

620
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:22,483
That's true.

621
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,713
Is this...

622
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,843
your house?

623
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,713
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Sure thing.

624
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,123
This is what it feels like.

625
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:32,653
I went from being in a suit...

626
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,123
to wearing this, right?

627
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:36,163
I couldn't look any shabbier.

628
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,763
- It's true.
- Off I go.

629
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:39,163
Sang Uk's tall, so...

630
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,833
(Glancing)

631
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,763
- You know what?
- It won't seem awkward.

632
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:44,933
Here's what I got...

633
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,303
from that look on your face.

634
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:48,533
You're drawn to this, aren't you?

635
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,303
(Busted)

636
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,343
- That?
- He's right.

637
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:53,343
- Dong Hyun finds it bland.
- Exactly.

638
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:54,943
It's too bland for him.

639
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,643
You're absolutely right.

640
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:58,583
- I don't want to switch...
- You...

641
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,453
because you want this.

642
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,713
Okay.

643
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,323
(The older members can't let others be happy.)

644
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:04,653
- You...
- Just so you know...

645
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,723
You'll regret this for two weeks.

646
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:09,563
- Look at him.
- Come on.

647
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:10,963
- How is this not underwear?
- It's like you came from home.

648
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:13,133
That looks like underwear for sure.

649
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,263
Even though this is one of the longer shorts...

650
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:16,733
Please don't point the camera this way.

651
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:19,403
You look like you came from home.

652
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:20,603
This...

653
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:23,143
- Isn't his longer?
- This is longer.

654
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:24,343
Mine are longer. Look.

655
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,403
Those are way longer.

656
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,473
They get pulled up when you sit.

657
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,473
I didn't like the design.

658
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,643
See? He had standards.

659
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:32,953
Even he agrees that yours is the most bland.

660
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,083
Last chance.

661
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,113
What will it be?

662
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,483
- Tae Hyun...
- Come on.

663
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,223
- You...
- Whatever.

664
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:39,353
This is your last chance.

665
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:41,023
- It'll be settled if you leave.
- Sure thing.

666
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,393
- Dong Hyun.
- Here I go.

667
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,493
- You...
- Look at Tae Hyun's face.

668
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,093
- I'm good too.
- Really?

669
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,163
Off I go.

670
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:48,293
You...

671
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,633
Off I go.

672
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,833
He looks as if he was desperate...

673
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,373
to stop me.

674
00:23:54,073 --> 00:23:55,703
You'll be boring today.

675
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:58,243
(Dong Hyun, you'll be boring today.)

676
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,943
You'll be extremely boring today.

677
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,713
How about this?

678
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,783
Let's say, "Gosh, it's so boring."

679
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:05,783
We'll act like it's bland and boring.

680
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,313
Who's the cameraman filming Dong Hyun?

681
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,483
(Dong Hyun's cameraman)

682
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:10,523
Sir,

683
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,353
when Dong Hyun's in view,

684
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:13,593
click your tongue.

685
00:24:13,593 --> 00:24:14,923
(Clicking tongue)

686
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:18,463
(That sounds like fun!)

687
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:19,663
Just this once.

688
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,363
Hi, guys.

689
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:24,803
(Just then, the clueless prey enters.)

690
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:27,373
(They're suddenly quiet.)

691
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:30,773
(Method acting begins.)

692
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,473
(He bounces his belly out of awkwardness.)

693
00:24:35,883 --> 00:24:37,313
- What is it?
- It's worse than I thought.

694
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:39,283
- Is it too bland?
- It's too bland.

695
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,453
Well, the fun will be provided by Tae Hyun.

696
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,023
- With those shorts.
- I...

697
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:44,583
Don't be jealous of me.

698
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,423
There's no switching.

699
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:47,923
- You...
- It's too bland.

700
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:50,263
You want it so much that I won't switch.

701
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:52,093
Do you know how bland this is?

702
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,693
Let's ask your cameraman. What do you think?

703
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,863
(Sucks teeth)

704
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,733
(Sighing...)

705
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,003
(He loses his balance.)

706
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,543
I can't believe he did that.

707
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,713
They made you do that, didn't they?

708
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,843
How could we have asked him that?

709
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,413
- How could we have asked him?
- It seems to me...

710
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,643
that you did.

711
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,143
Unbelievable.

712
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,753
Dong Hyun, look.

713
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:14,753
(Dong Hyun, check this out.)

714
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:17,583
(Tae Hyun, no!)

715
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,623
Tae Hyun...

716
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:21,223
You look like you're about to step on a ring.

717
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:23,163
Dong Hyun, I bet you're jealous.

718
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:24,493
Pull it up some more.

719
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:26,993
Gosh, the design.

720
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:29,033
- Nice.
- I love it.

721
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,103
(You can't hide the entertainment value.)

722
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:33,273
He's right. There's this, Tae Hyun.

723
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:35,843
If you lower your t-shirt, the shorts now look cool.

724
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:38,143
You look like a runner.

725
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:39,443
(Eureka!)

726
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:40,473
Doesn't he look like a runner?

727
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,213
If I end up going outside,

728
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,213
I'll keep running.

729
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,283
You'll keep running?

730
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:46,553
(A runner?)

731
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:47,753
In those shorts?

732
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:48,953
No way.

733
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,083
I'll cover my face.

734
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,693
Yes, be a runner!

735
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:54,693
(Runner Cha running in the Hongdae area)

736
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:55,993
Aren't you Cha Tae Hyun?

737
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:57,693
Oh, no.

738
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:58,793
You can't be running.

739
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,793
(He's just Tae Hyun in floral shorts.)

740
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,533
Anyway, you seem satisfied...

741
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,263
with your breathable outfits.

742
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,333
I'll let you know...

743
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:09,743
something important you must do for this week's Shortage in Fashion.

744
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,843
(An important schedule?)

745
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:13,973
Today, at 2:30pm,

746
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,213
you will visit the CJ ENM building in Sangam-dong.

747
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:18,783
There's a meeting with the tvN marketing team...

748
00:26:18,783 --> 00:26:21,483
and another with the chief director to discuss the show's future.

749
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,723
(Wasn't taking away our clothes enough?)

750
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:25,923
(He can't believe what he just heard.)

751
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:29,163
(We're going to the office looking like this?)

752
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,623
Are you kidding me?

753
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,133
The CJ ENM building?

754
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,433
A meeting to discuss the show's future?

755
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,933
This show could be canceled at any time.

756
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,903
That's why we'll voice our complaints.

757
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:39,403
(This show is more like a zombie.)

758
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,573
(They calm down for a second.)

759
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:41,603
Are you kidding me?

760
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:42,773
We're off to the office wearing this?

761
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,343
- What do we do?
- After the meeting,

762
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:45,673
at 8pm,

763
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,243
you'll go bowling and arrange flowers...

764
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:48,843
with club members.

765
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,913
What?

766
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:51,183
- Bowling?
- Yes, bowling.

767
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:52,243
You all know this,

768
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,653
but bowling requires the use of your legs.

769
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,153
Arranging flowers?

770
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,753
Wouldn't there be...

771
00:26:57,153 --> 00:27:00,223
many ladies in the club for flower arranging?

772
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:02,223
Don't you also think that?

773
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:04,063
- And guys will be bowling.
- I...

774
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:06,063
I'm dressed perfectly for flower arranging.

775
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,793
- You already arranged some.
- That's a lot of flowers.

776
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,263
- I'm dressed perfectly.
- You're right.

777
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:14,103
And tomorrow at noon,

778
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,603
there will be an autograph signing event...

779
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,603
at a major shopping mall in Yeongdeungpo.

780
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,043
(What did you just say?)

781
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:22,173
What?

782
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,643
- What?
- What are you saying?

783
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,043
- I went there last week...
- That's too much.

784
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,713
to greet fans for my movie.

785
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,353
Yeongdeungpo?

786
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:30,083
(An autograph signing event looking like this?)

787
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,423
(A meeting with the tvN marketing team...)

788
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:34,853
(and a meeting with the chief director)

789
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,663
(Difficulty level: 2)

790
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:38,963
(The building is packed with people, but there are many places to hide.)

791
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:41,163
(Club activities)

792
00:27:41,163 --> 00:27:43,363
(Difficulty level: 3)

793
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:44,863
(They will crash club meetings in clothes...)

794
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,333
(that are embarrassing to be caught in.)

795
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,143
(Team Handsome autograph signing event)

796
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:54,173
(Difficulty level: 6)

797
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,543
(Not only will there be many people,)

798
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,883
(but their photos could be posted on social media.)

799
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:00,653
Wait. You haven't told us about our lunch and dinner plans.

800
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:01,783
There are...

801
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,583
many restaurants in the area.

802
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,293
- Look here.
- Delivery!

803
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,293
This is...

804
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:08,753
You're going to let us loose like this?

805
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,423
You can eat however you want.

806
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,863
- You can choose how you'll eat.
- Oh, let's order delivery.

807
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:13,563
However, delivery is not allowed.

808
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:15,463
(They can buy food to go or eat out, but they can't get delivery food.)

809
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:17,463
We could go to a very small restaurant...

810
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,473
with only one table that can't fit more than just us.

811
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,803
- A one-table restaurant?
- Yes, let's find one of those.

812
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:22,973
(Searching like the wind)

813
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,503
Hey, but this place is really small.

814
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,573
- That's even better.
- That's even better.

815
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,643
(The smaller, the better.)

816
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:31,783
Let's just decide this.

817
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,753
Will just one of us go outside based on rock-paper-scissors...

818
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,453
- All of us going out in a crowd?
- That would be less embarrassing.

819
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,453
- Two or all at once.
- But...

820
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:39,323
I say we all go.

821
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:41,293
ULDD.

822
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:42,893
- Oh, ULDD?
- ULDD.

823
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:44,623
- ULDD.
- ULDD.

824
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,793
- Today...
- Hey, today...

825
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:46,993
Are we ULDD today?

826
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:48,033
- Today...
- ULDD.

827
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:50,533
Then, shall we just go outside, no matter what happens?

828
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:51,563
Let's go outside.

829
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,973
I'm going out as I trust my colleagues.

830
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,943
Hey, but... Going out like this...

831
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,243
It's less embarrassing since we're all together.

832
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:01,313
Right, it's less embarrassing.

833
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:02,783
(ULDD is effective.)

834
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:03,913
ULDD.

835
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,413
- Right now, Hongdae is...
- It's not bad.

836
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,013
We're walking the red carpet the opposite way? What is this?

837
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,393
(The reverse experience red carpet photo time)

838
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:15,653
One, two.

839
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,493
(We were definitely cool earlier.)

840
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:20,633
(Sighing)

841
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:22,393
Hey, wait. Here...

842
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,403
There's someone on the right. Go left.

843
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:24,433
Let's just go in here.

844
00:29:24,703 --> 00:29:26,233
- The right...
- Just go in here.

845
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,033
- They're not open.
- Aren't they?

846
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,503
Oh, they're open here.

847
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:31,473
All seats are private rooms.

848
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:34,513
- Beef brisket.
- No.

849
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,083
- Beef brisket.
- Can we eat here now?

850
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,443
Oh, we open at half-past.

851
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,653
- Oh, at half-past? Okay.
- What?

852
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,883
- They're still getting ready.
- This is perfect.

853
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:42,383
- They open at half-past.
- That's too bad.

854
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,553
- No, we're not.
- You mistook us for someone else.

855
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:46,153
- You mistook us.
- You mistook us.

856
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,753
- No, we're not.
- We look similar.

857
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,493
- It is Cha Tae Hyun!
- No, I'm not.

858
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,423
He's that Cha Tae Hyun, who sold ten million tickets in the box office.

859
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:52,633
Kim Dong Hyun, be quiet.

860
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,833
Ten million tickets.

861
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,933
Gosh, but we... Why are all the restaurants...

862
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,203
Dong Hyun, let's try going left from here.

863
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,073
Hey, this is a busy street now.

864
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:01,733
- Hey!
- Where are we? This is...

865
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,303
- Are we on the Hongdae main street?
- Yes.

866
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,473
Gosh, I haven't been here in so long.

867
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,073
- My gosh.
- Yes, it's totally the main street.

868
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:09,213
(Hongdae Red Road, the sacred land of busking)

869
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:10,943
- But why aren't there any people?
- I know, right?

870
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,913
Well, nothing is open yet.

871
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,013
Also...

872
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,053
Hey, the charcoal dakgalbi place in the back is open.

873
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,053
Let's go.

874
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,053
- Shall we go?
- How about we think less?

875
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,053
Okay.

876
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:21,823
- Let's just go and ask.
- Can we eat now?

877
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,363
- Yes.
- We can eat.

878
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:25,023
Let's go inside.

879
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,663
Hello.

880
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,163
(The first guests after opening are in their pajamas.)

881
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

882
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,433
- The 5 of us are going to eat.
- There are 5 of us.

883
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,073
- Shall we go deeper inside?
- Yes.

884
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:37,243
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

885
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:38,373
The innermost...

886
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,413
Are you showing us inside because you're embarrassed by us?

887
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:42,073
- No.
- Oh, really?

888
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:43,713
A private room.

889
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:45,843
- Should I sit here?
- You can sit here.

890
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,553
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, okay.

891
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,123
It feels really familiar, how we're sitting down at this restaurant.

892
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:52,223
I saw that they have lunch specials here.

893
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:53,693
- Like this.
- Yes, here.

894
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,293
- They have lunch specials.
- Then, bibim naengmyeon.

895
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:56,293
I'll try the bibim naengmyeon.

896
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,863
- I'll have mul naengmyeon.
- Mul naengmyeon?

897
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:58,993
(They each choose what they want from the lunch special.)

898
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:00,533
Do you have aprons?

899
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,903
(Let's protect our precious white undershirts.)

900
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:09,033
For this restaurant, the fact that we're their first guests...

901
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,203
- Is it a good sign?
- Of course.

902
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,713
It means they'll hit the jackpot today. It's a great sign.

903
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,343
- Is that right?
- Your clothes.

904
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,713
- Gwang. You know?
- Oh, gwang.

905
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:17,943
- That energy.
- True.

906
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,283
Gosh, in that case, I should eat as I show this off.

907
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:22,483
(Tucking in his shirt so the gwang is more visible)

908
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:23,853
Tuck in your apron too.

909
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:25,253
- The energy of the gwang...
- I can see the confidence rising...

910
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,293
in your eyes.

911
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,363
Yes. I should give them the energy of the gwang.

912
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:32,263
- Hey, wear it like that.
- Don't I look a bit cooler?

913
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:34,563
This looks like a shirt they sell.

914
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:35,733
- Right?
- For real.

915
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,103
More and more...

916
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:38,763
There are other customers.

917
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:42,573
(A whole group comes in.)

918
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:44,303
Gosh, they're a big group.

919
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,213
- You sit down right away.
- Hide.

920
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:47,743
- You sit down right away.
- I told you earlier.

921
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,483
We're ULDD,

922
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,943
so all of the staff, you can get closer together too.

923
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,683
Please block us from view.

924
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,413
Here it comes.

925
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:59,153
Here is our food. Let's eat quickly.

926
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,193
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

927
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:02,763
- Three mul naengmyeons...
- Sang Uk.

928
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,623
This is a total meat and naengmyeon combo.

929
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,723
It's Cha Tae Hyun.

930
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:07,293
- Hello.
- I love him the most.

931
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,603
- What about his fashion today?
- What do you think about it?

932
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,633
He looks cool. Very confident.

933
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:12,633
Thank you.

934
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,773
(Super confident)

935
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,273
I didn't see your shorts.

936
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:17,543
She didn't see your shorts.

937
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:18,843
Your restaurant today...

938
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:20,313
To wish you good luck today,

939
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,913
- it's a gwang.
- Oh, indeed.

940
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:22,943
- Gwang underpants...
- This...

941
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,683
- This is three servings.
- Okay.

942
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:26,413
- And this is two servings.
- Thank you.

943
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,883
(Bibim naengmyeon that will boost your appetite with its spiciness)

944
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:31,153
(Mul naengmyeon that will blow away the heat with its cold broth)

945
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:34,493
(The grilled dakgalbi that comes as a set)

946
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:35,993
Watch out for the naengmyeon splattering.

947
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:37,523
- I know.
- Enjoy your food, guys.

948
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,393
- Still...
- We have a meeting later.

949
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,733
Yes, we do. We shouldn't get food stains.

950
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:43,803
We have an important meeting after this.

951
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,203
- Enjoy.
- Hey, this is...

952
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:46,833
- Enjoy your meal.
- This can splatter so easily.

953
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,533
- It's easy to get stains from this.
- Yes.

954
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,443
(Exclaiming)

955
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:56,483
Hey, this is...

956
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,583
(He sure knows what he's doing.)

957
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:02,213
(Slurping the naengmyeon that's rolled up over the dakgalbi)

958
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,253
- It's delicious.
- This is boosting my appetite.

959
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,023
(Just taking a piece of dakgalbi)

960
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,453
Hey, this is delicious.

961
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,523
(Impressed)

962
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,123
- What?
- Hurry up and try this.

963
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,323
(A real reaction after trying a bite of dakgalbi)

964
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,433
It's so good.

965
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:14,933
This is really good.

966
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,933
(As they forget about being embarrassed and enjoy the food...)

967
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,963
With the sauce, it's nice and salty.

968
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:22,773
When we were playing bingo last year,

969
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:25,243
did you imagine we'd be eating here wearing this outfit?

970
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,613
I know. What on earth is this show about?

971
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:29,683
(A sudden question comes over them.)

972
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,183
From bingo...

973
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:33,113
- We have to go to CJ today.
- I know.

974
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,883
How did we end up doing all this?

975
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:38,583
We're sure we came here because they said it was bingo.

976
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,923
(They were called to play bingo.)

977
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:42,023
Where on earth is our bingo board?

978
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,793
They've taken all of our clothes.

979
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,633
(Where did our bingo card and clothes go?)

980
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,033
- Who wants water?
- Thank you.

981
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,033
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

982
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,163
- We really enjoyed the food.
- I enjoyed it so much.

983
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,603
Gosh, I'm so full.

984
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,333
Yes, hello.

985
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,603
- Thank you.
- Hello.

986
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:56,773
- Enjoy your meal.
- Bye.

987
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,043
- Bye.
- Thank you.

988
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:59,513
We're a running crew.

989
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:00,643
Hello.

990
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:01,773
(Transforming into a hermit crab out of embarrassment)

991
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:03,443
It's Lee Yi Kyung. Yes.

992
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,743
This is Cha Tae Hyun.

993
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:08,183
- Handsome Guys.
- He wanted to wish us good luck.

994
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:09,553
That's why he wore red underpants.

995
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:11,083
I wish you good luck.

996
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:13,393
I'm so embarrassed.

997
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,163
(Suddenly running off)

998
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,693
Hurry up.

999
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,233
(Running at full speed)

1000
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:24,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

1001
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,603
Hello. We're a running crew.

1002
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,433
A running crew.

1003
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,403
Hello, have a nice day.

1004
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,743
(Still greeting everyone politely as he's running from embarrassment)

1005
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:35,473
Hey, they're running off by themselves.

1006
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,513
I'm going to go too.

1007
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,713
Tae Hyun is coming by himself.

1008
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,453
Gosh, those guys are running away.

1009
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:41,513
Thank you.

1010
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,953
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1011
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:44,053
(He warms up enough...)

1012
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:46,153
- Run!
- Tae Hyun.

1013
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:48,223
So people can't tell. My gosh.

1014
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:49,693
One, two.

1015
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:50,763
(Checking his smartwatch)

1016
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:52,223
Aren't you Cha Tae Hyun?

1017
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,333
(The Hongdan runner parades around Hongdae.)

1018
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,263
- Aren't you Cha Tae Hyun?
- Gosh, this is nice.

1019
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,633
There are so many foreigners.

1020
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:58,903
Yes. Cha Tae Hyun.

1021
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:01,103
- A ten-million actor.
- Cicada Kim.

1022
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:02,773
Yes, Stun Gun.

1023
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,503
He's a ten-million actor.

1024
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:06,713
You can do it!

1025
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,843
Yes, hello.

1026
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,683
Cha Tae Hyun.

1027
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:12,743
It's Handsome Guys.

1028
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:14,783
Handsome Guys!

1029
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,353
- Oh, he knows Handsome Guys.
- Yes, that's right.

1030
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:18,923
Our show has gotten a lot more famous.

1031
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:20,623
- Hey, but seriously...
- Hey, taking off our clothes...

1032
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:22,193
has made us a lot more famous.

1033
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:23,723
- He mentioned Handsome Guys.
- Hey!

1034
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,023
Take off your shirt. This won't do.

1035
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,863
If you have a good body, you should all take off your shirts.

1036
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,063
- Tae Hyun...
- They're literally underpants.

1037
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:32,973
Tae Hyun, you just look like... Hey, they're literally underpants.

1038
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:36,673
Hey, I was so shocked from seeing my reflection in a store window too.

1039
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:39,943
On top of that, there's an actual model walking this way.

1040
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,513
Gosh, we look so shabby compared to that person.

1041
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,213
Let's hurry up and go inside.

1042
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,953
- I mean...
- Such a huge comparison.

1043
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:48,883
(They go back to their lodging before any more humiliation.)

1044
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:51,623
So, today, you're meeting the chief director for the first time.

1045
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:52,623
Yes.

1046
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:54,623
We thought it would be a bit impolite to go like this.

1047
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:55,623
- Yes.
- That's right.

1048
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:56,823
It's very impolite.

1049
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,493
- From now on, you'll play a game.
- Yes?

1050
00:35:58,663 --> 00:36:00,493
The one person who wins...

1051
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,563
will get a chance to purchase a shirt or pants...

1052
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,063
and change into it.

1053
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,633
Then, can we continue to wear it?

1054
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,173
- Do we get to keep it?
- Yes.

1055
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:09,173
Okay.

1056
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:10,503
- That's great.
- Let me ask.

1057
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:11,973
Jean shorts? That would be perfect.

1058
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:13,213
With our white shirts,

1059
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,673
- even just jean shorts...
- We could wear jean shorts.

1060
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,213
- Yes, that would look really nice.
- It would be...

1061
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:17,943
They're rubber bands.

1062
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,083
(The staff brings something out.)

1063
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,153
Is it pickled radish?

1064
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,783
Oh, they're rubber bands.

1065
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,053
- What is this?
- What is it?

1066
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:24,483
With the rubber bands that we just gave you,

1067
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,093
put one around your ears as it goes past your nose.

1068
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:30,393
Only use your facial muscles...

1069
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:32,163
to bring it down to your neck to succeed.

1070
00:36:33,063 --> 00:36:34,433
Does the person who finishes first win?

1071
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,993
- Yes, whoever finishes first...
- Is that how it works?

1072
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,203
will get an item of clothing.

1073
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:38,403
- Whoever goes first will have...
- Okay.

1074
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:39,603
the biggest disadvantage.

1075
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:41,533
- Right, the skills...
- Of course. We'll learn the skill.

1076
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:43,643
Then, let's have the winner decide the order however he wants.

1077
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,943
Okay. If you don't play, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

1078
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:47,373
Rock-paper-scissors.

1079
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:48,573
- All right. Scissors.
- Oh, my gosh.

1080
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,213
If you don't play, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

1081
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:51,313
- I don't want...
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1082
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,313
If you don't play, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors!

1083
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,383
- Hey, you won.
- You won.

1084
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:55,383
(The other four are eliminated.)

1085
00:36:55,913 --> 00:37:00,653
Then, let's have our eldest brother show us how it's done first.

1086
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:01,953
You're such a thug.

1087
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:05,593
- But why?
- Gosh, that little...

1088
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,363
Since you're the oldest and have more experience,

1089
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:08,993
I thought you'd be good at it.

1090
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:10,433
- Next?
- Next,

1091
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,563
Seung Ho is good.

1092
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,803
- I'd like to learn...
- Seung Ho is good.

1093
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:14,033
- Seung Ho's skills.
- Yes, that's true.

1094
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,403
Then, we'll go with...

1095
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,943
Yi Kyung's sharp instincts.

1096
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,073
- Nice.
- Then, the meaningless one.

1097
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,943
No matter how much you learn, I'm sure you'll be worse than me.

1098
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:25,443
Since I have nothing to learn from him,

1099
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,513
so Sang Uk and I will go last.

1100
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,883
- What?
- Tae Hyun, let's start here.

1101
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:31,253
- Here?
- Still, I think it's similar.

1102
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,453
- Yi Kyung, you look so weird.
- Ready,

1103
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:34,593
set, go.

1104
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,363
- It's going down.
- Hey, you're almost there.

1105
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:39,933
You're almost there!

1106
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:44,903
(Sticking his tongue out)

1107
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:45,933
You're almost there.

1108
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,803
(It goes past his mouth in a flash and goes down to his chin.)

1109
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,403
- My gosh.
- You have to pull it.

1110
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,613
- Your chin...
- No, pull it down lower.

1111
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,813
Your chin!

1112
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:57,843
Tae Hyun, your chin!

1113
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:58,983
(Copying him without realizing it)

1114
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:00,083
My gosh!

1115
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:01,983
Tae Hyun, your chin!

1116
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:04,083
(Blowing raspberries)

1117
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:07,093
(This isn't easy.)

1118
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,893
(Shouting)

1119
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:10,923
- Is my chin that big?
- You're almost there.

1120
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,093
Tae Hyun, you're almost there.

1121
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,763
- How do we do this?
- Don't give up!

1122
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:16,633
Don't give up, Tae Hyun.

1123
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,403
- Bring it down. This won't work.
- There you go.

1124
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,573
Good. Do whatever it takes!

1125
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:26,003
- It's working.
- No, it really won't work.

1126
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,213
- It really isn't going down.
- Why doesn't it work?

1127
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:29,743
- I give up.
- What?

1128
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,953
Gosh, that must've hurt.

1129
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,783
Hang on. This means I can't do it either.

1130
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,723
I have a protruding chin.

1131
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:42,253
It would never go down from my chin.

1132
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:45,223
- We never know. It took me so long.
- But you never know, Dong Hyun.

1133
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,693
It took you 1 minute and 58.79 seconds.

1134
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,863
- That wasn't too...
- It wasn't much.

1135
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,463
I thought it took you about 4 to 5 minutes.

1136
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:51,903
It wasn't even two minutes.

1137
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,273
- Okay, go.
- Okay.

1138
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,673
- If you're ready, we'll start now.
- Seung Ho.

1139
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:57,743
Ready, go.

1140
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:02,743
- That part is quick. Yes.
- It gets hard here.

1141
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:04,213
Yes, push it with your tongue.

1142
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,783
- Watch his technique.
- No way.

1143
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:07,813
You have to watch this.

1144
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,683
Gosh, look at that.

1145
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,253
This is the problem.

1146
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,023
Oh, I thought he did it. It was his necklace.

1147
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,253
- This won't work.
- Oh, this part...

1148
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:17,393
Gosh, does this not work?

1149
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:18,563
Okay, the next person can go.

1150
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,633
I think I'll be stuck here for about five minutes.

1151
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:25,463
Look, it gets stuck. How does it go down any further?

1152
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:26,973
It doesn't work.

1153
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,433
I told you, you were fast.

1154
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,433
(Still, he tried until the end.)

1155
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,303
But I didn't use my hands earlier...

1156
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,173
He got it.

1157
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:34,343
(Rolling back)

1158
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,183
- There you go.
- Why are you lifting your legs?

1159
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:38,283
(Shooting his chin out as if firing a cannon)

1160
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:39,813
- The recoil.
- He's using the recoil.

1161
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:40,953
The recoil of the rubber band.

1162
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:42,853
(Impressed)

1163
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:43,953
The recoil of the rubber band.

1164
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,093
- I did it!
- What was the technique at the end?

1165
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:50,093
- I don't know what it was.
- This is it!

1166
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:51,963
This is it!

1167
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:54,563
(They learn a fancy technique of pushing in the tongue.)

1168
00:39:54,693 --> 00:40:01,073
(In slow motion)

1169
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,573
That was so fast.

1170
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,503
- He used his tongue.
- How long did it take me?

1171
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:07,173
- How long did it take me?
- It was 53.94 seconds.

1172
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:09,413
- What was your record?
- I had 1 minute, 58 seconds.

1173
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,843
I want to try it now.

1174
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,983
- The cutline is so short now.
- If we use our facial muscles...

1175
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:16,383
Shall we start? Ready, set, go.

1176
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,823
(The third player, Yi Kyung, begins!)

1177
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,793
- What was that?
- That part goes by quickly.

1178
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,823
(Sure enough, he gets to his mouth quickly.)

1179
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:23,923
- Gosh, seriously.
- Oh, it worked.

1180
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:24,993
(He succeeds in smoothly getting it down to his chin.)

1181
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:26,223
You got it!!

1182
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:27,863
You got it!!

1183
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,503
(What was that?)

1184
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,473
- It was about technique.
- Why are we doing this?

1185
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,503
(Seung Ho's 1st place position disappeared in the blink of an eye.)

1186
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:36,573
- Hey.
- He went like this.

1187
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:37,843
How long did that take? About 20 seconds?

1188
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:39,043
It was 11.38 seconds.

1189
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,243
- That's it!
- There's no point in playing now.

1190
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,913
No, Dong Hyun. You can do it even faster.

1191
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,343
- It's a disadvantage to go first.
- It's a disadvantage to go first.

1192
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:47,983
- Okay.
- Yes.

1193
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,513
Ready, go.

1194
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:50,753
(He must succeed within 11.38 seconds.)

1195
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:52,153
- Oh, he got it down to there.
- You have to...

1196
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:53,453
- push it with your tongue.
- He got it.

1197
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,623
Push it calmly with your tongue.

1198
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:56,193
Push it calmly with your tongue.

1199
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:58,423
Push it. No, push it calmly.

1200
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,523
I'm drooling.

1201
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,633
- Push it calmly.
- Five,

1202
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,963
- four, - Push it more.

1203
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,093
- three, - No, you have to push harder.

1204
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,263
- two, - Push it.

1205
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:05,403
one. You can do whatever you want now.

1206
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,003
(You've already lost.)

1207
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:09,733
- It only ends if you get it down.
- Do whatever you want now.

1208
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,843
- Then, push your lips out.
- Dong Hyun, put yours on.

1209
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,873
- Keep trying.
- Gosh, it won't go past this point.

1210
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:16,513
Just keep going.

1211
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:18,443
Take your time. Ready, go.

1212
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,283
Hang on. I think I've seen this on Easter Island.

1213
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:23,083
Oh, he's fast.

1214
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,323
- Dong Hyun.
- It won't work for me.

1215
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:29,553
- Push it calmly with your tongue.
- Four, three, two,

1216
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,193
- one. You can do what you want too.
- His chin is also the problem.

1217
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:32,463
His chin is the problem as well.

1218
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,433
Even your tongue can't get it down that far.

1219
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:37,133
(He pushes his tongue out as far as he can, but...)

1220
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,703
That's just stuck.

1221
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:40,903
Hey, that's literally just stuck.

1222
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,933
- Dong Hyun.
- You can both do what you want.

1223
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:45,673
(Foolish Dong Hyun struggles desperately,)

1224
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:46,943
(and Foolish Sang Uk doesn't want to lose.)

1225
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:49,143
- You got it!
- With your tongue.

1226
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:51,543
- There you go. With your tongue.
- Yes, that's it.

1227
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,913
You're almost there. There!

1228
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:53,913
(Foolish Sang Uk kept his pride alive at the end.)

1229
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:55,153
Dong Hyun is still trying.

1230
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,053
This was a matter of pride for me.

1231
00:41:57,053 --> 00:42:00,193
- This part...
- Yours is really stuck in place.

1232
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:02,223
- This is just...
- This just won't work.

1233
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,493
Gosh, it literally got stuck.

1234
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:05,263
I have a huge disadvantage.

1235
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,993
I have a protruding chin.

1236
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:09,033
- Then, Yi Kyung gets to buy it.
- Yes.

1237
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:11,033
You may go and buy an item of clothing right now.

1238
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:12,933
- He can go alone. We don't have to.
- Do I go by myself?

1239
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,473
- Aren't we going together?
- No, you're going alone.

1240
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,473
Hey, but...

1241
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:16,473
(He gets to be fashionable, but he must bear with the embarrassment.)

1242
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:17,503
- Hey, that's a penalty.
- Yes.

1243
00:42:17,503 --> 00:42:19,303
- This is like a penalty.
- But the person in last place...

1244
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,973
The person who lost could go...

1245
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,373
Go.

1246
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,043
Then, I'll go by myself.

1247
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:27,153
- A pair of jeans is all I need.
- Of course.

1248
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,613
That's totally... You know.

1249
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:30,623
You'd look like you dressed well at home.

1250
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:31,723
(Envious)

1251
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:33,023
Shall we go? I mean, I'll be back.

1252
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:34,193
- Okay.
- See you later.

1253
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,253
Still, going alone is a bit awkward.

1254
00:42:36,693 --> 00:42:38,563
- There's no other way, though.
- I'll be back.

1255
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:39,623
It's not far, is it?

1256
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,233
Gosh, by myself...

1257
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,363
(Scanning)

1258
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:46,903
I think people will think I'm a beggar.

1259
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:48,373
(Super embarrassed)

1260
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:49,673
Gosh, by myself...

1261
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:52,873
(He tries to hide his face behind the camera.)

1262
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,243
(You look scary.)

1263
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:00,383
Gosh, it's so embarrassing to walk around alone.

1264
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,683
(He quickly moves along the side of the road.)

1265
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,353
I have a pretty big cell phone.

1266
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:06,993
(When someone appears...)

1267
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,353
Hello?

1268
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:09,353
(Yi Kyung has used the Hide His Face skill.)

1269
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,363
Yes.

1270
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:11,363
(Looking around furtively)

1271
00:43:11,363 --> 00:43:13,293
Yes. Oh, gosh. Yes.

1272
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:14,963
(He brings his phone back up in a hurry.)

1273
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:18,863
Just wait until I buy some jeans.

1274
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,433
I'm going to walk back with so much confidence.

1275
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,373
Just wait until I buy jeans.

1276
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,473
Yes, I just have to get there. It'll be fine on my way back.

1277
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,073
I'll buy clothes.

1278
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,573
(He spots a clothing store in the distance.)

1279
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,413
What do I do? Oh, do I cross?

1280
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

1281
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:33,753
Hello... Oh, my.

1282
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,953
- Oh, I mean... Yes.
- My gosh.

1283
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,523
I live around here, so...

1284
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:40,293
Thank you.

1285
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:41,853
(With a fake excuse,)

1286
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,793
(he hurriedly runs off toward the store.)

1287
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,533
Goodness, I have arrived.

1288
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:52,963
(The 5-minute journey to the clothing store felt like an hour.)

1289
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:56,843
Hello. I came to buy clothes.

1290
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:58,643
What should I buy to go with this outfit?

1291
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:01,213
(So flustered)

1292
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,543
What kind of style do you usually like?

1293
00:44:03,543 --> 00:44:05,143
Well, I...

1294
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:07,883
Should I buy a pair of jeans, since this is a white T-shirt?

1295
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,483
Yes, hello.

1296
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,483
(He runs off to the corner where the jeans are.)

1297
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,723
(Will he be able to save the outfit with a pair of jeans?)

1298
00:44:13,723 --> 00:44:15,723
Some comfortable jeans that are also stylish.

1299
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,493
What do you think about my outfit now?

1300
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,333
Right now...

1301
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:23,403
You look like you just left your house.

1302
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,963
Yes, that is true.

1303
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,133
(A perfect fashion analysis with no errors)

1304
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,473
When I put it on...

1305
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:30,673
There are other members...

1306
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:31,843
- besides me.
- Yes.

1307
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:33,813
There are others who look even worse than I do.

1308
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,843
I want them to see me and feel jealous.

1309
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,283
Got it.

1310
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,283
(Request: jeans that would make the members jealous)

1311
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:42,353
You could wear dark jeans or black jeans like these.

1312
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,783
- I think they'd suit you.
- Do you think so?

1313
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,453
These have a nice stretch to them.

1314
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:49,993
(He chooses a pair of jeans that he likes.)

1315
00:44:49,993 --> 00:44:52,393
I think this looks all right. Look.

1316
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:53,433
(He goes to the full-length mirror.)

1317
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:56,633
Hey, it's all right. I can walk back with confidence.

1318
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,103
I can go with confidence.

1319
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,463
Hey, look at this.

1320
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,303
(Reverse experience, the maximum effect)

1321
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:03,133
This is awesome. Does a pair of jeans make such a big difference?

1322
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,773
These jeans are a miracle.

1323
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:08,773
- Sir, can I try these two on?
- Of course.

1324
00:45:09,013 --> 00:45:10,843
I'll come outside in the ones that fit better.

1325
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,183
Gosh, with these on, I could go anywhere today.

1326
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,053
Gosh, even with a pair of jeans...

1327
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,123
Gosh, it's all over.

1328
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,753
My, these fit great.

1329
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:20,393
(What will Yi Kyung look like with the jeans on?)

1330
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:24,663
(The curtains that were closed...)

1331
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:26,063
Gosh, it's all over. This is literally...

1332
00:45:26,063 --> 00:45:27,233
(They open gracefully.)

1333
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:30,563
This is insane.

1334
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:31,663
(Finally, showing himself...)

1335
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:34,003
(It's Yi Kyung in jeans.)

1336
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:35,003
My confidence is much higher.

1337
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:39,243
I'll just go ahead and pay for these.

1338
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,243
- Can I remove the tag, then?
- Yes.

1339
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:44,113
The two in the back here... Oh, there are more here.

1340
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:46,953
- Do I have to take this off?
- Yes, you do.

1341
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,313
(The antitheft tag can only be removed with a machine.)

1342
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,483
Gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

1343
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,383
I have to take them off, remove the tag, and put them back on.

1344
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,823
I'm sorry.

1345
00:45:57,523 --> 00:45:58,663
Thank you.

1346
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:00,663
(He leaves after successfully paying.)

1347
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:01,693
These are so nice.

1348
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:02,863
Have a good day.

1349
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:04,503
Oh, I have to wear them out!

1350
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:08,033
(He almost walked back dressed the same way.)

1351
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,703
(His fifth time going into the changing room today)

1352
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:11,743
Gosh, am I a fool?

1353
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:13,443
(We have a lot to say, but we won't say anything.)

1354
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:16,613
All right. Now, I feel comfortable.

1355
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:20,113
Even when I run into people, I don't feel any...

1356
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:23,413
No awkwardness at all. I'll say hello.

1357
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,623
Hello.

1358
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:27,923
I only changed my pants, but they recognize me right away.

1359
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:30,363
They ask if I'm Lee Yi Kyung.

1360
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,523
It looks cool if you roll up the sleeves a bit.

1361
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,893
(Rolling them up)

1362
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,133
(He switches things up by rolling up the short sleeves.)

1363
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:38,203
Hello.

1364
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:43,333
(He adds a bit of flair to his new jeans by rolling them up too.)

1365
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,473
I could even sign autographs for fans in this outfit.

1366
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:46,913
(He could even have a meet-and-greet and sign autographs for his fans.)

1367
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:48,343
After rolling those up...

1368
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:49,613
Hello.

1369
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:51,243
Hello.

1370
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,743
(To those who have recognized me,)

1371
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,253
(I send you my passionate vibes.)

1372
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:57,423
I am exuding with confidence.

1373
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:59,953
Hello.

1374
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,853
High-five.

1375
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:02,993
Have a joyful day.

1376
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:06,323
My reflection...

1377
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:07,733
Gosh, I look all right.

1378
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:09,493
My reflection...

1379
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,163
(His confidence is off the charts.)

1380
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:12,433
Gosh, this is excellent.

1381
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:14,703
Hello.

1382
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,503
Look at this. With a single pair of jeans,

1383
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:19,503
I have changed so much.

1384
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,543
(A surprising change from a single pair of jeans)

1385
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:21,873
Hey, there.

1386
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:22,943
(He finally arrives at the lodging.)

1387
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:24,983
This is totally...

1388
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:27,513
- It's like a normal outfit, right?
- It looks perfect on you.

1389
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,553
- Isn't it awesome?
- They look good.

1390
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:29,553
They cost less than 30 dollars too.

1391
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:30,553
It was 20-something dollars.

1392
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,383
Oh, really? They're stretchy.

1393
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:33,593
- That's nice.
- Right? Isn't it nice?

1394
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:41,063
(Also, inside the lodging...)

1395
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,463
Sang Uk, how do I look?

1396
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,563
Oh, what is this?

1397
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:47,533
(At Yi Kyung's look that has changed in an instant)

1398
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:48,833
Are you going somewhere?

1399
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,673
(Envious)

1400
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,043
You bought a nice pair.

1401
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,713
They're no joke, right? They were only about 20 dollars.

1402
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,243
- Really?
- Yes.

1403
00:47:57,243 --> 00:47:58,383
(Highly satisfied)

1404
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:01,513
- You're back.
- Dong Hyun.

1405
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:02,783
(Exclaiming)

1406
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:04,223
That's awesome.

1407
00:48:04,353 --> 00:48:05,983
You look so nice.

1408
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,053
It's much better.

1409
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:09,293
That was totally...

1410
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:11,123
- a game changer.
- That was a big game.

1411
00:48:11,123 --> 00:48:12,223
- He looks totally different.
- Tae Hyun.

1412
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,223
Gosh.

1413
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,533
You look amazing.

1414
00:48:14,563 --> 00:48:16,663
When I walked past the people with this on,

1415
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:17,763
they approached me.

1416
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:19,503
Gosh, that's amazing.

1417
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:20,973
I'm done, Seung Ho.

1418
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,703
(Sighing)

1419
00:48:22,703 --> 00:48:23,743
Lucky you.

1420
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:25,503
I'm going to head out like this.

1421
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,843
(After seeing the other members who have given up,)

1422
00:48:26,843 --> 00:48:28,413
(he feels happy.)

1423
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:29,443
Look at Yi Kyung.

1424
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:31,213
That's amazing.

1425
00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:32,683
The jeans make a big difference.

1426
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:34,083
With just one pair of jeans,

1427
00:48:34,183 --> 00:48:35,383
I feel so much at peace.

1428
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:38,883
Shall we get going?

1429
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,893
(The Handsome Guys head out for the first thing on the schedule.)

1430
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:42,693
(The Handsome Guys move out for the first time today.)

1431
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:43,693
Gosh, I'm heading out like this.

1432
00:48:43,693 --> 00:48:44,693
(Sighing)

1433
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:47,263
(Sighs could be heard from here and there.)

1434
00:48:47,263 --> 00:48:48,793
Before we meet the chief director,

1435
00:48:49,063 --> 00:48:50,303
we'll meet the Marketing Team first.

1436
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:51,603
What?

1437
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,903
There's a brief meeting with the Marketing Team too.

1438
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:56,673
If it's that big of an appointment,

1439
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,473
it isn't polite to be there with slippers on.

1440
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:01,213
We already gave them a heads up on that.

1441
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:02,673
They already know about it.

1442
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,843
I'm fine with anything as I'm wearing jeans.

1443
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:07,883
(Only Yi Kyung is fine.)

1444
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:09,053
I'm totally fine with anything.

1445
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,723
Gosh, jeans make that much of a difference.

1446
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,023
- Keep this in mind.
- Okay.

1447
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:16,353
It's a meeting.

1448
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,823
Meetings are done while sitting at a table together.

1449
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:20,363
They'll only see us when we greet them?

1450
00:49:20,363 --> 00:49:21,493
It'll be fine after greeting them.

1451
00:49:22,663 --> 00:49:23,663
Greeting them isn't the problem.

1452
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,663
Entering the lobby is the problem.

1453
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,333
I never thought that...

1454
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:29,903
I would enter the building like this.

1455
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,773
(I never thought that I would enter tvN like this.)

1456
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:33,673
(Looking out the window)

1457
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:34,773
We're at Hongdae...

1458
00:49:34,773 --> 00:49:37,483
and seeing the people out here,

1459
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:39,713
they all look so stylish.

1460
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:41,853
Their fashion sense feels different.

1461
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,953
Hongdae is just...

1462
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,223
(As it's the main area of style...)

1463
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:46,953
- This is the main area.
- Gosh.

1464
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:48,123
If you think about it,

1465
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,693
there are this many people at 2pm.

1466
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:53,293
But as of today,

1467
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,663
no matter how much they style themselves,

1468
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:56,463
we'll be the ones to stand out the most outside.

1469
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,103
But...

1470
00:49:58,303 --> 00:49:59,833
it'll be okay for now.

1471
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,633
We're dressed like this as a group.

1472
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:04,603
Gosh, we're in the heart of Sangam.

1473
00:50:04,603 --> 00:50:05,773
Hold on.

1474
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:07,543
There are other broadcasting stations here as well.

1475
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:08,873
They're all here.

1476
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:11,083
I'm feeling more embarrassed...

1477
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,713
now that it's time to head out.

1478
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:14,413
I feel so comfortable right now.

1479
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,523
We'll get off here?

1480
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:22,023
(They arrive at the tvN building for the first appointment.)

1481
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,093
Time to get off.

1482
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:26,293
(The Handsome Guys get out of the car.)

1483
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:28,893
Gosh, this is embarrassing!

1484
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,293
(Gosh, this is embarrassing!)

1485
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,533
They're taking pictures from the second floor.

1486
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,633
- Hello.
- They're on the second floor.

1487
00:50:34,903 --> 00:50:35,973
Gosh.

1488
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,673
I'm feeling great.

1489
00:50:38,003 --> 00:50:39,103
I feel at ease.

1490
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,673
Gosh.

1491
00:50:40,673 --> 00:50:42,573
I look much worse next to Yi Kyung.

1492
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:47,553
- We're going in like this?
- Hello.

1493
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:49,383
Come on in.

1494
00:50:50,853 --> 00:50:53,083
(Yi Kyung feels confident.)

1495
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,223
Go first.

1496
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:57,423
Go first.

1497
00:50:57,423 --> 00:50:59,423
Hurry up. Go first.

1498
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:00,733
Oh, gosh.

1499
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:02,593
I'll hide behind Tae Hyun.

1500
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:05,103
(Appearances that are hard to approach)

1501
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,203
Gosh, look at Tae Hyun!

1502
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:07,933
Hello.

1503
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:09,333
Yes. He's Cha Tae Hyun.

1504
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,443
We have a meeting today.

1505
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,813
We're here to meet the Marketing Team...

1506
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:15,073
and the chief director.

1507
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,213
- I'll give each of you a pass.
- Thank you.

1508
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:18,383
- Thank you.
- Here you are.

1509
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:19,413
Thank you.

1510
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,453
Here.

1511
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:24,083
(Checking their outfits)

1512
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:25,823
Hey, we're meeting the chief director.

1513
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,553
All of you should tuck in your shirts.

1514
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:29,793
Come on.

1515
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:31,723
- Should we keep our manners?
- That's so impolite.

1516
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:32,963
You should tuck in your shirts.

1517
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,663
- That's how you keep your manners.
- Is that so?

1518
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:37,303
Definitely. We'll be at a meeting.

1519
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:39,233
(This is the standard look for good manners.)

1520
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:40,573
You have to be dressed modestly.

1521
00:51:40,603 --> 00:51:42,373
You especially have a ribbon,

1522
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:43,603
so you should tuck in your shirt.

1523
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,443
(Neat)

1524
00:51:47,443 --> 00:51:49,773
My cousin looked like that with his diapers on.

1525
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:52,483
The elevator is here. Is that not it?

1526
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:53,643
We'll go up with this.

1527
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,013
Don't look.

1528
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:57,323
- Hello.
- Don't look.

1529
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:58,823
Don't look.

1530
00:51:58,823 --> 00:52:00,553
(Avoiding the others)

1531
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:02,323
Let's get in quickly.

1532
00:52:02,323 --> 00:52:03,493
- Let's get in quickly.
- Let's get in quickly.

1533
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:04,593
(They take the next elevator.)

1534
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:07,123
But...

1535
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,363
- Hold on.
- It looks like...

1536
00:52:08,363 --> 00:52:09,463
- something was spilled.
- But...

1537
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,003
is this what I only think?

1538
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,303
Do we think the same thing when we see each other?

1539
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:14,303
You look...

1540
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:15,703
awful.

1541
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:17,103
Do you think the same way when you see me?

1542
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,303
Seung Ho looks okay.

1543
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,573
You and Sang Uk look awful.

1544
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:22,273
- Really?
- Is it that bad?

1545
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,743
- Is it that bad?
- But...

1546
00:52:23,743 --> 00:52:25,743
you look even more awful while standing next to him.

1547
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,743
The color looks off too.

1548
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,683
You look terrible while standing next to him.

1549
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:31,023
I didn't think I looked that bad...

1550
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,383
in the mirror.

1551
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,683
But...

1552
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:36,023
showing off the gwang sign...

1553
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,263
fills me with confidence.

1554
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:38,763
Hold on. Okay.

1555
00:52:38,763 --> 00:52:40,123
(The Handsome Guys finally arrive at the destination.)

1556
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,593
Let's greet them now.

1557
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:43,693
Go past there.

1558
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:44,903
Oh, it's this way.

1559
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:46,533
Gosh.

1560
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,833
Once we go in, we'll all go,

1561
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,103
"Hello. We are the Handsome Guys."

1562
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,143
We have to take it that far?

1563
00:52:51,143 --> 00:52:53,403
They won't know us if we just go in.

1564
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:54,573
Got it?

1565
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:56,073
I'm pretty sure they'll know who we are.

1566
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,413
(They head into the office with different thoughts...)

1567
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:58,813
(based on their outfits.)

1568
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,243
(Gasping)

1569
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,713
There are so many of them. There are people over there too.

1570
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:04,953
(The office is filled.)

1571
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,386
(They head into the office with different thoughts...)

1572
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:07,796
(based on their outfits.)

1573
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,256
(Gasping)

1574
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,666
There are so many of them. There are people over there too.

1575
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,666
(The office is filled.)

1576
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,236
On the count of three, "Hello. We are the Handsome Guys."

1577
00:53:17,306 --> 00:53:18,936
One, two, three.

1578
00:53:18,936 --> 00:53:19,936
- Hello.
- Hello.

1579
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:21,336
We are the Handsome Guys.

1580
00:53:22,606 --> 00:53:23,806
They can't see us.

1581
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:25,276
They can't see our outfits.

1582
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:27,316
(Quiet)

1583
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:28,546
Hello.

1584
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:30,786
We are the Handsome Guys.

1585
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:32,516
Hello. We are the Handsome Guys.

1586
00:53:32,616 --> 00:53:34,056
- Hello.
- Hello.

1587
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:35,786
- Hello.
- Hello. Cheer up.

1588
00:53:36,386 --> 00:53:37,956
You're going through so much.

1589
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:40,056
There's "Handsome Guys" over there.

1590
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:41,096
Hello.

1591
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,256
Hold on.

1592
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:43,526
Which team is this?

1593
00:53:44,026 --> 00:53:45,026
This is the Design Team.

1594
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,226
- The Design Team.
- The Design Team?

1595
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,866
How does the design of Tae Hyun's shorts look?

1596
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:49,066
Does it look okay?

1597
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:50,136
It looks beautiful.

1598
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,006
As someone from the Design Team,

1599
00:53:52,336 --> 00:53:53,836
which shorts look the worst?

1600
00:53:53,976 --> 00:53:55,106
Out of the three of us.

1601
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:56,436
(Scanning)

1602
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:57,776
Yours look weird.

1603
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,276
Sang Uk's shorts.

1604
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:01,516
- Sang Uk has the worst shorts.
- I told you.

1605
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:02,676
(Feeling upset)

1606
00:54:03,816 --> 00:54:07,186
This is the hottest trend these days.

1607
00:54:07,246 --> 00:54:08,386
He didn't notice it.

1608
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:10,486
Hello.

1609
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:11,826
Yi Kyung's fan is here.

1610
00:54:11,826 --> 00:54:13,586
I should pass her one.

1611
00:54:14,256 --> 00:54:16,426
I'm fine as I have jeans on.

1612
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:17,766
- She's a fan of Sang Uk.
- Hello.

1613
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:18,826
Hello.

1614
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,426
(Sang Uk's fan is waiting as well.)

1615
00:54:20,796 --> 00:54:22,536
I want to give it to her.

1616
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:23,936
Hurry over to her.

1617
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:25,706
I'm just in my underwear.

1618
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:27,576
- Hurry over to her.
- Gosh.

1619
00:54:27,706 --> 00:54:28,836
Here's Sang Uk.

1620
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:30,306
- He's dressed nicely, isn't he?
- Take it with you.

1621
00:54:30,306 --> 00:54:31,876
(Hesitating)

1622
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:34,276
Could I get an autograph?

1623
00:54:35,476 --> 00:54:37,176
- I'll root for you.
- Thank you.

1624
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:40,186
- I'll look better next time.
- Right.

1625
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:43,816
(Feeling upset again)

1626
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,456
Cheer up.

1627
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:46,686
We are the Handsome Guys.

1628
00:54:47,086 --> 00:54:48,396
Hello.

1629
00:54:49,026 --> 00:54:50,026
Right.

1630
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:51,566
You have a lot of things.

1631
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:52,766
- Gosh.
- Right?

1632
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:53,766
Well,

1633
00:54:53,996 --> 00:54:55,796
I got a bit surprised by your hwatu shorts.

1634
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:57,766
(Tae Hyun looked surprised.)

1635
00:54:57,766 --> 00:54:59,206
She got quite surprised.

1636
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:01,976
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

1637
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:03,636
(Out of the many employees...)

1638
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:06,076
Which team is in charge of Handsome Guys?

1639
00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:07,976
They have this.

1640
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:10,516
(The bingo board of the 1st season gets discovered!)

1641
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,246
- Is it this team?
- These two seniors...

1642
00:55:12,246 --> 00:55:13,946
have the bingo board.

1643
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:15,516
(One person gets really surprised.)

1644
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:17,356
Was that something to get that surprised?

1645
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,356
Why is everyone...

1646
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,086
Is this the Handsome Guys Team?

1647
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:21,696
Right. We are the Marketing Team.

1648
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:23,196
- This is the Marketing Team?
- Yes.

1649
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:24,666
(Marketing Team)

1650
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:25,996
You were quite surprised, right?

1651
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:27,596
- Gosh.
- We apologize.

1652
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,896
I'll have to bring it down because of Jung Min.

1653
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:31,866
Why are you bringing it down?

1654
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:33,566
Jung Min is struggling too much.

1655
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:34,736
(He drops the look of good manners for a while.)

1656
00:55:34,736 --> 00:55:37,006
- It's better now, right?
- Yes. It's much better.

1657
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:39,446
Have you been in charge of the marketing of Handsome Guys...

1658
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:41,046
since last year?

1659
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,976
Right. We started...

1660
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:45,486
from the launch of the show.

1661
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:47,316
I have a question.

1662
00:55:47,316 --> 00:55:50,656
How do you promote our show as the Marketing Team?

1663
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,256
We upload short-form content...

1664
00:55:52,256 --> 00:55:54,856
and clips online.

1665
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:56,826
You've seen posters as well, right?

1666
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:59,326
We promote the show so that many people can watch the show.

1667
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,736
There are a lot of clips online.

1668
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:03,796
- So they upload those clips.
- We're all dressed up...

1669
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:05,266
for short-form content.

1670
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:06,306
(Shocked)

1671
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:07,436
(Covering their mouths)

1672
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:08,606
- We're all dressed for that.
- What do you think?

1673
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,376
Out of the five of us,

1674
00:56:10,606 --> 00:56:12,506
which member contributes the most...

1675
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:14,146
to the promotion of our show?

1676
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:15,776
Personally,

1677
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:16,846
I think it's Seung Ho.

1678
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,886
- Seung Ho?
- Right.

1679
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:20,046
(Bowing)

1680
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:21,116
Bring up your shirt!

1681
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:22,386
Feel confident.

1682
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:24,826
(Orangutan Show of Joy)

1683
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:27,156
He has great chemistry with the members.

1684
00:56:27,156 --> 00:56:28,856
But even when there are guests,

1685
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:31,826
- he has great chemistry with them.
- Seung Ho is great at that.

1686
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:35,266
I think that he's the Chemistry Fairy.

1687
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,136
(Chemistry Fairy, Rascal Seung Ho)

1688
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:39,036
Seung Ho does contribute a lot,

1689
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:40,836
but Dong Hyun contributes a lot too.

1690
00:56:40,836 --> 00:56:43,506
- He's almost like...
- The son of tvN.

1691
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:46,146
- the uncle of tvN.
- Right.

1692
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:47,816
Tae Hyun kept saying this to me.

1693
00:56:47,816 --> 00:56:49,976
"Who's behind your back at tvN for you to appear all the time?"

1694
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:51,346
- Isn't your uncle here?
- He found it suspicious.

1695
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:53,816
- She mentioned "uncle" just now.
- There's no one here.

1696
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,756
- I think your uncle is here.
- Tae Hyun said...

1697
00:56:55,756 --> 00:56:57,786
he was going to find out if it was true.

1698
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,626
Even when we come up with the press release,

1699
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,496
- Dong Hyun is a good source.
- Really?

1700
00:57:03,496 --> 00:57:05,166
Gosh, thank you.

1701
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,766
You are responsible for more than just your own self.

1702
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:08,366
- I should work hard.
- If something bad happens to you,

1703
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:10,366
three tvN shows will go into the dumper.

1704
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:11,866
- Right.
- You have to be careful.

1705
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:13,936
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes. I should work hard.

1706
00:57:14,276 --> 00:57:15,406
- I will always feel grateful.
- Right.

1707
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,076
We call our show a zombie show between ourselves.

1708
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,376
Our subtitle is "Until the End."

1709
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:21,816
Our format keeps changing.

1710
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:24,216
What do you think of our show that has reached this far?

1711
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:26,746
I believe that Handsome Guys...

1712
00:57:27,016 --> 00:57:29,656
is a hidden influence.

1713
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:30,716
Really?

1714
00:57:30,856 --> 00:57:33,186
(Hidden influence?)

1715
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,296
But it's hidden very well.

1716
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:39,326
(A big blow from a Marketing Team member...)

1717
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:41,036
(that has been with the show from the start)

1718
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,796
- So...
- Someone will discover it...

1719
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:45,936
and the show will see the light soon.

1720
00:57:45,936 --> 00:57:47,166
Is today that day?

1721
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,406
Today is that day.

1722
00:57:50,106 --> 00:57:53,946
We'll be meeting the chief director soon.

1723
00:57:54,476 --> 00:57:57,446
We can speak on behalf of the team.

1724
00:57:57,446 --> 00:57:59,846
Are there any suggestions that you want to make to the chief director?

1725
00:57:59,986 --> 00:58:01,316
We'll share them with him.

1726
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:03,416
Today will be the last day we'll see him anyway.

1727
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,986
We won't be seeing him again.

1728
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:06,356
We'll make sure to ensure anonymity.

1729
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:08,526
We'll be bold about it.

1730
00:58:09,226 --> 00:58:10,556
I want Handsome Guys...

1731
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,796
- to become a regular show.
- Right.

1732
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:13,896
We're not a regular show?

1733
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:15,296
(Regular: Show broadcasted regularly throughout the year)

1734
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:16,896
- Are you serious?
- What?

1735
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:19,536
Our show has been going on for almost a year.

1736
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:21,476
- We've been going on for a year.
- It's been quite a while.

1737
00:58:21,476 --> 00:58:22,776
- No.
- This won't do. I'll tuck it in.

1738
00:58:22,776 --> 00:58:24,246
- Hold on.
- We weren't a regular show.

1739
00:58:24,246 --> 00:58:27,776
Even the Marketing Team isn't sure about us.

1740
00:58:28,176 --> 00:58:30,176
- That's how bad things are for us.
- Right.

1741
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:31,616
- Right.
- We're in danger.

1742
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:33,646
I realized that after coming to headquarters.

1743
00:58:33,746 --> 00:58:35,586
We weren't a regular show.

1744
00:58:35,856 --> 00:58:36,916
But aren't we surviving for a really long time...

1745
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:37,956
even though we're not a regular show?

1746
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:39,156
We're surviving for a long time.

1747
00:58:39,156 --> 00:58:40,156
We're carrying on longer than a regular show.

1748
00:58:40,156 --> 00:58:41,156
"Until the End."

1749
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:43,196
Shall we meet the chief director?

1750
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:45,426
Thank you for sparing us with your time.

1751
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:46,626
- Thank you.
- We'll work hard.

1752
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:47,636
Please continue your work for us.

1753
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:49,036
- Thank you.
- We will also work hard.

1754
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:50,036
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1755
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:51,106
Thank you.

1756
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:53,206
What are we then?

1757
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:55,336
- We're not a seasonal show.
- We're still a pilot show.

1758
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,276
We're still a pilot show?

1759
00:58:59,346 --> 00:59:04,316
(The chief director's office is busy with a meeting.)

1760
00:59:05,316 --> 00:59:07,916
He's already in a meeting.

1761
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:10,486
The posters are up here, but we're missing.

1762
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:14,426
Our poster isn't here.

1763
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,996
(Several posters are put up in front of the chief director's office.)

1764
00:59:17,996 --> 00:59:19,266
- Dong Hyun is here. One, - Right.

1765
00:59:19,266 --> 00:59:20,296
two, three.

1766
00:59:20,296 --> 00:59:22,096
- Are you serious?
- That one is...

1767
00:59:22,536 --> 00:59:23,936
Dong Hyun is in four shows then.

1768
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,136
The season is over for that one.

1769
00:59:25,136 --> 00:59:26,366
Are we coming to an end?

1770
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,206
- Why aren't we up here?
- Will our show be over soon?

1771
00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:30,076
- Who knows?
- But...

1772
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:32,176
- why are these put up here?
- We're not here at all.

1773
00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:33,206
This one will be over soon.

1774
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:34,616
Why take pictures when our poster isn't up there?

1775
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:35,946
I'm going to make a complaint.

1776
00:59:36,216 --> 00:59:37,476
- You're going to make a complaint?
- Yes.

1777
00:59:37,476 --> 00:59:38,916
- He's inside?
- Let's go.

1778
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,016
You should lead us then, Dong Hyun.

1779
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:41,186
(They enter the office with a lot of question marks.)

1780
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,016
The uncle of tvN should enter first.

1781
00:59:44,116 --> 00:59:45,256
(Knocking)

1782
00:59:45,256 --> 00:59:46,826
Let us welcome them. Gosh.

1783
00:59:48,696 --> 00:59:50,626
- Hello.
- Hello.

1784
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:54,466
(Bowing like a flip phone)

1785
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:55,766
- Hello.
- Hello.

1786
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,136
- We're dressed like this.
- Hello.

1787
00:59:57,236 --> 00:59:58,936
What's going on, Tae Hyun?

1788
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,206
(The Handsome Guys greet them politely.)

1789
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:02,406
Gosh, hello.

1790
01:00:02,406 --> 01:00:03,876
- Are they shorts or trunks?
- Hello.

1791
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:05,676
Have you come from home like this?

1792
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:07,876
- Yes.
- Yes. We came like this from home.

1793
01:00:08,216 --> 01:00:09,346
The guesthouse.

1794
01:00:09,346 --> 01:00:10,376
(Fascinated)

1795
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:11,946
Have one of these.

1796
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:15,116
(Sang Uk places down the drinks politely.)

1797
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:16,186
Thank you.

1798
01:00:16,486 --> 01:00:18,526
Please take a seat. Sit here, Dong Hyun.

1799
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:19,626
Gosh.

1800
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:22,556
The one with normal pants should sit here.

1801
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:24,966
- Right.
- Take the seat in front.

1802
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:26,366
For now...

1803
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:28,896
I'm sorry, Chief Director.

1804
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:31,306
Could the air conditioner be a bit stronger?

1805
01:00:31,306 --> 01:00:33,106
Sure.

1806
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:34,376
Can I sit there?

1807
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:36,236
The first thing he asked for was to turn up the AC.

1808
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:37,606
He sweats a lot.

1809
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:41,776
(The Handsome Guys take their seats in the chief director's office.)

1810
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,546
What kind of meeting was this?

1811
01:00:43,546 --> 01:00:46,616
At 2pm every Monday,

1812
01:00:46,616 --> 01:00:49,556
we have a weekly meeting based on the issues of the company.

1813
01:00:49,716 --> 01:00:52,326
The business managers are gathered...

1814
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,296
and we discuss things like the future of Handsome Guys.

1815
01:00:55,296 --> 01:00:56,456
(Today's issue: The future of Handsome Guys)

1816
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:58,296
- We were already curious...
- This is an important meeting.

1817
01:00:58,296 --> 01:01:00,626
and wanted to ask about this.

1818
01:01:00,626 --> 01:01:03,596
Soon, we will be reaching...

1819
01:01:03,596 --> 01:01:06,236
- our first anniversary.
- Right.

1820
01:01:06,236 --> 01:01:07,566
It was a tough journey, wasn't it?

1821
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:08,806
Right.

1822
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:11,306
We heard that from the Marketing Team.

1823
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:12,676
What did the Marketing Team tell you?

1824
01:01:12,676 --> 01:01:14,516
They want our show to be a regular show.

1825
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:16,576
(Feeling guilty)

1826
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:17,676
- Gosh.
- Does that mean...

1827
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:19,886
we're a pilot show?

1828
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:21,616
We're definitely not a seasonal show.

1829
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:23,616
Even after carrying on for a year,

1830
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:25,156
they wanted the show to be a regular show?

1831
01:01:25,156 --> 01:01:26,156
Yes.

1832
01:01:26,156 --> 01:01:27,756
We would like to know...

1833
01:01:27,756 --> 01:01:30,756
where we are currently positioned and facing toward.

1834
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:33,366
It would be great to hear about that in person.

1835
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:36,836
What do you all think about Handsome Guys?

1836
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:38,166
First of all,

1837
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:40,336
we've done our best to survive.

1838
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:42,036
(Laughing)

1839
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:43,876
As you would all know, it's not the strong that survive.

1840
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:45,676
- Right.
- The ones that survive...

1841
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:47,276
- are strong.
- Right.

1842
01:01:47,276 --> 01:01:49,876
I believe we are setting an example for that.

1843
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:52,216
Right. This is what I think.

1844
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,146
I'm not sure if this is the right way to put it,

1845
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:55,356
but we're on the line.

1846
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,256
(It's sad but funny.)

1847
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,726
It would be great for us to come up just a bit more,

1848
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:01,996
- but that's hard for us to do.
- Right.

1849
01:02:01,996 --> 01:02:02,996
That's what it feels like.

1850
01:02:02,996 --> 01:02:04,026
Right.

1851
01:02:04,356 --> 01:02:07,026
I called over the producer...

1852
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:09,336
- Right.
- and asked about the show.

1853
01:02:09,536 --> 01:02:12,166
The producer said he would make one last gamble.

1854
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,836
Is this why I'm dressed like this?

1855
01:02:13,836 --> 01:02:14,976
This was his gamble?

1856
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:17,336
- Was this why I was stripped off?
- With the hwatu shorts.

1857
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:20,246
- Gosh.
- To keep this show alive.

1858
01:02:20,546 --> 01:02:22,976
He said that the members were lovable and great.

1859
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:26,586
He said that he wanted to work with these members for a long time.

1860
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:30,086
- But will that be possible?
- Right.

1861
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:32,256
- Well, - That's the most important part.

1862
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:35,996
we got our fortunes read.

1863
01:02:35,996 --> 01:02:37,726
We met a famous person...

1864
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,666
and we were told that after a change at the second half of the year.

1865
01:02:39,826 --> 01:02:42,436
We were told that we would become a great success if we survive.

1866
01:02:42,436 --> 01:02:43,466
Really?

1867
01:02:43,866 --> 01:02:47,266
(The New Year's Fortune Special this February)

1868
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:50,676
(You will become tvN's representative variety show!)

1869
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:52,676
(Tell the chief director this.)

1870
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:56,216
(We have to survive through the first half of the year.)

1871
01:02:56,676 --> 01:02:57,746
What happens if the show doesn't survive?

1872
01:02:57,746 --> 01:02:59,186
If the show doesn't survive...

1873
01:03:00,016 --> 01:03:01,786
We still made it this far.

1874
01:03:02,186 --> 01:03:03,786
Right. It's September...

1875
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:05,926
and we will be reaching October with the content we have.

1876
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,096
Should we try to survive until our first anniversary?

1877
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:11,026
- Well...
- Am I the only one that remembers?

1878
01:03:11,026 --> 01:03:13,096
Didn't she say all tvN shows will do well in the end?

1879
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:14,226
- She said that.
- Right.

1880
01:03:14,226 --> 01:03:15,766
- I remember her saying that.
- All shows will do well.

1881
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:18,706
We are considering Handsome Guys as a serious topic.

1882
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,506
Would you like to take a look?

1883
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:21,706
- What?
- Yes.

1884
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:22,876
- I've never seen this before.
- That's fascinating.

1885
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:24,476
It's a graph of the viewer ratings per minute.

1886
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,476
It says, "Guest John Park."

1887
01:03:26,876 --> 01:03:28,046
Fortunately,

1888
01:03:28,616 --> 01:03:30,746
- it's a rising curve.
- Right.

1889
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:32,016
- The show is on a rising curve.
- Right?

1890
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,146
It's attracting more viewers.

1891
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,186
- Right.
- Right.

1892
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,616
(Chuckling)

1893
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:38,286
There's a bit of disappointment.

1894
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:41,326
(What kind of disappointment?)

1895
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,426
There's no expectation for all of you.

1896
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:46,666
There's no expectation for all of you.

1897
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:48,896
(That was harsh.)

1898
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:50,296
So that's how we are viewed.

1899
01:03:50,296 --> 01:03:52,106
- But...
- I see.

1900
01:03:52,236 --> 01:03:53,636
what does it mean when the graph is going up?

1901
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:55,236
The viewers tend to enjoy it more and more while watching.

1902
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:56,976
That is what the graph represents.

1903
01:03:56,976 --> 01:03:59,746
So if the graph was going down,

1904
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:01,146
- we wouldn't have reached this far.
- If it was going down,

1905
01:04:01,146 --> 01:04:03,446
you all wouldn't have been able to come here.

1906
01:04:03,446 --> 01:04:06,616
We survived because it showed a rising curve.

1907
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:09,086
The rising curve brought us here.

1908
01:04:09,256 --> 01:04:11,586
He wanted to see the members in person.

1909
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:13,986
With "Infinite Challenge" in the past,

1910
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:16,996
there were members that played the villain.

1911
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:20,396
The members of Handsome Guys are all just handsome.

1912
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:21,866
- We're all nice.
- You're all just handsome.

1913
01:04:21,866 --> 01:04:23,936
We're all nice. There's no back and forth.

1914
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:25,536
Are we too nice? Should we fight each other?

1915
01:04:25,536 --> 01:04:27,366
Right. I think that's a good idea.

1916
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:30,136
- I think that's a good idea.
- We have to fight.

1917
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,176
The viewer ratings were good...

1918
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:33,806
- when Dong Hyun did low kicks.
- I see.

1919
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:35,046
That's a good idea.

1920
01:04:35,616 --> 01:04:38,146
Let's bring out the low kicks when things aren't going well.

1921
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:40,916
I can do that all the time. That's not hard for me to do.

1922
01:04:41,786 --> 01:04:43,286
Or we could start with them today.

1923
01:04:43,956 --> 01:04:46,456
- Today?
- If there's anyone willing...

1924
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:48,856
Oh, right.

1925
01:04:48,856 --> 01:04:50,356
Have you experienced a low kick before?

1926
01:04:50,356 --> 01:04:52,366
(Have you experienced a low kick before?)

1927
01:04:52,366 --> 01:04:54,366
Do we have to go that far?

1928
01:04:54,366 --> 01:04:55,466
We'll be in big trouble.

1929
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:57,036
Or...

1930
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:58,936
it could be the business manager.

1931
01:05:00,866 --> 01:05:02,076
We'll be in big trouble.

1932
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,476
We were told that there were no villains among us.

1933
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,176
If we pass with the low kicks,

1934
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:08,176
we'll be called the nice guys again.

1935
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:09,676
- Right.
- Aren't I right?

1936
01:05:09,676 --> 01:05:10,776
In my opinion...

1937
01:05:11,216 --> 01:05:12,616
(You said there were no expectations...)

1938
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:15,656
(and villains.)

1939
01:05:15,656 --> 01:05:17,316
Will it be the chief director...

1940
01:05:18,026 --> 01:05:19,526
- Gosh.
- or the business manager?

1941
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:21,026
I think it should be the business manager.

1942
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:22,156
- You two should decide.
- Well,

1943
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:24,496
I don't have the right to make decisions on the show.

1944
01:05:24,496 --> 01:05:25,866
- You don't?
- The one with that right...

1945
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:27,426
- is the chief director.
- The business manager...

1946
01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:28,596
I can't decide on anything.

1947
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:32,066
The business manager is the one in charge.

1948
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:33,836
Could the two of you play rock-paper-scissors?

1949
01:05:35,636 --> 01:05:36,776
Could the two of you play rock-paper-scissors?

1950
01:05:36,776 --> 01:05:38,946
(Flustered)

1951
01:05:39,146 --> 01:05:40,446
(This is amazing.)

1952
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:41,516
Gosh.

1953
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,176
This is for Kim Dong Hyun's low kick...

1954
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:44,476
that will bring up the viewer ratings.

1955
01:05:44,476 --> 01:05:45,516
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

1956
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:47,286
Let's go past 2.1 percent with this.

1957
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:48,556
Will the loser take the kick?

1958
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:50,656
- The loser should take the kick.
- Right.

1959
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:51,856
- All right.
- Gosh.

1960
01:05:52,026 --> 01:05:53,586
- It's a single round, right?
- It's down low right now.

1961
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:54,856
It will be a single round.

1962
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:56,296
- You should call it out for them.
- Okay.

1963
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:58,196
All right. Here I go. It's a single round.

1964
01:05:58,326 --> 01:05:59,826
Ready or not,

1965
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:01,026
rock-paper-scissors!

1966
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:03,096
(Scissors, paper)

1967
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,606
(Chief Director Kim Yu Kon wins the low kick.)

1968
01:06:06,606 --> 01:06:08,176
- All right.
- It's the chief director.

1969
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:10,036
Everything is set.

1970
01:06:10,106 --> 01:06:12,146
This will bring it up to 2.5 percent.

1971
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:13,876
I don't think I will be able to handle it.

1972
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:16,616
(The chief director enters the stage.)

1973
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:19,116
Which angle is the best for the camera directors?

1974
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:21,016
Is this angle okay?

1975
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:22,186
I'll move here.

1976
01:06:22,486 --> 01:06:24,616
The chief director will take a low kick right now.

1977
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:26,086
Are there people who want to take a look?

1978
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:28,626
It's okay. Just come.

1979
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:30,396
Come over if you want to take a look.

1980
01:06:30,956 --> 01:06:32,266
- Come on over.
- Come on over.

1981
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:34,426
Come and take a look.

1982
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:35,596
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1983
01:06:35,596 --> 01:06:38,566
Get your cameras ready! You should all film it.

1984
01:06:39,836 --> 01:06:42,176
They're all watching.

1985
01:06:42,776 --> 01:06:43,836
(The seats are filled.)

1986
01:06:43,836 --> 01:06:45,006
My gosh.

1987
01:06:45,946 --> 01:06:47,806
(Putting on a bitter smile)

1988
01:06:47,806 --> 01:06:49,846
Feel free to make posts after this episode goes up.

1989
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:52,046
Please tell me that you're fine with this.

1990
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:53,516
Ask me to give you a clean hit...

1991
01:06:53,516 --> 01:06:55,616
for a better future of the show. That way, I will be able to...

1992
01:06:55,616 --> 01:06:58,016
Give me a clean hit for a better future of the show!

1993
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,626
I can endure it.

1994
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:01,086
Why are you being so polite all of a sudden?

1995
01:07:01,596 --> 01:07:02,756
(Laughing)

1996
01:07:02,756 --> 01:07:04,726
- Say, "Dong Hyun, hit me!" - Dong Hyun, hit me!

1997
01:07:04,996 --> 01:07:06,396
- Here I go.
- I can hold out. Dong Hyun, hit me!

1998
01:07:08,536 --> 01:07:10,336
(Groaning)

1999
01:07:18,876 --> 01:07:20,906
(Handsome Guys are highly satisfied.)

2000
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,716
I mean, how could you...

2001
01:07:22,716 --> 01:07:23,746
(Handsome Guys are highly satisfied.)

2002
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:27,816
(The audience is satisfied as well.)

2003
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:30,256
I mean...

2004
01:07:30,816 --> 01:07:32,256
Help him up.

2005
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:34,026
- I mean...
- Chief director.

2006
01:07:34,026 --> 01:07:35,096
- Are you okay?
- How could you...

2007
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:36,096
(Chief director! Where are you going?)

2008
01:07:36,096 --> 01:07:38,626
Seriously, you feel like...

2009
01:07:38,626 --> 01:07:40,466
you've been electrocuted. Walk slowly.

2010
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:43,666
- It's no joke.
- What's this?

2011
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:45,136
- Are you okay? What should I do?
- What's this?

2012
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:47,406
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

2013
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:48,506
I'm okay.

2014
01:07:48,506 --> 01:07:50,276
Rub the skin a bit.

2015
01:07:50,276 --> 01:07:52,406
- Straighten your legs.
- I'm okay.

2016
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,606
- Are you okay? Did I kick too hard?
- It was better than I expected.

2017
01:07:54,606 --> 01:07:56,016
- Did I kick too hard?
- He's okay.

2018
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:57,746
- Did I kick too hard?
- You feel like...

2019
01:07:57,746 --> 01:07:58,916
you've been electrocuted.

2020
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:00,446
- Seriously.
- Are you okay?

2021
01:08:01,186 --> 01:08:03,716
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Please upload it everywhere.

2022
01:08:03,716 --> 01:08:05,556
- Thank you.
- Please upload it everywhere.

2023
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:07,556
(Chief director of tvN makes a big sacrifice for TV ratings.)

2024
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:08,756
Oh, no.

2025
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,626
(Kick hard.)

2026
01:08:10,726 --> 01:08:14,526
(Laughing)

2027
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:15,936
Seriously,

2028
01:08:15,936 --> 01:08:17,236
there's no chief director like him.

2029
01:08:17,236 --> 01:08:18,936
It's one thing if all of us get fired,

2030
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:20,866
but if only I get fired next week...

2031
01:08:20,866 --> 01:08:23,376
- That won't happen.
- That won't happen, right?

2032
01:08:23,636 --> 01:08:24,636
That won't happen.

2033
01:08:24,636 --> 01:08:27,406
Please show a performance...

2034
01:08:27,406 --> 01:08:29,616
that's as impactful as a kick on this show.

2035
01:08:30,216 --> 01:08:33,246
When it comes to the changed format,

2036
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:34,246
I'm confident.

2037
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:36,756
He's cool.

2038
01:08:36,756 --> 01:08:37,886
(Rascal Seung Ho is ambitious.)

2039
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:40,456
Thank you. We'll work hard.

2040
01:08:40,456 --> 01:08:42,026
- Okay. We're in your care.
- Thank you.

2041
01:08:42,026 --> 01:08:43,256
We're in your care.

2042
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:44,356
(Please continue to watch Handsome Guys.)

2043
01:08:44,356 --> 01:08:45,896
- We need to do well.
- Yes.

2044
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:47,296
Please do well. Seriously.

2045
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,066
- Please continue to watch us.
- Okay.

2046
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:50,366
(The meeting with the chief director ends.)

2047
01:08:50,366 --> 01:08:52,336
What? Aren't we going home?

2048
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:56,776
(Please come in here for a second before you go home.)

2049
01:08:57,276 --> 01:08:58,976
Why is everyone gathered around?

2050
01:08:58,976 --> 01:09:00,846
It looks like we'll do something.

2051
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:02,646
For goodness' sake.

2052
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:06,046
We'll do something. I should've known.

2053
01:09:06,616 --> 01:09:09,116
You have an important schedule this evening.

2054
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:10,656
That's right. Club.

2055
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:11,886
Yes. The club activity.

2056
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,296
- Flower arrangement or bowling.
- That's right.

2057
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:16,856
Are there any other clubs?

2058
01:09:17,296 --> 01:09:18,626
Is there no swim club?

2059
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:20,866
- Will you go in right away?
- A swim club.

2060
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:21,936
You can go into the water right away.

2061
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:25,436
Going to the club in those outfits will be a bit...

2062
01:09:25,436 --> 01:09:27,536
- Except for Yi Kyung...
- I'm dressed nicely.

2063
01:09:27,536 --> 01:09:28,936
He looks normal.

2064
01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:30,836
I didn't know that jeans were so helpful.

2065
01:09:31,476 --> 01:09:34,346
Thus, you'll play games.

2066
01:09:34,346 --> 01:09:35,516
Okay.

2067
01:09:35,516 --> 01:09:36,616
- Please.
- This time,

2068
01:09:36,616 --> 01:09:38,116
the top three will get the benefit.

2069
01:09:38,116 --> 01:09:39,116
Oh, my.

2070
01:09:39,816 --> 01:09:41,556
The first place...

2071
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,786
will get 1 top and 1 pair of pants.

2072
01:09:43,786 --> 01:09:45,186
(1 top and 1 pair of pants will be provided.)

2073
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:46,556
- Will we be able to keep them?
- Yes.

2074
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:47,956
- Will we be able to keep them?
- Yes.

2075
01:09:47,956 --> 01:09:50,326
The second place, just like Yi Kyung, will get...

2076
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:51,826
- either the top...
- We get to decide.

2077
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:52,926
or the pants.

2078
01:09:52,926 --> 01:09:53,996
- How about the third place?
- Also,

2079
01:09:53,996 --> 01:09:55,036
the third place...

2080
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:56,796
will get his shoes back.

2081
01:09:57,836 --> 01:09:59,506
- The dress shoes?
- It'll be a penalty.

2082
01:09:59,506 --> 01:10:01,266
No. We have your sneakers.

2083
01:10:01,266 --> 01:10:02,536
- Do you have our sneakers?
- Yes.

2084
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:05,806
- When did you get them?
- I like the slippers I'm wearing.

2085
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:08,276
Just avoid placing third then.

2086
01:10:08,276 --> 01:10:11,346
You know, adjustment is a scary thing.

2087
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:13,116
I've adjusted to this outfit.

2088
01:10:13,616 --> 01:10:15,016
Placing third doesn't have any merits, right?

2089
01:10:15,016 --> 01:10:17,186
- Sneakers will look strange.
- I like these slippers.

2090
01:10:17,586 --> 01:10:18,856
Will you play games haphazardly?

2091
01:10:19,086 --> 01:10:20,926
Well, let's do this.

2092
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,026
(He answers haphazardly.)

2093
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:25,566
- Here comes the first game.
- Okay. Please.

2094
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:26,596
Please let me be lucky.

2095
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,596
Please don't let it be a physical game.

2096
01:10:29,966 --> 01:10:31,736
(Clothes?)

2097
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:34,436
The way you threw clothes at us was a bit...

2098
01:10:34,436 --> 01:10:36,706
The way we rushed to them was a bit sad.

2099
01:10:36,706 --> 01:10:38,246
We were like, "Those are clothes!"

2100
01:10:39,246 --> 01:10:40,906
(They take a pair of pants each.)

2101
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:41,976
I mean...

2102
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:45,116
I mean, while clothes are precious...

2103
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:46,246
Shall we put them on?

2104
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:47,746
You'll put them on, but...

2105
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:50,556
- I guess we need to wear them fast.
- Wear the work pants...

2106
01:10:50,556 --> 01:10:53,626
to the waist without using your hands to complete the mission.

2107
01:10:53,626 --> 01:10:54,756
- Hold on.
- These pants?

2108
01:10:55,196 --> 01:10:57,726
How will we wear these pants to the waist?

2109
01:10:57,726 --> 01:10:59,666
- Without using the hands?
- Yes.

2110
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:01,366
I'm really good at this.

2111
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:04,436
I had a similar scene in a drama one time,

2112
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:06,266
so I practiced for over an hour the day before.

2113
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:08,836
That's cheating. Then you should place third.

2114
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:10,976
Okay. But this is...

2115
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,976
- In this state?
- Yes.

2116
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:15,916
If anyone uses his hands, we'll pull down his pants.

2117
01:11:15,916 --> 01:11:17,776
We'll tell him to start over. Don't use your hands.

2118
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:19,346
Let's be careful when we pull down the pants.

2119
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:21,446
- It might lead to an accident.
- That's right.

2120
01:11:21,446 --> 01:11:23,786
If we remove 3 layers instead of 1...

2121
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:25,986
There's no way we'll remove three layers.

2122
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:27,386
(Laughing)

2123
01:11:27,386 --> 01:11:29,526
You'll survive in the order of wearing the pants.

2124
01:11:29,526 --> 01:11:31,926
The last one will get eliminated.

2125
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:33,096
We just need to avoid placing last.

2126
01:11:33,766 --> 01:11:35,236
Now, let's begin.

2127
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:37,366
- I'm at a disadvantage.
- Don't put your feet inside.

2128
01:11:37,366 --> 01:11:38,506
- Take your feet out.
- Hey.

2129
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:41,136
(Hey.)

2130
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:42,836
(Hey!)

2131
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:44,436
- Start the game now.
- Set...

2132
01:11:44,436 --> 01:11:45,506
Start it now. Hurry up.

2133
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:46,806
- Okay.
- Okay.

2134
01:11:46,946 --> 01:11:48,846
(Walking over)

2135
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:50,176
He's relaxed.

2136
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:51,946
He's confident that he'll still win.

2137
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:53,586
(Other Handsome Guys)

2138
01:11:53,816 --> 01:11:56,216
(He's busy putting in the toes first.)

2139
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:58,956
My feet went into the pockets.

2140
01:12:00,186 --> 01:12:02,796
(Sang Uk struggles from the get-go.)

2141
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:04,326
(The experienced one, Yi Kyung)

2142
01:12:04,326 --> 01:12:05,366
There you go.

2143
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:06,566
(He succeeds in putting in his feet.)

2144
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:07,566
Hold on.

2145
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:09,236
(Yi Kyung gets ahead.)

2146
01:12:09,236 --> 01:12:10,336
There you go.

2147
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,266
Should I lie down like that?

2148
01:12:13,706 --> 01:12:14,836
Is that how you do it?

2149
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:16,076
Let's copy it.

2150
01:12:16,076 --> 01:12:18,006
(Let's copy Yi Kyung!)

2151
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:20,106
There you go.

2152
01:12:20,106 --> 01:12:21,646
(Seung Ho lies down on his back right away.)

2153
01:12:22,246 --> 01:12:25,046
I use my entire body. My entire body is a weapon.

2154
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,886
(Dong Hyun works fast.)

2155
01:12:26,886 --> 01:12:28,686
For people like us, the entire body is a weapon.

2156
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:31,056
If we go to war, we can survive in the water...

2157
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:32,226
with nothing but a pair of pants.

2158
01:12:33,686 --> 01:12:34,726
What should I do?

2159
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,956
(Did he rip the pants?)

2160
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:38,466
(Ripping)

2161
01:12:39,226 --> 01:12:40,226
(Ripping)

2162
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:41,996
(Ripping)

2163
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,436
(He rips them instead of pulling them up.)

2164
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:50,936
(Doing the hip turn at full power)

2165
01:12:51,006 --> 01:12:52,246
Hey, is that how you do it?

2166
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,446
(Okay, I'll do the same.)

2167
01:12:57,476 --> 01:13:00,386
(They suddenly have a dance battle.)

2168
01:13:00,446 --> 01:13:02,156
(A one-leg kick?)

2169
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:05,756
(Is this Street Handsome Fighter?)

2170
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:07,456
They won't go up because of my jeans.

2171
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:12,996
No, the bottom...

2172
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:15,596
(Changing the target)

2173
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,266
People like us... Gosh, move.

2174
01:13:17,836 --> 01:13:19,066
Move.

2175
01:13:20,406 --> 01:13:21,876
(He takes Yi Kyung down right away.)

2176
01:13:21,876 --> 01:13:25,106
(The Cicada Kim mode is on.)

2177
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:27,676
(Yi Kyung faces the danger of getting his pants pulled down.)

2178
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:29,416
No! I wore them with so much effort.

2179
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:31,846
(While Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung struggle)

2180
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:32,846
Don't come near me.

2181
01:13:33,546 --> 01:13:34,716
This is the problem.

2182
01:13:34,716 --> 01:13:38,726
(Other members get ahead.)

2183
01:13:39,186 --> 01:13:40,256
Look at Seung Ho.

2184
01:13:40,256 --> 01:13:42,256
(Except for Seung Ho)

2185
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:44,396
(Handsome Guys give it the last spurt.)

2186
01:13:44,726 --> 01:13:46,626
(He pulls up the pants by doing squats.)

2187
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:49,996
(Sang Uk uses the fencing steps.)

2188
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:52,536
They won't go past the hips.

2189
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:55,776
How do you pull them up from here?

2190
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:57,176
We got this far.

2191
01:13:58,306 --> 01:14:00,706
How do you pull them up from here?

2192
01:14:00,706 --> 01:14:01,916
(The work pants stop at the hips.)

2193
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:02,976
What should we do?

2194
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:08,716
(They'll advance to the next round if the pants go above the hips.)

2195
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,056
(Wearing the pants with so much effort)

2196
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:12,126
Gosh, this is...

2197
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:14,456
What should we do?

2198
01:14:15,396 --> 01:14:16,426
(Clattering)

2199
01:14:16,696 --> 01:14:17,756
(Clattering)

2200
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:24,196
(They're going up.)

2201
01:14:25,466 --> 01:14:26,636
For goodness' sake.

2202
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,976
For goodness' sake.

2203
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:31,906
That's it!

2204
01:14:32,106 --> 01:14:34,276
(Run to the stanchion!)

2205
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,646
(Run.)

2206
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:42,486
(Yi Kyung started the stanchion craze.)

2207
01:14:42,986 --> 01:14:44,216
(Go up.)

2208
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:45,256
How did you do it?

2209
01:14:45,256 --> 01:14:47,456
(Go up, pants.)

2210
01:14:47,926 --> 01:14:50,896
(While they were busy using the tool,)

2211
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:52,666
(Sang Uk continued to use his body.)

2212
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:53,896
Isn't this good enough?

2213
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:55,096
Turn around.

2214
01:14:56,566 --> 01:14:58,036
- Success.
- They went this far.

2215
01:14:58,536 --> 01:14:59,636
How about me?

2216
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,536
(Up next is Yi Kyung.)

2217
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:03,076
- Yi Kyung, success.
- Success.

2218
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:05,876
- Isn't this good enough?
- Let me take a look.

2219
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,446
- Dong Hyun, success.
- Okay.

2220
01:15:07,446 --> 01:15:08,506
(Dong Hyun gets a pass.)

2221
01:15:08,506 --> 01:15:10,416
(Tae Hyun and Seung Ho remain.)

2222
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:14,446
(Who will get eliminated?)

2223
01:15:14,446 --> 01:15:16,386
Isn't this good enough? Because of my microphone...

2224
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:17,456
Turn around.

2225
01:15:17,456 --> 01:15:18,756
They won't go up further.

2226
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:21,656
- Seung Ho, how about you?
- Look at him.

2227
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,596
My butt is inside the pants.

2228
01:15:25,826 --> 01:15:27,166
- Right?
- Tae Hyun, success.

2229
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,426
(Tae Hyun wins by a landslide.)

2230
01:15:28,426 --> 01:15:30,966
I walk around like this.

2231
01:15:30,966 --> 01:15:32,936
Your buttcrack isn't covered.

2232
01:15:33,306 --> 01:15:35,106
Its eyes are peeking out.

2233
01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,206
(The sad eyes of an orangutan that's faced with elimination)

2234
01:15:36,206 --> 01:15:37,806
- The eyes should be covered.
- This is...

2235
01:15:37,806 --> 01:15:38,946
It's watching.

2236
01:15:38,946 --> 01:15:40,206
(The cut-off point is clear.)

2237
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:41,846
Seung Ho, you're out.

2238
01:15:41,846 --> 01:15:42,946
Okay.

2239
01:15:42,946 --> 01:15:44,346
- I did it with all of my might.
- Same here.

2240
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:46,716
- Seung Ho, well done.
- I did it with all of my might.

2241
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:47,786
Good luck.

2242
01:15:47,786 --> 01:15:50,886
- We just need to survive once more.
- I'm sweating.

2243
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:53,726
- You're right.
- Let's proceed with the next game.

2244
01:15:53,726 --> 01:15:54,786
(They quickly move on to Round 2.)

2245
01:15:54,786 --> 01:15:56,456
- Come on in.
- What is it this time?

2246
01:15:56,696 --> 01:15:59,066
I'm scared. What if the chief director enters?

2247
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:00,626
- It must be something big.
- What?

2248
01:16:00,766 --> 01:16:01,766
(My goodness)

2249
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,979
- Hold on. That's...
- I know what it is. You blow on it.

2250
01:16:04,053 --> 01:16:06,223
I'm scared. What if the chief director enters?

2251
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:07,663
- It must be something big.
- What?

2252
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,593
Hold on. That's...

2253
01:16:09,593 --> 01:16:11,233
I know what it is. You blow on it.

2254
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,233
(A mini soccer field enters the stage.)

2255
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:13,403
It isn't half bad.

2256
01:16:13,533 --> 01:16:14,803
- Seriously.
- What is it?

2257
01:16:16,303 --> 01:16:21,503
(The 2nd game, 2-on-2 Mouth Soccer)

2258
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,643
(There's mouthwash to protect the players.)

2259
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,313
They made many preparations.

2260
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:28,313
Now that I'm old, it'll be hard.

2261
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,453
It won't be easy.

2262
01:16:30,813 --> 01:16:31,983
I'll explain the rules first.

2263
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,153
The next game is the Mouth Soccer.

2264
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:35,153
For goodness' sake.

2265
01:16:35,153 --> 01:16:36,593
It'll be a 2-on-2 team match.

2266
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,093
You'll blow on a table tennis ball...

2267
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,923
and put it in the opposing team's goalpost.

2268
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,593
The 1st and 2nd halves will be 5 minutes each.

2269
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:43,593
It's too long.

2270
01:16:43,593 --> 01:16:45,193
- Five minutes?
- We'll be dizzy.

2271
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:46,733
I'm sorry,

2272
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:47,833
but please remove the mouthwash.

2273
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:50,133
(Please remove the mouthwash.)

2274
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:51,233
Overcoming the smell is a part of the game.

2275
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:53,673
The team that scores more goals will win.

2276
01:16:53,673 --> 01:16:56,743
The winning team members will be 1st and 2nd places.

2277
01:16:57,243 --> 01:16:58,743
- Shall we decide on the teams?
- The teams...

2278
01:16:58,743 --> 01:16:59,813
It's a team competition. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2279
01:16:59,813 --> 01:17:00,843
Rock-paper-scissors.

2280
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,183
- The winner will pick his teammate.
- Okay.

2281
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:05,113
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2282
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:07,153
(Sang Uk and Yi Kyung are out.)

2283
01:17:07,153 --> 01:17:08,583
Rock-paper-scissors.

2284
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:09,723
With whom do you want to play?

2285
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,523
The winning team members will be 1st and 2nd places.

2286
01:17:11,523 --> 01:17:12,593
I choose...

2287
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:14,893
the one who's good at every game,

2288
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,063
Yi Kyung.

2289
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:17,933
- Yi Kyung is good at games.
- Okay.

2290
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,733
- Hey, Sang Uk is still an athlete.
- That's right.

2291
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,533
- His lung capacity must be insane.
- We'll win.

2292
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:24,003
(The national fencer warms up his lungs.)

2293
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:25,203
I don't know about that.

2294
01:17:25,443 --> 01:17:26,743
Today, Dong Hyun...

2295
01:17:26,973 --> 01:17:28,103
didn't brush his teeth.

2296
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:29,543
I don't brush my teeth.

2297
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:30,573
I've never done it.

2298
01:17:30,573 --> 01:17:31,643
Brace yourselves. I've never done it.

2299
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:32,683
For goodness' sake.

2300
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:34,383
I've never done it. Brave yourselves.

2301
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,383
And earlier,

2302
01:17:35,383 --> 01:17:36,483
I ate so much pork shoulder, garlic,

2303
01:17:36,483 --> 01:17:37,813
and spinach. Be prepared.

2304
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:39,453
He's the real deal.

2305
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:41,653
(He's the only one who'll play with manners.)

2306
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:42,793
Shall we go inside?

2307
01:17:42,793 --> 01:17:43,823
(Now, the players enter.)

2308
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:47,423
(Under the watchful eyes of the orangutan referee)

2309
01:17:47,423 --> 01:17:49,493
I have no idea from which hole they'll come out of.

2310
01:17:49,493 --> 01:17:50,493
My goodness.

2311
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:53,203
(They boast of their teamwork by entering at the same time.)

2312
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:55,003
My chair is too low. Please adjust the height.

2313
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,933
(The ace player, Sang Uk, enters last.)

2314
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,403
If the height needs to be adjusted for your chair,

2315
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:00,503
tell me now.

2316
01:18:00,503 --> 01:18:01,543
(The atmosphere is heated up in the stadium.)

2317
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:02,613
We have the best referee...

2318
01:18:02,613 --> 01:18:03,913
- who used to play soccer.
- Yes.

2319
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,213
Seriously.

2320
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:06,843
- Seriously.
- He'll be precise.

2321
01:18:06,913 --> 01:18:08,683
Is it okay to put the ball in my mouth...

2322
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:10,653
and shoot it out?

2323
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,123
That's a penalty kick.

2324
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:14,153
- Is it allowed?
- Yes.

2325
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:16,493
But if you bite the rolling ball,

2326
01:18:16,493 --> 01:18:18,863
I'll put it in the mouth of the opposing players.

2327
01:18:19,523 --> 01:18:20,993
Then there will be a penalty kick.

2328
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:22,433
- So, it shouldn't enter the mouth.
- That's right.

2329
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,593
Should we blow on it only?

2330
01:18:23,593 --> 01:18:25,193
- It's dirty.
- It's dirty indeed.

2331
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,603
I can pass the ball.

2332
01:18:28,633 --> 01:18:29,903
He'll pass it to the center.

2333
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:31,533
Will you use a set piece?

2334
01:18:32,033 --> 01:18:33,943
In the first piece, biting the ball is prohibited.

2335
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:36,413
Follow the rules I've explained just now.

2336
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:38,113
- Okay.
- Don't put the ball in the mouth.

2337
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,143
The game will begin once the ball hits the ground.

2338
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,253
(Focused)

2339
01:18:42,253 --> 01:18:43,983
(Focused)

2340
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,453
(The first half)

2341
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:51,993
(From the start, they compete for the control of the ball.)

2342
01:18:53,193 --> 01:18:54,193
(Coughing)

2343
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,963
(The ace player experiences an unexpected breathing problem.)

2344
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,593
Shoot it hard once it gets closer.

2345
01:18:58,593 --> 01:18:59,963
Shoot it.

2346
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,433
There you go.

2347
01:19:02,573 --> 01:19:04,633
(Tae Hyun plays the game calmly.)

2348
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,773
He's dribbling.

2349
01:19:05,773 --> 01:19:08,143
We need to block the middle.

2350
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:09,343
Collect your breath.

2351
01:19:09,873 --> 01:19:11,713
(They work together to blow on the ball!)

2352
01:19:12,143 --> 01:19:14,213
- It's a chance.
- Give it to me.

2353
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,343
Pass it to me.

2354
01:19:15,613 --> 01:19:16,613
At once.

2355
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:18,283
(Did the ball float?)

2356
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:20,223
He made the ball float. I've never seen it before.

2357
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:22,193
(Oh, my!)

2358
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:24,593
(Yi Kyung is good with his mouth.)

2359
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:25,923
- What?
- What a technique.

2360
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:27,193
What kind of a technique is that?

2361
01:19:27,193 --> 01:19:29,933
(He traps the ball like magic.)

2362
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,233
If you send it out, it'll lead to a corner kick.

2363
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,333
What kind of a technique is that?

2364
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:33,963
(He's flustered by a never-before-seen technique.)

2365
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,433
That's right.

2366
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:37,173
There we go.

2367
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:38,833
(He manages a save.)

2368
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:42,003
Gosh, it was so close.

2369
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:43,443
Do it at once.

2370
01:19:43,443 --> 01:19:45,313
Do it at once when it's near.

2371
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,913
Let me do it once when it comes to me.

2372
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:48,013
Send it here just once.

2373
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,153
(He has been warming up his mouth for 2 minutes.)

2374
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:51,713
Let me do it once when it comes to me.

2375
01:19:51,713 --> 01:19:53,783
Send it here just once.

2376
01:19:53,783 --> 01:19:55,183
(It's practically a match between Tae Hyun and Yi Kyung.)

2377
01:19:55,183 --> 01:19:56,653
The players are so...

2378
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:58,223
- I can do what I like, right?
- Yes.

2379
01:19:58,223 --> 01:19:59,763
- I'll do what I like.
- Okay.

2380
01:19:59,763 --> 01:20:01,323
I'll add one more ball.

2381
01:20:01,323 --> 01:20:02,893
Really?

2382
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,333
- Two balls?
- Yes.

2383
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,563
- Behind you!
- There are two balls.

2384
01:20:05,563 --> 01:20:06,763
- What?
- Stay alert.

2385
01:20:06,763 --> 01:20:08,163
What?

2386
01:20:08,163 --> 01:20:09,203
- Why are there two balls?
- Hurry up.

2387
01:20:09,673 --> 01:20:11,003
It's the same situation.

2388
01:20:11,003 --> 01:20:12,843
Send one here.

2389
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:14,343
Send one to me.

2390
01:20:16,073 --> 01:20:17,243
- Hey.
- What?

2391
01:20:17,743 --> 01:20:19,313
(It's the same situation with one more ball.)

2392
01:20:19,313 --> 01:20:20,413
- Hey.
- What?

2393
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:22,113
Isn't it the same situation?

2394
01:20:22,113 --> 01:20:23,153
Send one here.

2395
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:24,783
All right. I'll do it.

2396
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:25,853
I mean...

2397
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:27,983
I mean...

2398
01:20:28,483 --> 01:20:29,523
(It's a goal!)

2399
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:30,653
- It's 1 to 0.
- Okay!

2400
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,793
- Okay!
- I did it.

2401
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:34,093
(Sang Uk's amazing goal)

2402
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:35,223
- It's 1 to 0.
- Okay!

2403
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:36,393
(Tae Hyun and Sang Uk: 1 versus Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung: 0)

2404
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:37,633
Again.

2405
01:20:38,093 --> 01:20:39,233
I'll look for a chance.

2406
01:20:39,903 --> 01:20:40,903
Send it to me.

2407
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:42,233
- Go ahead.
- Send it.

2408
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:45,673
(A powerful shot)

2409
01:20:46,043 --> 01:20:47,573
Good. That's how you do it.

2410
01:20:49,473 --> 01:20:50,943
Good. That's how you do it.

2411
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,383
(It'll be the best goal of the day.)

2412
01:20:52,383 --> 01:20:53,383
It's 2 to 0.

2413
01:20:53,383 --> 01:20:54,413
- It's a goal!
- It's 2 to 0.

2414
01:20:54,413 --> 01:20:55,413
(Sang Uk finally begins to do well.)

2415
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:57,353
It's 2 to 0. Yi Kyung, hurry up.

2416
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:00,723
(This is insane.)

2417
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:01,753
It's 2 to 0.

2418
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,323
Yi Kyung, hurry up.

2419
01:21:04,323 --> 01:21:05,823
Send one to me.

2420
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,723
(He attacks quickly!)

2421
01:21:12,233 --> 01:21:13,363
Hey, we're winning.

2422
01:21:13,363 --> 01:21:15,233
Use a time-wasting tactic.

2423
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:16,603
- Use a time-wasting tactic.
- Lie down.

2424
01:21:16,603 --> 01:21:18,833
(Lie down!)

2425
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:23,873
Give us the balls!

2426
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:25,443
We need the balls.

2427
01:21:25,943 --> 01:21:27,043
(He blows as hard as he can.)

2428
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,713
(The wind is nowhere near enough.)

2429
01:21:28,883 --> 01:21:29,983
For goodness' sake!

2430
01:21:30,613 --> 01:21:31,613
Referee!

2431
01:21:31,613 --> 01:21:32,823
It's okay.

2432
01:21:32,823 --> 01:21:33,983
It's only the first half.

2433
01:21:33,983 --> 01:21:35,023
I feel dizzy.

2434
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,793
(The referee is relaxed since it's the first half.)

2435
01:21:39,563 --> 01:21:41,093
You can take a nap.

2436
01:21:41,093 --> 01:21:42,993
(Tae Hyun makes a surprise shot.)

2437
01:21:42,993 --> 01:21:44,863
We can waste time.

2438
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,063
There's no need to be in a hurry, Sang Uk.

2439
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,333
Keep going.

2440
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,373
(The player who is in a hurry, Yi Kyung makes a shot.)

2441
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:52,033
(It goes to Tae Hyun again.)

2442
01:21:52,703 --> 01:21:55,073
It's hard to send it to the center.

2443
01:21:56,473 --> 01:21:58,613
(Hello, ball.)

2444
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,643
(Do you want to play with me?)

2445
01:22:01,643 --> 01:22:03,413
(It's a goal!)

2446
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:05,313
(While Tae Hyun wastes time,)

2447
01:22:05,683 --> 01:22:08,553
(he makes a powerful long shot...)

2448
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:11,493
(and scores a goal.)

2449
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,123
(Sang UK gets a hat trick.)

2450
01:22:13,123 --> 01:22:14,463
It's 3 to 0.

2451
01:22:14,693 --> 01:22:16,033
- Tae Hyun.
- All right.

2452
01:22:16,363 --> 01:22:17,363
Go.

2453
01:22:17,893 --> 01:22:20,563
(Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung have a long way to go.)

2454
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,333
He'll sleep.

2455
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:25,773
He'll sleep.

2456
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:28,003
- For goodness' sake.
- He'll sleep.

2457
01:22:28,203 --> 01:22:30,543
- For goodness' sake.
- He'll sleep.

2458
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:32,243
Let's blow on it. One, two, three.

2459
01:22:32,313 --> 01:22:33,843
(Blowing)

2460
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:35,483
(Sleeping)

2461
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:36,553
I can't move it.

2462
01:22:36,553 --> 01:22:37,613
Referee!

2463
01:22:37,813 --> 01:22:39,583
You'll get a penalty for that.

2464
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,653
- A penalty!
- All right.

2465
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:42,283
- A penalty!
- A penalty!

2466
01:22:42,923 --> 01:22:44,853
Get ready. You can't put it in your mouth.

2467
01:22:44,853 --> 01:22:46,663
- Can't I do that?
- You can't do that.

2468
01:22:46,763 --> 01:22:48,523
Block the goalpost.

2469
01:22:49,063 --> 01:22:50,863
Shoot it right away.

2470
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:52,233
Once I move my hand...

2471
01:22:52,663 --> 01:22:53,663
Play.

2472
01:22:54,233 --> 01:22:55,233
(Sang Uk blocks with his face.)

2473
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:56,303
- Okay.
- That was simple.

2474
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,133
(It's Yi Kyung's turn to play.)

2475
01:22:58,133 --> 01:22:59,173
Shoot.

2476
01:22:59,403 --> 01:23:00,903
They blocked it.

2477
01:23:00,903 --> 01:23:02,103
They have good defense too.

2478
01:23:02,813 --> 01:23:04,443
(It almost goes in.)

2479
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:05,613
There you go.

2480
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,583
(The match turns fierce again.)

2481
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,013
- Where is it?
- Dong Hyun...

2482
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,383
has a very narrow field of vision.

2483
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,553
(He gathers his energy and makes a strong shot.)

2484
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:13,983
He blocked it.

2485
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:16,123
It went in and bounced out.

2486
01:23:16,153 --> 01:23:17,193
- What?
- Did it go in first?

2487
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,453
- It went in and bounced out.
- I didn't see that,

2488
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,223
- but he put it in his mouth.
- Did it go in first?

2489
01:23:20,223 --> 01:23:21,263
Did it go in?

2490
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:22,463
It went in and bounced out.

2491
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:26,933
(The table tennis ball hits the net and bounces out.)

2492
01:23:26,933 --> 01:23:28,963
It went in and bounced out. Okay.

2493
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:30,233
What was that?

2494
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:32,233
(The game resumes.)

2495
01:23:32,443 --> 01:23:34,243
(Dong Hyun takes out the ball carefully.)

2496
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,143
(Now is my chance!)

2497
01:23:37,443 --> 01:23:38,473
Okay!

2498
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:39,483
(It's a goal!)

2499
01:23:39,483 --> 01:23:41,043
- Come on, Dong Hyun.
- Okay.

2500
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,583
Okay.

2501
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:43,813
(They're winning in the first half.)

2502
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:45,113
The last goal...

2503
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:46,223
doesn't count.

2504
01:23:46,223 --> 01:23:47,223
- Why not?
- Doesn't it count?

2505
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:48,783
The first half had ended.

2506
01:23:48,783 --> 01:23:50,023
I continued to watch since it was fun.

2507
01:23:50,023 --> 01:23:51,023
Isn't it 4 to 0?

2508
01:23:51,023 --> 01:23:52,353
(The first half ends.)

2509
01:23:52,353 --> 01:23:53,663
(Tae Hyun and Sang Uk: 3 versus Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung: 1)

2510
01:23:53,693 --> 01:23:55,163
The first half is over.

2511
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,463
Since this is an official game,

2512
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:58,833
you'll switch sides.

2513
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:00,503
Okay.

2514
01:24:00,503 --> 01:24:01,803
How will we turn this table?

2515
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,433
Get up.

2516
01:24:03,433 --> 01:24:04,473
- Get up from the chair?
- Get up.

2517
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:06,403
Do a squat.

2518
01:24:06,403 --> 01:24:07,473
It's too hard.

2519
01:24:07,473 --> 01:24:09,243
- Get up from the chair?
- It's too hard.

2520
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:11,243
(Stay seated in a squat position.)

2521
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,313
- Get up. All right.
- No!

2522
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:14,613
No!

2523
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:15,913
- Get up.
- I can't do it.

2524
01:24:15,913 --> 01:24:17,153
Hurry up and get up.

2525
01:24:17,153 --> 01:24:18,213
- I...
- Get up.

2526
01:24:18,213 --> 01:24:20,323
Oh, my.

2527
01:24:20,353 --> 01:24:21,383
Oh, my. I can do it, but...

2528
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,423
Sang Uk, get up.

2529
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:23,623
- Sang Uk can't do it.
- Get up.

2530
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:24,723
Get up.

2531
01:24:25,223 --> 01:24:26,263
What's this?

2532
01:24:27,493 --> 01:24:28,563
What's this?

2533
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:29,763
(What's this?)

2534
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:31,933
What's this?

2535
01:24:32,163 --> 01:24:33,963
(Will they turn the table like this?)

2536
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:35,803
Is this how you switch the chairs?

2537
01:24:36,103 --> 01:24:37,303
Is this how you do it?

2538
01:24:37,303 --> 01:24:38,573
Is this how you switch the chairs?

2539
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,103
Is this how you do it?

2540
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:42,713
(It's like a show of superhuman strength.)

2541
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:45,913
(The referee is rolling on the floor.)

2542
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:47,613
(A new way of switching sides)

2543
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:49,313
What's this?

2544
01:24:49,313 --> 01:24:50,613
This is ridiculous.

2545
01:24:50,613 --> 01:24:52,453
We should've just stayed in the same positions.

2546
01:24:52,453 --> 01:24:53,753
What's the point?

2547
01:24:53,753 --> 01:24:55,553
We're still on the same half.

2548
01:24:55,683 --> 01:24:56,753
What?

2549
01:24:56,753 --> 01:24:58,593
We're still on the same half.

2550
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:01,463
(Despite the change, they're still on the same halves.)

2551
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,893
- What's this?
- Please give me my chair.

2552
01:25:03,893 --> 01:25:05,163
- It feels strange.
- My chair.

2553
01:25:05,163 --> 01:25:06,963
- My chair.
- My chair.

2554
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:09,903
- My chair.
- Give me my chair, please.

2555
01:25:09,933 --> 01:25:11,073
My chair.

2556
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:12,973
(Stop rushing me.)

2557
01:25:13,203 --> 01:25:15,243
(Switching sides is harder than the actual game.)

2558
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:17,113
- All done.
- It feels strange.

2559
01:25:17,243 --> 01:25:19,343
- Now, you can do cannon shots.
- Okay.

2560
01:25:19,543 --> 01:25:21,113
Cannon shots are allowed.

2561
01:25:21,113 --> 01:25:22,583
- Okay.
- And team play too.

2562
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:23,713
- It's allowed.
- Yes.

2563
01:25:23,713 --> 01:25:26,023
- Let's call it a set play.
- A set play.

2564
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:27,553
Let's say the ball that was in Yi Kyung's mouth...

2565
01:25:27,553 --> 01:25:29,153
goes into Dong Hyun's mouth...

2566
01:25:29,153 --> 01:25:30,853
without touching the ground.

2567
01:25:30,853 --> 01:25:32,323
If Dong Hyun scores a goal in that way,

2568
01:25:32,323 --> 01:25:33,593
the team will get three points.

2569
01:25:33,593 --> 01:25:35,193
(In case of a goal, the team will get 3 points.)

2570
01:25:35,933 --> 01:25:38,063
- Without touching the ground?
- Yes.

2571
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:39,263
It won't be easy.

2572
01:25:39,263 --> 01:25:40,903
I'll blow it like this.

2573
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:42,433
Keep your mouth wide open.

2574
01:25:42,873 --> 01:25:44,973
(The second half)

2575
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:46,973
We aren't getting two balls from the start.

2576
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:48,503
(They need to win in order to get clothes.)

2577
01:25:49,343 --> 01:25:51,513
Put it in your mouth!

2578
01:25:51,673 --> 01:25:52,813
There you go!

2579
01:25:53,243 --> 01:25:54,343
Put it in your mouth further.

2580
01:25:54,343 --> 01:25:55,543
There you go. Shoot it!

2581
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:57,413
(He loads the table tennis ball.)

2582
01:25:59,013 --> 01:26:00,183
Gosh, Yi Kyung.

2583
01:26:01,123 --> 01:26:03,023
Shoot it!

2584
01:26:03,153 --> 01:26:04,593
We need to score a goal.

2585
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:05,693
Give him some mouthwash.

2586
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:06,693
Shoot it!

2587
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:07,693
(It's the perfect chance to score a goal.)

2588
01:26:08,523 --> 01:26:10,033
(Nice defense)

2589
01:26:10,993 --> 01:26:12,863
Should I put it in my mouth or what?

2590
01:26:13,363 --> 01:26:14,363
Put it in your mouth.

2591
01:26:14,363 --> 01:26:15,363
(He blows on it.)

2592
01:26:15,933 --> 01:26:17,933
Put it in your mouth. One more time.

2593
01:26:18,533 --> 01:26:20,073
(He loads the ball again.)

2594
01:26:20,073 --> 01:26:21,103
Come on.

2595
01:26:21,173 --> 01:26:23,173
Gosh, he keeps putting it in his mouth.

2596
01:26:24,073 --> 01:26:25,173
Aim low.

2597
01:26:25,373 --> 01:26:27,713
(It's a goal!)

2598
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,413
(Their dopamine level is at its max.)

2599
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:32,153
It went in.

2600
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:34,923
- It's wet.
- There you go.

2601
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,293
Wipe the ball with that.

2602
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:39,563
(Wiping the ball)

2603
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:40,823
- Hold on.
- All right.

2604
01:26:40,823 --> 01:26:42,323
Wiping is prohibited.

2605
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,793
It wasn't my hand. Why did you hit me?

2606
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,563
- I mean...
- This is my hand.

2607
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:48,763
It wasn't my hand. Why did you hit me?

2608
01:26:48,763 --> 01:26:49,803
A handball.

2609
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:50,903
- A handball.
- It's prohibited.

2610
01:26:50,903 --> 01:26:52,603
A handball. Dong Hyun, open your mouth.

2611
01:26:52,743 --> 01:26:54,073
(He gets hit for some reason.)

2612
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:55,303
- Why?
- Here.

2613
01:26:55,303 --> 01:26:57,473
(Dong Hyun gets a penalty kick.)

2614
01:26:57,643 --> 01:26:59,813
(Let's block it.)

2615
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:02,043
Okay.

2616
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,013
- Nice!
- What are you doing?

2617
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,713
What are you doing? You should've done this.

2618
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:07,423
- Okay.
- When did another ball enter?

2619
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:09,183
- All right.
- Open your mouth.

2620
01:27:09,653 --> 01:27:11,093
- Okay.
- He doesn't give us anything.

2621
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,663
(He doesn't give us anything.)

2622
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:15,163
- That's a biased judgment.
- It went in too deep.

2623
01:27:15,223 --> 01:27:16,863
Score a goal. You need to score a goal.

2624
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:18,093
The center.

2625
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,403
(He gives them a feint.)

2626
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:21,563
Was it a feint?

2627
01:27:23,903 --> 01:27:25,203
(Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung: 3 versus Tae Hyun and Sang Uk: 4)

2628
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:26,373
Okay. That's good.

2629
01:27:26,473 --> 01:27:27,503
Sang Uk,

2630
01:27:27,503 --> 01:27:28,773
- open your mouth.
- It's our turn.

2631
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:31,313
- Open your mouth.
- What kind of a game is this?

2632
01:27:32,683 --> 01:27:34,613
(What kind of a game is this?)

2633
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:36,013
Score a goal.

2634
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,453
- It's a goal!
- Nice!

2635
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:42,693
(Thus began the exchange of cannon balls.)

2636
01:27:42,693 --> 01:27:43,993
It's a goal.

2637
01:27:43,993 --> 01:27:45,423
Okay.

2638
01:27:45,423 --> 01:27:46,423
All right.

2639
01:27:46,423 --> 01:27:47,893
(When Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung close the gap)

2640
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:48,993
It's 7 to 7.

2641
01:27:49,493 --> 01:27:51,093
- Nice.
- Okay.

2642
01:27:51,093 --> 01:27:52,863
- Did it go in?
- It went in.

2643
01:27:52,863 --> 01:27:54,503
- Wasn't it a golden goal?
- How about three points?

2644
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:56,233
You'll have one more minute.

2645
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:57,973
It's 7 to 7. How about 3 points?

2646
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,033
Go ahead.

2647
01:27:59,033 --> 01:28:00,603
- How about three points?
- Three points.

2648
01:28:00,603 --> 01:28:01,643
Open wide.

2649
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:03,213
You need to open wide.

2650
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:06,313
(Dong Hyun waits for the ball like a baby bird.)

2651
01:28:06,743 --> 01:28:07,913
One more time.

2652
01:28:09,913 --> 01:28:10,913
(Hitting)

2653
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:12,453
(The double front teeth shot)

2654
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:14,823
(It's a ridiculous set play.)

2655
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:16,793
Don't make us do it.

2656
01:28:17,153 --> 01:28:18,853
- Don't make us do it. Seriously.
- Just one more time.

2657
01:28:18,853 --> 01:28:20,123
Don't make us do it. Seriously.

2658
01:28:20,123 --> 01:28:21,123
- Don't make us do it. Seriously.
- Just one more time.

2659
01:28:21,123 --> 01:28:22,793
One last time.

2660
01:28:23,693 --> 01:28:24,733
Dong Hyun.

2661
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:25,993
(Dong Hyun gets a warning for retching.)

2662
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:28,503
- Dong Hyun, open your mouth!
- They'll fail.

2663
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,773
(Open your mouth!)

2664
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:32,073
(A successful pass)

2665
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,803
(The referee gets a dopamine rush.)

2666
01:28:33,803 --> 01:28:35,703
(Block it.)

2667
01:28:35,703 --> 01:28:36,943
If you score a goal, you'll win.

2668
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:41,583
(Go in there!)

2669
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,683
(He blocks it!)

2670
01:28:45,813 --> 01:28:47,183
(I can't believe he blocked it.)

2671
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:49,153
(Sang Uk's nice defense)

2672
01:28:49,253 --> 01:28:51,123
(Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung: 7, Tae Hyun and Sang Uk: 8)

2673
01:28:51,353 --> 01:28:53,823
(Team Tae Hyun and Sang Uk wins.)

2674
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:55,363
It was disgusting.

2675
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,663
(The players quickly escape.)

2676
01:28:57,933 --> 01:28:59,833
Give me a mouthwash.

2677
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:00,963
We won.

2678
01:29:00,963 --> 01:29:03,103
(Give me a mouthwash!)

2679
01:29:03,273 --> 01:29:04,603
Give me a mouthwash.

2680
01:29:04,603 --> 01:29:06,473
(Their mouths feel stuffy.)

2681
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:07,503
Seriously.

2682
01:29:07,503 --> 01:29:10,113
(The referee is happier than the winners.)

2683
01:29:10,113 --> 01:29:11,573
A wheel came off.

2684
01:29:11,843 --> 01:29:14,883
The winners are Tae Hyun and Sang Uk.

2685
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:17,013
- We're 1st and 2nd places.
- You'll decide on the rankings.

2686
01:29:17,013 --> 01:29:18,313
- Okay.
- Also,

2687
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:20,523
the losers, Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung,

2688
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,383
will also decide on the rankings.

2689
01:29:22,383 --> 01:29:24,593
Let's give a round of applause...

2690
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,493
to the great referee of the great game.

2691
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:27,563
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

2692
01:29:27,693 --> 01:29:29,633
- He was a former soccer player.
- He's an international referee.

2693
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:31,533
I had so much fun.

2694
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:32,903
- Seriously.
- He was a former soccer player.

2695
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,263
It was my first time feeling proud that I lost.

2696
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:37,933
I won a pair of pants.

2697
01:29:38,603 --> 01:29:39,803
(He's proud that he has won a pair of pants at the very least.)

2698
01:29:39,803 --> 01:29:41,273
- I'm satisfied.
- Okay.

2699
01:29:41,573 --> 01:29:43,243
They've won a pair of pants.

2700
01:29:43,243 --> 01:29:44,473
One of us will win a pair of pants.

2701
01:29:44,473 --> 01:29:45,573
(One of them will get the benefit.)

2702
01:29:45,573 --> 01:29:47,183
(Disappointed)

2703
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:49,853
What's the use of placing third and getting sneakers?

2704
01:29:49,883 --> 01:29:50,883
You're right.

2705
01:29:50,883 --> 01:29:52,353
- Does the third place get sneakers?
- Yes.

2706
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:55,083
- Then my outfit will be complete.
- It's meaningful to Yi Kyung.

2707
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:57,423
- It's meaningful to me. Let me win.
- It's meaningful to you.

2708
01:29:58,093 --> 01:29:59,923
Dong Hyun, go easy on me.

2709
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:01,863
What use are sneakers when your outfit is like that?

2710
01:30:02,393 --> 01:30:04,033
I should've scored a three-pointer.

2711
01:30:04,033 --> 01:30:05,033
It was close.

2712
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,263
Had you scored the golden goal, the game would've ended right away.

2713
01:30:07,563 --> 01:30:09,433
I should've scored it.

2714
01:30:09,803 --> 01:30:11,703
It's time for the last game.

2715
01:30:11,903 --> 01:30:13,003
Please enter.

2716
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:14,673
What? What is it?

2717
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,943
They made so many preparations. What's that?

2718
01:30:17,213 --> 01:30:18,243
(A mysterious pile of chocolate snacks)

2719
01:30:18,243 --> 01:30:20,243
- What's that?
- Will it involve eating?

2720
01:30:21,283 --> 01:30:22,713
I think I recognize the game.

2721
01:30:22,913 --> 01:30:24,783
- It's the electrical thing.
- It's the electrical thing.

2722
01:30:25,213 --> 01:30:26,923
- Gosh.
- As you can see,

2723
01:30:26,923 --> 01:30:28,383
there are low-frequency massagers.

2724
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:29,523
Low-frequency massagers.

2725
01:30:29,853 --> 01:30:32,693
Attach a low-frequency massager to the arm.

2726
01:30:32,863 --> 01:30:34,763
- It hurts.
- Then take turns...

2727
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,933
to make a cookie tower.

2728
01:30:37,363 --> 01:30:39,133
Do we lose if it collapses?

2729
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,803
That's right. The first person to make it collapse...

2730
01:30:40,803 --> 01:30:42,163
will lose.

2731
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,173
Take positions for the 3rd and 4th places.

2732
01:30:44,173 --> 01:30:46,133
- Where should we put it?
- We'll do that.

2733
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:47,143
Okay.

2734
01:30:47,143 --> 01:30:48,303
- Are these actual cookies?
- Where should we put it?

2735
01:30:48,303 --> 01:30:49,573
- We'll do that.
- Okay.

2736
01:30:49,573 --> 01:30:50,713
They look delicious.

2737
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,643
- May I eat one?
- Go ahead.

2738
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:56,913
(He takes care of hunger that came after playing soccer.)

2739
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:59,253
You need to put water on it to make it stronger.

2740
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:01,453
Clean it with a wet wipe.

2741
01:31:01,453 --> 01:31:03,093
That way, it'll be strong. Clean it with a wet wipe...

2742
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:04,693
- to make it strong.
- You can increase the level.

2743
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:06,423
It doesn't hurt, does it?

2744
01:31:06,423 --> 01:31:08,293
You must know the spot that hurts the most.

2745
01:31:08,693 --> 01:31:10,533
(Screaming)

2746
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:12,493
I can feel it even now!

2747
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:15,263
I haven't done anything.

2748
01:31:15,263 --> 01:31:18,473
(Laughing)

2749
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:21,073
(The man who needs to go next can't laugh.)

2750
01:31:21,073 --> 01:31:22,743
I felt the electricity.

2751
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,773
- She turned it off.
- I'm so scared.

2752
01:31:25,973 --> 01:31:27,583
I felt the electricity.

2753
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:29,083
Raise it slowly.

2754
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,783
- Raise it slowly.
- He startled me so much.

2755
01:31:30,783 --> 01:31:32,213
He startled me so much.

2756
01:31:32,413 --> 01:31:33,623
- I can feel it.
- I'll increase it by one level.

2757
01:31:33,623 --> 01:31:34,623
Okay.

2758
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:36,653
Here you go.

2759
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:38,353
What's the current level?

2760
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:40,423
Same here.

2761
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,433
- I'm twitching too.
- Let's go with this level.

2762
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:44,463
Level Three.

2763
01:31:44,993 --> 01:31:46,163
It hurts.

2764
01:31:46,603 --> 01:31:47,903
If you go with Level Two...

2765
01:31:49,973 --> 01:31:51,073
Stop it!

2766
01:31:53,443 --> 01:31:54,473
Stop it!

2767
01:31:54,603 --> 01:31:55,643
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

2768
01:31:56,713 --> 01:31:58,343
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

2769
01:31:58,873 --> 01:32:00,843
(Electric shock)

2770
01:32:00,843 --> 01:32:02,913
Stop it! For goodness' sake!

2771
01:32:02,913 --> 01:32:04,383
(The low-frequency show ends.)

2772
01:32:04,383 --> 01:32:05,413
My goodness.

2773
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,353
For goodness' sake!

2774
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:08,723
(Ripping off)

2775
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,623
(He removes the low-frequency strip.)

2776
01:32:10,753 --> 01:32:13,223
- Let's hurry up and do it.
- That was so funny.

2777
01:32:13,263 --> 01:32:14,393
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2778
01:32:14,393 --> 01:32:15,393
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2779
01:32:15,393 --> 01:32:16,593
My fingers moved on their own.

2780
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:18,263
(Scissors by the low-frequency massager)

2781
01:32:18,263 --> 01:32:19,333
You won.

2782
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,863
It helped you play scissors.

2783
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:23,733
- You won with scissors.
- He won.

2784
01:32:23,733 --> 01:32:25,333
- Level Two? Okay.
- Let's begin.

2785
01:32:25,603 --> 01:32:27,273
Hold on. Can I hold my arm?

2786
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:28,273
- Of course.
- Gosh.

2787
01:32:28,273 --> 01:32:29,673
I guess it hurts for Yi Kyung.

2788
01:32:29,673 --> 01:32:31,573
- It hurts.
- That means you'll lose.

2789
01:32:32,943 --> 01:32:34,413
- You'll lose.
- Hurry up and pick it up.

2790
01:32:34,483 --> 01:32:35,913
(Picking up a cookie is hard for him.)

2791
01:32:35,913 --> 01:32:38,113
- Why can't I...
- Once you grab one, it's over.

2792
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:41,683
- It hurts for me.
- There you go.

2793
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:43,823
(Electric shock)

2794
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,623
- Hold on.
- Hurry up and put it down.

2795
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:50,163
There's the right timing.

2796
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:51,893
- There's the right timing.
- The right timing.

2797
01:32:52,093 --> 01:32:53,703
- Now.
- It's when it opens and closes.

2798
01:32:53,703 --> 01:32:55,233
- Now.
- Now.

2799
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:57,233
(The right timing is between the shock waves.)

2800
01:32:57,233 --> 01:32:58,503
- Now. Okay.
- There you go.

2801
01:32:58,733 --> 01:33:00,873
- Now.
- Okay.

2802
01:33:00,873 --> 01:33:03,173
(They get used to the waves.)

2803
01:33:03,173 --> 01:33:04,843
Level 2? We'll now change it to Level 2.

2804
01:33:04,843 --> 01:33:05,913
- Why?
- Level Two.

2805
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,083
- Why?
- Your hands will shake.

2806
01:33:07,383 --> 01:33:08,843
Level Two.

2807
01:33:09,143 --> 01:33:12,013
Look at this.

2808
01:33:12,313 --> 01:33:13,683
(The low-frequency waves hit him nonstop.)

2809
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:14,823
Look at this.

2810
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:16,223
- I can't uncurl my hand.
- Look at this.

2811
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,253
All right.

2812
01:33:17,253 --> 01:33:18,493
Let's go with this mode.

2813
01:33:18,623 --> 01:33:21,163
If you break it in your hand, you're out.

2814
01:33:21,163 --> 01:33:22,193
Okay.

2815
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:24,163
- Can you stop it for a second?
- I don't see the option.

2816
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:26,163
Good.

2817
01:33:26,433 --> 01:33:27,863
It's so hard.

2818
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:29,833
Go ahead.

2819
01:33:30,473 --> 01:33:31,933
What's this?

2820
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:33,743
That won't do.

2821
01:33:34,503 --> 01:33:35,543
That won't do.

2822
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:36,813
(Collapsing)

2823
01:33:36,813 --> 01:33:39,113
- Hey!
- What was that?

2824
01:33:39,243 --> 01:33:40,913
- Why did it suddenly collapse?
- What?

2825
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:42,913
What happened? Why did it collapse?

2826
01:33:43,183 --> 01:33:44,253
Hey.

2827
01:33:44,253 --> 01:33:45,683
(You're the culprit.)

2828
01:33:45,683 --> 01:33:47,223
- Why did it suddenly collapse?
- What?

2829
01:33:47,453 --> 01:33:48,983
Our effort got ruined.

2830
01:33:49,283 --> 01:33:50,623
- Our effort...
- What happened?

2831
01:33:50,823 --> 01:33:51,853
- Hey.
- What was that?

2832
01:33:51,853 --> 01:33:53,163
(Their effort was in vain.)

2833
01:33:53,363 --> 01:33:54,693
I leaned on the table.

2834
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:55,993
(I leaned on the table and it collapsed.)

2835
01:33:55,993 --> 01:33:57,593
- What?
- Hey, you punk!

2836
01:33:57,593 --> 01:33:59,963
(Hey, you cutie pie!)

2837
01:34:00,303 --> 01:34:01,633
- Hey!
- What happened?

2838
01:34:01,633 --> 01:34:03,003
I can't believe you.

2839
01:34:03,003 --> 01:34:04,203
How did it happen?

2840
01:34:04,203 --> 01:34:05,733
(Meanwhile, Rascal Seung Ho inhales cookies.)

2841
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,843
I can't believe these rascals.

2842
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:11,113
These rascals are ridiculous. I can't believe these rascals.

2843
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:13,213
Give us more cookies.

2844
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:17,713
(Thus, the round for the 3rd and 4th places resumes.)

2845
01:34:17,713 --> 01:34:18,953
All right.

2846
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:21,623
(They work fast since it's the second time.)

2847
01:34:22,383 --> 01:34:23,793
Go.

2848
01:34:24,153 --> 01:34:26,053
It's dangerous now. It's dangerous already.

2849
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,523
It's hard.

2850
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:29,963
It'll collapse.

2851
01:34:30,533 --> 01:34:31,593
(He made a difficult shot.)

2852
01:34:31,593 --> 01:34:32,963
- Hey.
- You're welcome, man.

2853
01:34:33,303 --> 01:34:34,933
- You should be considerate.
- It's your turn.

2854
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:36,803
I'm in trouble.

2855
01:34:38,933 --> 01:34:39,943
Now.

2856
01:34:40,343 --> 01:34:41,373
Put it on there.

2857
01:34:41,373 --> 01:34:43,943
(Dong Hyun succeeds in it.)

2858
01:34:43,943 --> 01:34:46,443
Now, stop.

2859
01:34:46,443 --> 01:34:47,743
Don't touch the table.

2860
01:34:47,743 --> 01:34:49,783
(Everyone, stop moving!)

2861
01:34:49,783 --> 01:34:51,283
Don't touch the table.

2862
01:34:51,283 --> 01:34:52,953
- No one should touch it.
- Don't touch the table.

2863
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,183
I'll move back a little.

2864
01:34:54,183 --> 01:34:55,553
It moves on its own.

2865
01:34:55,553 --> 01:34:56,953
Don't move.

2866
01:34:56,953 --> 01:34:59,523
- Heartbeat.
- Go.

2867
01:34:59,523 --> 01:35:01,593
- Hold it.
- Okay.

2868
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:07,203
(Carefully,)

2869
01:35:07,203 --> 01:35:09,203
(he picks a chocolate cookie.)

2870
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:10,373
Yi Kyung, you got this.

2871
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:13,443
It's leaning to one side.

2872
01:35:14,243 --> 01:35:16,003
You should put it a bit to the other side.

2873
01:35:16,473 --> 01:35:17,743
(Yi Kyung stacks the cookie.)

2874
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:18,943
- There you go.
- It won't be easy.

2875
01:35:18,943 --> 01:35:20,183
Now.

2876
01:35:20,513 --> 01:35:21,843
Now. Put it there.

2877
01:35:22,643 --> 01:35:24,083
- Put it there.
- Please.

2878
01:35:24,913 --> 01:35:26,483
- Put it there.
- Please.

2879
01:35:30,093 --> 01:35:31,093
Okay.

2880
01:35:31,093 --> 01:35:33,563
(The chocolate cookie tower collapses.)

2881
01:35:34,093 --> 01:35:36,563
(Yi Kyung fails to win sneakers.)

2882
01:35:36,563 --> 01:35:38,193
You tried to hold it until the end.

2883
01:35:38,863 --> 01:35:40,333
I tried, but my fingers didn't work.

2884
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:42,133
Okay. Let's turn it off.

2885
01:35:42,533 --> 01:35:44,303
(Dong Hyun wins his sneakers.)

2886
01:35:44,303 --> 01:35:45,333
- We'll go with Level 3...
- Level 3.

2887
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,703
since this is the round for 1st and 2nd places. Let's go.

2888
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:49,343
Rock-paper-scissors.

2889
01:35:50,113 --> 01:35:51,273
Okay, I won.

2890
01:35:51,743 --> 01:35:53,013
- Now.
- That's it.

2891
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,283
(Tae Hyun times his movement to the waves.)

2892
01:35:55,283 --> 01:35:56,513
Now is the right timing.

2893
01:35:56,513 --> 01:35:57,783
(He gets used to the timing right away.)

2894
01:35:57,883 --> 01:35:59,613
(Sang Uk's turn)

2895
01:35:59,613 --> 01:36:00,883
- Sang Uk...
- The timing.

2896
01:36:00,883 --> 01:36:02,223
must've used this a lot for physical therapy.

2897
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:03,753
Sang Uk must've used this a lot for physical therapy.

2898
01:36:05,123 --> 01:36:06,323
My hand is twitching a lot.

2899
01:36:07,323 --> 01:36:09,563
- I'll suppress it with my strength.
- That's right.

2900
01:36:10,133 --> 01:36:11,593
Can you suppress it with your strength?

2901
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,333
(He can't.)

2902
01:36:15,533 --> 01:36:17,803
(Oh, my.)

2903
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:22,773
You need to go with that.

2904
01:36:22,773 --> 01:36:24,113
Hey, you didn't...

2905
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:26,013
Hey, you didn't suppress it with your strength.

2906
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,383
- Hey.
- You need to go with that.

2907
01:36:27,383 --> 01:36:28,583
You said you'd suppress it with your strength.

2908
01:36:28,713 --> 01:36:30,383
- You didn't do that.
- It'll end quickly.

2909
01:36:30,613 --> 01:36:32,313
- It hurts so much.
- It'll end quickly.

2910
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,023
This is annoying.

2911
01:36:34,453 --> 01:36:35,953
Now.

2912
01:36:37,223 --> 01:36:38,393
- Now.
- Okay.

2913
01:36:38,393 --> 01:36:39,993
All right. You're done for.

2914
01:36:40,423 --> 01:36:42,293
The right timing is the key.

2915
01:36:42,293 --> 01:36:43,593
That's right. You need to do it at the right timing.

2916
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:46,463
Don't wait for the right timing.

2917
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:47,863
- Now.
- There you go.

2918
01:36:47,863 --> 01:36:49,103
- Okay.
- That's how you do it.

2919
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:51,503
Hey, you can do it quickly.

2920
01:36:52,003 --> 01:36:55,173
I figured it out now. You can do it quickly.

2921
01:36:55,403 --> 01:36:57,473
You can do it while eating.

2922
01:36:58,113 --> 01:36:59,743
You can do it while eating.

2923
01:36:59,743 --> 01:37:01,243
- Here.
- He's relaxed.

2924
01:37:01,813 --> 01:37:02,843
Here.

2925
01:37:03,513 --> 01:37:04,883
- What?
- Here.

2926
01:37:05,113 --> 01:37:07,553
Old people have dull senses.

2927
01:37:07,553 --> 01:37:10,123
- Their muscles are gone.
- That's right.

2928
01:37:10,123 --> 01:37:11,423
- Their muscles are gone.
- That's right.

2929
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:13,423
I need this treatment.

2930
01:37:14,463 --> 01:37:17,293
When you reach Tae Hyun's age, your senses aren't the same.

2931
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:19,733
(He tries to keep the tremors in control.)

2932
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:21,333
Okay. I did it.

2933
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,533
You can't predict the result.

2934
01:37:23,303 --> 01:37:25,073
I'll do it with my left hand.

2935
01:37:26,703 --> 01:37:28,003
It's easy now.

2936
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,173
We can move this along fast.

2937
01:37:30,173 --> 01:37:34,513
(Method acting of low-frequency)

2938
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:35,883
Seriously.

2939
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:38,883
(Everyone marvels at Sang Uk's performance.)

2940
01:37:39,713 --> 01:37:41,853
(Tae Hyun is unassuming.)

2941
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:45,693
(His incredible acting fools the actor who got 10 million views.)

2942
01:37:47,063 --> 01:37:50,063
(Collapsing)

2943
01:37:50,533 --> 01:37:52,593
(Disappointed)

2944
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:54,033
He's good.

2945
01:37:54,533 --> 01:37:55,833
- Tae Hyun.
- What happened?

2946
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:56,833
- I won, right?
- Yes.

2947
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,173
- Okay.
- Tae Hyun.

2948
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:01,203
See if his hand is getting an electric shock.

2949
01:38:02,603 --> 01:38:04,573
- What?
- The massager is on the other hand.

2950
01:38:04,573 --> 01:38:06,783
(The hand without the massager is twitching.)

2951
01:38:07,113 --> 01:38:08,243
What's this?

2952
01:38:08,243 --> 01:38:09,513
(Did I get fooled?)

2953
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:10,683
- Did you play that way?
- Yes.

2954
01:38:10,683 --> 01:38:12,283
- And you still lost?
- And you still won.

2955
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:14,153
(In any case, Tae Hyun won.)

2956
01:38:14,153 --> 01:38:16,153
- Okay.
- That was incredible.

2957
01:38:16,153 --> 01:38:18,093
I had no idea. I wondered why people were laughing.

2958
01:38:18,923 --> 01:38:21,363
The third place, Dong Hyun,

2959
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:23,223
- will get his sneakers back.
- Me?

2960
01:38:23,593 --> 01:38:24,693
Are those my sneakers?

2961
01:38:24,693 --> 01:38:25,793
(The benefit for the 3rd place, your own sneakers)

2962
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:29,133
The colors don't match. Pink and green.

2963
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:31,603
Pink and green.

2964
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:33,903
White sneakers would've been better.

2965
01:38:34,003 --> 01:38:35,603
(Pitiful)

2966
01:38:35,603 --> 01:38:39,013
The first place, Tae Hyun.

2967
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:40,783
- Okay.
- It has been a while.

2968
01:38:41,213 --> 01:38:42,843
The second place, Sang Uk.

2969
01:38:42,843 --> 01:38:43,953
(The 2nd place, Sang Uk)

2970
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:46,383
Before the club activity,

2971
01:38:46,383 --> 01:38:48,083
you'll have time to shop for clothes.

2972
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,623
- Okay.
- That sounds nice.

2973
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:52,123
It's time to join the bowling or flower arrangement club.

2974
01:38:52,223 --> 01:38:54,993
The bowling club can accept two people...

2975
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:56,863
and the flower arrangement club can accept three people.

2976
01:38:57,233 --> 01:38:58,363
Are we getting divided up?

2977
01:38:58,363 --> 01:39:00,303
- I choose the flower arrangement.
- I want to do flower arrangement.

2978
01:39:00,603 --> 01:39:01,603
I want to do flower arrangement.

2979
01:39:01,933 --> 01:39:03,033
Three people for the flower arrangement club.

2980
01:39:03,033 --> 01:39:04,503
Then I'll go bowling.

2981
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,443
- Bowling?
- I'll bowl in these clothes too.

2982
01:39:07,573 --> 01:39:08,573
Okay then.

2983
01:39:08,743 --> 01:39:11,943
- Let's go.
- Let's move.

2984
01:39:11,943 --> 01:39:14,343
I sweated so much. Why did I sweat so much?

2985
01:39:14,343 --> 01:39:16,213
- Why did I sweat so much?
- I sweated so much.

2986
01:39:16,213 --> 01:39:17,213
Did we fight or something?

2987
01:39:17,413 --> 01:39:19,283
I feel embarrassed now that I'm outside.

2988
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:23,453
I felt fine when we were by ourselves.

2989
01:39:23,693 --> 01:39:25,153
Let's move quickly.

2990
01:39:25,153 --> 01:39:27,763
Had my shorts looked better, my outfit would've been fine.

2991
01:39:27,763 --> 01:39:28,863
Tuck your T-shirt in.

2992
01:39:28,863 --> 01:39:31,193
- You need to tuck it in.
- That's right.

2993
01:39:31,193 --> 01:39:32,233
There's a ribbon on the shorts.

2994
01:39:32,233 --> 01:39:33,833
- It's sexy.
- It's less charming that way.

2995
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:34,963
Really?

2996
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:37,333
- It's sexy when you tuck it in.
- Hey.

2997
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:40,033
Seriously, these shorts...

2998
01:39:40,033 --> 01:39:41,043
(Gosh)

2999
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:42,443
We're in the middle of Sangam.

3000
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:44,513
If we aren't careful, we'll end up on the news. Hurry up.

3001
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:47,513
Look at how ridiculous our reflection looks.

3002
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:50,213
Are we going to enjoy water sports?

3003
01:39:50,213 --> 01:39:51,213
(The water sports fashion is too much in the city.)

3004
01:39:51,213 --> 01:39:52,413
Seriously, this is too much.

3005
01:39:52,413 --> 01:39:54,283
Foreigners are taking photos of us.

3006
01:39:54,383 --> 01:39:55,453
Hello.

3007
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:56,993
(The oldest member takes good care of his fans.)

3008
01:39:56,993 --> 01:39:59,753
- He's a superstar.
- I know you guys.

3009
01:39:59,753 --> 01:40:01,593
Really? Do you know me?

3010
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:03,663
- I'm shy.
- Thank you.

3011
01:40:03,663 --> 01:40:05,593
He's an actor with ten million views in Korea.

3012
01:40:05,763 --> 01:40:07,003
(He brags about Tae Hyun until the very end.)

3013
01:40:07,003 --> 01:40:08,033
Thank you.

3014
01:40:08,203 --> 01:40:09,833
People are getting off work.

3015
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:11,603
People are getting off work. Let's hurry.

3016
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:14,873
Let's pretend to be a runner.

3017
01:40:15,103 --> 01:40:16,103
Are you pretending to be a runner?

3018
01:40:16,103 --> 01:40:18,573
(Let me join you.)

3019
01:40:18,873 --> 01:40:20,183
There are students too.

3020
01:40:20,883 --> 01:40:22,113
They're behind us.

3021
01:40:22,113 --> 01:40:23,313
(To make the matters worse, students watch them.)

3022
01:40:23,613 --> 01:40:26,653
(Workers and students on their way home make them laugh.)

3023
01:40:26,713 --> 01:40:28,723
I feel like I'm naked.

3024
01:40:28,723 --> 01:40:30,553
Seung Ho, you look okay...

3025
01:40:30,553 --> 01:40:32,523
- because they're like swim shorts.
- Seung Ho looks like...

3026
01:40:32,523 --> 01:40:34,363
- he's going to a swimming pool.
- They look like swim shorts.

3027
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:36,463
- The length is perfect.
- They look nice, right?

3028
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:37,493
Yes.

3029
01:40:37,693 --> 01:40:38,693
Okay. Let's hurry up and cross the street.

3030
01:40:38,693 --> 01:40:39,693
(I'm embarrassed.)

3031
01:40:39,693 --> 01:40:40,733
"Let's hurry up and cross the street."

3032
01:40:41,263 --> 01:40:42,863
Gosh, why do we need to eat...

3033
01:40:42,863 --> 01:40:44,203
every meal?

3034
01:40:44,203 --> 01:40:45,203
(They're getting photographed.)

3035
01:40:45,203 --> 01:40:46,403
People are photographing us from their cars.

3036
01:40:47,403 --> 01:40:49,243
(They get photographed as if they were on the red carpet.)

3037
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:50,813
(Hi.)

3038
01:40:51,513 --> 01:40:54,113
(A clip of them in Sangam...)

3039
01:40:54,113 --> 01:40:55,843
(was actually posted on social media.)

3040
01:40:56,853 --> 01:40:58,813
Why are we going to such a busy street?

3041
01:40:58,813 --> 01:40:59,883
(Flustered)

3042
01:40:59,883 --> 01:41:02,283
Hello.

3043
01:41:02,283 --> 01:41:03,283
(People recognize us everywhere we go.)

3044
01:41:03,283 --> 01:41:04,723
- Motorcycle.
- I just need to lose these shorts.

3045
01:41:05,123 --> 01:41:08,393
(Our outfits, shoes, and vibes...)

3046
01:41:08,393 --> 01:41:09,823
This is driving me crazy.

3047
01:41:09,823 --> 01:41:11,793
(Embarrassment makes him hang his head.)

3048
01:41:12,293 --> 01:41:14,363
Sang Uk, hang in there. You'll get shorts soon.

3049
01:41:14,363 --> 01:41:15,563
- Of course.
- Yes.

3050
01:41:15,563 --> 01:41:17,033
- I'm going to enjoy this.
- Seriously.

3051
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:18,903
- Is this the place?
- This is the place.

3052
01:41:18,903 --> 01:41:20,103
(They arrive at a restaurant as they console themselves.)

3053
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:21,773
- Hey.
- It looks like a good restaurant.

3054
01:41:21,973 --> 01:41:24,173
People take these slippers for the toilet.

3055
01:41:24,173 --> 01:41:25,243
These slippers are ours.

3056
01:41:25,473 --> 01:41:27,813
People will think that they belong to the restaurant.

3057
01:41:27,813 --> 01:41:29,913
- Hello.
- Hello.

3058
01:41:29,913 --> 01:41:31,183
You guys must've gone swimming.

3059
01:41:32,483 --> 01:41:33,923
As we entered, the owner went,

3060
01:41:33,923 --> 01:41:35,223
"You guys must've gone swimming."

3061
01:41:36,053 --> 01:41:38,053
(Because of their fashion, they can't say no.)

3062
01:41:38,053 --> 01:41:39,793
I hope the games will end in this state.

3063
01:41:40,193 --> 01:41:41,793
- In this state?
- Yes.

3064
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,793
Can't we call it a day?

3065
01:41:44,033 --> 01:41:45,663
Don't play more games. We have enough for an episode.

3066
01:41:45,663 --> 01:41:47,003
Tae Hyun, you're selfish.

3067
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:49,163
Just because you got your clothes...

3068
01:41:49,163 --> 01:41:51,273
It isn't like that. It's a sacrifice to make the show entertaining.

3069
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:53,003
- What?
- Didn't you hear?

3070
01:41:53,003 --> 01:41:54,143
The chief director said...

3071
01:41:54,143 --> 01:41:55,273
- that we needed a villain.
- A villain.

3072
01:41:55,573 --> 01:41:57,813
- A villain? Who will it be?
- He said that we needed a villain.

3073
01:41:57,943 --> 01:42:01,743
We should show a split between the members.

3074
01:42:01,983 --> 01:42:04,783
If the TV ratings drop even after we do this,

3075
01:42:04,783 --> 01:42:05,783
we should just quit.

3076
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:07,523
(There's no retreat.)

3077
01:42:07,523 --> 01:42:08,823
What's the use?

3078
01:42:08,823 --> 01:42:10,123
I really want to see the graph...

3079
01:42:10,123 --> 01:42:11,423
- for this episode.
- Seriously.

3080
01:42:12,336 --> 01:42:14,176
(The Shortage in Fashion schedule doesn't end.)

3081
01:42:14,476 --> 01:42:16,406
(They join the clubs...)

3082
01:42:16,406 --> 01:42:19,246
(as shabby men...)

3083
01:42:19,246 --> 01:42:20,776
(and...)

3084
01:42:20,776 --> 01:42:22,116
(an orangutan.)

3085
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:25,486
(One last schedule remains.)

3086
01:42:25,846 --> 01:42:28,486
(A fan signing event at a big mall)

3087
01:42:28,656 --> 01:42:29,686
(It won't be much of a fan signing event.)

3088
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:31,356
(To avoid attending the event in underwear,)

3089
01:42:31,556 --> 01:42:34,126
(they'll have the fashion battle!)

3090
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:37,126
(A challenge for better fashion)

3091
01:42:37,696 --> 01:42:39,526
(Your fail...)

3092
01:42:39,526 --> 01:42:40,966
(equals my gain.)

3093
01:42:41,636 --> 01:42:44,836
(At the end...)

3094
01:42:44,836 --> 01:42:46,906
(of the fierce struggle)

3095
01:42:47,106 --> 01:42:48,536
(Devastated)

3096
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:50,606
(You guys are total jerks, okay?)

3097
01:42:50,746 --> 01:42:52,246
(A big fuss)

3098
01:42:52,346 --> 01:42:54,746
(At this rate, they'll do a fan signing event in underwear.)

3099
01:42:54,946 --> 01:42:56,946
(The guest who'll save Handsome Guys from Shortage in Fashion)

3100
01:42:57,016 --> 01:42:58,946
(The queen of festivals, Kwon Eun Bi)

3101
01:42:59,116 --> 01:43:02,756
(The last challenge with Eun Bi)

3102
01:43:02,956 --> 01:43:07,226
(Passion at its max)

3103
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:11,026
(A desperate contest for fashion)

3104
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:12,366
I should've stayed home.

3105
01:43:12,391 --> 01:43:16,891
(Will they be able to escape Shortage in Fashion?)

3106
01:43:17,448 --> 01:43:19,448
