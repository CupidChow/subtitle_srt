1
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:32,367
(Today's Handsome Heritage, architectural buildings in Jeju)

2
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,167
(He is back...)

3
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,897
(quickly.)

4
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,366
(I came back to take revenge.)

5
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,936
(Jin came back for revenge.)

6
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:43,337
(Team Handsome that possesses beneficial cards exclusively)

7
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:46,547
(Team Guys that picked only the worst cards)

8
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:49,976
(Team Guys is doomed.)

9
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,886
(They set out from the north in despair.)

10
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,686
(If we get the question wrong, )

11
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,817
(let's just go anywhere.)

12
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,027
(Unlike gloomy Team Guys from the start)

13
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,456
(We must win the center square.)

14
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:01,297
(Energetically, Team Handsome aims...)

15
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:03,057
(for the center square.)

16
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:04,798
(We'll help Jin win.)

17
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,036
(It doesn't matter where we go.)

18
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:09,066
(What do you want us to do?)

19
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:12,268
(There's a spark of discord.)

20
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:13,907
(Arguing...)

21
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,076
(about the answer)

22
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:16,077
Incorrect.

23
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,247
(After failing unexpectedly)

24
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,507
(We'll use our reattempt card.)

25
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:21,346
(30-minute nap card)

26
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,676
(We'll use it right now.)

27
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:25,487
(They run out of their chance card.)

28
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:27,917
(It's your responsibility.)

29
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:30,826
(In the end, Team Handsome is in full discord.)

30
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,386
(Meanwhile, Team Guys)

31
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:35,297
(They answer correctly in a row.)

32
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,797
(Celebrating their right answer)

33
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:40,796
(They enjoy some black pork and turn the tables.)

34
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,906
(The scores get switched with current score of 2 to 1.)

35
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:46,067
(Team Handsome's attempt continues.)

36
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,437
(They're faced with the problem.)

37
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:49,978
It's incorrect.

38
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:52,406
(In despair)

39
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,077
(This could be controversial.)

40
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,276
(I'm going to start the controversy.)

41
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,317
(With the change in the game, )

42
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,986
(in what direction will the race on Jeju Island continue?)

43
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,987
All right.

44
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,458
That was nice and delicious.

45
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,627
It's really a gourmet trip.

46
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:09,897
(Yes, I'm full.)

47
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:12,266
Are we going to Ctesiphon House?

48
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,237
- Yes, let's go there first.
- Ctesiphon House?

49
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,797
- Here we go.
- Okay.

50
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,037
Ctesiphon House is nearby. It'll only take 20 minutes.

51
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:21,237
(They head to a nearby place.)

52
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,948
We had food at 11 something.

53
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,817
The alarm hasn't gone off yet,

54
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:29,377
which means that they got one question wrong.

55
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,617
- Definitely.
- They failed.

56
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,617
Right.

57
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:33,116
Whatever we see...

58
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:34,287
(Occupation strategy)

59
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,356
We should win.

60
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:36,817
(Ctesiphon House)

61
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,757
If they got Bangju Church wrong...

62
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,957
and we win Ctesiphon House, they will sob.

63
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,897
They won't have any way to complete the bingo.

64
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,998
The score would be 3 to 1.

65
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:50,307
I'd love such a scenario. That'd be the best.

66
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,366
How could we win under these circumstances?

67
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,437
It's impossible.

68
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:58,807
Our chance of winning was lower than ten percent.

69
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,517
If we win Ctesiphon House,

70
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,378
our chance of winning will increase to 50 percent.

71
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:05,787
If we win it without using our reattempt card,

72
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,557
- it'll increase to 51.
- Right.

73
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,857
- It will be more than half.
- Exactly.

74
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,056
The bird of victory is flying...

75
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,197
with a ray of light shining on it.

76
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,927
It's close to being a paradise.

77
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,068
A paradise?

78
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:19,667
(Bursting into laughter)

79
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:21,467
- Do you see it?
- A paradise?

80
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,498
It's a paradise.

81
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,938
(Are we heading to a paradise?)

82
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:34,977
(As they continue their way, they reach a green meadow.)

83
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,377
I heard that it was here.

84
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,086
It must be where Ctesiphon House is.

85
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,448
There's pasture.

86
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,487
Places like this are so beautiful.

87
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,927
It's really pretty here.

88
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,228
This is...

89
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,067
(Ctesiphon House)

90
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,767
- It's a ranch.
- A ranch.

91
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:55,598
We might find milk here.

92
00:03:57,168 --> 00:04:01,008
(Handsome Heritage 5, a happy abandoned house)

93
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,237
(Handsome Heritage 5, a happy abandoned house)

94
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,848
- Hello.
- We meet again.

95
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,777
- Hello.
- I seem to get teleported, don't I?

96
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:08,917
This must be it.

97
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,917
I always arrive before you. This is it.

98
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,086
We must read this no matter what.

99
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,918
- What is Ctesiphon?
- Yes.

100
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,917
- Ctesiphon-style?
- What is Ctesiphon?

101
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:17,926
It must be a type of style.

102
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,997
Ctesiphon is the name of this architecture technique.

103
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:22,326
(It refers to this building's architecture technique.)

104
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,827
Ctesiphon comes from the name of a city...

105
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,727
called Ctesiphon.

106
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,598
It was located in Iraq.

107
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,336
- It was the name of a city?
- In the Middle East.

108
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,407
There was a palace in the Sasanian Empire.

109
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:36,337
- Is it where Ctesiphon comes from?
- A technique called Ctesiphon...

110
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:40,078
started in England in the early 1900s.

111
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,316
In order to understand,

112
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,546
you need to know the background of this ranch.

113
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,957
It used to be a wasteland.

114
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,018
It was a deserted wasteland in Jungsangan.

115
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:53,327
In 1954, which was right after the Korean War...

116
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,827
- Right.
- At that time,

117
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,528
the entire country was in ruins.

118
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:01,598
A priest named McGlinchey whose Korean name was Im Pi Je...

119
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:04,637
"Patrick James McGlinchey from Ireland."

120
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,137
Yes. He came here for missionary work,

121
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:11,077
but people were so poor that they weren't interested in religion.

122
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,446
While thinking about how to help them survive,

123
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,746
he thought of cultivating the wasteland into a ranch.

124
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,246
He built a ranch...

125
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,756
with the locals here.

126
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,227
For people to cultivate something,

127
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:27,626
they needed a house and livestock.

128
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:31,196
At that time, they lacked material and skills.

129
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,398
So he thought about how to build a house easily.

130
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,268
McGlinchey remembered seeing...

131
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,307
an easy method of building a house back home.

132
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:42,607
He decided to apply the Ctesiphon method.

133
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:46,607
When plywood gets wet, it bends.

134
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:50,417
He used bent plywood pieces in a row.

135
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,317
He hung straw sacks in between.

136
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:55,556
He formed a mold with straw sacks.

137
00:05:55,557 --> 00:06:00,127
Cement was baked in the mold to create this arch shape.

138
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:05,028
(To make it quickly and simply)

139
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:12,367
(Ctesiphon House was made with straw sacks and cement.)

140
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:20,006
(A monument that shows their determination to live well)

141
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:23,817
At first, there were about 200 houses.

142
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,718
- Like this house?
- There were houses.

143
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,588
Would you like to take a look inside?

144
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,387
You'll see traces of straw sacks inside.

145
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:31,528
If you look carefully...

146
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,828
This is the straw sack.

147
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,958
- Is that the straw sack?
- Yes.

148
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:39,626
- The sack used for rice?
- Exactly.

149
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:40,697
It's staying still.

150
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,866
(Laughing)

151
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,107
It's staying still? Be quiet.

152
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,638
You're so excited after eating some food.

153
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,408
Isn't it staying still?

154
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,877
You can also see traces of wooden laths in the middle.

155
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,047
Due to the heavy weight of cement,

156
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,047
they were pushed down and got bent.

157
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,487
You can still see the traces.

158
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:04,756
In order to make rooms in the middle,

159
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,328
they built walls with these blocks.

160
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,397
Did someone live here?

161
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:12,727
Yes, but everything is broken now.

162
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:16,436
- No one needs it anymore.
- Right.

163
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,236
We asked the priest...

164
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,306
if he was sad about the house disappearing.

165
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,277
He said that it only meant...

166
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,446
people in Jeju were better off now.

167
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,218
He wasn't sad about the house disappearing...

168
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:28,918
at all.

169
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:34,418
(From serious poverty and severe nature)

170
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,458
(Ctesiphon House was a roof that protected a generation.)

171
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,927
(Now it's a happy ruin that turned into a photo spot.)

172
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:47,667
(Ctesiphon House in Hallim-eup, Jeju)

173
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,796
(Time for Quiz)

174
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,806
- I have a good feeling about it.
- We should be careful.

175
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:53,507
What's important is that we haven't heard cuckoo yet.

176
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:56,838
- You're right.
- Why aren't you playing the sound?

177
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:00,348
This is the only thing that we didn't predict.

178
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:03,018
Shall we answer the quiz in a good mood?

179
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:05,787
Did you enjoy the black pork before coming here?

180
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:06,887
- Yes.
- Yes.

181
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,056
They definitely enjoyed it.

182
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:09,388
Is it a question about black pork?

183
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,187
In the past,

184
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,587
black pork, also known as poop pork,

185
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:14,728
was grown in Jeju.

186
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,696
However, in 1960,

187
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,497
St. Isidore Farm started to import pork grown outside the country.

188
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,968
The amount of black pork decreased by a lot.

189
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:29,106
Also, as National Junior Sports Festival was held...

190
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,876
on Jeju Island in 1984,

191
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,648
the amount of black pork decreased for another reason.

192
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,478
What was this reason?

193
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,288
What are you talking about?

194
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:38,847
What kind of question is this?

195
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:39,848
(Level of difficulty: Five stars)

196
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,256
- In 1984?
- Yes.

197
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,187
(Thinking hard)

198
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,857
National Junior Sports Festival on Jeju Island?

199
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,827
(Did the athletic boy get a hunch?)

200
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,097
Could you repeat the question?

201
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,296
Did they go out to dinner?

202
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,968
(Bursting out laughing)

203
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:55,596
So that was why.

204
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:57,367
People like you...

205
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,537
from all over the country gathered here.

206
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,436
- They did.
- What does...

207
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,138
National Junior Sports Festival have to do with it?

208
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,607
Isn't it strange?

209
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,446
Why was the junior sports festival mentioned?

210
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,017
- Why was it mentioned?
- I can only think of them...

211
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,577
going out to dinner.

212
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,247
I'm serious.

213
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:12,587
It must be related to the answer.

214
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,287
I mean...

215
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,118
- They must be related.
- Exactly.

216
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:18,956
- Imagine ten wrestlers.
- National Junior Sports Festival.

217
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,586
What does the National Junior Sports Festival have to do with it?

218
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:21,827
(The soccer player agrees with the answer.)

219
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:24,296
Let's be objective.

220
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,768
That can't be the answer.

221
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:29,997
He said foreign pork and black pork separately.

222
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:31,206
Imported pork...

223
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,567
Something must have come into the country again.

224
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,508
Was there only a decrease in black pork?

225
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,976
- They just ate a lot of black pork.
- Please.

226
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,647
- Do you have another guess?
- Please.

227
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,877
- Stop eating!
- This is correct.

228
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:44,418
- Stop eating.
- Isn't it correct?

229
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,017
They can't have only eaten black pork.

230
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,087
They only had pork grown in Korea.

231
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,027
Doesn't it make sense?

232
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,427
(Eccentric boys' love for Korean pork?)

233
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:56,057
During National Junior Sports Festival on Jeju Island,

234
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,796
they gave out pork as a prize...

235
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:00,937
instead of money.

236
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:02,397
In 1984.

237
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,437
That's a better answer.

238
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,837
The idea of giving out pork...

239
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,238
as a prize.

240
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,806
Aren't they the same thing?

241
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,446
- Giving them pork to eat.
- Right.

242
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,878
Getting it as a prize or going out to eat.

243
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,587
I don't think it's because they went out to eat.

244
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:20,547
Let's say students in middle school went out to eat.

245
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,287
- If they're in middle school, - Stop going with that idea.

246
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,388
They wouldn't eat Korean products.

247
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,027
There are so many of them.

248
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:28,627
- You're absolutely right.
- Yes.

249
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,726
- They always eat foreign products.
- You know what they eat the most?

250
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,066
Meat from Mexico or Brazil.

251
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,066
There's also meat from Chile. That's what they mostly eat.

252
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,667
Pork from South America is cheap.

253
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,966
So eating out can't be the answer.

254
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,778
- Okay.
- It'd decrease foreign products.

255
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:48,717
In order to hold the junior sports festival,

256
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,317
- they sold a lot of pork.
- To whom?

257
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:53,947
In order to raise funds?

258
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,917
Hey, you're up.

259
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,826
- Isn't this right?
- It's Sang Uk today.

260
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,726
It has to be right. There's no other answer.

261
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,857
- Right.
- Organize your thoughts.

262
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,357
Let's organize our thoughts first.

263
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:05,967
The answer can't be too specific. You know that, right?

264
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,267
Tell me.

265
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:08,336
- So...
- I need to check.

266
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:12,436
They sold black pork to raise funds for the festival.

267
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,508
It's too specific.

268
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:16,508
- Just say, "To run the festival." - How could the two of you...

269
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,176
(Chuckling)

270
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,446
- Here's the answer.
- Yes?

271
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,918
To run the festival.

272
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,918
That's it.

273
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,517
All right, that's good.

274
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,617
(It's quite blunt.)

275
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,086
- To run the festival, - Yes.

276
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,586
- they sold black pork?
- Yes.

277
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,956
- That's how they raised funds.
- In order...

278
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,628
- To raise funds.
- to raise funds.

279
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:36,397
That's the only answer.

280
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:37,696
It has to be correct.

281
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,926
- You can count on me.
- For the festival...

282
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:40,967
Incorrect.

283
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,696
It's incorrect?

284
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:43,697
That's not the answer?

285
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,538
We have a reattempt card.

286
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,977
Let's get some hints and try again.

287
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,476
Give us a hint.

288
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:50,538
Wait a minute.

289
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,147
What happens when we abandon this place?

290
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:55,216
- Give us a minute.
- What?

291
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,346
No, Seung Ho.

292
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:57,716
Hold on for a minute.

293
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,018
What happens when we abandon this place?

294
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,287
Give us a hint.

295
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,788
We'll try again.

296
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,427
We should be wise about this.

297
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:06,426
Should we use it here or give it up?

298
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,596
Assuming that they didn't win Bangju Church...

299
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,628
(He writes something for them.)

300
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,466
Don't do any research.

301
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,197
I really didn't.

302
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,437
He gave you a different card.

303
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:23,207
I almost got fooled.

304
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:26,647
You gave me the picking tangerine card.

305
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,976
(The reattempt card is right here.)

306
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,278
I gave him a different card.

307
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,687
If he gives us a hint,

308
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,947
our reattempt card wouldn't be used.

309
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,726
- He'd have told us for free.
- Seung Ho.

310
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:38,957
You're really...

311
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,758
You're full of petty tricks.

312
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,128
I'll go easy on you this time.

313
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:44,966
Thank you.

314
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:45,967
(He hands in the reattempt card.)

315
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,436
That's a bummer. You'd better give us a helpful hint.

316
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:50,737
- Okay.
- I should take notes.

317
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,367
This is almost...

318
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,408
Here's your hint.

319
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,608
Where were you before coming here?

320
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,577
We had pork belly.

321
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,947
You were at the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

322
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,748
- The poop pork place?
- Yes.

323
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:07,517
To make it more comfortable for visitors from around the country,

324
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:09,716
they did something.

325
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:11,358
They must have gotten rid of it.

326
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:18,498
(They saw the Jeju-style restroom at the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.)

327
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:20,727
Is it a toilet?

328
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,067
Many people come for the National Junior Sports Festival.

329
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,336
- It'd be stinky and dirty.
- Because it was dirty?

330
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:29,837
They must have made it more modern.

331
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:31,576
Say that. I think it's correct.

332
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,677
It should be correct.

333
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,617
They replaced the pig farms.

334
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,087
- Or they removed them.
- They replaced them.

335
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,446
As the toilets changed.

336
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,887
(The toilets were replaced or removed.)

337
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,918
Correct.

338
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,957
- It was impossible to get it wrong.
- Right.

339
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:51,297
- It was so difficult.
- I know.

340
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,066
- Ctesiphon House.
- Ctesiphon House.

341
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,397
(Ctesiphon House in Hallim-eup, Jeju)

342
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,498
Poop pork.

343
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,437
(Ctesiphon House in Hallim-eup, Jeju)

344
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,408
(What's the dish at Ctesiphon House?)

345
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:03,637
- It's perfect. It's ice cream.
- We must eat that.

346
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,806
- There's an ice cream shop.
- It's ice cream.

347
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,447
- Okay.
- It's perfect.

348
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:11,817
(An ice cream shop at the entrance of the ranch)

349
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,687
- Hello.
- Thank you.

350
00:14:15,457 --> 00:14:18,027
(They take ice cream with a rich flavor.)

351
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:19,226
Goodbye.

352
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,258
Thank you.

353
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,657
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the ice cream.

354
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,897
(They leave the ranch happily.)

355
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,028
Is it cold?

356
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,738
It's delicious.

357
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,767
(Team Handsome)

358
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,897
It's so difficult.

359
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,238
(Team Handsome)

360
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,066
Where should we go now?

361
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,307
(Team Handsome feels gloomy from failing the quiz.)

362
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:37,777
Should we go to Sora's Castle?

363
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:38,778
(Is their next destination Sora's Castle?)

364
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,648
Look at this.

365
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,446
If they follow this direction, they'll definitely go here...

366
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,647
- because it's nearby.
- Right.

367
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:47,518
If they're going in this direction,

368
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,387
they'll go to Ctesiphon House.

369
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,686
They're guaranteed to go there.

370
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,257
If they occupy Ctesiphon House...

371
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,826
- and Sora's Castle, they will win.
- You're right.

372
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,358
They'll definitely go to Ctesiphon House.

373
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,196
They're trying to occupy more places than us.

374
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,067
Why didn't they get anything wrong?

375
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:01,897
Here we go.

376
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:03,836
- It's not over yet.
- Let's go.

377
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,138
It's not over yet.

378
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,138
The weather is beautiful.

379
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,207
Dong Hyun, it's the sea.

380
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,977
How can the weather be like this in the winter?

381
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,748
- The weather is nice.
- It's the best.

382
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:22,288
(They arrive in Seogwipo, the southernmost part in Korea.)

383
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:26,857
This must be it.

384
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:29,658
(Sora's Castle)

385
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:32,997
We only go to famous places in Jeju.

386
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,037
- Right.
- It's my first time here.

387
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,167
- It's like I've never been to Jeju.
- I'd never been to any of them...

388
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,607
despite coming here so often.

389
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:40,238
It's like my first time on Jeju Island.

390
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,707
It looks very exotic.

391
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,017
(When they walk into the refreshing forest for a long time)

392
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,118
- What's this?
- It's beautiful.

393
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,247
(A brook appears at the end.)

394
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:55,056
- This is incredible.
- Such a place existed in Jeju?

395
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,117
It's incredible.

396
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:57,988
Why doesn't anyone know about this?

397
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,557
The water is so clear.

398
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:01,456
- My goodness.
- It looks so beautiful.

399
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,097
This is insane.

400
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,367
It's unbelievable.

401
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:06,697
I didn't know a place like this existed in Korea.

402
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,697
It'd be amazing to go in the water.

403
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,897
Unbelievable!

404
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:12,207
(Unbelievable!)

405
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,537
(Sojeongbang Waterfall)

406
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,476
(A small waterfall located near Jeongbang Waterfall)

407
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,677
(The water falls from the land directly to the sea.)

408
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,446
- This is just unbelievable.
- Goodness.

409
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,917
(The more they look, they more they get absorbed...)

410
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,076
What's this?

411
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,748
(in the beauty of the waterfall.)

412
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,858
We don't have time to be in awe right now.

413
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,857
I know, but I can't help it.

414
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,258
I understand, but...

415
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:40,427
(A handsome architectural building hidden in this forest)

416
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,767
(Chief Lim welcomes Team Handsome.)

417
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:45,908
This is amazing.

418
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,476
- The view is magnificent.
- Yes.

419
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,847
It was just incredible.

420
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,077
Doesn't this building look unusual?

421
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,247
Doesn't it look unusual and round?

422
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,317
- Yes, it looks unusual.
- Including the pillars.

423
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:04,158
(The beautiful waterfall as its garden)

424
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,758
(A white house over a steep cliff)

425
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,797
(A 2-story mansion, Sora's Castle)

426
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:19,567
(A heritage from the last century with an exotic vibe)

427
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:26,207
(Handsome Heritage 6, a secret villa in the south)

428
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,547
The way to the house,

429
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,246
- the shape of the building, - It's so beautiful.

430
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,487
And the palm trees make it seem...

431
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,456
- like I'm outside of Korea.
- Doesn't it feel like...

432
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:39,226
you're at a castle in a jungle in Southeast Asia?

433
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,297
Was the design inspired by a shell?

434
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,327
No, it was named Sora's Castle...

435
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,128
- much later.
- Really?

436
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,526
Who made this building?

437
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,966
What was the use of it?

438
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,167
No one knows.

439
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,667
- No one knows?
- No.

440
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:53,637
We only know that it was built in 1969.

441
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,408
We can look it up on its real estate register.

442
00:17:56,878 --> 00:18:00,176
It's unknown, but one person is assumed to have built it.

443
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,577
- His name is Kim Chung Up.
- Right, I brought up his name.

444
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:05,787
He was one of the first architects in Korea.

445
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,957
He was born in the 1920s, so he passed away.

446
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,256
Did he build something...

447
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,726
- that looks similar to this?
- One of his buildings is...

448
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,997
Dr. Seo's Women's Clinic in Dongdaemun.

449
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:19,797
That's even rounder than this one.

450
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,797
(An architectural building that's similar to Dr. Seo's Women's Clinic)

451
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:25,007
The main building of Jeju National University is...

452
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:28,107
also built with similar materials and structures.

453
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,507
That's why people guess that it was built by Kim Chung Up.

454
00:18:32,648 --> 00:18:35,377
Imagine building this at this location back then.

455
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,017
There weren't paved roads then.

456
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,217
There was probably nothing but nature.

457
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,087
To transport all the materials here,

458
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,587
the construction must have been costly.

459
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,926
- Someone who's rich?
- Exactly.

460
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,456
- It was either someone rich...
- Someone rich.

461
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:49,897
Or someone with a lot of power.

462
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:52,067
Maybe someone built a villa.

463
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,526
He wanted to keep it a secret...

464
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,736
- so that no one comes to visit.
- Right.

465
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,337
It's possible especially for a villa.

466
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,068
That's one of the thoughts.

467
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,308
(How does the mansion with many secrets look inside?)

468
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:08,818
Right now, this is the information desk.

469
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,247
There's a book cafe upstairs.

470
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,088
This is how the inside looks.

471
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:21,088
(A spacious living room with a glass wall facing the sea)

472
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:26,727
(You can get a glimpse of a mansion from the 70s.)

473
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:32,168
It'd be amazing to live here.

474
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,168
This is incredible.

475
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:37,377
You wake up in the morning and go fishing.

476
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,308
If I lived here...

477
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:40,776
Please come this way.

478
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:41,777
(A Mediterranean balcony with the view of the beach)

479
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:44,717
Isn't the handrail interesting?

480
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:48,017
It feels like you're at the beach.

481
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,217
These stairs lead to the second floor.

482
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,427
They go up in a whirl.

483
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,697
There are no stairs inside.

484
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,696
Usually, the floors are connected indoors.

485
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,827
Is it this way?

486
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,027
You can only go upstairs outside.

487
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,868
It looks so beautiful.

488
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,267
This is what it looks like.

489
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:10,838
(What you see as soon as you come upstairs)

490
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,176
(A panoramic view of the sea)

491
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:16,447
You can see Mun Island and Seogwipo Port.

492
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:18,686
This is nice.

493
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,487
I love this background.

494
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,457
It's like a work of art.

495
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:26,987
- It's amazing.
- As you said, it's a work of art.

496
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:32,298
The palm trees make me feel like I'm in Southeast Asia.

497
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,997
Usually, the windows...

498
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,567
Wouldn't it look more refreshing...

499
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:39,808
if all the windows were one?

500
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:45,746
(It would've looked more refreshing if it were a single window.)

501
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,147
It wasn't possible...

502
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,348
because there aren't pillars.

503
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:52,348
If the house was supported with pillars,

504
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,986
it could've been one long window.

505
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,058
Pillars would support the house.

506
00:20:57,158 --> 00:21:01,158
However, the wall is supporting the building,

507
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,398
so it couldn't be a long window.

508
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:06,526
The white part in between is necessary, isn't it?

509
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:07,867
That's what supports the top.

510
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,568
The pillars are at the bottom.

511
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:12,267
At the bottom, there are pillars.

512
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:14,536
Based on what I see,

513
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,807
it doesn't seem like someone lived here.

514
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,946
Maybe it was a place to invite guests.

515
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,577
It seems more like a vacation home.

516
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:22,847
I agree.

517
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,318
It doesn't seem like a regular home.

518
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:29,687
(Their visit to Sora's Castle with many secrets is over.)

519
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,328
Shall we go downstairs?

520
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:34,588
(Time for Quiz)

521
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,097
You feel it as soon as you hear it.

522
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,267
Exactly.

523
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,196
- They're already done?
- At this rate...

524
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:41,197
Ctesiphon House.

525
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,736
- See that?
- I knew it.

526
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,696
- They got this right.
- How many have they won?

527
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:45,838
And now...

528
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:48,138
They won so many.

529
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:49,676
They've been planning to win...

530
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,577
- by occupying more places.
- From the start?

531
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,007
It's 3 against 1.

532
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,547
Let's do the quiz and move on.

533
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,847
Here's the question.

534
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,647
- The culture of Jeju Haenyeo was...
- Haenyeo?

535
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:04,318
Inscribed as the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016.

536
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:08,327
When haenyeos dive,

537
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,496
they wrap their heads...

538
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,668
with white cloth to keep their hair tidy.

539
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:16,597
In emergency situations underwater,

540
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:20,006
they grab this cloth and wave it.

541
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,077
Or they tie it around the ankle to extend it.

542
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,578
What type of emergency situation is it?

543
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,776
- Do you mean in the water?
- Yes, underwater.

544
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,177
(In the water?)

545
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:30,618
When they encounter sharks...

546
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,216
I've seen women divers...

547
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,017
in dramas.

548
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,216
When they're out of breath...

549
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:37,587
or the rope gets tangled...

550
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:38,627
(Out of oxygen or tangled rope?)

551
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:40,026
I've worked with haenyeos...

552
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,127
- on "Hangout with Yoo." - Have you?

553
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,797
- Please. So what happened?
- Have you really?

554
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,328
- And so?
- Do you know the answer or not?

555
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,727
There are seaweeds underwater.

556
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:50,337
- When they get tangled on the foot, - Exactly.

557
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,036
They untie the cloth to ask for help.

558
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,168
Really? You're sure about it, right?

559
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:56,676
I remember hearing something like that.

560
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:57,737
It sounds plausible.

561
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,308
If it's underwater, that'd be the only answer.

562
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:01,308
- Let's hurry and move on.
- Do you think it's right?

563
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,077
- That's the only answer.
- Right.

564
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:04,347
They wouldn't encounter sharks.

565
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,947
Can you two calm down?

566
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,986
We should brainstorm and narrow down the ideas.

567
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,357
- It's correct.
- Seriously.

568
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:12,157
There's no need to think. It's correct.

569
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,226
We don't have time.

570
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,797
- Let's answer it and eat.
- We must go.

571
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:15,827
Let's go.

572
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:16,828
(Let's hurry.)

573
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,897
- Let's think about it for a while.
- Really?

574
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,926
You're way too excited.

575
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,696
- The two of you...
- Wait, listen.

576
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,696
Possible emergency situations at the sea is...

577
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:26,067
- encountering violent fish.
- No.

578
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:28,007
Or you're out of breath.

579
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,808
Wait a minute.

580
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:34,578
Haenyeo's uniform is black, right?

581
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:38,516
Something long and white can make them look big.

582
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,557
When it's hanging from the ankle...

583
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:44,186
Sharks or large octopuses could be dangerous.

584
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:45,588
When they see that,

585
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,427
they might get threatened.

586
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:50,158
You should answer and take responsibility for it.

587
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:51,868
How can I take responsibility?

588
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:53,427
How?

589
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,696
When we carry one rock,

590
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:56,037
you carry two rocks.

591
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,437
I can do that.

592
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,706
Jin is already expecting...

593
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:00,967
to get the penalty.

594
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,477
I'll let everything go today.

595
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,348
- Go with your answer.
- Let's do that.

596
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,176
Please. I don't know anymore.

597
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,177
(Giving up on himself)

598
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:11,918
To avoid something that's dangerous.

599
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,917
To avoid something that's dangerous.

600
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,857
- No.
- To avoid something...

601
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,697
- that's dangerous?
- That's not it.

602
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,397
- Something dangerous.
- It's not it.

603
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,598
When you face various fish in the sea.

604
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,966
Wait.

605
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,166
- I think it's correct.
- I think so, too.

606
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,007
Dangerous fish and shellfish.

607
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,038
- "Shellfish?" - No, seafood.

608
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,308
- Seafood.
- "Seafood?"

609
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:39,946
When they're faced with seafood.

610
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,377
Everything at a fish market.

611
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,078
Everything in the aquarium.

612
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:46,388
(What's the answer?)

613
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,848
Correct.

614
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,558
(To avoid dangerous fish by making themselves look big)

615
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,927
(We got it.)

616
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:55,757
All right.

617
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,426
- You're good, Dong Hyun.
- Was it the exact answer?

618
00:24:58,427 --> 00:24:59,526
(What's the exact answer?)

619
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:00,598
What's the exact answer?

620
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:02,736
When they're faced with dangerous fish,

621
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,466
they make their bodies bigger than the fish.

622
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,207
Your answer was accurate.

623
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:08,937
- That's unbelievable.
- By the way,

624
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:11,877
Jin said the correct answer first within 0.5 seconds.

625
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,047
What did he say?

626
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,547
As soon as I asked, he mentioned sharks.

627
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,247
(I said the correct answer?)

628
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,016
Did you say that?

629
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,686
It also happened during the last shoot.

630
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,217
They always say that I said the correct answer.

631
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:24,986
That's a relief.

632
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,926
We'd be in trouble if we failed.

633
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:27,957
Seriously.

634
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:30,097
- Sora's Castle.
- Sora's Castle.

635
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:35,567
(Donghong-dong, Seogwipo: Sora's Castle)

636
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,637
What's on the menu?

637
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,236
- Modakchigi.
- What's modakchigi?

638
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,436
In Jeju, they pour tteokbokki and other snacks...

639
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:42,207
- all on one plate.
- I see.

640
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:43,776
- Can we get...
- Let's hurry.

641
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:45,407
Modakchigi to go?

642
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:46,746
- Yes, it's a snack.
- To eat it in the car?

643
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,206
- Can you eat while driving?
- Of course.

644
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,517
- Of course.
- Sure.

645
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:51,317
- I can even eat with a straw.
- Right?

646
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:53,347
- I can suck it in.
- I'll feed you from the side.

647
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:54,486
Let's get going first.

648
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,317
Click on the map. I'll put the address.

649
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,358
Okay.

650
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:00,157
Sir, can we get modakchigi to go?

651
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,426
- Yes.
- We're on our way now.

652
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,496
Can we get one modakchigi to go?

653
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,298
- I'll prepare it for you.
- Thank you.

654
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:07,598
Okay.

655
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,667
Is the score 3 to 2?

656
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,607
Bingo can't be completed.

657
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,737
We must block them.

658
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,436
Can you give me the board?

659
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:18,506
(Now it's about who has more.)

660
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,446
They have enough time to win five,

661
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:22,377
but we can only win four.

662
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,417
It's okay.

663
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:26,447
No, they still have to wish someone happy birthday...

664
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:28,348
and pick tangerines.

665
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:30,617
You're right. There isn't much time before 7pm.

666
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:31,987
(Jin is still hopeful.)

667
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:33,827
It's over here.

668
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,226
- This is it.
- Here it is.

669
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,598
(They arrive at the snack bar.)

670
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:38,558
I'll bring it.

671
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:42,936
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

672
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,098
(Picking up modakchigi quickly)

673
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,707
(He finishes picking up.)

674
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:52,177
Gosh, it smells good.

675
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:56,578
He told me to mix everything.

676
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,377
Okay, just mix them?

677
00:26:58,378 --> 00:26:59,618
That's modakchigi.

678
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,456
(In Jeju dialect, modakchigi means an assortment of food...)

679
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,256
(on one plate.)

680
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,026
(You can only find it on Jeju Island.)

681
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,757
(Things like tteokbokki, gimbap, and jeon are served together.)

682
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:13,368
(Looking delicious)

683
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:15,398
Egg.

684
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,068
Are you thinking about your health right now?

685
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,108
We have no napkins here, so be careful.

686
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:22,436
(Starting with Dong Hyun who's working hard to drive)

687
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:23,578
Nice.

688
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,677
It's delicious.

689
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:27,807
Jin, have a bite and hand me the plate.

690
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:28,818
Okay.

691
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,477
- Dong Hyun has to steer.
- Right.

692
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:31,716
It's good.

693
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:32,788
(Jin slurps some in.)

694
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,917
It's delicious.

695
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:36,186
(Tossing directly to Yi Kyung behind him)

696
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,217
I want some more.

697
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,058
It's delicious.

698
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:41,387
(Taking a bite neatly)

699
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:42,427
It's good.

700
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:46,226
- This is really good.
- It's tasty.

701
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:47,227
It's delicious.

702
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,627
I want one more bite.

703
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:50,666
(I want one more bite.)

704
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,737
Okay.

705
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:55,578
(They can't stop eating modakchigi.)

706
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,307
The rice cake is good.

707
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,048
(The rice cake is good.)

708
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:02,848
- Jin is doing well next to him.
- It's delicious.

709
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,516
The rice cake is amazing.

710
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,986
- The rice cake is fried.
- Right.

711
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:07,047
It's fried.

712
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,818
- The fried rice cake is incredible.
- It's so good.

713
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:13,087
We even found a tasty restaurant.

714
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:14,927
Their food isn't spicy.

715
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:17,456
It's nice and sweet.

716
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,327
(While they eat modakchigi...)

717
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,828
I can't stop eating it.

718
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:24,038
- We passed.
- We will...

719
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,608
We will make it today.

720
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,467
We already won.

721
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,908
We should go and pick tangerines.

722
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,637
It's ten minutes from here.

723
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:33,307
(Picking tangerine card, 30 minutes)

724
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:35,206
Let's go to the tangerine farm to pick tangerines.

725
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:36,947
(They head to do their assignment.)

726
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,047
Wasn't the ice cream great?

727
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,048
Yes.

728
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,687
We just need to eat some ara.

729
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,318
I won't sit back.

730
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,527
It's game over once we can get ara.

731
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:51,027
We'll show them what it means to reduce the amount.

732
00:28:51,257 --> 00:28:52,297
(Hilarious)

733
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,766
How the amount gets reduced.

734
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,098
It wasn't to make things easy.

735
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:57,467
The amount got reduced because we were hungry.

736
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,907
You laughed at eating out for an answer.

737
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,707
Yes, we aren't uncomfortable.

738
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:03,807
I'll show them that it isn't funny.

739
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,946
Reduce the amount of ara out of hunger.

740
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:07,847
(Reduced the Amount of Ara Out of Hunger)

741
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:08,877
That's correct.

742
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:11,647
(As Team Guys continues talking about food)

743
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:14,447
I can't believe that we haven't heard the sound yet.

744
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:15,888
I mean...

745
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:17,957
I'd like to hear the cuckoo sound.

746
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,658
Once we hear it,

747
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:22,358
we'll feel rushed. Don't you think?

748
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:23,957
- What?
- You're right.

749
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:27,027
- Did you hear that?
- Sora's Castle.

750
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:28,996
Seolaesa?

751
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:30,337
(Maybe I shouldn't have said it.)

752
00:29:30,338 --> 00:29:31,437
Where is it?

753
00:29:31,997 --> 00:29:33,137
Sora's Castle?

754
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,407
Sora's Castle? Okay.

755
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,777
- It was to block us.
- That's good.

756
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:39,506
That's better for us.

757
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:41,007
We can just go to Bangju Church.

758
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,016
Then they'll go to V Garden.

759
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:44,348
Now, it's about who has more.

760
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:46,247
They'll go to V Garden.

761
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:49,317
We'll go to Bangju Church and World Cup Stadium.

762
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:51,118
We must win one of them.

763
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,756
(While competing for time, )

764
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:57,226
(they arrive at the tangerine farm.)

765
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,558
Let's get to work.

766
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,367
Here we go.

767
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,068
(They start picking tangerines right away.)

768
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:03,397
(How to dress for picking tangerines)

769
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:04,496
I'm the head of the village.

770
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:05,637
(Sang Uk, the head of the village)

771
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,667
Goodness.

772
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,838
(Tae Hyun, a kid)

773
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,007
(And...)

774
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:12,976
They're picked when they're ripe.

775
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,148
(A brick character?)

776
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:17,916
(The 3 of them start to pick tangerines.)

777
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,088
All right.

778
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,587
(They just need to pick them without goals for 30 minutes.)

779
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,617
Is it too big?

780
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:27,057
(They just need to pick them without goals for 30 minutes.)

781
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,257
This should be enough.

782
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,727
This looks very delicious.

783
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,766
(A tangerine that makes your mouth water)

784
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,298
It looks very sweet.

785
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:39,436
(He tastes it.)

786
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,467
Are you assuming that they got two wrong?

787
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,206
(He can't stop looking at tangerines after tasting it.)

788
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,308
It looks good.

789
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,147
He's eating so much.

790
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,247
(In awe)

791
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,548
We must go for the top.

792
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,756
Most people probably picked at the bottom.

793
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,057
(Sang Uk goes after tangerines on top.)

794
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:58,087
The higher ones.

795
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,887
(Picking easily)

796
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:05,158
(Picking)

797
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:08,067
(Laughing)

798
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,397
Seung Ho, are you picking them?

799
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,737
- Sure, I picked almost all of them.
- Right?

800
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,507
(He seems to be picking tangerines, not drinking them.)

801
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:21,747
(Not the collar but tangerines)

802
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:27,848
(Did Seung Ho pick his first tangerine?)

803
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,187
(Staring)

804
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:35,328
(Selecting the tangerines very carefully)

805
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:39,898
(Kid Tae Hyun is definitely picking tangerines.)

806
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,337
(A lot)

807
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:43,798
The tangerines are big.

808
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:49,277
(Commanding)

809
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:53,408
(He picked 1 during 5 minutes.)

810
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:56,848
There must be one question...

811
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:00,348
about Jeju dialect.

812
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:04,517
There will definitely be one question about Jeju dialect,

813
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:06,757
but when will it be?

814
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:09,026
(Humming)

815
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,426
(Exclaiming)

816
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:11,798
(What is this sound?)

817
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:24,638
(The head of the village is starting to snack again.)

818
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:30,247
(Full of wild beauty)

819
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:35,548
It's good.

820
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:37,888
It's good.

821
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,226
(His harvest increased by 200 percent.)

822
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,427
What is he doing?

823
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:48,427
I picked pretty ones.

824
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:49,837
I'm all about quality.

825
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:50,967
(I picked two pretty tangerines.)

826
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,667
Seung Ho.

827
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,706
While you were growing up,

828
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,476
didn't your parents scold you a lot?

829
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,077
- No, not at all.
- Oh, come on.

830
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,408
Is this what you picked?

831
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,578
- This is just a baby.
- I know.

832
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:04,916
Return it.

833
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,587
(He has it returned out of embarrassment.)

834
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:08,446
There. Bring it back when it's bigger.

835
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,618
How can I grow it bigger when it's already been picked?

836
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:13,256
Unbelievable.

837
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,457
- Here.
- Sang Uk.

838
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:17,297
Why are you carrying around tangerine peel?

839
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:18,328
Well...

840
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,027
I couldn't help myself, so I ate them.

841
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,736
(After experiencing the taste of tangerines)

842
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:25,497
(After experiencing the work of picking tangerines)

843
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,667
(They hurry off to the next location.)

844
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,308
(Or so they thought.)

845
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:34,408
(Happy birthday to you)

846
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:38,748
(Happy birthday, dear Su Jin)

847
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:41,817
(Happy birthday to you)

848
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,788
(Why are they wishing someone a happy birthday?)

849
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,487
- Seung Ho.
- Yes?

850
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:46,626
Check this out.

851
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:47,788
- The wishing happy birthday card.
- Yes?

852
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:52,097
"Buy a cake, find someone whose birthday is today,"

853
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,397
"and wish them a happy birthday."

854
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,938
My daughter's birthday is tomorrow.

855
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,208
Doesn't it say we should buy a cake?

856
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,837
I already bought one.

857
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:03,307
I bought one via messenger.

858
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,437
Then I sent it.

859
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,847
- That's right.
- I found a birthday girl.

860
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:10,647
(Come to think of it, he isn't wrong.)

861
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,288
We can make a video call to her.

862
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:14,946
There wouldn't be an issue.

863
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:17,216
- That's what we'll do.
- Right?

864
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:18,687
Read it to make sure.

865
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,058
Right?

866
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,287
That'll work.

867
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:22,388
Did you get the cake?

868
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,227
- Su Jin, happy birthday.
- Su Jin.

869
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,327
(Like that, they wished her a happy birthday via video call.)

870
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,427
Thank you.

871
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,027
Su Jin, he'll be in the movie "Omniscient Reader."

872
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,038
(He'll be in the movie "Omniscient Reader.")

873
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,637
(Moving)

874
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,938
- Hi.
- Where is she suddenly going?

875
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:36,676
What on earth? Stop that.

876
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:38,376
Why did you bow to him?

877
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,747
(Look at her.)

878
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,577
He's the fencer.

879
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:43,646
- Hi.
- The gold medalist in fencing.

880
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:44,946
(Embarrassed, bowing without looking)

881
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:47,547
Su Jin, happy birthday anyway.

882
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:51,487
I sent you a cake via messenger.

883
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:52,987
Happy birthday.

884
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,387
Your dad bought the cake.

885
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:57,396
I bought the cake myself. Bye.

886
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,567
Su Jin, come watch "Omniscient Reader" next year.

887
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,397
Thanks.

888
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,897
- Bye.
- Bye.

889
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,197
- We did it.
- Done.

890
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,707
Okay.

891
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,767
- Now, - Where to next?

892
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:08,836
We're off to Bangju Church.

893
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:10,836
We're finally done cleaning up the poop in our way.

894
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:13,078
- Goodness. We're all done.
- My gosh.

895
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:17,176
- Let's go to Bangju Church.
- Bangju Church.

896
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:19,018
(Team Guys completed their homework.)

897
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:22,658
(Team Handsome)

898
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:27,658
(Sinhyo-dong, Seogwipo-si: V Garden)

899
00:35:27,688 --> 00:35:29,356
- We're running out of time.
- We don't have much time.

900
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:31,098
- We're losing.
- We don't have time.

901
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,926
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

902
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,397
(What will be the story of this place?)

903
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,597
What's this?

904
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:39,767
- Gosh, hello.
- Hi.

905
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:40,768
You always greet us out of the blue.

906
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,207
- Goodness.
- Hey.

907
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,836
I heard you answered the question correctly.

908
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,577
Congratulations. The race is almost over now.

909
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:48,077
- We came back from the dead.
- You're almost done.

910
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,078
We almost lost.

911
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:54,517
You're at a well-developed garden.

912
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:56,458
- It'll be beautiful.
- That's right.

913
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:58,486
- Let's see for ourselves.
- I can't wait.

914
00:35:58,487 --> 00:35:59,526
(Handsome Heritage 7:)

915
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:00,557
(Shall we see it from above or from the ground?)

916
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,857
Through here...

917
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,756
You'll find yourselves in a passage.

918
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:05,426
The pillars guide us outside.

919
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:06,697
- A passage?
- It's pretty.

920
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,227
- This place is amazing.
- Right.

921
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:09,467
Here's the garden.

922
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:12,566
- It's called a garden for a reason.
- Of course.

923
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:15,167
When we talk about landscaping,

924
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,106
the building comes first...

925
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,308
while trees and plants come second.

926
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:19,777
However,

927
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:21,908
this place is owned by a landscape architect.

928
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,176
The building was constructed with the landscape in mind...

929
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:25,347
during the initial stages.

930
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:28,247
- Is it a famous architect?
- Absolutely.

931
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,018
He was born and raised in Jeju as well.

932
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:32,417
- This is incredible.
- Right?

933
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:33,688
That architect...

934
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:35,526
built something in his hometown...

935
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,058
by utilizing his expertise.

936
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,397
Check this out.

937
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:42,097
This was designed as a photo spot.

938
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:43,837
Wave to the camera.

939
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,296
This was made to take photos at.

940
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:46,308
(Nice to meet you.)

941
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,437
The landscape architecture of this place...

942
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:52,676
may seem like random trees and plants to us,

943
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,807
- but there's a meaning behind...
- He planted them all.

944
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:55,978
There's a meaning behind everything.

945
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:59,046
This section is for trees while this section is for moss.

946
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,546
- Like that.
- I see.

947
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:02,387
- That's why there is moss.
- Down there!

948
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,256
It's called the Gumburi Garden.

949
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:07,027
- What's a gumburi?
- Vegetation in craters.

950
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:09,727
What grows around craters...

951
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,527
- were planted here.
- This was man-made, then.

952
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:15,328
Since the architect was born in Jeju,

953
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:17,696
he had vast knowledge of the plants here...

954
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,836
and was able to show the true colors of Jeju Island.

955
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,207
He must've made it...

956
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,038
- so that it looked like a crater.
- Yes, it was deliberate.

957
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,276
I don't think I've ever come across anything...

958
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,348
- that looked like this.
- Right.

959
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,676
He created the space so that it felt...

960
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:32,716
like we were experiencing the ecosystem of Jeju.

961
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,687
I love how what he did with the space under the building.

962
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,087
- Isn't that great?
- Yes.

963
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,558
He had the building elevated.

964
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:42,287
As you know, moss grows in darker places.

965
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:45,026
He created the space because it was a great environment...

966
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:46,027
for moss to grow.

967
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,098
What's inside is even more intriguing.

968
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,696
He dug a hole in the floor and had it covered with glass...

969
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,268
so that we could look at what's underneath.

970
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,977
He made sure we could see everything from every angle.

971
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,236
- What's underneath...
- Right.

972
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,146
And what's around the building.

973
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,748
- We used to have many pavilions.
- Right.

974
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,247
The same can be said for why we favored those.

975
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:08,446
The building didn't block the view of the land,

976
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:11,118
and the landscape could be viewed no matter where you were.

977
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:12,857
Normally, homes were built surrounded by nature.

978
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,687
It's similar in a way.

979
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:17,526
It's bigger in size...

980
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,296
and has glass windows,

981
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,297
but it's similar to a pavilion.

982
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,597
We can call it a modernized pavilion.

983
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:22,626
(They saw a modernized pavilion...)

984
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:23,668
(where nature could be seen from above.)

985
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:26,966
(This time, it's the exact opposite.)

986
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,668
I see we have to take off our shoes.

987
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:33,908
(A section of the building that is dark and quiet)

988
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:40,087
As you can see, there are steps leading down.

989
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,146
He designed it that way...

990
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,857
so that the ground could be aligned with the level of our eyes.

991
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,227
The ground will look different from down there.

992
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,356
Before, we viewed the nature from above.

993
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:49,827
You're supposed to sit here...

994
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,426
and meet the ground at eye-level.

995
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,897
(Once seated, grass and moss will be at eye-level.)

996
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:58,567
(Hi)

997
00:38:58,668 --> 00:38:59,966
He dug up the ground for this.

998
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,267
That's right. It was to lower the ground level.

999
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,977
Like you said, now that we're here...

1000
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,478
meeting the ground at eye-level,

1001
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:10,276
it feels as though I was surrounded by nature more.

1002
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:11,478
That feeling is stronger.

1003
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:13,918
Look how beautiful the moss is.

1004
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:15,748
- I can see that now.
- Right.

1005
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,617
I love it here.

1006
00:39:18,618 --> 00:39:21,387
Like he said, I wouldn't mind spending a whole day here.

1007
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:22,388
(Like enjoying a folding screen)

1008
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:24,797
We're looking at this almost like we're meditating,

1009
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:28,427
but in a few moments, we'll go wild over the quiz.

1010
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:31,897
The moment of fate is drawing near.

1011
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,767
Again, I wish you the best of luck.

1012
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:36,776
- Got it.
- It's that time again.

1013
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,106
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1014
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:39,447
I was enjoying the meditation.

1015
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,308
While we were meditating, that time drew near.

1016
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,316
(Sinhyo-dong, Seogwipo-si: V Garden)

1017
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:46,817
(Time for Quiz)

1018
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,047
- Here's your question.
- Sure.

1019
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,356
Jeju has many unique cultures...

1020
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:56,828
that are different from the mainland which it got from being an island.

1021
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,867
Oddly enough, bread and buns...

1022
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,566
are popular during the Lunar New Year holiday...

1023
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,498
and the Chuseok holiday.

1024
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,937
Bread and buns are popular during Lunar New Year and Chuseok.

1025
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:09,938
(Bread and buns are popular on traditional holidays?)

1026
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:12,848
Why?

1027
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:17,947
Dol hareubang, dol hareubun.

1028
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:20,788
Maybe dol hareubuns fly off the shelves.

1029
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:24,586
(As if)

1030
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:25,987
Dol hareubuns?

1031
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:28,627
(Innocent)

1032
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,257
I'm not the sharpest one here, but that can't be it.

1033
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:33,097
(Or not)

1034
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,098
This may be wrong,

1035
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:36,296
but rice farming couldn't be done in Jeju.

1036
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:38,467
Since it's an island, it wasn't easy to get water.

1037
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:42,138
It's also windy here and the weather isn't friendly enough.

1038
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,836
They could cultivate wheat which makes bread and buns,

1039
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:46,708
- so maybe that's...
- That isn't a cultural reason.

1040
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,647
It's a culture here.

1041
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:53,788
(I think I'm right...)

1042
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,487
What do we do on Lunar New Year and Chuseok?

1043
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,487
- We have memorial services.
- Right.

1044
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:00,756
- We have memorial services.
- Yes.

1045
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:01,926
- To do so, - Do they serve bread?

1046
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,397
- they must've cooked food.
- Right.

1047
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,827
Bread had to be a dish...

1048
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,467
- that they served.
- What?

1049
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:09,797
- Because of that...
- That's their culture?

1050
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:11,296
We wouldn't know, but...

1051
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,267
- I don't think so.
- On Lunar New Year and Chuseok,

1052
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:14,506
they serve bread to their ancestors.

1053
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:15,667
(It's a traditional holiday, so he thought of the memorial service.)

1054
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,236
That being the reason for it...

1055
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:19,377
is what I initially thought.

1056
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,947
The reason behind that could be what I said earlier.

1057
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,578
About farming rice and this being an island.

1058
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:27,817
All three members are incredibly stubborn.

1059
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,757
This is never a discussion.

1060
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,987
We're busy trying to prove that we're right.

1061
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:33,586
- Two of us will back out, - Right.

1062
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:34,657
And we go with the answer from the last person.

1063
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,457
We go with the answer from the most stubborn person.

1064
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,727
As I was talking, his expression...

1065
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:39,966
(He already shared his opinion with his expression.)

1066
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,426
Rice can't be farmed on islands. They don't have many rice paddies.

1067
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:43,438
(Talking to himself)

1068
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:44,566
I got it!

1069
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,268
(What now?)

1070
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:48,807
(Being fussy)

1071
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,407
It's a volcanic island!

1072
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,408
- Rice paddies require plains.
- Right.

1073
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,006
They don't have that with this being a mountain.

1074
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,717
However, wheat grows well even in slanted fields.

1075
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,146
- That's what you said earlier.
- I know.

1076
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:00,486
We serve rice to our ancestors.

1077
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:02,647
They should serve hot steamed rice to their ancestors,

1078
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,457
but their ancestors are understanding of it.

1079
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,717
Of them serving bread?

1080
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,728
- That's why...
- If we put that together,

1081
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,957
it's because of how they serve bread...

1082
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,457
to their ancestors...

1083
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,497
at memorial services that take place on holidays.

1084
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,827
That's why they buy so much of it on holidays.

1085
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,437
- Exactly.
- That's what we'll go with?

1086
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:19,737
- What about dol hareubuns?
- Dol hareubuns?

1087
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,208
That...

1088
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:22,537
Dol hareubuns?

1089
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:24,107
If that's the correct answer, I'll stay behind tomorrow.

1090
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,247
The one from Team Guys and I...

1091
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:28,748
will stay here for our penalty.

1092
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:30,276
Got it?

1093
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:31,876
It's unorthodox, but I can get on board with that.

1094
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:33,118
Right?

1095
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,748
The answer is this.

1096
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,816
Jeju Island traditionally served bread...

1097
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:40,757
to their ancestors at memorial services...

1098
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:45,427
that take place on holidays such as Lunar New Year and Chuseok.

1099
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:48,126
That's why they see high sales of bread...

1100
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:50,138
during that time of year.

1101
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:58,578
(What's the answer?)

1102
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,747
The answer is because they serve bread...

1103
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,577
for ancestral rites in Jeju Island.

1104
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:05,877
(Because they serve bread for ancestral rites, the sale is high.)

1105
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,486
(They got the exact answer again!)

1106
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:09,517
This is unbelievable.

1107
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,117
(That makes it a 3-versus-3 tie.)

1108
00:43:11,118 --> 00:43:13,086
- Really?
- Did we say the exact answer?

1109
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:14,388
- It's crazy.
- Here is an explanation for it.

1110
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:19,457
In the past, due to barren soil and lack of rice farming,

1111
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,728
rice was precious in Jeju Island.

1112
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:23,566
So, instead of using tteok or sweets made of rice,

1113
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,868
it is said they used bread.

1114
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,966
- Cool.
- I think we did a nice job.

1115
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,566
- It was good.
- It was nice this time.

1116
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:30,837
- It was great.
- One of us is always right.

1117
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:32,176
- No.
- Come on.

1118
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:35,046
When the two young ones are being mischievous,

1119
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,617
the eldest one gets the work done. It's good teamwork.

1120
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,217
(We might have good teamwork.)

1121
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:44,558
(Team Handsome successfully occupies the V Garden.)

1122
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:47,388
- V Garden!
- V Garden!

1123
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:52,756
(Sinhyo-dong, Seogwipo-si: V Garden)

1124
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:55,228
(Team Guys)

1125
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:58,497
Let's finish this at the Bangju Church.

1126
00:43:58,498 --> 00:43:59,808
We have to put an end to it here.

1127
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:01,736
Welcome.

1128
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:03,606
(Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si: Bangju Church)

1129
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,577
This place is called the Bangju Church.

1130
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:07,946
- The Bangju Church?
- Yes.

1131
00:44:07,947 --> 00:44:09,676
Who would think this is a church?

1132
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:12,078
Seriously. It looks like a really pretty cafe.

1133
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:16,316
- It symbolizes Noah's Ark.
- I've heard of it.

1134
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:18,287
To symbolize Noah's Ark,

1135
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,558
- a part of the roof is protruding.
- Yes.

1136
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:24,057
It symbolizes the mouth of a fish...

1137
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:25,327
that is facing the sky.

1138
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,368
- It symbolizes that.
- I see.

1139
00:44:27,527 --> 00:44:31,337
The material used for the roof makes it look like scales.

1140
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:33,308
That's what it's expressing.

1141
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,506
It must be sparkling.

1142
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,977
In fact, this church is nice...

1143
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,676
when it's sunny,

1144
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,577
- but it's better around this time.
- Really?

1145
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,216
When you look at Mount Sanbang from here,

1146
00:44:44,217 --> 00:44:46,078
a holy light comes down.

1147
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:48,147
What is that?

1148
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:49,958
That's a true paradise.

1149
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,356
(It makes them feel like they're in paradise.)

1150
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:58,458
(The sunset of the Bangju Church)

1151
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:01,527
This is really...

1152
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,537
- Everything is on our side.
- Yes.

1153
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:05,737
(Even the sky is helping us.)

1154
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:07,408
This must be the place to wrap it up.

1155
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,077
(Though their beginning was small, )

1156
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:12,137
(their latter days will be very great!)

1157
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:16,248
(Cuckoo)

1158
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,847
V Garden.

1159
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,216
- The V Garden.
- The V Garden.

1160
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:23,018
- We could tell that far.
- We anticipated it.

1161
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,018
Now, we're on the battle with ourselves.

1162
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:26,957
Let's go there...

1163
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,627
- and see it from the front.
- Can we do that?

1164
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:32,228
There's a cross here.

1165
00:45:32,498 --> 00:45:33,598
There is.

1166
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,497
- It looks like a window, - It's like a window.

1167
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:37,368
But it must be a cross when viewed from the front.

1168
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:40,506
The cross is placed very subtly.

1169
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:43,207
- They put a big tower on it.
- Right.

1170
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,937
It doesn't make it too obvious.

1171
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:46,578
(A metaphorical cross that only those who know will notice)

1172
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,376
(The giant bow of the ark is finally showing itself.)

1173
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:49,578
This is so...

1174
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,877
Can it be this cool?

1175
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,717
It does look like an ark from here, doesn't it?

1176
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:58,117
The reflection on the water...

1177
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:01,328
is a bit vague right now, right?

1178
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:03,897
- Yes.
- As if the boat was moving forward.

1179
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:06,426
At a glance, it does look like it's floating.

1180
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:08,828
- Like it's sliding through water.
- Yes.

1181
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,868
It doesn't look mundane.

1182
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:16,038
I couldn't have imagined it symbolized the Ark.

1183
00:46:16,938 --> 00:46:18,307
Shall we go inside?

1184
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,877
- Yes.
- Can we go inside?

1185
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:21,748
I was curious about the inside.

1186
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:27,317
(How will the inside of the Bangju Church look?)

1187
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:35,188
There's a window on the ceiling facing the sky.

1188
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,926
It's where the roof folds when you see from the outside.

1189
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:39,966
(The window faces the sky.)

1190
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,227
- Is this the protruding part?
- Yes.

1191
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:43,897
- The mouth.
- It's the opening of the mouth.

1192
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:45,966
I thought it was a ceiling.

1193
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:46,967
(The outside and the inside, and nature and architecture...)

1194
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:47,967
(create harmony.)

1195
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:53,038
You see things only when you know about it.

1196
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:56,777
- Shall we go inside?
- Is that okay?

1197
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,777
I really want to see inside.

1198
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:00,487
You have to see this place.

1199
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,126
(Like the Ark made of woods...)

1200
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:10,256
It uses wood here...

1201
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:13,868
because Noah's Ark was made of wood.

1202
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:18,537
You can see the cross from the inside too.

1203
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:19,796
This place is so...

1204
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:21,236
I feel like I've seen it in a movie.

1205
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:24,507
It's so pretty.

1206
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:26,908
Can we take a seat?

1207
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:29,447
- Let's take a seat for a second.
- Since we're at a church.

1208
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,417
Gosh. Here,

1209
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:34,347
you have to sit...

1210
00:47:34,348 --> 00:47:36,987
to see the view. I told you.

1211
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:39,117
(You can see outside through the front window.)

1212
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:40,888
You can see outside from inside.

1213
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,957
But when you are standing, you can't see it.

1214
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,498
When you sit, you can see the sky reflecting on the water.

1215
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:49,167
The reflection of the sky on the water.

1216
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:52,736
There are windows we can open on the eye-level.

1217
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:54,106
- That's right.
- For example,

1218
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:56,007
it feels like you're rowing...

1219
00:47:56,337 --> 00:48:00,007
through the gaps between the columns to move forward.

1220
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,247
The chairs are placed on a perfect spot.

1221
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:04,716
The church symbolizes the Ark.

1222
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:08,317
It symbolizes that they're going forward through the water.

1223
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,117
In fact, there aren't any special decorations.

1224
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:11,717
- They barely have lighting.
- Right.

1225
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,658
What fills up the space is nature.

1226
00:48:16,288 --> 00:48:19,927
The water, the sky, the waves on the water,

1227
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:22,227
- and even the wind...
- Those are the design elements.

1228
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:24,137
Become the decoration for the church.

1229
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:26,038
(The Bangju Church filled with nature)

1230
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:29,237
It's nice and warm inside.

1231
00:48:29,978 --> 00:48:31,007
(Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si: Bangju Church)

1232
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,478
Now, I'll give you a quiz.

1233
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:37,646
Water has always been scarce on Jeju Island,

1234
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:41,046
so there are many idioms about water.

1235
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:44,087
Now, you'll hear an idiom about water.

1236
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:46,418
It must be in dialect.

1237
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:48,957
- Dialect.
- If...

1238
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,697
the dialect I learned...

1239
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:54,467
from the YouTube I watched is part of the quiz,

1240
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,467
it's the sky telling us to win.

1241
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:57,767
- Seriously.
- Yes. It's a sign.

1242
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,066
- It's...
- It's a sign.

1243
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:01,337
- "My goodness," indeed.
- Here we go.

1244
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:03,168
No way.

1245
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:06,747
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,

1246
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:09,147
you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.

1247
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:11,078
(Unbelievable)

1248
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:15,517
What is the meaning of the idiom you just heard?

1249
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:17,857
- It's not about listening.
- Please.

1250
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:18,986
(Shocked)

1251
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,327
- It's in Korean, right?
- Yes. In Jeju dialect.

1252
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,598
Should we write it down?

1253
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:25,396
Play it once more.

1254
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:26,696
- Once more.
- It's just like...

1255
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,728
"Amazing Saturday."

1256
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:32,897
(And so the Team Guys' dictation contest begins.)

1257
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,267
- I got it.
- In after life.

1258
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:38,177
If you waste water when you wash up,

1259
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:41,777
you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.

1260
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:44,946
- You're awesome.
- Please play it one more time.

1261
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:47,986
What's with your brain today?

1262
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,787
Did the sky give you a signal?

1263
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:51,087
- I think that's it.
- That's it.

1264
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,757
Your answer is, "If you waste water when you wash up,"

1265
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:57,058
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

1266
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:00,267
(Team Handsome came and had the same quiz earlier.)

1267
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:03,467
(They mistook "wash nhot" as "wash up.")

1268
00:50:03,697 --> 00:50:06,037
If you waste water when you wash up,

1269
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:07,467
you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.

1270
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:09,336
You are incorrect.

1271
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:10,707
(Team Handsome said exactly what Seung Ho said.)

1272
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,938
A triangle.

1273
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,347
- What? A triangle?
- A triangle?

1274
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,646
What do you mean?

1275
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:16,946
Are you going to give us the half of the sticker?

1276
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,376
Cut the sticker in the shape of a triangle, then.

1277
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:20,646
You got, "If you waste water,"

1278
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:21,887
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife" right.

1279
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,017
(If you waste water, you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.)

1280
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:25,418
Think of the first part again.

1281
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,228
"When you wash nhot?"

1282
00:50:27,288 --> 00:50:29,357
Maybe it's not wash up?

1283
00:50:29,388 --> 00:50:32,727
We said, "If you waste water so much."

1284
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:34,268
Instead of saying, "If you waste water when you wash up."

1285
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:37,168
(This is also in the same pattern as Team Guys.)

1286
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:39,598
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

1287
00:50:39,638 --> 00:50:40,808
"When you wash up."

1288
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:43,308
It's not "When you wash up," then.

1289
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:44,776
We'll hear it again.

1290
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:46,308
(Team Guys plays it infinitely too.)

1291
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:47,847
(If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot, )

1292
00:50:47,848 --> 00:50:49,046
(you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.)

1293
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,446
(If you waste water when you wash your face, )

1294
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,848
(you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.)

1295
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:53,947
When you wash nhot...

1296
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:56,118
- When you wash...
- When you wash nhot.

1297
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:58,057
When you wash the oar?

1298
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,157
- The oar?
- But the oar is...

1299
00:50:59,158 --> 00:51:01,228
The oar sounds plausible because we're in the Ark.

1300
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:02,888
But it doesn't make sense.

1301
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,356
Then it's not "you."

1302
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:05,657
(When you wash your face)

1303
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:07,067
It's not "wash," isn't it?

1304
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,626
"When you wash nhot..."

1305
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:11,267
can't mean "when farming," can it?

1306
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,897
When washing rice?

1307
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:15,106
They shouldn't waste water...

1308
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:16,407
when washing hands.

1309
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:17,776
(When you wash your face)

1310
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:18,907
When they wash their face.

1311
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,977
(When you wash your face)

1312
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,208
It's when washing something.

1313
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:25,248
When washing their face.

1314
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:27,586
But it doesn't sound right.

1315
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:28,646
(But it doesn't sound right.)

1316
00:51:28,647 --> 00:51:29,688
(When you wash your face)

1317
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:31,957
It's something that requires lots of water.

1318
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,018
Washing dishes?

1319
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,526
- When washing nhot.
- When washing nhot.

1320
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,527
- Maybe it's brassware?
- Exactly.

1321
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:37,896
I thought of it too. "Washing nhot..."

1322
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:40,097
It's either washing dishes or washing their bodies.

1323
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:43,196
They won't scold when washing their faces.

1324
00:51:43,197 --> 00:51:45,038
But when they do the dishes,

1325
00:51:45,098 --> 00:51:46,598
they would tell them to save water.

1326
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:49,337
- So it means brassware.
- Yes.

1327
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:51,336
- That's it. We don't know anymore.
- When washing brassware...

1328
00:51:51,337 --> 00:51:52,736
- We'll go with "Washing dishes." - When doing the dishes.

1329
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:54,807
If you waste water when doing the dishes,

1330
00:51:54,808 --> 00:51:56,877
you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.

1331
00:51:57,877 --> 00:51:59,117
Brassware is the only way to go.

1332
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:00,288
No.

1333
00:52:01,217 --> 00:52:04,017
(Team Guys fails to occupy Bangju Church too.)

1334
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:06,387
- Will you tell us the answer?
- Yes.

1335
00:52:06,388 --> 00:52:07,787
(Will you tell us the answer?)

1336
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:08,856
The answer is,

1337
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:10,526
"If you waste water when you wash your face,"

1338
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,657
I was right.

1339
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,927
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

1340
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,368
Does "nhot" mean washing your face?

1341
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,767
It means the face.

1342
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:17,966
Like the face.

1343
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,337
- When washing your face...
- Yes.

1344
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:20,908
(Sighing)

1345
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,607
We had it before.

1346
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:29,078
But isn't she being so cruel?

1347
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,776
Why does she yell for washing some faces?

1348
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:32,347
(Why does she scold when one's washing their face?)

1349
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,447
Right?

1350
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,717
We were really close.

1351
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:39,117
Let's go. We should hurry.

1352
00:52:39,118 --> 00:52:40,728
You shouldn't have a mental breakdown.

1353
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:43,458
We'll win when we get one quiz right.

1354
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,658
Or will it be a tie?

1355
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,327
That was the same thing, tough.

1356
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:50,566
- Washing face and wash up.
- When washing your face...

1357
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,598
(From now on, save water when you wash your face.)

1358
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,836
- It was close.
- This place is really good.

1359
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,438
See? It was on "Food Travel."

1360
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,606
Let's quickly grab a bowl each.

1361
00:52:58,607 --> 00:52:59,637
- The sun is going down.
- Let's go.

1362
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:00,707
(Let's grab 1 serving each and go.)

1363
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,708
(V Garden)

1364
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:05,547
(Sinhyo-dong, Seogwipo-si: Momguk)

1365
00:53:05,777 --> 00:53:07,748
What exactly is momguk?

1366
00:53:07,987 --> 00:53:10,716
We simmer pig bones for six hours.

1367
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:13,687
We add gulfweed, which is called "molmang" here.

1368
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:14,688
- "Molmang." - Yes.

1369
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:16,157
- We also add dried radish leaves.
- It's gulfweed.

1370
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:19,696
We also add buckwheat powder to make it.

1371
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,498
- You should add some chili.
- Ma'am.

1372
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:23,767
I want to play something for you.

1373
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:24,768
Okay. What is it?

1374
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,696
- Are you from Jeju Island?
- Yes.

1375
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:28,437
- You're from here.
- Will you tell us what it says?

1376
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,438
Okay. What is it?

1377
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,776
(Checking the controversial quiz from the Bangju Church...)

1378
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:33,506
(with a local from Jeju Island.)

1379
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:38,047
If you use lots of water when you wash your face...

1380
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:40,446
(The controversy dies down at once.)

1381
00:53:40,447 --> 00:53:42,287
- In the afterlife...
- This is...

1382
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:44,418
To stop the controversy,

1383
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,987
they planted her here.

1384
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:48,527
How could we? You called this restaurant yourself.

1385
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:50,757
How could she say, "When you wash your face" at once?

1386
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,327
- She can understand the dialect.
- Yes.

1387
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:56,228
(The controversy ends here.)

1388
00:53:57,098 --> 00:53:59,868
This is momguk. Right. I see gulfweed in here.

1389
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,736
It's like seaweed soup made with pork bone broth.

1390
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:05,276
But it has hijiki-looking thing in it.

1391
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:06,606
It tastes like seaweed soup.

1392
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:08,677
The seaweed soup with rich bone broth.

1393
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,376
It's good.

1394
00:54:11,377 --> 00:54:13,377
I was full, but I keep eating.

1395
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:15,288
It's good. It'll be better if I put these in.

1396
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,087
You have to put them in to make it spicier.

1397
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:24,026
It's tasty.

1398
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,498
(It's sad to have just one bowl.)

1399
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:30,197
I think it'll be a great remedy for the cold.

1400
00:54:30,598 --> 00:54:32,138
I feel like I'm getting healthier.

1401
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:34,467
It's hearty.

1402
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:37,078
- We have to hurry.
- Okay. I'll hurry.

1403
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:40,137
We still have the hope for a turnaround.

1404
00:54:40,138 --> 00:54:41,176
That's right.

1405
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,177
(The moment for a turnaround is close.)

1406
00:54:45,817 --> 00:54:48,847
(Drinking out of the bowl)

1407
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:51,257
- Seok Jin, you eat well.
- It's good.

1408
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:53,958
(Scraping)

1409
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,256
Okay. That was a good meal.

1410
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:59,026
Let's go for it at the World Cup Stadium.

1411
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:00,767
- Seok Jin will have his victory.
- Yes,

1412
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:01,796
- We'll go back to Seoul.
- Yes.

1413
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:03,497
- Team Guys will carry the rocks.
- Good.

1414
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:04,537
- Got it?
- Yes.

1415
00:55:04,538 --> 00:55:05,796
- Was the meal good?
- Yes, it was.

1416
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:06,867
- Should we win?
- Yes.

1417
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:08,137
Let's chant. One, two, three.

1418
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,307
- Handsome.
- Handsome.

1419
00:55:09,308 --> 00:55:10,908
Let's go. Quickly.

1420
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:13,376
It's the stadium of victory, everyone!

1421
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:14,578
(Team Guys heads to the World Cup Stadium.)

1422
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,477
Korea

1423
00:55:17,478 --> 00:55:19,776
(The will to turn over the game is on fire.)

1424
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:21,188
- Korea - Handsome

1425
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:24,487
- Handsome - Handsome

1426
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:26,558
(Singing)

1427
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:29,127
We're excited!

1428
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:32,728
- We'll go on a sacred mode.
- On a sacred mode.

1429
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:36,327
This is by Jo Sumi, isn't it?

1430
00:55:36,328 --> 00:55:37,438
- Yes.
- Jo Sumi.

1431
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:38,797
Let's be on a serious mode.

1432
00:55:39,237 --> 00:55:40,466
It gives me goosebumps.

1433
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:41,836
(The dream will come true.)

1434
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:43,466
(The 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup...)

1435
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:47,007
(shook the history of Korea.)

1436
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:50,876
(Just like that moment when we made the dream come true...)

1437
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:53,277
(after the whole country became one, )

1438
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:58,357
(will Team Handsome's dream come true today?)

1439
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:00,018
This is the last battleground.

1440
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:01,727
We have to occupy this spot.

1441
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:04,526
If we occupy this spot, the victory is ours.

1442
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,796
I trust our leader.

1443
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,566
- I trust him too.
- No.

1444
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,966
- Now you call me a leader.
- Our leader.

1445
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:10,868
- We do trust you.
- Sir.

1446
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,396
- Hello.
- Hello.

1447
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:14,137
- Gosh. Congratulations.
- Yes.

1448
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:15,707
- Gosh.
- Sir.

1449
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:18,808
I think this will be the last architecture of the day.

1450
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:22,447
Is there a special feature of the World Cup Stadium?

1451
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:25,046
When you look, what do you see?

1452
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:26,477
- Hareubang.
- Dol hareubang.

1453
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:28,046
(Dol hareubang are standing in line.)

1454
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:29,317
They look like Dong Hyun.

1455
00:56:30,118 --> 00:56:31,257
They are dol hareubang.

1456
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,717
- There are 11 of them.
- Is there a reason for it?

1457
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:36,058
- In soccer, 11 players play.
- There are 11 soccer players.

1458
00:56:36,658 --> 00:56:38,328
So, there are 11 dol hareubang.

1459
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:40,196
Such a thing is applied well all around.

1460
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,867
There are many fun elements.

1461
00:56:41,868 --> 00:56:43,727
- Should I explain it on the way?
- Let's go inside.

1462
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:45,098
Let's go closer to it.

1463
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:48,607
There are 11 of them to represent soccer players.

1464
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:51,407
The way to the entrance is quite nice, isn't it?

1465
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,408
Yes.

1466
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,446
There are two big structures...

1467
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:56,547
- in front of you.
- Yes.

1468
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,716
On Jeju Island,

1469
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:00,046
we have something called jeongnang.

1470
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,317
- Jeongnang?
- Jeongnang.

1471
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:03,248
It's the gate.

1472
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,257
- Right. There are holes.
- I see. That's the way in.

1473
00:57:05,418 --> 00:57:07,117
- There are three holes.
- Yes.

1474
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:09,026
They are to stick the sticks in.

1475
00:57:09,027 --> 00:57:10,287
Each stick has a meaning, right?

1476
00:57:10,288 --> 00:57:11,626
- Yes. To show you're home or not.
- It has a meaning.

1477
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:13,057
Yes. It has a meaning.

1478
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,168
- Right.
- Yes.

1479
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:19,368
When you head this way, we can enter the stadium.

1480
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:21,807
When we enter a stadium,

1481
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:24,807
we usually go inside a building and walk round and round...

1482
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,537
- to reach the field.
- Yes.

1483
00:57:26,538 --> 00:57:29,647
But here, you can see it as soon as you enter.

1484
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:32,046
- It's pretty.
- That's what's nice about it.

1485
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,316
It's so pretty.

1486
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:34,887
(The soccer field unfolds as soon as they pass the entrance.)

1487
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:36,086
Isn't it so unique?

1488
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:37,388
It's so big, by the way.

1489
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:40,086
Imagine the game with tens of thousands of people.

1490
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:43,257
Imagine yourself watching a final goal of the World Cup here.

1491
00:57:44,158 --> 00:57:45,227
- Gosh.
- That would be amazing.

1492
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,856
Shall we walk down there?

1493
00:57:46,857 --> 00:57:47,897
- I'd love that.
- Sounds good.

1494
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,768
- What's unique here is...
- Yes.

1495
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,438
That they dug the ground 14m-deep.

1496
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:55,167
- They dug the ground?
- It's usually on the ground.

1497
00:57:55,168 --> 00:57:56,707
- But they dug it.
- They dug it.

1498
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,537
There are some reasons behind it.

1499
00:57:58,538 --> 00:58:00,176
First, it's in the way of the wind.

1500
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,848
The storm would hit here first.

1501
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,776
So they went beneath the ground...

1502
00:58:03,777 --> 00:58:06,876
to be less affected by the wind.

1503
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:08,247
(It represents the crater on oreum, the mountains, )

1504
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:09,646
(while getting less affected by the wind.)

1505
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:13,716
While digging the ground, they got the slope naturally,

1506
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:15,756
so they could save the construction fee.

1507
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,526
- That's right.
- Because they get the slope.

1508
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,356
- Yes.
- You can dig at a slanted angle.

1509
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:22,196
It's pretty because they dug the ground to build it.

1510
00:58:22,197 --> 00:58:24,497
- Nothing obstructs the view.
- It was a great move.

1511
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:27,767
You have to be extra careful when building a stadium...

1512
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:30,037
because a crowd comes in and out at once.

1513
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:31,877
- Right.
- An accident can occur.

1514
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:34,946
What's great about this place is that it's a short walk...

1515
00:58:34,947 --> 00:58:36,308
to go in and out of the stadium at once.

1516
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:37,617
- The gates are right behind.
- They can get out right away.

1517
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:38,618
- Yes.
- That's true.

1518
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,216
Generally, you have to go inside...

1519
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,586
and go through the building to leave the stadium,

1520
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:45,057
which can cause congestion and accidents.

1521
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:46,187
It's hard to find ways too.

1522
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:48,587
In that sense, it has great strength.

1523
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:52,696
Also, those are the most beautiful part of the stadium.

1524
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,168
It's a membrane-structure stadium.

1525
00:58:54,427 --> 00:58:57,268
As it's a membrane structure, it feels light.

1526
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,566
Usually, there are columns in the stadium...

1527
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:02,168
- that obstruct the view.
- Right.

1528
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:04,077
The poles are placed outside here.

1529
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:06,207
So, you get the open view.

1530
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:09,876
How wonderful is it to watch a game while watching the sea?

1531
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:11,317
(You see Mount Halla in the North while the sea unfolds in the South.)

1532
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:15,546
The sun is set. That's the last sunset.

1533
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:17,288
- There's a sunset.
- Yes. The sun is setting.

1534
00:59:18,118 --> 00:59:22,157
Personally, I think this is the most beautiful stadium.

1535
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,228
I see.

1536
00:59:24,158 --> 00:59:28,067
(From the entrance and all throughout the stadium, )

1537
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:32,566
(it embraces the features of Jeju Island...)

1538
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:34,837
(and you can enjoy nature here at the World Cup Stadium.)

1539
00:59:38,478 --> 00:59:39,877
These soccer cleats are nice.

1540
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,777
- Shall we?
- Okay. Let's go.

1541
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:44,518
What an honor.

1542
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,748
It's such a huge honor.

1543
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,017
The players go up like this.

1544
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:51,216
(They enter like the players.)

1545
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:52,418
That must feel so nervous.

1546
00:59:53,788 --> 00:59:56,658
They do something like this and follow their routines.

1547
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:58,297
Gosh. Look at the grass.

1548
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:01,497
Can we step on it?

1549
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:02,728
- We're wearing cleats.
- Here?

1550
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:05,196
- This is what it feels like.
- Is it all right?

1551
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:07,066
(They step on the green grass that holds players' sweat and breath.)

1552
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:08,107
It's natural grass.

1553
01:00:09,168 --> 01:00:10,268
It's crazy.

1554
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:12,107
The natural grass feels different.

1555
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:14,478
Hear how it echoes.

1556
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,677
(Hey.)

1557
01:00:16,507 --> 01:00:17,677
It does have an echo.

1558
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:20,047
(It's interesting.)

1559
01:00:20,377 --> 01:00:22,688
How is it different from the UFC cage?

1560
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:24,086
It's not this big.

1561
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,557
Aren't they closer to the audience?

1562
01:00:25,558 --> 01:00:27,657
When you enter it, you can see the audience like this.

1563
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:28,687
- Like this?
- Yes.

1564
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:30,857
What is the maximum number of people you played in front of?

1565
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:33,426
- About 20,000 to 30,000?
- Gosh.

1566
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:34,997
You were naked with the gloves on in front of 20,000 to 30,000 people?

1567
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,397
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1568
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:39,768
Jin, what was the largest audience number you sang for?

1569
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:42,038
I think it was around 65,000 people.

1570
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:43,637
It's either 55,000 or 65,000.

1571
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:45,077
- I don't remember it exactly.
- It's twice as many.

1572
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:46,407
The whole 65,000 people...

1573
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:48,577
- are the fans of BTS.
- That's right.

1574
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:49,946
They were there just to see you.

1575
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:52,748
You have to overcome the shouts from such a crowd.

1576
01:00:53,118 --> 01:00:55,347
Right. You can hear them scream through the in-ear monitor.

1577
01:00:55,348 --> 01:00:56,447
That must be confusing.

1578
01:00:56,817 --> 01:00:58,987
So, we increase the volume of the in-ear monitor to hear.

1579
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:02,828
When I go back home after the concert,

1580
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:05,756
- I can hear a buzz.
- You get tinnitus.

1581
01:01:05,757 --> 01:01:06,827
It keeps beeping.

1582
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:08,668
I also hear a beeping sound after getting knocked out.

1583
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,767
- When they hit me hard on the ears, - Really?

1584
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,437
I can hear a beeping sound.

1585
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:17,138
For giving us the honor...

1586
01:01:17,538 --> 01:01:18,736
to enter the World Cup Stadium,

1587
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:20,606
- I want to thank you.
- Thank you.

1588
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:22,807
- It's an honor.
- Give us the quiz.

1589
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:23,847
(Time for Quiz)

1590
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,546
It has been 22 years...

1591
01:01:25,547 --> 01:01:27,446
since the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup was held.

1592
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:28,447
Yes.

1593
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,617
At the time, Korea finished...

1594
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:32,158
fourth in the game...

1595
01:01:32,257 --> 01:01:34,157
after playing a total of seven games.

1596
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,188
That's right.

1597
01:01:35,427 --> 01:01:37,356
Please say the name of the seven countries...

1598
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:39,626
we played against in chronological order...

1599
01:01:39,627 --> 01:01:41,368
from the preliminary rounds.

1600
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:42,966
How do we know the order?

1601
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:44,638
(It was more than 20 years ago.)

1602
01:01:44,897 --> 01:01:46,196
(Yi Kyung writes it down without hesitation.)

1603
01:01:46,197 --> 01:01:47,638
I have no idea.

1604
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:49,867
Do you know the order for the preliminary rounds? Here.

1605
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:50,937
Are you sure about the preliminary rounds?

1606
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:52,007
- Let me see.
- Like this.

1607
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,538
Are you sure about the preliminary rounds?

1608
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,247
I know for sure from the round of 16 and onward.

1609
01:01:57,248 --> 01:01:59,018
Italy, Spain.

1610
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,017
- The order is important.
- This is right.

1611
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,087
Is it? Didn't we play against the US first?

1612
01:02:04,357 --> 01:02:05,917
(If they get it right, they can turn over the game.)

1613
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:07,257
It might be the US.

1614
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,158
During the game against the US,

1615
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,397
Hwang Sun Hong and Yoo Sang Chul scored, right?

1616
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:15,697
Yoo Sang Chul made a mid-range goal that went in through the left side.

1617
01:02:15,868 --> 01:02:17,566
Hwang Sun Hong got an assist from Lee Eul Yong...

1618
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,667
- and kicked it nonstop.
- Yes. The ball was rolling.

1619
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:21,066
He had a goal ceremony like this.

1620
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,137
Was that against the US?

1621
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,566
I just need to know if it was against the US or Poland.

1622
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:24,977
- Exactly.
- That was the first game.

1623
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:26,807
I was young back then,

1624
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:28,877
so the US felt so grand to me.

1625
01:02:29,107 --> 01:02:33,117
So, I thought, "How on earth can we beat the US team?"

1626
01:02:33,118 --> 01:02:36,417
But I think we had a game prior to that.

1627
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:37,418
- A game prior to that?
- Yes.

1628
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:38,457
The US game was first?

1629
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,417
- No. The US game came after.
- Not the US.

1630
01:02:40,418 --> 01:02:42,126
- After the game against Poland?
- It must be the second game.

1631
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:43,288
That means Poland,

1632
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:45,196
- the US, - I saw it accidentally.

1633
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:47,026
Portugal, Round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals,

1634
01:02:47,027 --> 01:02:48,227
- and third-place match?
- That's right.

1635
01:02:48,228 --> 01:02:50,067
Just say it as you remember it.

1636
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:51,836
I'll tell you the answer.

1637
01:02:51,837 --> 01:02:52,937
Gosh. Please.

1638
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:54,207
- Our meeting is over.
- Okay.

1639
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,767
- Please.
- Even if you get it wrong,

1640
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:58,506
- I won't blame you at all.
- Don't blame me.

1641
01:02:58,507 --> 01:02:59,977
- You did all the work.
- Yes.

1642
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:01,547
I did contribute from the round of 16.

1643
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:05,447
I'll give you the answer.

1644
01:03:06,118 --> 01:03:08,288
During the 2002 international soccer games...

1645
01:03:08,587 --> 01:03:10,716
The first game was against Poland.

1646
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:12,486
The second game was against the US.

1647
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:14,426
The third game was against Portugal.

1648
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:16,356
That way, Korea advanced to the round of 16.

1649
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,796
Then came Italy. Ahn Jung Hwan scored a goal.

1650
01:03:18,797 --> 01:03:19,997
Then came Spain. There was a kickoff.

1651
01:03:19,998 --> 01:03:22,267
- We lost to Germany.
- What will we do if we're wrong?

1652
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:24,197
The 3d and 4th places were decided by a game against Türkiye.

1653
01:03:24,297 --> 01:03:27,336
In total, Korea played against seven countries.

1654
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,368
That's all.

1655
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:31,077
- The order you've given...
- Please.

1656
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:36,106
(Poland, the US, Portugal, Italy, )

1657
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:40,677
(Spain, Germany, Türkiye)

1658
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:42,847
(Current time: 6pm, Meanwhile, Team Guys)

1659
01:03:42,848 --> 01:03:44,188
Washing the face.

1660
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:46,857
- No matter how much I think...
- Seriously.

1661
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:48,527
We were so close.

1662
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:50,327
That's why we're having a mental breakdown.

1663
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:52,158
(They still can't get over the quiz about washing the face.)

1664
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:53,658
You know,

1665
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:55,828
we'll fight for one square in the end.

1666
01:03:56,368 --> 01:03:58,966
How far is Mokwoljae from here? Twenty-six minutes?

1667
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,098
It's basically the same.

1668
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,707
Then let's go to the World Cup Stadium.

1669
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,277
- Let's go there.
- If you sseumin water hayeong...

1670
01:04:05,578 --> 01:04:07,377
I had this thought.

1671
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:10,676
What if they didn't go to the World Cup Stadium...

1672
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:13,647
because they got the quiz wrong at the Bangju Church?

1673
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:15,018
Had they done that,

1674
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:17,856
we'll see them at the World Cup Stadium now.

1675
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:18,857
- Seriously.
- Yes.

1676
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:20,188
Then it's the worst for us.

1677
01:04:20,388 --> 01:04:22,087
It'll be over before we get a chance to try something.

1678
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,827
(Current time: 6:15pm)

1679
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:26,558
(The race ends at 7pm.)

1680
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:30,297
Sang Uk, please check how long it takes to get to Mokwoljae.

1681
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,368
- We never know.
- It takes 37 minutes.

1682
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:33,966
How much time remains?

1683
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:35,408
We arrive at the stadium at 6:19pm.

1684
01:04:35,507 --> 01:04:37,807
If we get there and make a U-turn,

1685
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:39,606
we'll be able to enter...

1686
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:42,207
the parking lot at 7pm...

1687
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,708
and solve the quiz.

1688
01:04:43,748 --> 01:04:45,046
It's okay. We can go there.

1689
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:49,018
(Team Guys arrives at the World Cup Stadium.)

1690
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:50,986
(At that moment)

1691
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,388
Team Handsome is...

1692
01:04:53,188 --> 01:04:54,788
inside the World Cup Stadium.

1693
01:04:55,987 --> 01:04:56,987
They're there.

1694
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:58,228
That's...

1695
01:04:58,498 --> 01:05:00,997
- Let's go to Mokwoljae.
- Let's go right away.

1696
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:03,466
We shouldn't be here to wait and see if they get the quiz wrong.

1697
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,437
We'll get there on time if we leave for Mokwoljae now.

1698
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:06,937
If we hadn't made that prediction...

1699
01:05:06,938 --> 01:05:07,966
(They hurriedly turn the car toward Mokwoljae.)

1700
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:09,067
It would've been bad.

1701
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:12,578
We need to stay alert until the end.

1702
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:13,937
Seriously.

1703
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:14,947
(Only 40 minutes remain until the end of the race.)

1704
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,817
(Will Team Guys arrive at Mokwoljae on time?)

1705
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:21,617
In total, Korea played against...

1706
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:23,546
seven countries. That's all.

1707
01:05:23,547 --> 01:05:24,716
(Poland, the US, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Germany, Türkiye)

1708
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:25,958
The order you've given...

1709
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:28,027
is correct.

1710
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:35,296
(They give a winning ceremony.)

1711
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:36,498
- It's correct.
- We did it.

1712
01:05:37,197 --> 01:05:38,466
Yi Kyung.

1713
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,667
- Yi Kyung, it was in your memory.
- Seriously.

1714
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:41,736
I remember.

1715
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,767
"The first game against Poland begins now."

1716
01:05:43,768 --> 01:05:45,276
- Go away.
- Seriously.

1717
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:46,776
- Dong Hyun.
- "The first game begins now."

1718
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,077
Stop riding on his coattail.

1719
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:49,347
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

1720
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:51,276
- Stop it.
- The Korean players wore red.

1721
01:05:51,277 --> 01:05:53,018
Of course. They're the Red Devils.

1722
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:54,248
Stop it.

1723
01:05:54,447 --> 01:05:57,447
- World Cup Stadium.
- World Cup Stadium.

1724
01:05:58,257 --> 01:06:01,188
(Beophwan-dong, Seogwipo-si: World Cup Stadium)

1725
01:06:01,828 --> 01:06:03,126
(Cuckoo)

1726
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:04,356
They got it right.

1727
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:05,598
(World Cup Stadium)

1728
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,397
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1729
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:09,296
We fought hard.

1730
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:11,167
(The current score is 4 to 3.)

1731
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:15,836
I can just imagine Dong Hyun's proud facial expression.

1732
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:17,007
It makes me so angry.

1733
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,737
They must be so excited.

1734
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,777
Suddenly, I want to make it a tie.

1735
01:06:23,377 --> 01:06:25,248
I want to make it a tie.

1736
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,078
- Seriously.
- Let's make it a tie.

1737
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:28,848
Mokwoljae.

1738
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:31,617
We'll have a chance to answer the question.

1739
01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:33,217
Thank goodness that we'll have a chance.

1740
01:06:33,587 --> 01:06:35,457
This is a miracle, to be honest.

1741
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,627
You're right.

1742
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,228
We have one bullet left.

1743
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,427
That's right.

1744
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:41,828
It's the final kickoff and the fifth kicker is up.

1745
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:43,667
We're the only ones left. It's our turn.

1746
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,466
The opposing team's fifth kicker...

1747
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:46,736
- He scored a goal.
- Yes.

1748
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,066
It's a matter of whether or not...

1749
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,737
we'll get extra time.

1750
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:51,776
(Like a soccer player who faces the last penalty kick)

1751
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:53,006
It's the last shot.

1752
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:54,078
(Like a soccer player who faces the last penalty kick)

1753
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:56,146
This will determine the winner.

1754
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:58,447
(They're headed to Mokwoljae.)

1755
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:02,147
- Do you see the word "Stop?" - Stop.

1756
01:07:02,587 --> 01:07:04,586
We're on our way to stop them.

1757
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,587
(A road sign that shows their wish welcomes Team Guys.)

1758
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,158
As a center back,

1759
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,788
I'm very good at stopping an opponent's attack.

1760
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:10,958
Good.

1761
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,127
We can get it right.

1762
01:07:13,527 --> 01:07:14,827
(Did Team Guys arrive on time?)

1763
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:15,927
We're here.

1764
01:07:17,427 --> 01:07:19,197
- Seriously.
- Five minutes remain.

1765
01:07:20,598 --> 01:07:22,967
This is incredible. We made it.

1766
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:24,537
Okay.

1767
01:07:24,538 --> 01:07:26,438
(Team Guys gets a chance to give the last quiz a try.)

1768
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,078
- Gosh.
- This place is nice.

1769
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,308
Gosh, this place...

1770
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,347
This place is so pretty.

1771
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,947
(Mokwoljae)

1772
01:07:35,647 --> 01:07:38,517
(An office that contains the scenery of Jeju and hanok)

1773
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:39,658
This place is cool.

1774
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,298
(It's located in the deep mountains of Hangyeong-myeon, Jeju.)

1775
01:07:50,128 --> 01:07:51,396
(There are orchards...)

1776
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:52,937
(and Gotjawal around the building.)

1777
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:56,508
(It's a place that contains the scenery of Jeju.)

1778
01:07:57,878 --> 01:08:00,477
(2023 Korea Wood Design Awards)

1779
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:05,078
(What kind of a place is Mokwoljae?)

1780
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,147
As soon as you enter...

1781
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:10,087
Hello.

1782
01:08:10,088 --> 01:08:11,457
- Hello.
- Hello.

1783
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,088
- Hello.
- Hello.

1784
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:14,658
What? You aren't Ms. Noh.

1785
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:16,258
- Hello.
- Hello.

1786
01:08:16,828 --> 01:08:17,997
I guess she left...

1787
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:19,498
to catch her flight.

1788
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:22,967
I'm Architect Lee Chang Kyu.

1789
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:25,167
I'm Architect Kang Jung Yoon.

1790
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:26,467
- Are you guys married?
- Yes, we are.

1791
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:29,167
Many architects marry each other.

1792
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:32,038
- Yes.
- We don't get much time to date.

1793
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:34,377
(There are many architects who marry each other.)

1794
01:08:34,378 --> 01:08:35,747
- I see.
- Yes.

1795
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:38,346
This place is called Cheongsu Mokwoljae.

1796
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,748
It's a place we use as a design office.

1797
01:08:42,548 --> 01:08:44,787
Mokwoljae is a house that's a modern take...

1798
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:47,158
on Jeju's house and hanok.

1799
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:49,056
(Nodding)

1800
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:52,356
You entered through an alley.

1801
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:54,396
It's the Olle Trail in Jeju's house.

1802
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:57,097
(The entrance of the office has Jeju's traditional structure.)

1803
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:58,468
(They learned about the Olle Trail at the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.)

1804
01:08:58,469 --> 01:08:59,937
- That's right.
- The Olle Trail.

1805
01:08:59,998 --> 01:09:04,168
The house is situated like a big, mieum-shaped hanok.

1806
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,106
The surrounding structures block the wind.

1807
01:09:07,107 --> 01:09:09,776
Thus, the yard is warm.

1808
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:13,377
- This is the yard.
- Yes.

1809
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:14,686
(A garden is situated at the center.)

1810
01:09:14,687 --> 01:09:17,047
When you enter the yard of a hanok,

1811
01:09:17,048 --> 01:09:19,386
what do you see first?

1812
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:20,917
- Do you remember?
- The yard of a hanok?

1813
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:22,686
The structure that looks like this.

1814
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:23,726
- That's right.
- Maru.

1815
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,827
- Maru.
- Daecheong maru. That's right.

1816
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,497
When you enter from the yard,

1817
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,328
there's a space like that.

1818
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:36,267
(In hanok, you see daecheong first.)

1819
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:38,476
One, two, three.

1820
01:09:38,477 --> 01:09:41,077
We planned the daecheong with three compartments.

1821
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:44,817
When the blinds are up, the scenery looks like it's framed.

1822
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:46,316
(When the blinds are down)

1823
01:09:46,317 --> 01:09:49,548
When the blinds are down, light enters in a pretty way.

1824
01:09:51,357 --> 01:09:53,316
The scenery you see...

1825
01:09:53,317 --> 01:09:55,726
from the yard to daecheong and what lies beyond...

1826
01:09:55,727 --> 01:09:56,958
is pretty nice.

1827
01:09:57,088 --> 01:10:00,328
(The entering space shows the pride of Mokwoljae.)

1828
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:02,127
(Impressed)

1829
01:10:02,128 --> 01:10:04,026
Shall we move to the resting area?

1830
01:10:04,027 --> 01:10:05,097
- Okay.
- Okay.

1831
01:10:06,538 --> 01:10:09,468
(The next area follows.)

1832
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,077
We use this space...

1833
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:16,678
as the resting area.

1834
01:10:16,977 --> 01:10:18,476
The difference in the level...

1835
01:10:18,477 --> 01:10:19,946
- is fascinating, right?
- Yes.

1836
01:10:19,947 --> 01:10:22,217
The scenery you see from the high level,

1837
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,547
the scenery you see from the low level,

1838
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:26,158
and the scenery you see sitting down are all different.

1839
01:10:27,317 --> 01:10:29,287
Although the building is small,

1840
01:10:29,288 --> 01:10:32,158
it offers a variety. There's richness to it.

1841
01:10:33,057 --> 01:10:35,328
It'll be incredible to sit here during the day.

1842
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:39,467
During the day, you can see the two forests.

1843
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,038
(Two forests?)

1844
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:44,066
(Mokwoljae is located between the two gotjawals.)

1845
01:10:44,067 --> 01:10:45,936
When we first built this,

1846
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:49,447
we thought about which house would suit the forests.

1847
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,617
We thought it'd be nice...

1848
01:10:51,618 --> 01:10:55,186
if the building became a part of the background...

1849
01:10:55,187 --> 01:10:56,717
without standing out.

1850
01:10:56,718 --> 01:10:59,957
So we used wood for the outside since it suited the forests.

1851
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,957
It's painted black,

1852
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,457
so the outside of the building is quite simple.

1853
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:05,727
(The outside of Mokwoljae is black.)

1854
01:11:07,027 --> 01:11:09,596
It's so nice. We should've come here during the day.

1855
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:12,838
The resting area really suits the purpose.

1856
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:15,908
The areas are connected in the mieum shape.

1857
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:19,837
What? I've seen this somewhere.

1858
01:11:19,838 --> 01:11:22,477
- It's the elevated maru of hanok.
- Yes.

1859
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:24,377
There's the elevated maru...

1860
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:25,717
- like a toetmaru.
- A toetmaru.

1861
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,917
You can sit there.

1862
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:30,386
You can lie down and read a book in the sunlight.

1863
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,117
Yes. We can also talk.

1864
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:33,717
- It's where we relax.
- Seriously.

1865
01:11:33,718 --> 01:11:34,987
(It's where they can catch a break between work.)

1866
01:11:35,027 --> 01:11:37,928
If you look over here, the ceiling is very high.

1867
01:11:38,197 --> 01:11:39,298
(My goodness)

1868
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:42,397
What comes to mind When you look at this?

1869
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,396
Isn't it a crossbeam?

1870
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:45,636
That's right.

1871
01:11:45,637 --> 01:11:47,566
- You see it in hanok.
- Yes.

1872
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:49,467
In hanok, there are columns.

1873
01:11:49,468 --> 01:11:52,136
A crossbeam holds the columns in place.

1874
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:54,846
It's a very stable structure.

1875
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:58,846
So it doesn't only serve a design purpose.

1876
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,276
- It actually has that function.
- Yes.

1877
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:03,386
It holds the two walls in place safely.

1878
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,587
It also supports the ceiling. Yes.

1879
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:06,758
(The structure uses the shape and function of a crossbeam.)

1880
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:08,187
It's cool.

1881
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:10,687
It's the house I want to live in.

1882
01:12:11,897 --> 01:12:14,128
- We enjoyed looking around.
- Thank you so much.

1883
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:16,067
Thank you.

1884
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,196
- Shall we do a cheer?
- Okay.

1885
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:19,537
Send it up.

1886
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:21,298
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1887
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:22,607
Let's keep Dong Hyun here.

1888
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:25,636
(Hangyeong-myeon, Jeju: Mokwoljae)

1889
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:26,807
It's the last quiz of the day.

1890
01:12:27,338 --> 01:12:29,507
When a house is built on the land, a best site has...

1891
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:32,217
a mountain in the back and a river in the front.

1892
01:12:32,218 --> 01:12:34,118
But it's a bit different on Jeju Island.

1893
01:12:34,218 --> 01:12:36,918
What kind of a site did people prefer?

1894
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:39,418
I was going to ask this question...

1895
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:42,057
to the architects earlier.

1896
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:43,428
On Jeju Island,

1897
01:12:44,387 --> 01:12:45,628
water is scarce...

1898
01:12:46,298 --> 01:12:47,557
and rocks are plenty.

1899
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:50,767
- Water is scarce.
- A flatland with a lot of soil.

1900
01:12:53,538 --> 01:12:55,636
Water is scarce.

1901
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,307
(Laughing)

1902
01:12:57,338 --> 01:12:59,037
You know, it might be right.

1903
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:01,647
Such a site is the best for building a house.

1904
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:02,977
Think about it.

1905
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:06,317
You wouldn't build a house by the sea when it's windy.

1906
01:13:06,347 --> 01:13:08,446
- We know that's wrong.
- It gets windy here.

1907
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:10,087
- We know that's wrong. But...
- Right.

1908
01:13:10,088 --> 01:13:11,686
You also can't go to the top of the mountain...

1909
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,856
since it's cold. That's wrong.

1910
01:13:12,857 --> 01:13:14,017
My guess is mountainside.

1911
01:13:14,218 --> 01:13:15,386
- Really?
- The middle of the mountain.

1912
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:16,827
That's right.

1913
01:13:16,828 --> 01:13:19,628
The middle of the mountain...

1914
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:21,097
where there's a forest.

1915
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:22,697
They'll want to block the wind.

1916
01:13:23,267 --> 01:13:25,597
I agree that they'll want to block the wind.

1917
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,968
A place where they can hide from the wind.

1918
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,508
While looking around this place,

1919
01:13:30,668 --> 01:13:32,407
we learned that gotjawal...

1920
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,908
referred to a forest.

1921
01:13:34,137 --> 01:13:35,507
Gotjawal is a forest.

1922
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:37,178
Houses usually aren't built at such a place.

1923
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:41,487
Did they build it here since they were on Jeju Island?

1924
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:45,118
- My goodness.
- I shouldn't have looked it up.

1925
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:47,087
I think you're right.

1926
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:48,386
- Let's just go with that.
- Okay.

1927
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,258
- If it's wrong, it can't be helped.
- That's right.

1928
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:52,227
A place where there are many trees...

1929
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:54,827
- to block the wind.
- A place where trees grow evenly.

1930
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:56,968
- A place where there are trees.
- A place where trees grow evenly.

1931
01:13:57,368 --> 01:14:01,038
A place where there's a forest to block the wind.

1932
01:14:01,097 --> 01:14:02,407
Yes. I think it's right.

1933
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:03,767
- Forest. Trees.
- Forest.

1934
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,637
It has to be about the wind.

1935
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,606
- Could it be wrong?
- We're set. The die is cast.

1936
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:10,947
- Let's see it.
- It's a miracle.

1937
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:16,017
(What will be the fate of Team Guys?)

1938
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,417
It's 7:19pm.

1939
01:14:18,418 --> 01:14:19,857
(Current time: 7:19pm, Team Handsome)

1940
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:22,227
Now, it's about 90...

1941
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,726
- It's 98 percent.
- It's 98 percent.

1942
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,828
Which member of that team will receive the penalty?

1943
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:29,127
- Wouldn't Sang Uk receive it?
- No.

1944
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:30,526
I think Sang Uk will survive again.

1945
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,197
- That's my guess as well.
- Sang Uk.

1946
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,067
- It's a 50-50 chance.
- Yes.

1947
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,537
"Let's do it again."

1948
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,137
(Cuckoo)

1949
01:14:39,977 --> 01:14:41,306
No. There's no way we heard that sound.

1950
01:14:41,307 --> 01:14:43,307
- Come on.
- There's no way.

1951
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:46,217
- There's no way we heard it.
- Seriously.

1952
01:14:46,218 --> 01:14:47,677
Dong Hyun was startled for real.

1953
01:14:47,678 --> 01:14:49,646
- Don't be like that.
- Dong Hyun...

1954
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:50,946
Dong Hyun was startled for real.

1955
01:14:50,947 --> 01:14:52,957
- Seriously.
- It seriously made me go, "What?"

1956
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,588
- Seriously.
- You made the same sound, right?

1957
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:55,857
What? I received a call.

1958
01:14:56,628 --> 01:14:58,258
Hello?

1959
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:00,957
- What?
- Cuckoo.

1960
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,226
What?

1961
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:03,397
Mokwoljae!

1962
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:07,967
Mokwoljae!

1963
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:09,908
(They hear the cuckoo over the phone.)

1964
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:11,507
I guess they got it right.

1965
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:12,707
Maybe they didn't get it right.

1966
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,507
- I don't think they got it right.
- They didn't get it right.

1967
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:15,577
(What happened?)

1968
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:16,646
What's going on?

1969
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:17,907
(What happened?)

1970
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:20,577
A place where there's a forest to block the wind.

1971
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:21,946
Yes. I think it's right.

1972
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:23,146
- Forest. Trees.
- Forest.

1973
01:15:23,147 --> 01:15:24,747
It has to be about the wind.

1974
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:25,986
- Could it be wrong?
- We're set. The die is cast.

1975
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:27,417
- Let's see it.
- It's a miracle.

1976
01:15:27,418 --> 01:15:29,075
(A place where there are many trees to block the wind)

1977
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:30,329
- Could it be wrong?
- We're set. The die is cast.

1978
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,730
- Let's see it.
- It's a miracle.

1979
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,119
- That's...
- Correct.

1980
01:15:34,336 --> 01:15:35,465
(Screaming)

1981
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:37,205
- We did it.
- Seriously.

1982
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:38,476
No one can leave.

1983
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:39,906
No one can leave.

1984
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:42,005
No one can leave, okay?

1985
01:15:42,006 --> 01:15:43,546
Tell them to stay put.

1986
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:46,175
It has always been windy on Jeju Island.

1987
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:47,816
A place where you can hide from the wind.

1988
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:51,147
It's usually a site that's concaved,

1989
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:53,487
a site that's surrounded by the trees as you said,

1990
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:56,625
or a site behind oreum. Such sites that are less windy...

1991
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:58,825
are considered good and preferred.

1992
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:00,027
(A good site lets you hide from the wind.)

1993
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:02,425
We made a miracle.

1994
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:03,766
It's like placing fourth at the international soccer games.

1995
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,097
- We made a miracle.
- Seriously.

1996
01:16:05,737 --> 01:16:07,767
- We did it.
- Let's go.

1997
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,666
- This is the beginning.
- They can't leave.

1998
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:11,237
No one can leave.

1999
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:13,676
(Cuckoo)

2000
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,376
Mokwoljae.

2001
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:16,875
What's that?

2002
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:18,045
Mokwoljae.

2003
01:16:18,046 --> 01:16:19,245
Did they go there?

2004
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:20,376
(They got the quiz right!)

2005
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:22,686
(Sighs fill Team Handsome's car.)

2006
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:24,017
No way.

2007
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:27,017
This is the worst.

2008
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:30,586
So we don't know what will happen.

2009
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:33,425
- This is impossible.
- They're impressive.

2010
01:16:33,426 --> 01:16:34,996
They really are impressive.

2011
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:37,197
How did they get it right?

2012
01:16:37,597 --> 01:16:39,237
I was too happy.

2013
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:41,237
It's okay.

2014
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:43,766
I want to say that.

2015
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:46,035
(Let's pick the person who'll receive the penalty.)

2016
01:16:46,036 --> 01:16:49,875
(Today's activity is building a stonewall.)

2017
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:52,447
The penalty of building a stonewall will be given...

2018
01:16:52,546 --> 01:16:53,846
to only one person.

2019
01:16:53,847 --> 01:16:55,316
- One?
- One?

2020
01:16:55,317 --> 01:16:56,716
One out of six?

2021
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,557
We'll use the fastest method,

2022
01:16:58,716 --> 01:17:00,085
ghost leg.

2023
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:01,186
Ghost leg?

2024
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:03,426
- Okay. Let's leave it to fate.
- The result will be so random.

2025
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:07,057
(Who will build the stonewall?)

2026
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:08,996
- Hey.
- Sang Uk.

2027
01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:10,526
We're neck-and-neck.

2028
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,995
- How did this happen?
- We don't have much time.

2029
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:14,066
(The rules of ghost leg)

2030
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:15,807
Pick a number.

2031
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,836
We'll go up from the penalty.

2032
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:23,776
Since we're further away, shall we pick the numbers first?

2033
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:26,517
Go ahead. Jin, pick a number first.

2034
01:17:26,546 --> 01:17:28,447
Okay. I'm number one.

2035
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:29,817
I'm number two.

2036
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,187
Then I'll be number three.

2037
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,616
I'm number four.

2038
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,526
- I'm number 5.
- I'm number 6.

2039
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:37,656
- Okay.
- We went in an order.

2040
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:39,056
- We went in an order.
- Let's go in an order.

2041
01:17:39,057 --> 01:17:40,296
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2042
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:41,597
Hold on.

2043
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:45,026
Don't move the screen so much. Show us the whole thing.

2044
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,567
Move back.

2045
01:17:46,637 --> 01:17:49,465
(They finish setting up with the perfect angle.)

2046
01:17:49,466 --> 01:17:52,106
There's no winning or losing. It's an individual match.

2047
01:17:52,107 --> 01:17:54,706
We worked hard all day long. How can it be chosen so easily?

2048
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:56,576
Let's start from the bottom.

2049
01:17:57,947 --> 01:18:02,116
(The ghost leg of fate reveals itself.)

2050
01:18:02,347 --> 01:18:05,856
(If they void the penalty once, )

2051
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:09,026
(they can go home.)

2052
01:18:09,027 --> 01:18:13,097
(Who will build the stonewall?)

2053
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:16,397
(The ghost leg of fate sets off.)

2054
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:19,597
(Focused)

2055
01:18:19,897 --> 01:18:22,835
(He goes up without hesitation.)

2056
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:25,806
(The result)

2057
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:27,176
Dong Hyun!

2058
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:31,205
Dong Hyun!

2059
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:35,046
(Overjoyed)

2060
01:18:36,616 --> 01:18:37,785
(What?)

2061
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:38,987
- Number three.
- What?

2062
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:40,356
Dong Hyun!

2063
01:18:40,357 --> 01:18:43,456
(Devastated)

2064
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:46,125
Nice.

2065
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:47,825
(Laughing)

2066
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:49,767
It's the best scenario.

2067
01:18:51,197 --> 01:18:53,396
(Team Guys is overjoyed.)

2068
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:54,465
Dong Hyun.

2069
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:57,005
(Jeju Island's penalty-taker, new)

2070
01:18:57,006 --> 01:18:58,535
I can't believe it.

2071
01:18:58,536 --> 01:18:59,675
(Team Handsome members can only console him.)

2072
01:18:59,676 --> 01:19:01,106
It aches my heart...

2073
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:03,307
that it's a member of my team, Dong Hyun.

2074
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:04,745
Whenever I lose in a game,

2075
01:19:04,746 --> 01:19:06,175
I can tell in advance.

2076
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:08,075
The moment I picked the number,

2077
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,245
I had a feeling that I'd get the penalty no matter what.

2078
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,285
(Dong Hyun has been chosen to build a stonewall.)

2079
01:19:12,286 --> 01:19:13,715
- Dong Hyun.
- It's too much.

2080
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:15,156
Dong Hyun, what will you do?

2081
01:19:15,157 --> 01:19:16,755
- Seriously.
- For two weeks,

2082
01:19:16,756 --> 01:19:19,426
Dong Hyun hoped that he wouldn't get the penalty today.

2083
01:19:19,456 --> 01:19:22,267
Don't you need to go and watch your son's performance tomorrow?

2084
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,866
- Tomorrow.
- It can't be helped.

2085
01:19:24,996 --> 01:19:26,596
I thought that we'd win.

2086
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:28,835
I happily messaged my wife that we'd win.

2087
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:31,006
- Shall I do it instead?
- No.

2088
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,575
Dong Hyun, shall I do it?

2089
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:34,236
No. I can't take up on that offer.

2090
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:35,477
- You have a schedule.
- It's okay.

2091
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:38,075
- It's okay.
- My goodness.

2092
01:19:38,076 --> 01:19:39,576
It's okay. It can't be helped.

2093
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:41,676
- It's me, Sang Uk.
- Okay.

2094
01:19:42,017 --> 01:19:44,686
If I can take the penalty instead...

2095
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:46,556
- It's okay. We talked it out.
- Yes.

2096
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:48,625
- It's too late. It's okay.
- He agreed to do it.

2097
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:50,085
- My heart aches.
- It's okay.

2098
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:51,557
My heart aches.

2099
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:54,897
How did this happen?

2100
01:19:55,126 --> 01:19:56,226
Let's hurry up and go.

2101
01:19:56,227 --> 01:19:57,965
Dong Hyun! Work hard!

2102
01:19:57,966 --> 01:19:59,166
Let's go.

2103
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:02,506
Since I'm here, I'll get some rest in the evening.

2104
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:04,737
Sleep well and begin working early in the morning.

2105
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:05,976
I'll give it a go.

2106
01:20:05,977 --> 01:20:07,836
I'll show the strength of a dad.

2107
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,146
- We'll look forward to that.
- I'll build a stonewall well.

2108
01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:12,545
Okay. I'll stay behind and build a stonewall well.

2109
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,375
- I'll return after I'm done.
- Okay.

2110
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,946
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2111
01:20:15,947 --> 01:20:17,245
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

2112
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:18,715
Let's be on the same team next time.

2113
01:20:18,716 --> 01:20:20,356
- Let's meet again if we can.
- Okay.

2114
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,085
- Let's take revenge.
- Let's do that.

2115
01:20:22,086 --> 01:20:23,226
(The night passes in Jeju.)

2116
01:20:23,227 --> 01:20:26,027
(The next morning)

2117
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:27,955
I'll think of it as a morning exercise.

2118
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:28,966
(Waheul Buckwheat Village, Jeju)

2119
01:20:29,126 --> 01:20:30,466
It's the morning CrossFit.

2120
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,067
Stonewall CrossFit.

2121
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:34,697
- Hello.
- Hello.

2122
01:20:34,866 --> 01:20:36,036
It's nice to meet you.

2123
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:39,476
I'm a stonemason who works on Jeju Island, Kang Tae Yang.

2124
01:20:39,477 --> 01:20:41,076
My goodness.

2125
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,407
What do you work on?

2126
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:45,006
To get the village listed as UNESCO's World Heritage Site,

2127
01:20:45,046 --> 01:20:48,716
I'm making a stonewall on the buckwheat field.

2128
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:50,415
You're building a stonewall...

2129
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:51,817
- to preserve the tradition.
- That's right.

2130
01:20:53,657 --> 01:20:56,057
- I'll use my muscles today.
- Thank you.

2131
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,726
(Building Jeju's stonewall)

2132
01:20:58,727 --> 01:21:00,125
What's this?

2133
01:21:00,126 --> 01:21:01,756
This is a chisel.

2134
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:06,535
- You make it pointy, right?
- Yes.

2135
01:21:06,536 --> 01:21:10,636
That way, the rock breaks when I hit it with a hammer.

2136
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:12,006
Gosh, what's this? The fire...

2137
01:21:12,437 --> 01:21:14,607
- It makes the fire stronger.
- Yes.

2138
01:21:15,206 --> 01:21:16,647
It's becoming flat.

2139
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:19,875
(The chisel takes shape as he hits it.)

2140
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:21,075
It's taking shape as I hit it.

2141
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,187
(The chisel takes shape as he hits it.)

2142
01:21:25,086 --> 01:21:27,255
Wouldn't it break if it's too sharp?

2143
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,085
That's right. It shouldn't be too thin.

2144
01:21:29,086 --> 01:21:31,126
Next comes this step.

2145
01:21:31,557 --> 01:21:33,826
This is how you do it. Stick it in.

2146
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:36,995
The end part should go in first.

2147
01:21:36,996 --> 01:21:38,526
- Okay.
- If you do that,

2148
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:41,196
- the color turns white.
- Yes.

2149
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,307
Put it in again.

2150
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:43,907
The color changes more.

2151
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:46,606
You adjust the strength of the metal...

2152
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:48,505
for the end of the chisel.

2153
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:49,646
- You repeat the process.
- Yes.

2154
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:51,176
Explain it to him.

2155
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:53,646
Are you someone who shouldn't be on the camera?

2156
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:55,075
(Taking leave)

2157
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,786
I can be on the camera.

2158
01:21:56,847 --> 01:21:58,387
But it'll be better to show the young ones.

2159
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,085
(It gets handed to the young ones.)

2160
01:22:00,086 --> 01:22:01,187
Will you give it a try?

2161
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:03,825
I think you can put it in now.

2162
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:05,825
- Shall I?
- Don't put it in right away.

2163
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:07,625
Take a break and take a look at it.

2164
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:08,825
- Take a look at it?
- Take a look at it.

2165
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:11,026
There's a reason why it has to be worked on...

2166
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:12,397
when it isn't red.

2167
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:14,266
- It's...
- You should come here.

2168
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:16,266
- It's because...
- You should talk with me here.

2169
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:17,335
- It's fine.
- No?

2170
01:22:17,336 --> 01:22:19,506
Then, with the hammer...

2171
01:22:19,737 --> 01:22:21,776
(He shows how it's done.)

2172
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,476
"Nice. It was done well."

2173
01:22:23,477 --> 01:22:25,146
It works only when you say this.

2174
01:22:25,147 --> 01:22:26,276
- Sir.
- Try hitting it.

2175
01:22:26,277 --> 01:22:27,575
Could you keep teaching me right next to me?

2176
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,545
I'll teach you from afar. Stay right there.

2177
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:30,915
Your pupil is walking on eggshells.

2178
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,186
- I'm fine.
- It's okay.

2179
01:22:32,187 --> 01:22:33,187
It's fine to stay by me.

2180
01:22:33,188 --> 01:22:34,215
(Shall we move on to the next part?)

2181
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:35,925
All right. Let's move on to moving the stones.

2182
01:22:35,926 --> 01:22:37,255
(Making Jeju's stonewalls)

2183
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:38,625
(Step 2: Moving the stones)

2184
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:41,097
The stone must be moved by four people.

2185
01:22:41,326 --> 01:22:43,727
- Move to the other side. Okay.
- Gosh.

2186
01:22:43,996 --> 01:22:46,296
This is like a workout. It's like doing squats.

2187
01:22:46,567 --> 01:22:48,036
All right. Let's get up now.

2188
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,006
All right.

2189
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,666
(The 4 people lift up the 50kg stone.)

2190
01:22:52,006 --> 01:22:53,436
- Did the stone get lifted up?
- Stop.

2191
01:22:53,437 --> 01:22:54,636
Is the stone there?

2192
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,245
(They move energetically based on the shouts.)

2193
01:22:56,246 --> 01:22:57,346
- Did the stone get lifted up?
- Heave-ho!

2194
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,575
Gosh, we're missing the shouts.

2195
01:22:58,576 --> 01:22:59,776
Come back!

2196
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:00,876
- What?
- Let's do it again.

2197
01:23:01,116 --> 01:23:02,615
- My goodness.
- Did we miss something?

2198
01:23:02,616 --> 01:23:03,986
- Spread out.
- Sir,

2199
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:05,286
this feels like a training camp.

2200
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:06,486
Come back.

2201
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:08,357
You should've taught us. What do we have to do?

2202
01:23:09,286 --> 01:23:10,955
- How do we make the shouts?
- All right.

2203
01:23:10,956 --> 01:23:13,756
When I go, "Heave-ho," you should shout as well.

2204
01:23:14,126 --> 01:23:15,296
One, two, three.

2205
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:17,196
- Gosh, it feels light.
- All right.

2206
01:23:17,197 --> 01:23:20,437
(Heave-ho!)

2207
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:23,936
(The four stonemasons press forward along with the shouts.)

2208
01:23:23,937 --> 01:23:25,506
(Charge!)

2209
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:27,206
(Heave-ho!)

2210
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,575
- We're here.
- We'll bring it down.

2211
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:30,607
- Squat down.
- One, two.

2212
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:31,777
Okay.

2213
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:35,446
But it felt as if the stone wasn't there...

2214
01:23:35,447 --> 01:23:36,816
as the four of us lifted it.

2215
01:23:36,817 --> 01:23:38,817
It isn't over. We'll move it in twos now.

2216
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:42,625
(Heave-ho!)

2217
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:43,786
(Charge!)

2218
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,326
- Heave-ho!
- Heave-ho!

2219
01:23:45,426 --> 01:23:47,097
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

2220
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:48,755
So this is how the stones are moved.

2221
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:50,465
- This is how the stones are moved.
- Right.

2222
01:23:50,466 --> 01:23:52,295
(The big and small stones...)

2223
01:23:52,296 --> 01:23:54,937
(were moved with the wooden blocks.)

2224
01:23:55,336 --> 01:23:56,736
I'll teach you how to stack up the stones now.

2225
01:23:56,737 --> 01:23:58,336
(Step 3: Stacking up the stones)

2226
01:23:58,536 --> 01:23:59,977
- Check the sides of the stone.
- Right.

2227
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:02,147
The bottom has to be the most secure...

2228
01:24:02,506 --> 01:24:05,076
for it to be safe as it gets stacked up.

2229
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:08,816
- Secure them so they don't shake.
- So this is how they are stacked.

2230
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,115
I wondered how they were stacked.

2231
01:24:10,116 --> 01:24:12,086
You have to see which side should face down.

2232
01:24:12,557 --> 01:24:15,157
Great. There are gaps that are made as they get stacked.

2233
01:24:15,626 --> 01:24:17,657
These gaps must be filled with stones...

2234
01:24:18,126 --> 01:24:20,027
to keep the stone secure.

2235
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,425
When the stone is filled,

2236
01:24:21,426 --> 01:24:22,767
- hit it with the hammer.
- Right.

2237
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:24,496
Here.

2238
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:25,736
(When another stone is placed on top...)

2239
01:24:25,737 --> 01:24:26,795
- That was perfect, right?
- That was perfect.

2240
01:24:26,796 --> 01:24:29,136
- Right?
- This keeps it secure.

2241
01:24:29,137 --> 01:24:31,666
(The stonewalls are being stacked up securely.)

2242
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:34,535
- Here's another tip.
- Right, sir.

2243
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:35,977
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

2244
01:24:36,046 --> 01:24:37,607
- When the stones are stacked up, - Right.

2245
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:39,575
You have to believe that they are alive.

2246
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:41,317
- Try placing it gently.
- Right.

2247
01:24:41,517 --> 01:24:42,517
Again.

2248
01:24:43,147 --> 01:24:45,016
Try stacking it like this.

2249
01:24:45,017 --> 01:24:46,817
It won't budge. Okay!

2250
01:24:47,057 --> 01:24:48,455
- This is how it's done.
- Got it.

2251
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:50,026
(The heart of a stonemason that is careful with each stone)

2252
01:24:50,027 --> 01:24:52,726
If it gets stacked up like this and a person goes on top...

2253
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:54,227
- Be careful, sir.
- I'm fine.

2254
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:55,665
It won't break down.

2255
01:24:55,666 --> 01:24:56,966
It won't break down even if I jump around.

2256
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:59,397
Jeju stonewalls are made lightly like this.

2257
01:24:59,836 --> 01:25:01,496
Right.

2258
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:03,437
Shall we start stacking up on this side now?

2259
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,777
(Dong Hyun is trying to stack up a large stone.)

2260
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:08,977
- Yes!
- That's great.

2261
01:25:09,076 --> 01:25:10,875
It's fine even when someone goes on top.

2262
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:11,876
Right.

2263
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:12,916
Right?

2264
01:25:13,216 --> 01:25:14,746
It's fine even when someone goes on top.

2265
01:25:15,246 --> 01:25:16,347
This is the Jeju stonewall.

2266
01:25:17,116 --> 01:25:18,585
- I'll stack this up too.
- Right.

2267
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:19,786
Make me lift up the heavy ones.

2268
01:25:21,256 --> 01:25:23,357
Gosh, I was told not to do this. I'm sorry.

2269
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:26,126
You have to place it gently.

2270
01:25:26,796 --> 01:25:28,125
- You're doing great.
- Nice!

2271
01:25:28,126 --> 01:25:29,166
Right.

2272
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:31,067
Be careful with your hands.

2273
01:25:32,637 --> 01:25:33,767
(Groaning)

2274
01:25:34,137 --> 01:25:35,365
(Passionate)

2275
01:25:35,366 --> 01:25:36,567
- This worked perfectly.
- Right.

2276
01:25:36,737 --> 01:25:38,005
- That was nice.
- You did really well.

2277
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:39,075
That was impressive.

2278
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:40,335
A stonemason gets paid 500 dollars a day.

2279
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:41,736
You should continue to work here.

2280
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:42,807
They get paid 500 dollars?

2281
01:25:43,447 --> 01:25:44,907
Really? It's 500 dollars a day?

2282
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:46,147
Yes.

2283
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:47,546
It's 500 dollars a day?

2284
01:25:47,817 --> 01:25:49,045
- Is it really true?
- Yes.

2285
01:25:49,046 --> 01:25:50,416
- That's a lot.
- Right.

2286
01:25:50,987 --> 01:25:52,386
If you've done this for ten years...

2287
01:25:52,387 --> 01:25:54,156
- As it's hard labor...
- Right.

2288
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:55,656
- You've done this for ten years?
- Yes.

2289
01:25:55,657 --> 01:25:56,786
(He feels a lot of respect in many different ways.)

2290
01:25:57,086 --> 01:25:59,255
(The captain with a daily wage of 500 dollars)

2291
01:25:59,256 --> 01:26:01,925
Rookies usually start with 150 dollars.

2292
01:26:01,926 --> 01:26:02,926
(Amazed)

2293
01:26:02,927 --> 01:26:04,197
I feel energized all of a sudden.

2294
01:26:04,466 --> 01:26:06,567
- Right. I'll do it.
- Okay.

2295
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:09,406
(Dong Hyun chose a heavy stone.)

2296
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:10,767
This one should be...

2297
01:26:12,777 --> 01:26:13,977
Gosh, this isn't easy.

2298
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,807
You have to lift it up as if you were doing a squat.

2299
01:26:19,447 --> 01:26:20,616
Gosh, this is really heavy.

2300
01:26:21,817 --> 01:26:23,987
You won't be able to lift it. It's really heavy.

2301
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,857
(Lifting)

2302
01:26:30,326 --> 01:26:33,096
It has to be gym equipment for me to lift it up.

2303
01:26:33,097 --> 01:26:34,197
(Amazed)

2304
01:26:35,426 --> 01:26:37,197
- No. You shouldn't lift it.
- It won't work, right?

2305
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:39,466
- Shall I do it?
- You won't be able to lift it.

2306
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:40,795
Don't strain yourself because I'm here.

2307
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:41,937
You'll hurt yourself.

2308
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:44,566
(Lifting)

2309
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:45,706
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2310
01:26:47,277 --> 01:26:49,175
(Amazed)

2311
01:26:49,176 --> 01:26:50,245
He's amazing.

2312
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:51,807
That's the power...

2313
01:26:52,347 --> 01:26:53,446
of the one with the daily wage of 500 dollars.

2314
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:55,075
(The power of the one with the daily wage of 500 dollars)

2315
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,615
This is the difference of someone who makes 150 dollars...

2316
01:26:56,616 --> 01:26:57,947
and 500 dollars.

2317
01:26:58,216 --> 01:27:00,056
Captain, I think the side the rookie worked on...

2318
01:27:00,057 --> 01:27:01,756
- must be stacked again.
- Why?

2319
01:27:01,887 --> 01:27:02,955
It's not sturdy.

2320
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:04,186
- It's not sturdy?
- No.

2321
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:06,096
(The 65-year-old stonemason, Lee Gyu Nam)

2322
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:09,227
This isn't built just to stop people from going through.

2323
01:27:09,426 --> 01:27:11,566
- There are cows and horses.
- Right.

2324
01:27:11,567 --> 01:27:13,766
When they hit the wall and bring it down,

2325
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:14,936
it has to be built again.

2326
01:27:14,937 --> 01:27:17,005
That is why you should stay...

2327
01:27:17,006 --> 01:27:18,607
to work on it again.

2328
01:27:19,006 --> 01:27:20,505
Let's move on after that.

2329
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:22,776
But that part was done by the master.

2330
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:23,846
- Really?
- Yes.

2331
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:24,875
It was exactly that part.

2332
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:26,045
It was done by the master.

2333
01:27:26,046 --> 01:27:27,245
It was the part he stood on.

2334
01:27:27,246 --> 01:27:29,646
Then we'll...

2335
01:27:29,647 --> 01:27:30,886
(The tables are turned.)

2336
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:32,116
How long have you worked here?

2337
01:27:32,286 --> 01:27:33,455
I was...

2338
01:27:33,456 --> 01:27:35,516
born with the stones here.

2339
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:37,785
It has been 65 years since I've lived with the stones.

2340
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:39,026
- It has been 65 years?
- Yes.

2341
01:27:39,027 --> 01:27:40,455
(Shocked)

2342
01:27:40,456 --> 01:27:42,296
Then aren't you the one with the most experience here?

2343
01:27:42,496 --> 01:27:44,325
- When it comes to work experience, - Yes?

2344
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:47,197
It has been...

2345
01:27:47,697 --> 01:27:48,736
three years.

2346
01:27:48,737 --> 01:27:49,767
Three years?

2347
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:52,375
(His stonemason career is a lot shorter than expected.)

2348
01:27:52,376 --> 01:27:53,506
You completely fooled me.

2349
01:27:54,137 --> 01:27:55,706
When he pointed me out,

2350
01:27:56,046 --> 01:27:58,147
I thought that was the one with the most experience.

2351
01:27:58,277 --> 01:27:59,846
He was a pilot for Korean Air for 30 years.

2352
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:01,716
What? Who?

2353
01:28:03,716 --> 01:28:05,516
- Really?
- Yes.

2354
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:06,517
Really?

2355
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:08,056
- You are now working here...
- Yes.

2356
01:28:08,057 --> 01:28:09,326
- after leaving the company?
- Yes.

2357
01:28:09,487 --> 01:28:12,256
Why did you decide to come here?

2358
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,755
- The stones here are beautiful...
- Right.

2359
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,626
- and they are our heritage.
- Right.

2360
01:28:17,067 --> 01:28:19,835
They look stunning when seen from above.

2361
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:20,836
I see.

2362
01:28:21,937 --> 01:28:26,335
(He witnessed the beauty of the stonewalls from afar...)

2363
01:28:26,336 --> 01:28:30,447
(for 30 years.)

2364
01:28:30,876 --> 01:28:33,216
I thought that it would be meaningful...

2365
01:28:33,546 --> 01:28:35,147
to develop and carry on with this tradition.

2366
01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:37,387
I was born in Jeju too.

2367
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:39,786
- You've returned to your hometown?
- Yes.

2368
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:41,255
I see.

2369
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:42,925
- To maintain the culture.
- Right.

2370
01:28:42,926 --> 01:28:43,986
To develop and carry on with this tradition.

2371
01:28:43,987 --> 01:28:45,086
It was to carry on with this tradition.

2372
01:28:45,387 --> 01:28:47,357
That is the reason you are doing this.

2373
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:49,926
(They continue to work.)

2374
01:28:50,527 --> 01:28:52,227
(Along with the stonemasons, )

2375
01:28:52,737 --> 01:28:54,437
(Dong Hyun lets out his last spurt.)

2376
01:28:55,237 --> 01:28:59,835
(The building of the stonewall nears its end.)

2377
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:00,976
I always work out in the morning.

2378
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:03,375
I've done a great amount of exercise today.

2379
01:29:03,376 --> 01:29:04,745
I'm sweating buckets.

2380
01:29:04,746 --> 01:29:07,347
I tried to enjoy it as if I was working out.

2381
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:09,647
I did a lot of deadlifts today.

2382
01:29:10,086 --> 01:29:11,817
Whenever I see stonewalls in Jeju from now on,

2383
01:29:12,286 --> 01:29:14,116
I think I'll break out in a cold sweat down my back.

2384
01:29:15,956 --> 01:29:16,986
Great work.

2385
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:19,456
(He completes his work with Jeju's stonewall.)

2386
01:29:19,897 --> 01:29:22,425
(Dong Hyun was able to...)

2387
01:29:22,426 --> 01:29:26,137
(attend his son's performance as well.)

2388
01:29:26,266 --> 01:29:28,305
(The next race)

2389
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:29,875
(The swift handsome guy is coming!)

2390
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:31,506
(Ahn Jae Hyeon)

2391
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:33,906
(Is this the appearance of a smart one?)

2392
01:29:33,907 --> 01:29:35,206
(Out of the questions that were given out here, )

2393
01:29:35,207 --> 01:29:36,277
(were there any of them that you knew the answer to?)

2394
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:37,876
(No way!)

2395
01:29:37,876 --> 01:29:38,876
(Relieved)

2396
01:29:39,216 --> 01:29:40,546
(What is today's Handsome Heritage?)

2397
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,186
(South Chungcheong Province's treasure and cultural heritage)

2398
01:29:44,716 --> 01:29:45,926
I had no idea!

2399
01:29:46,327 --> 01:29:50,626
(Go through the generations...)

2400
01:29:51,497 --> 01:29:54,596
(and dig through Korean history!)

2401
01:29:54,827 --> 01:29:56,635
(When a bingo is made, )

2402
01:29:56,636 --> 01:29:58,366
(a special gift will be given out!)

2403
01:29:58,367 --> 01:30:01,867
(How will the teams go for the bingo?)

2404
01:30:02,876 --> 01:30:06,776
(Team Guys heads toward the crowded areas of land.)

2405
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:07,845
(You too?)

2406
01:30:07,846 --> 01:30:09,046
(Me too!)

2407
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:13,185
(The two teams have the same goal.)

2408
01:30:13,186 --> 01:30:14,186
(Where are you going?)

2409
01:30:15,147 --> 01:30:17,617
(There's no time to waste!)

2410
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:20,027
(Let's press forward!)

2411
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:25,096
(How will this crazy race end?)
