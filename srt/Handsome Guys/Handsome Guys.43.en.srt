1
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:20,198
(Yangju, Gyeonggi Province)

2
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:25,163
(Current time: 9:30am)

3
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,433
One of us got fired.

4
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:27,733
Where is he?

5
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,903
There are only four of us.

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,403
(Are there only 4 seats?)

7
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,743
- This is... - Wait a minute.

8
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:33,513
Is Sang Uk joining us later?

9
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:35,543
Yes, he has a match today.

10
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:36,943
That's his main job.

11
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,113
Someone who's smarter than me has to disappear.

12
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:40,153
Goodness.

13
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:42,823
It can't be someone who's worse than me.

14
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,553
The next one to get fired is me. It could mean trouble.

15
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,993
We came all the way to Yangju.

16
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:49,693
It feels awkward.
What's on the side?

17
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:52,933
- Isn't it strange? - What?

18
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,163
(What's all this?)

19
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:56,403
- It's food. - Yes.

20
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,933
We prepared a breakfast buffet for you.

21
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,003
Why?

22
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:03,773
Maybe they gave us strange dishes.

23
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:05,543
- Here's the first one. - Okay.

24
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,813
- What's the first dish? - Is it rice?

25
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:09,983
- It's a salad. - It has a name.

26
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,413
- Caprese salad. - Caprese.

27
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,953
- "Caprese?" - Caprese.

28
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:14,583
- Okay. - Caprese salad.

29
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,183
- The second dish. - It's a fruit salad.

30
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,183
- This is a fruit salad. - A fruit salad.

31
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,383
It's soft tofu.

32
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:20,993
- Soft tofu. - It's soft tofu.

33
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:23,493
Both Tae Hyun and I like soft food.

34
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:25,963
(They take a look at the next dish.)

35
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:28,063
- Isn't it something called "chop?" - Yes, it must be a chop steak.

36
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,233
This is meat.

37
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,763
(Dish 4, chop steak)

38
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,733
I expected a shortage of meat.

39
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,873
- There's meat. - There's meat.

40
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:35,903
Right.

41
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,373
- It's a sausage. - What's this?

42
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:38,873
- That also looks okay. - Why is there only one?

43
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:40,543
- Is it made with chicken breast? - Yes.

44
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,843
- It's an ordinary sausage. - This seems like...

45
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,313
It also looks okay. It's chicken breast.

46
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,783
It's chicken breast.

47
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:47,383
(Dish 6, chicken breast and mashed potatoes)

48
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,453
Based on what we saw, I can't tell what's lacking.

49
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:51,253
- There's a lot. - I can't tell what we're lacking.

50
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,653
There's no shortage. There's enough food.

51
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:54,893
From there...

52
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,893
- I'll tell you today's theme. - Okay.

53
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,023
What's the theme?

54
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:02,263
Today, it's Shortage in MCC.

55
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:03,703
"MCC?"

56
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,103
What?

57
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,403
- What does that mean? - Does it mean high in something?

58
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:09,103
- C must be... - Carbs.

59
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:10,573
The last one must be protein.

60
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:12,543
MCC stands for...

61
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,273
- MCC. - meat,

62
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,513
carbs, and carbonated drinks.

63
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:17,913
Carbonated drinks?

64
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,483
(Meat, carbs, and carbonated drinks)

65
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:24,053
(Speechless)

66
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:29,793
(Meat-lovers who would die without meat)

67
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:33,863
(Meat is out.)

68
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:36,133
(Lovers of carbs...)

69
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,633
(who are crazy about rice and noodles)

70
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,873
(Carbs are out.)

71
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:48,443
(Carbonated drink lovers who can't live with it)

72
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:51,883
(Carbonated drinks are out.)

73
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,583
(Shall we live today on a light diet?)

74
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,283
Gosh.

75
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:58,723
- Meat isn't allowed. - No.

76
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:00,853
- Carbs aren't allowed either. - We can't eat carbs?

77
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,163
It means that you won't give us rice.

78
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,123
No carbonated drinks...

79
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,033
- that we absolutely love? - Exactly.

80
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,633
It will be Life in Shortage of these three items.

81
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,163
I saw meat earlier.

82
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,503
- Wait a minute. - Vegetables?

83
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,103
- Is it not meat? - How is that even possible?

84
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:19,503
This is vegan meat.

85
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,513
- Vegan meat? - Yes, it's vegan meat.

86
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,683
That's fake meat.

87
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,083
(Vegan meat is made with beans, and it tastes like meat.)

88
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,513
Think of this breakfast as an adjustment phase.

89
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:32,453
We only prepared a small amount of meat.

90
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:34,593
After this meal, no meat...

91
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,963
or processed meat is allowed.

92
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:39,363
- Including the sausage. - It's fake meat.

93
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,763
(The last meat for today is one sausage and chicken breast.)

94
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,663
Your meal will start now.

95
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,103
The order of serving will be important.

96
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,973
Since there isn't a lot of meat,

97
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,743
the first person could eat it all.

98
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:50,873
It's a test of loyalty.

99
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,643
(There won't be much meat left when people in the front take it.)

100
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:55,173
(First come, first served)

101
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,813
(The 1 to serve himself 1st will get the meat.)

102
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,053
It will be a 1-on-1 game.

103
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,413
Blow the party horn.

104
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:07,323
(Party horns)

105
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,993
The 1st person to take off 4 pieces of paper...

106
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:12,023
on the opponent's face wins.

107
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,163
It will be a tournament.

108
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,463
(Deciding the Order of Eating Breakfast)

109
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,663
(Round 1, Yi Kyung versus Tae Hyun)

110
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,363
Why don't we put our hands on each other's shoulders?

111
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:22,203
(Grabbing each other's shoulders for the final showdown)

112
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:23,843
Can someone say "start?"

113
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:24,903
Okay.

114
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,713
He's the professional referee.

115
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,243
Get ready...

116
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:29,883
Start.

117
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,383
(1 point)

118
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,963
(The players are participating actively, but...)

119
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:45,123
Blow and lift it.

120
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:47,463
It's hard to take them off.

121
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:49,093
(The match looks quite ridiculous.)

122
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,403
Lift it up with the end.

123
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:51,803
Yes, use it like tongs.

124
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:57,543
Scrap it off.

125
00:04:57,543 --> 00:04:59,103
(Yi Kyung tries to scrap off the stickers while blowing hard.)

126
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:00,173
Scrap it off.

127
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,813
(Tae Hyun, on the other hand)

128
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:05,013
It looks like Tae Hyun is...

129
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,983
(Flicking)

130
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:09,883
(His tactic is beating him repetitively.)

131
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,823
It looks like Tae Hyun is gobbling them up.

132
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,393
Look.

133
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:16,663
(Scraping off versus punching repetitively)

134
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:20,593
(Please...)

135
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:25,403
(Just a little more)

136
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:26,473
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

137
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,673
(Gosh, I feel dizzy.)

138
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,273
(The most important is having endurance of the lungs.)

139
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,373
You have ten more seconds.

140
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:34,473
- Ten seconds? - Ten seconds remain.

141
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,583
(The game resumes.)

142
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,183
It's hard to take them off.

143
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:43,883
(The competition between us continues.)

144
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,653
- Your time is up. - Okay.

145
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:49,353
(Round 1 of the game is over.)

146
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,893
Tae Hyun took off two pieces.

147
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:53,963
I have a headache.

148
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,433
Tae Hyun. You have to play one more time because you won.

149
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:58,403
- Did I win? - You won.

150
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,033
- I can't do it. - Tae Hyun.

151
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,503
- This would be the most annoying. - You took off two.

152
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:04,773
After trying so hard,

153
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,303
you end up not eating when you lose.

154
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:07,443
Goodness.

155
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:08,843
Five pieces?

156
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,683
- Five pieces. - Put on as many as possible.

157
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,283
Putting on as many as possible will be motivating.

158
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,013
The one on your chin falls off fast because it moves.

159
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,283
That's strong.

160
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:17,853
It has a life of its own. It looks like your tongue.

161
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,093
(It's as lively as a real tongue.)

162
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:23,323
Get ready.

163
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,293
Start.

164
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,463
(Round 2 of the game starts.)

165
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:27,563
You have to get closer.

166
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,433
- Wait, it's defective. - What's the matter?

167
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,633
(Wait, it's defective.)

168
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:37,643
(He attacks while pretending that it's defective.)

169
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:42,543
(Seung Ho's method is doing whatever it takes to attack.)

170
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:43,743
Look at Dong Hyun.

171
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:44,783
(Cicada Kim dodges the punch.)

172
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:45,783
Look at Dong Hyun.

173
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:47,713
Dong Hyun.

174
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:49,953
Dong Hyun.

175
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:53,153
My goodness.

176
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,093
(A barrage of punches when Seung Ho gets disarmed)

177
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,663
(Stealing Tae Hyun's party horn)

178
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,393
(I'm back.)

179
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,633
- That's mine. - Why are all of mine defective?

180
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,463
(Why are all of mine defective?)

181
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,603
Here is yours.

182
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:08,573
(By Dong Hyun's unrestrained bombardment)

183
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,373
(Seung Ho is cornered.)

184
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,513
(Two horns?)

185
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:19,643
(Rise, double horns.)

186
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,513
That's good. A little more, Seung Ho.

187
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:25,623
(After discarding the horns, he makes a fierce wind attack.)

188
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,663
(Rascal Seung Ho explodes!)

189
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:31,823
Isn't it over?

190
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,093
(Feeling dizzy)

191
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,393
Pieces on Dong Hyun's face don't fall off.

192
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,263
Dong Hyun's won't fall off.

193
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,903
- What's wrong with him? - Here's why.

194
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:41,133
You used two.

195
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,303
- Did he stick something on them? - Here's why.

196
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,943
They stay stuck because my face is wide.

197
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,413
- They stick very well. - Isn't that harsh?

198
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,113
(The secret is his flat face.)

199
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,143
- I give up. - You give up?

200
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,713
Yes, I had no chance of winning this game.

201
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,683
(Deciding the Order of Eating Breakfast)

202
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,523
(The final round, Tae Hyun versus Dong Hyun)

203
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,493
- For the final round, - You have to stick them hard.

204
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:01,953
the weakest player is here.

205
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,563
- Hey, stop it. - Do you want me to do it?

206
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,533
Tae Hyun, show him what you've got.

207
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,733
(You, come over here!)

208
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:10,733
Are you ready?

209
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,663
- Get ready. - Shall I go easy on you?

210
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:14,233
Start.

211
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,273
(The final round starts.)

212
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,173
(He changes his tactic to scraping them off.)

213
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,373
Dong Hyun is so relaxed.

214
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:23,783
(Reaching out his tongue punch carefully)

215
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,043
Are you ready? Here I go.

216
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:27,053
(Dismissive)

217
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:32,023
(Punching)

218
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,523
(He resists for a while.)

219
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,263
This is ridiculous.

220
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,023
I can't open my eyes.

221
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:40,733
(Throwing straightforward punches)

222
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,863
What is he doing?

223
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,303
What's going on? I can't see.

224
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:46,463
(Helpless)

225
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,403
Dong Hyun is scary.

226
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,273
He uses it like it's his fist.

227
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,713
Dong Hyun is fierce.

228
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,073
(Stun Gun)

229
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:02,083
(Tae Hyun loses by technical knockout.)

230
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,753
- None of them fell off. - I'm tired.

231
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:08,153
- Mine fell off. - I'm tired.

232
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,293
Why is it so hard to take his off?

233
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,493
It was hard to make an impact.

234
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,393
Dong Hyun, how hard did you blow it?

235
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,303
- There's a hole in it. - There's a hole in it.

236
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:19,903
(There's a clear hole.)

237
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:21,203
How hard did he blow it?

238
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,003
How is it possible? This is plastic.

239
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,373
(He must have hit Tae Hyun as hard as he could.)

240
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:27,073
Does Dong Hyun get to eat first?

241
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:29,013
Yes, the winner will go first. The rest will go in order.

242
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,213
- This looks delicious. - I love it.

243
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,853
The food will be easy to digest. We won't feel heavy.

244
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:37,153
It's very healthy.

245
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,483
(The meat dishes could be the last ones for today.)

246
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:40,623
Gosh, this is...

247
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,123
- Isn't it chicken breast? - Right.

248
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,393
- I'm sorry, but... - Hey, Dong Hyun.

249
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:47,663
(All the chicken breast is mine.)

250
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:49,733
Dong Hyun, there are three more after you.

251
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,733
(The three people waiting are anxious.)

252
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:52,203
He took it all.

253
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:53,973
I'm sorry about this.

254
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,233
This is for my muscles. I can't help it.

255
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:57,843
I'm sorry about that.

256
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,843
Did you take this?

257
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:01,173
By the way, where is it?

258
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,683
(Did the sausage disappear all of a sudden?)

259
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:07,183
- Find it. Then you can eat it. - What?

260
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,653
How will I be able to find the sausage?

261
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,053
- Why not? - How can I find it?

262
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,823
I don't know where it is.

263
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,693
Look for it if you want it.

264
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:15,693
(The sausage's whereabouts are unknown.)

265
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:18,063
Dong Hyun, hurry up. The food will get cold. We need to eat.

266
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,093
Goodness.

267
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,493
(Just finish serving yourself.)

268
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,233
(A moment ago)

269
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,463
(Rascal Seung Ho stole the sausage secretly.)

270
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,003
(Tae Hyun...)

271
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,943
(and Yi Kyung already found out.)

272
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,643
Where's the sausage?

273
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,113
Find the sausage. Then you can eat it.

274
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,443
This is enough for me.

275
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,353
(Even without the sausage, there's plenty of food.)

276
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:43,113
(Next is Tae Hyun in 2nd place)

277
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:44,523
- It's fruit salad. - Salad?

278
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:45,583
I just need some fruit salad.

279
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,953
- Old women used to say fruit salad. - I just need some fruit salad.

280
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,693
- "Fruit salad." - It's my favorite.

281
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:53,363
(Yi Kyung in third)

282
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:56,533
(He takes the remaining chicken breast.)

283
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,963
I served myself neatly.

284
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,833
(The chicken breast is completely gone.)

285
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,003
If you find it now, you'll get to eat it.

286
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:05,043
Neither Tae Hyun nor I want anything in particular.

287
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,043
(Lastly, meat-loving Seung Ho serves himself.)

288
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,313
So no one will eat the sausage?

289
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,843
Where is it? The one who hid it should eat it.

290
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:14,013
The one who hid it will eat it.

291
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,383
(Leisurely)

292
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,623
(He walks to one side.)

293
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:19,853
Seriously?

294
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:23,523
(A sausage is stuck in front of a tree.)

295
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,363
Why did you stick it there?

296
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:26,863
It's a sausage tree.

297
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,203
I just have to put it on my plate.

298
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,373
He took the main dish.

299
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:34,403
I can't believe it.

300
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:36,873
It's not like he was nourishing the tree.

301
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,173
That can't be helped. It's okay.

302
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:43,143
This is enough food for me.

303
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:44,413
(It's time for breakfast with their last meat.)

304
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:45,783
Thank you for the food.

305
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,753
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

306
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,283
This is...

307
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,053
very nice.

308
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:54,793
(Taking a bite happily)

309
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,493
I've been curious about vegan meat.

310
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:00,963
So this isn't meat, right?

311
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:05,863
It's slightly different.

312
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,903
(Tae Hyun starts with his favorite fruit salad.)

313
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:17,083
(Seung Ho enjoys the sausage from the tree.)

314
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:19,513
By the way,

315
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,413
aren't you craving some carbs already?

316
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:24,353
(They feel the shortage of carbs quickly.)

317
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,953
I'm craving them so much.

318
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,193
Habits are so powerful.

319
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:31,023
I took too much chicken breast.

320
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:34,333
Gosh, I want some Coke.

321
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,463
(Trouble caused by greed)

322
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:37,533
(Quietly)

323
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,233
Why are you pushing your soft tofu to me?

324
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:41,273
You can have some if you want more.

325
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:42,473
I finished mine.

326
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,873
Here you go.

327
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,073
(This time, he gives it to Tae Hyun.)

328
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,013
I took too much food.
(Normally, he'd eat it easily.)

329
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,053
(There's no rice or ramyeon.)

330
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,053
(There's no carbonated drink that helps with digestion.)

331
00:12:57,353 --> 00:13:00,653
(The MCC slaves have a hard time enjoying the food.)

332
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,693
- You have a lot left. - What?

333
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,023
You have to finish it.

334
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:05,723
- You do. - Of course.

335
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:06,963
If you leave any,

336
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,693
we'll keep you in your seat and feed you.

337
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:10,603
No one is going to leave his food.

338
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:12,533
- Aren't you having a hard time? - No.

339
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,303
Not at all.

340
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:15,773
Why doesn't it decrease?

341
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:22,673
(With soft tofu as his last bite)

342
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:23,683
You finished it all.

343
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,413
(He clears the food.)

344
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,713
Before going to your lodging today,

345
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:31,253
you'll stop by a supermarket and get groceries.

346
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,223
Do we have to buy food to cook?

347
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,653
- Except MCC? - Yes.

348
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,493
- Then there's nothing to buy. - What should we buy?

349
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:38,593
Do we have to eat raw fish?

350
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:40,633
Squid, abalone, fish.

351
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:41,963
- Tofu. - There are so many options.

352
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,563
Usually, there's a seafood section.

353
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:44,763
Let's empty out the shelves in that section.

354
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,603
- Okay. - Shall we? Let's go shopping.

355
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:49,733
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

356
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:53,813
(Handsome Guys arrive at the supermarket.)

357
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:57,483
Anything except meat, carbs, and carbonated drinks.

358
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,483
You can buy up to 200 dollars.

359
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,953
- Is there a limit to the cost? - Up to 200 dollars.

360
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,223
Then we can't have raw fish.

361
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,853
I didn't expect a limit to the cost.

362
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,023
We can buy up to 200 dollars. This will be hard.

363
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,223
We have to endure it by eating filefish jerky.

364
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:12,793
Is filefish jerky allowed?

365
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,563
Filefish jerky isn't carbohydrates.

366
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,933
- Gambas? - Is that not allowed?

367
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,103
- We can eat gambas. - Gambas?

368
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,473
Here are some tomatoes.

369
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,373
This one is the cheapest.

370
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,173
(Kimchi)

371
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:28,713
Eggs.

372
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:32,313
We only need seaweed to make seaweed soup.

373
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:33,443
Okay.

374
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:34,713
Let's buy some curry powder.

375
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,623
(This time, they look for curry.)

376
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,923
I'm also good at making curry.

377
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,693
Even if we make curry, we can't eat rice.

378
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,063
As a substitute...

379
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:45,963
There's nothing else to add. What can we add?

380
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:48,163
It would be nice to eat with a lot of onions.

381
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,133
Aren't carrots allowed?

382
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,663
Why not? We can eat carrots.

383
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:54,233
Then let's add a lot of carrots. Carrots are good.

384
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,603
- They taste like potatoes. - Buy more. We only have two.

385
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:57,743
- Carrots. - Carrots and...

386
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,873
Carrots.

387
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:00,743
Let's buy one more carrot.

388
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,613
As you said, we can add a lot of carrots.

389
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:06,683
(Picking a lot of carrots)

390
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,953
- Shall we go to the cashier first? - Okay.

391
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:09,953
(They head to the cashier.)

392
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:11,083
Hello.

393
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,283
I'll put them up.

394
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:13,553
(What will be the total amount?)

395
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:16,323
- So how much is it? - I'll do it.

396
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,693
(The remaining amount: 2.34 dollars)

397
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,393
- It's 197 dollars. - We're short of 2.34 dollars.

398
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:20,933
Pick something that costs 2.3 dollars.

399
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,563
(Spending every penny)

400
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:23,603
For 2.3 dollars?

401
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:25,503
Let's buy more carrots.

402
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,233
Are you crazy about carrots?

403
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:30,373
Carrots are beneficial for our health.

404
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,803
How many carrots are you buying?

405
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,403
Your face will turn orange if you aren't careful.

406
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:35,443
Carrots are the closest to potatoes.

407
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:36,713
(In love with carrots)

408
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,643
That's perfect.

409
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:39,943
(In the end, they buy more carrots.)

410
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,253
We have 80 cents left.

411
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,483
- This is enough. - There's a lollipop for 25 cents.

412
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:46,623
How much do we have left?

413
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,023
- We have 66 cents. - That's not enough.

414
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,223
We can get lollipops for 2 with 66 cents.

415
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:52,393
Okay.

416
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,293
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

417
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,533
Rock-paper-scissors. I win everything today.

418
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,533
I can't believe this.

419
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,633
- I want the strawberry flavor. - Strawberry?

420
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:02,733
Hurry up and pick one.

421
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,073
(They buy groceries exactly up to 200 dollars.)

422
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,043
The total is 199.84 dollars.

423
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:09,943
Have a good day. Thank you.

424
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,013
Goodbye.

425
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,043
- You got everything? - Goodbye.

426
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,783
- Goodbye. - Take care. Thank you.

427
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,053
Goodbye.

428
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:19,383
(Total: 199.84 dollars)

429
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,223
It's the most fulfilling grocery shopping I've done recently.

430
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,223
(They head to the lodging.)

431
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,593
- Is it this way? - I'd put my life on the line.

432
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,463
- Tomatoes... - Is it this way?

433
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,033
Where are you going?

434
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,563
It must be this way.

435
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,033
Where are you going?

436
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,933
It's okay to get lost, isn't it?

437
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,403
When you aren't allowed to eat carbs,

438
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:39,603
things like this can happen.

439
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,843
You can't think straight, can you?

440
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:43,713
Tae Hyun, there's always a way to get there.

441
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:46,283
- Are you taking a detour? - No way.

442
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,813
(Trembling)

443
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,183
This is very tasty.

444
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:51,523
This is good.

445
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,353
(Filling up on glucose)

446
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:55,393
Does anyone want it?

447
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,393
Within three minutes...

448
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,563
If you're getting impatient, eat this.

449
00:16:58,563 --> 00:16:59,793
Who wants it?

450
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:01,963
(Do you really think...)

451
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,193
(that I can't eat it?)

452
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:04,863
He took mine away.

453
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:06,633
He took mine away.

454
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,373
It must be delicious. I should've taken it.

455
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:12,143
I even took the ping-pong ball from Yi Kyung's mouth.

456
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,443
- I should've taken it. - Right. Candy isn't any worse.

457
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:15,543
(They even shared a ping-pong ball.)

458
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:17,543
It reminds me of my childhood.

459
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,513
It's a hanok lodging.

460
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:22,713
It looks beautiful.

461
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:27,553
(After sharing some sugar, they arrived at today's lodging.)

462
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,993
(Under the cozy and quiet tilted roof)

463
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,533
(Today's Handsome lodging with a big yard)

464
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,363
(Welcome)

465
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,963
I'll carry it.

466
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:40,703
Goodness.

467
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,773
I feel so listless.

468
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:47,713
Just because I didn't have much carbs...

469
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,783
(Moving into today's lodging)

470
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,843
"Be careful of wasps." I'll open the door for you.

471
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:56,483
We're in.

472
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,353
(Exclaiming)

473
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:00,353
Tae Hyun.

474
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:02,023
- It's really nice. - It feels cool inside.

475
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,023
(Despite the shortage of food today)

476
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,623
- It's nice. - It's pleasant.

477
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:05,693
It's lovely.

478
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:07,733
I love the smell of wood.

479
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,163
The water pressure is good too.

480
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,533
We only need water, electricity, and air conditioner.

481
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:14,933
How about some coffee?

482
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,203
- Let's have some. - Coffee.

483
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,873
This is better.

484
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,513
Even if we're starving, don't you need an Americano?

485
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:24,513
That's right.

486
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,813
- It looks like Coke. - This is nice.

487
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:33,353
(Hypnotizing themselves with caffeine)

488
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:35,393
- A house like that... - What?

489
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:36,853
It's delicious.

490
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:37,863
(Exclaiming)

491
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,393
Imagining that it's Coke...

492
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,063
It's like Coke.

493
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,533
The view is really amazing.

494
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,733
My dream is living in a house like this.

495
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,773
(Now that they drank some Coke...)

496
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:55,173
(Handsome Guys lie down first.)

497
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:56,573
Are you sleeping?

498
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:00,453
We're low on sugar.

499
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:04,723
You have to eat lunch a little later.

500
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:08,793
Wouldn't you like some MCC?

501
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,623
- That would be better. - Meat?

502
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,293
With a tiny amount at stake,

503
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,163
we're planning to play a game.

504
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,433
That sounds great.

505
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,203
Oh, yes.

506
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:22,473
(With meat, carbs, and carbonated drinks at stake)

507
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:25,643
(3 types of water game)

508
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:28,373
(3 hours of shortage in MCC at 12:30pm)

509
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,673
That must be it.

510
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:32,283
It's a kiddie pool.

511
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,583
- What? There's a chair inside. - You're right.

512
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:36,783
What's this?

513
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,183
It's nice.

514
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:40,993
(The players enter.)

515
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:44,163
(It feels refreshing.)

516
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,693
I'll explain the game.

517
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,763
- You see the beakers on the right? - Yes.

518
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:49,793
There's a red line on the beaker.

519
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,833
The player will sit down with the beaker on his head.

520
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,003
Someone else will pour water from the kettle.

521
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,143
When you think the water passed the red line,

522
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:00,673
shout "stop."

523
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,813
If the water overflows...

524
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,883
or doesn't reach the red line,

525
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,013
you will fail.

526
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,013
You'll be slapped with water as a penalty.

527
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:11,753
(This will be fun.)

528
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,823
We have something at stake.

529
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:14,423
- The winner gets meat. - Right.

530
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,253
- Exactly. - In the first game,

531
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,793
the prize is one pack of ramyeon...

532
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:20,093
- and a carbonated drink. - One can?

533
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,163
Yes, one can.

534
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,333
Will there be one winner?

535
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:23,593
Yes, one winner.

536
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,303
Doesn't Dong Hyun always start the game?

537
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:27,333
Really?

538
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,903
I've never gone first.

539
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,173
Would you like to go first, Tae Hyun?

540
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,103
- I'll decide. - No.

541
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,073
- Let's pick. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

542
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,543
- The winner decides the order. - Okay.

543
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,543
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

544
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,483
(He's the only one playing rock.)

545
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,353
- Dong Hyun, come here. Go 1st. - You're 1st.

546
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:42,813
- Just play first. - Go.

547
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:44,923
What's wrong with playing first?

548
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,223
From now on, Dong Hyun will go first.

549
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,993
- I'll succeed right away. - Okay.

550
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,623
How many milliliters is it? I'm accurate with measures.

551
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,633
- It's 900ml. - It's 900ml?

552
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:56,493
It's equivalent to a carton of milk.

553
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,233
- Imagine gulping it down. - Approximately...

554
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,563
It's about this much.

555
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,573
I didn't say that I'd pour it into the beaker.

556
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,043
Aim it well.

557
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,173
It goes out this way.

558
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,713
- Aim it well. - It goes out this way.

559
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:10,143
You need to aim it well.

560
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,713
I should pour it from here. Okay.

561
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:12,883
All right.

562
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,913
Wait a minute.

563
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:16,053
Time-out.

564
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,113
Can you pour it instead?

565
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:18,423
I'll do it.

566
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,123
Get a feeling of it.

567
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:23,923
- Seriously. - Do it properly.

568
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:25,093
All right, Dong Hyun.

569
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:26,593
We'll do it properly.

570
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,433
This is our last practice.

571
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,463
Goodness.

572
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:33,603
Goodness.

573
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,803
Do it properly.

574
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,243
Okay, I'll start now.

575
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:39,503
- Okay. - Let's go.

576
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:40,603
Time-out.

577
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,643
You're too far in the back.

578
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:43,913
Can you lean your head forward a little?

579
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:49,783
(Getting slapped with water)

580
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:50,883
This is how it's done.

581
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,483
This is how it's done.

582
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:55,623
This is...

583
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:57,563
It reached the back of my eyeball.

584
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:58,893
Goodness.

585
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:00,123
You're so loud.

586
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,263
Oh, my.

587
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,963
- When are you starting? - Tae Hyun.

588
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:05,063
(When are you starting?)

589
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:07,103
The water reached behind my eye.

590
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,533
Please say start and stop.

591
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:10,943
Start.

592
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:12,603
That's good.

593
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,813
I know that water isn't going in.

594
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:16,443
- That's good. - Water isn't going in.

595
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,483
I don't hear any sound.

596
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,113
The water is going in.

597
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,153
- The water is going in, - Right.

598
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,153
but he doesn't hear anything going in.

599
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:26,553
(It's getting filled with water.)

600
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,623
(Moving about)

601
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:31,723
But he doesn't hear anything going in.

602
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:34,593
Water is going in,

603
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:35,863
- but... - Stop!

604
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:41,333
(It's overflowing.)

605
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,403
Stop!

606
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,433
(It's overflowing.)

607
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:49,013
(Laughing)

608
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,243
Time-out.

609
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,243
(Take this.)

610
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,383
Time-out.

611
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:56,413
(His face gets hit hard.)

612
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:59,053
(Kim Dong Hyun fails.)

613
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,123
Wait, time-out.

614
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:01,623
- It overflowed a long time ago. - What?

615
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,793
- It overflowed? - Yes, a long time ago.

616
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:06,123
The water went into my eyes.

617
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:07,593
(The water went into my eyes.)

618
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,693
Make your decision.

619
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:11,833
- This is difficult. - No.

620
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,303
Going last is the best.

621
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:15,833
(Why is he wearing a swimming cap?)

622
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,203
I will definitely make it.

623
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:19,303
Give it a try. It's not easy.

624
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:21,413
I just need to figure out the weight.

625
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,043
(How dare you?)

626
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:24,383
- Dong Hyun. - That's cheating.

627
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:25,743
- What... - That's cheating.

628
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:27,143
- You can't do that. - Just because you failed...

629
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:28,313
You can't do that.

630
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,453
That's cheating.

631
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:30,853
- Here I go. - Get ready,

632
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,053
set, go.

633
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,123
Okay, 50.

634
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:36,393
Hundred.

635
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:37,723
One hundred and fifty.

636
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,363
I know because I've gotten water from the filter.

637
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:41,863
Three hundred.

638
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:43,633
Five hundred.

639
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,933
- What? - Six hundred.

640
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:47,833
Seven hundred.

641
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,473
Eight hundred.

642
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,973
(Will he succeed?)

643
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:53,873
(It's still half.)

644
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,043
- Stop. - Gosh.

645
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,973
(Stop!)

646
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,713
(Here you go. Take this.)

647
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:05,823
Goodness.

648
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,493
Hey, doesn't it go into your eyes?

649
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,553
My eyes were closed, but it still went in.

650
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:10,123
It goes in even with your eyes closed.

651
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,493
It goes in even with your eyes closed.

652
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,793
- This is hard. - I'll go.

653
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:13,963
Yi Kyung also failed.

654
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,493
This is difficult.

655
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:16,793
(Yi Kyung's attempt also fails.)

656
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,703
I don't need other carbs.

657
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:20,433
- Ramyeon. - Ramyeon.

658
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:23,373
Start.

659
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:27,773
(The water gets poured as soon as it starts.)

660
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:30,813
(Pouring)

661
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:33,043
It must be heavy.

662
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,983
Seung Ho, are you okay?

663
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:40,223
(Keeping it his way)

664
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,323
Stop.

665
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:44,263
- Are you sure? - He said stop.

666
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,793
Think about it one more time.

667
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,563
Then keep going a little more.

668
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:50,733
- A little more. - He's pouring.

669
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:51,733
(Laughing)

670
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:53,103
It must feel heavy.

671
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:55,403
I'm getting ready to get slapped.

672
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,533
What about now?

673
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,103
(Getting ready to hit)

674
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,903
You need to pour it.

675
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,313
He's been pouring it.

676
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,773
I'm pouring a lot. Are you okay?

677
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:04,073
(I keep pouring it.)

678
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,813
(The water keeps rising.)

679
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:10,853
(Feeling nervous)

680
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:13,223
(He just needs to say stop to succeed.)

681
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:14,893
- Are you waiting to get hit? - Pour it.

682
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:17,563
- You want him to keep pouring it? - Are you pouring it?

683
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,163
Stop.

684
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:23,363
(You're too late, you brat.)

685
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,763
He could've gotten it right.

686
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,803
Were you pouring it?

687
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,103
I was pouring a lot.

688
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:30,503
(Seung Ho fails.)

689
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:33,243
How do I do this?

690
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:34,413
(The last player is Tae Hyun.)

691
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,773
The one with experience should step in.

692
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:37,813
Have you done it before?

693
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:39,443
I did it every day.

694
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:41,513
- This is a piece of cake. - If you fail,

695
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:42,783
I'll hit you hard.

696
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:43,783
This is a piece of cake.

697
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,623
Do I get brownie points for performing?

698
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:47,153
What if I fall back after getting hit?

699
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,893
- You'll get brownie points. - What if I fall like this?

700
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:49,953
Definitely.

701
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,193
I'm experienced.

702
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:52,223
Of course.

703
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:53,393
- Okay. - Start.

704
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,463
(Tae Hyun gives it a try.)

705
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,833
(Relaxed)

706
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,533
Start.

707
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:01,103
Start.

708
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,103
(Clashing)

709
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,243
Stop.

710
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:06,643
Lean forward a little.

711
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:10,043
(Is it close?)

712
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,213
Lean forward a little.

713
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:13,943
- He failed. - He failed.

714
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,553
(That was close.)

715
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:18,923
(Slapping)

716
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:25,693
(Points on technique: 10)

717
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:27,563
(Points on artistry: 10)

718
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,533
That was close.

719
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,533
- Tae Hyun. - You were really close.

720
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,573
- Seriously. - Tae Hyun.

721
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,433
I almost made you successful.

722
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:38,243
- I mean... - Seriously.

723
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,043
- Are you sure? - You were really close.

724
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:41,643
It didn't reach the line.

725
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,243
That hurt.

726
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,083
Are you okay? Did the water go into your brain?

727
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:46,383
Was it weak?

728
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:48,213
No, it wasn't weak.

729
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,183
This game is really difficult.

730
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,623
I'll try it one more time.

731
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:52,683
Everyone.

732
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:53,853
Why don't each of you try one more time?

733
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:54,953
Without the water slap,

734
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,093
the one who gets closest to the line wins.

735
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,393
- The one who succeeds... - Okay.

736
00:26:58,393 --> 00:26:59,763
will be the winner.

737
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,093
- One person? - Just one person.

738
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,133
Without the water slap?

739
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,363
- Without the water slap. - The one who gets the closest?

740
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:07,403
Keep the same speed from now on.

741
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:08,803
- Let's promise each other. - Don't play jokes.

742
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:09,803
Seriously.

743
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,403
- Shall I go? - Go.

744
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:12,403
Start.

745
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:14,643
(In the same order, Dong Hyun starts first.)

746
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:18,643
(The beaker gets filled with water.)

747
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,753
- Right now? - Stop.

748
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:23,083
Okay. Keep it that way.

749
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,883
Keep it the same. You can check.

750
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,123
- Don't move. - Keep it the same.

751
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,423
Don't move.

752
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,593
Oh, come on. Time-out.

753
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:32,063
Time-out.

754
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:33,223
- You're in the upper rank. - It's 600ml.

755
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:35,163
Put it on the side.

756
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,533
- Can I go again? - It's over.

757
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,303
They cheated. They planned it.

758
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:39,863
- That's not true. - How could we have planned it?

759
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:42,103
(Before starting the game)

760
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,743
I will help you succeed.

761
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:46,703
Give me a bite of ramyeon.

762
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,273
I'll say, "Right now?"

763
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:51,213
(Tempted)

764
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:55,283
(That's how he fell for it.)

765
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:57,753
He asked me for a bite of ramyeon.

766
00:27:57,953 --> 00:27:59,753
He promised to say "right now" when I got close.

767
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,123
Then... Gosh, that's cold.

768
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:03,423
"Right now?"

769
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,493
He promised me to say that.

770
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:07,693
Get ready, set, go.

771
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:08,693
(Yi Kyung goes second.)

772
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,533
Unbelievable.

773
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,003
(Concentrating)

774
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,773
(The beaker gets filled quickly.)

775
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:17,943
Now.

776
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:20,843
You have to keep pouring it. It's not over.

777
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:21,843
(It's very close to the red line.)

778
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,073
- Now? - I poured some more.

779
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:25,543
It's very high.

780
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:27,043
This looks good. It's 800ml.

781
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,413
Time-out. Wait.

782
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,213
Does "now" count?

783
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,683
He should've poured more when Yi Kyung said "now."

784
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:33,853
- What? - He said "now."

785
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:37,093
- Okay. - Why are you helping him?

786
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:39,363
Wait, is this a team game or an individual game?

787
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:40,523
It's an individual game.

788
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:41,893
- Is it an individual game? - Yes.

789
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,563
- But it feels like 1 against 3. - No way.

790
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:46,633
- It's an individual game, right? - Yes.

791
00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:49,073
Once you say start, I'll pour it.

792
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,273
Start.

793
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,413
(Seung Ho's beaker gets filled quickly.)

794
00:28:54,673 --> 00:28:57,343
(Pouring fast)

795
00:28:57,883 --> 00:28:59,913
It's hard to tell when you pour it this fast.

796
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:01,413
Now.

797
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,813
(Impressed)

798
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,183
Everyone who said "now..."

799
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:06,623
He got a little closer to the line.

800
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:08,293
- It looks more than 800ml. - It's over 800ml.

801
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:11,763
(He has to say stop, not now.)

802
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,263
- Put it over there. - He's in first place.

803
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:16,063
We have to check the VAR for this.

804
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:17,293
To decipher it.

805
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:18,903
- Take a look at this. - Seriously.

806
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:19,963
You're right.

807
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,173
That's good.

808
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,003
(Seung Ho 900ml, Yi Kyung 800ml, Dong Hyun 600ml)

809
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:24,403
I got tricked.

810
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:25,443
(The last player, Tae Hyun)

811
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,773
Wait a minute.

812
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:28,773
Dong Hyun, you made it.

813
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:30,913
(Seung Ho takes out something from the water.)

814
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:33,513
(Sticking)

815
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:36,113
This is sticky.

816
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:37,253
It's so sticky.

817
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,323
Where did it come from?

818
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:40,783
- Did it fall from here? - Yes.

819
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:41,953
It's very sticky.

820
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,693
Please shout "start."

821
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:45,093
- Do I go? - Yes.

822
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:46,923
Okay. Start.

823
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,393
(His last attempt for ramyeon and a carbonated drink)

824
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:51,633
Here it comes.

825
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,563
(Focused)

826
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,643
(Pouring)

827
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:02,873
- Unbelievable. - Stop.

828
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:06,513
(What will be Tae Hyun's record?)

829
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,883
Take a look at it.

830
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:09,283
Here you go.

831
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:11,153
(He obviously placed last.)

832
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,323
What's the matter with you?

833
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,053
- Tae Hyun, I didn't do anything. - You said,

834
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,223
- "Unbelievable." - Me?

835
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:18,323
- Did you say unbelievable or not? - Me?

836
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,293
- You said "unbelievable" earlier. - He did.

837
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:23,433
When the water stopped pouring,

838
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:24,733
he said, "Stop!"

839
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:27,703
(The first water game is over.)

840
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:30,473
As the winner, Seung Ho will get a pack of ramyeon...

841
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:33,903
and a can of carbonated drink.

842
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,843
I'll briefly explain the second game.

843
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,213
- In the 2nd game... - In the 2nd game?

844
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,283
(The prize in the second game)

845
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,553
Dakgalbi is at stake.

846
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:44,583
- Dakgalbi? - Gosh, that's amazing.

847
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,883
It's poultry.

848
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,523
- Poultry. - Wait, is it a team game?

849
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,593
No.

850
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:49,893
- Is it an individual game? - It's an individual game.

851
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,493
- You keep making us compete. - Yes.

852
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,563
Dakgalbi and one carbonated drink.

853
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,893
- Who is it? - Okay.

854
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,633
After deciding the order,

855
00:30:57,633 --> 00:31:00,103
put on the blindfold and sit in a row.

856
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:03,403
We'll release a water balloon from the back...

857
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,603
and make it swing.

858
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:05,973
It will go back and forth.

859
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:08,843
While shouting out your number from number one,

860
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,373
you have to get up and down from your seat.

861
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,313
(Getting up and down while shouting out your number)

862
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:14,513
If you get hit by the water balloon,

863
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:15,613
- Eliminated. - you'll be eliminated.

864
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:16,883
I got this.

865
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:18,553
I do a lot of training like this.

866
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:19,923
- You do this for training? - In mixed martial arts,

867
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:21,053
you have to dodge...

868
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:22,853
- Without looking? - while looking.

869
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:24,293
Based on your feeling,

870
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:25,793
you imagine the direction of the punch and dodge.

871
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,323
We practice dodging with a blindfold.

872
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:28,563
- Without looking? - Goodness.

873
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:29,563
(Slap, punch)

874
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:31,703
You can't dodge at all.

875
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,403
I mean,

876
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,303
only when I'm ready.

877
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:37,533
- After putting on the blindfold, - And predict the direction?

878
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,643
we dodge the swing.

879
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:41,943
(Ready)

880
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:43,413
it's so dark.

881
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:45,013
It's a blindfold.

882
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,843
- It's because you're blindfolded. - You're blindfolded.

883
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:47,983
It's very dark.

884
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,853
It's darker than a normal blindfold.

885
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,283
Tae Hyun is number 2. Dong Hyun is number 3.

886
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,123
- Yi Kyung is number 4. I'm 1. - Okay.

887
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:58,123
Everyone, let's succeed together.

888
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,293
- Okay. - Here we go.

889
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:02,533
(The game starts.)

890
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:03,533
One.

891
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,403
- Two. - Three.

892
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:08,133
(Three)

893
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,473
(As soon as they start without making a turn)

894
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:13,143
(What was that?)

895
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:15,443
Was it me?

896
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:16,973
(Laughing)

897
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,283
- Me? - I mean...

898
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:19,483
Was it you?

899
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,613
You said that it was part of your training.

900
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:23,753
Was it you, Tae Hyun?

901
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,753
- What are you talking about? - I didn't feel it.

902
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:27,623
Is it really me?

903
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,153
You're eliminated.

904
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:31,123
- It seems hard... - Do we get eliminated...

905
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,523
- little by little? - to get up on time for the balloon.

906
00:32:33,523 --> 00:32:34,523
I mean...

907
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:36,293
Tae Hyun called out his number late.

908
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:37,893
- That's up to me. - Can you get closer?

909
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:39,433
You told us to get up right away.

910
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,403
I want to enjoy the game longer.

911
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,873
Being strategic with time is important.

912
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:46,303
You said that you did this in training.

913
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:47,473
I thought that I had to say 3 right after 2.

914
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:48,643
I should have waited.

915
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:53,513
(The one who's eliminated gets to throw the balloon.)

916
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,253
Is there a rock?

917
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:58,523
I'm looking for a rock.

918
00:32:58,523 --> 00:32:59,553
Is that it?

919
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:01,223
I might switch it with a sandbag later.

920
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:02,293
Goodness.

921
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,523
Here we go.

922
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,893
(Number 1, 2, 3)

923
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:06,893
(The balloon is released.)

924
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,863
- One. - Two.

925
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:11,763
Three.

926
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,533
(Surprised)

927
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:15,173
(He waits a little.)

928
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,673
- One. - Two.

929
00:33:18,643 --> 00:33:20,003
- One. - Two.

930
00:33:20,003 --> 00:33:22,413
(The water balloon explodes on Tae Hyun.)

931
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,473
Goodness.

932
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:25,513
What happened?

933
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:26,883
(He got caught.)

934
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:28,283
What happened? That startled me.

935
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:30,313
(Tae Hyun got eliminated.)

936
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:31,853
(Covered with green paint)

937
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,083
You shouldn't be fast in this game.

938
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,153
Tae Hyun, it's random.

939
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:38,663
If Seung Ho wins again,

940
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,623
he'll gain weight.

941
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:43,433
That's not enough to gain weight.

942
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,503
- Won't it be nice... - You also won ramyeon...

943
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:46,863
- to yield? - in the last game.

944
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:48,703
Even if I want to yield, I can't.

945
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:49,803
You can stay standing up.

946
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,803
- You can stay standing up. - You can't yield?

947
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:54,003
- Stay standing up? - You can stay standing up.

948
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:58,683
(The final round, Seung Ho versus Yi Kyung)

949
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:00,543
Let's win dakgalbi.

950
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,353
(Resolute)

951
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,153
Gosh, that startled me.

952
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,223
One. Goodness.

953
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,523
(Seung Ho got caught in the chair while standing up.)

954
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:10,693
- Are you okay? - Yes.

955
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:12,123
- He said number one. - Two...

956
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:13,163
(Two?)

957
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,523
It's over.

958
00:34:14,523 --> 00:34:17,333
(Yi Kyung got hit while worrying about his opponent.)

959
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,363
It's over.

960
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:20,133
(Seung Ho also wins the second game.)

961
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:21,333
It's over.

962
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,233
Seung Ho, you're amazing.

963
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,743
I thought that something was wrong with him.

964
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:28,813
- That's amazing. - I asked him if he was okay.

965
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:30,043
Then I got hit.

966
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,313
Seung Ho,

967
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,583
you're lucky today.

968
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:36,083
Time-out. Can I propose something?

969
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,183
- You can propose something. - It's just a proposal.

970
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:40,253
Seung Ho won two carbonated drinks.

971
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:41,253
He has two.

972
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:42,893
Can the 3 of us play for 1 of the drinks?

973
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:44,763
You can be the referee.

974
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:46,363
- Okay, a carbonated drink? - Yes.

975
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:48,433
- Okay, a carbonated drink. - Please.

976
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:49,863
- Okay, a carbonated drink. - Okay.

977
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,293
- Let's go. - Yes.

978
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,533
- Let's win a carbonated drink. - I added one more chair.

979
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,333
Okay, let's get a carbonated drink.

980
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,773
Dong Hyun was very regretful.

981
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:58,173
Rock-paper-scissors.

982
00:34:58,443 --> 00:34:59,603
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

983
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:00,873
I'm number one.

984
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:02,143
Then I'm number three.

985
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:03,913
Okay.

986
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:06,243
(Who will get to drink the carbonated drink?)

987
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:08,483
(The game starts.)

988
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:09,513
Number one.

989
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:10,983
Number two.

990
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:12,453
Number three.

991
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,483
- It was too short. - Number two.

992
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,153
(The water balloon stopped.)

993
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:18,693
Number one.
(Shouting in the air)

994
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:20,893
- Two. - Three.

995
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:22,133
(Shouting in the air)

996
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,593
- Gosh, I'm nervous. - Number one.

997
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:25,863
(The water balloon departs again.)

998
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:27,503
- Two. - Three.

999
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,973
(Thud)

1000
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:30,933
- Two. - Three.

1001
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:34,373
(Dong Hyun is eliminated.)

1002
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,443
That was delicious.

1003
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:36,473
Three.

1004
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:39,813
(Laughing)

1005
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,253
(I do a lot of training like this.)

1006
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:48,293
(This sensation in mixed martial arts...)

1007
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:50,953
Goodness.

1008
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:53,593
I'm so curious.

1009
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:56,793
This is your last round.

1010
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:58,963
Coke is almost here.

1011
00:35:58,963 --> 00:36:00,663
- I just have to drink it. - Okay.

1012
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:01,973
I'm determined to win.

1013
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,103
- Am I number two? - Yes.

1014
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:06,043
(The game starts.)

1015
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:07,303
- Am I number one? - One.

1016
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:08,873
Two.

1017
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,043
(They avoid the water balloon easily.)

1018
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,173
- Did he not throw it? - One.

1019
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:12,413
Two.

1020
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:14,213
It didn't pop.

1021
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:17,153
(The water balloon bounced off of his head.)

1022
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:19,123
- It didn't pop. - Keep going.

1023
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:20,923
Keep playing.

1024
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,023
(The game continues.)

1025
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:24,423
One.

1026
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,423
- It's swinging. - Two.

1027
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:29,263
- It didn't pop. - Wait.

1028
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:31,433
- Why doesn't it pop? - It didn't pop.

1029
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,003
- Keep playing. - What's going on?

1030
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:34,103
- I definitely heard it. - The direction was...

1031
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:35,203
- I heard it. - It didn't pop.

1032
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:36,203
- Keep playing. - Has it started?

1033
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,233
All right.

1034
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:38,973
- Okay. - Are you ready?

1035
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:39,973
Here I go.

1036
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:43,313
- Did you throw it? - Yes.

1037
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:45,313
One.

1038
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:46,813
Two.

1039
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:49,813
This is so scary.

1040
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,513
- One. - It's like Russian roulette.

1041
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,523
Two.

1042
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:54,483
It's so scary.

1043
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:58,423
(The final round shows no sign of ending.)

1044
00:36:58,623 --> 00:36:59,723
- Right now. - One.

1045
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:01,393
Two.

1046
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,263
Two.

1047
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,763
(The water balloon didn't pop again after hitting his face.)

1048
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:07,633
Wait. It doesn't pop.

1049
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,673
Why isn't the balloon popping?

1050
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,343
Tae Hyun. He got hit.

1051
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:14,973
It's hard to pop this balloon.

1052
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:17,943
(It hits right in his face.)

1053
00:37:18,313 --> 00:37:19,943
It's hard to pop this balloon.

1054
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:22,913
(Are you okay?)

1055
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:25,123
It'd be better if my nose bled.

1056
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:26,923
If my nose bled, I'd have won.

1057
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,353
- Right. - It hit him right here.

1058
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:30,453
He took a direct hit,

1059
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:31,453
- Right. - so we'll say that it popped.

1060
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,523
- We should consider it popped. - That was close.

1061
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:35,993
For Seung Ho's carbonated drink,

1062
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:37,033
Yi Kyung won.

1063
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:39,933
In the end, both Yi Kyung and Seung Ho won.

1064
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:40,963
At least, I won a carbonated drink.

1065
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,803
When it comes to things like this, you and I always lose.

1066
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,503
It's always you and me.

1067
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:47,743
For the last game,

1068
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,173
there's 300g of beef at stake.

1069
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:51,513
(300g of Korean beef)

1070
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,013
Behind you, you'll see a hammock.

1071
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,013
Yes.

1072
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:56,853
(Lunch MCC, Round 3)

1073
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,823
While lying in the hammock,

1074
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,953
you must turn around once without using your hands.

1075
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,793
- While lying down, - Without using the hands?

1076
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:05,223
- Right. - do we have to turn once?

1077
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:06,293
Yes.

1078
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:07,923
Is that possible?

1079
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,063
Do we have to spin once inside the hammock?

1080
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,033
- Does that work? - If you can do that...

1081
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:13,603
We'll give you everything.

1082
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,703
- You'll give us everything? - It must be difficult.

1083
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,033
I think I can do it.

1084
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,203
- Try it first. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1085
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,203
Rock-paper-scissors.

1086
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:20,373
No, Dong Hyun should go first.

1087
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,573
No, I'll yield.

1088
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:22,813
- Dong Hyun. - He's going to yield.

1089
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:23,943
You always have to start first.

1090
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:25,383
- Yielding Dong Hyun. - How about this?

1091
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,643
- Give me a little. - No way.

1092
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:28,883
- What? - Dong Hyun.

1093
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:30,853
Play paper. We'll play scissors.

1094
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:32,783
- I'll play paper. - Then we'll play scissors.

1095
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:34,683
- Okay, let's go. - Think hard before you play.

1096
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,853
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1097
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:38,223
(He's the only one who plays rock.)

1098
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:41,323
(Laughing)

1099
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:42,733
What just happened?

1100
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,093
How is this possible?

1101
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:46,433
- What just happened? - The three of us should play first.

1102
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:47,703
- I can't believe it. - What happened?

1103
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,373
- I don't get it. - I thought...

1104
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:50,503
I did it carelessly.

1105
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,703
I told him to...

1106
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,703
I should've thought once more.

1107
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,543
Dong Hyun, just go first from now on.

1108
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,813
- Okay. - Go.

1109
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:58,783
What's this?

1110
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:00,783
It's cold.

1111
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:02,813
It's extremely cold.

1112
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,623
What's going on? Is this necessary?

1113
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:06,753
Hurry up and play.

1114
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,493
- Okay. - We'll help you.

1115
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:11,293
- Okay, sit down like that. - Like this?

1116
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:12,363
That's it.

1117
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,763
- This is nice. - That's it.

1118
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,763
How do we flip without using our hands?

1119
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:18,833
Grab yourself like this.

1120
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:19,903
Does it not work?

1121
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,333
How can you turn around?

1122
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:24,773
Turn around without using the hands? I think I can do it.

1123
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:26,043
You can do it?

1124
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:29,343
(It looks difficult.)

1125
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:30,613
- I'll start. - Okay.

1126
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:31,643
(Dong Hyun starts.)

1127
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:33,083
It seems easy.

1128
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:35,483
It's so easy.

1129
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:36,653
(First, he turns around.)

1130
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:40,123
What will you do next?

1131
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:42,553
This is too easy.

1132
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,823
I doubt I'll fall.

1133
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:49,593
(He claims it's too easy...)

1134
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:51,333
(Then, splash!)

1135
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:55,673
(Dong Hyun doesn't disappoint and drops into the water.)

1136
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:59,343
(Laughing)

1137
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:03,313
It's so cold. The water's freezing!

1138
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,673
I'm not kidding. It's freezing.

1139
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,883
All he said a few times was that it was easy.

1140
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:09,283
"This is too easy."

1141
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:10,383
Hear me out.

1142
00:40:10,383 --> 00:40:11,553
(A tale of how he took a dive)

1143
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:14,253
You'll lose your balance the second you lose control.

1144
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,093
The moment the hammock swivels...

1145
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,923
and you know you're in trouble,

1146
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:18,923
there's no recovering.

1147
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:23,363
This looks tough.

1148
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:24,833
(The end of his tale about how he took a dive)

1149
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,233
I think I'll be able to do it.

1150
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:27,703
Here's a strategy of mine.

1151
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:29,473
(Yi Kyung will go next.)

1152
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:31,173
- It's good to have a strategy. - Here it is.

1153
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,403
I'll swivel along with the hammock.

1154
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,403
Sounds good.

1155
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:36,543
- I'll swivel with the hammock. - You mean, this.

1156
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:37,943
(His goal is to swivel with the hammock.)

1157
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,213
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1158
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:40,343
- Here goes. - You'll break your toes.

1159
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:42,683
- You'll break your toes. - Watch your toes.

1160
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:44,083
Can you push me?

1161
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,753
- Okay, will do. - Give me a gentle push.

1162
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:46,953
- Got it. - Good.

1163
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:49,653
Okay, good. Hold on. You pushed me too hard.

1164
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:51,053
I'm rocking too much.

1165
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:52,993
- Give it some time. - I'll do it.

1166
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:58,633
- I'll swivel. - You can't use your hands.

1167
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:00,703
Did I do it?

1168
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:01,803
(A lame attempt)

1169
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:04,273
You look like the neighborhood fool.

1170
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:05,343
Hold on.

1171
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,103
Push me a little harder.

1172
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,813
- It can't be done. - Push me a little harder.

1173
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:12,083
- No way. - Just work with what you've got.

1174
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,513
It's been a minute and 30 seconds.

1175
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,543
(He gives up swiveling with the hammock.)

1176
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,883
We can use our feet like so.

1177
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:18,313
- This... - Don't use your hands.

1178
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:19,523
- Keep them locked. - Sure.

1179
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:20,783
It's not as easy as it seems.

1180
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:22,553
- You did it. - Hold on.

1181
00:41:23,053 --> 00:41:24,353
Swivel from there.

1182
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:25,723
- You're almost there. - You're doing it.

1183
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,263
- He did it. - He actually did it.

1184
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:29,433
(Bouncing)

1185
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:32,663
How are we supposed to do this after him?

1186
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:34,533
(He pivots using the rebound.)

1187
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,603
He's doing it!

1188
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:41,003
(Will Yi Kyung succeed?)

1189
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:43,063
(Will Yi Kyung succeed?)

1190
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:44,193
He's doing it!

1191
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,463
(As soon as he loses control...)

1192
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,133
(Dunk!)

1193
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,473
You're out!

1194
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:56,073
- You were almost there. - What a bummer.

1195
00:41:56,673 --> 00:41:57,843
You were almost there.

1196
00:41:57,843 --> 00:41:59,813
- How can it be done? - Isn't the water cold?

1197
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:01,213
This is tough.

1198
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,083
Yi Kyung's doing it.
(The moment when he loses control)

1199
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,653
This is too hard to do.

1200
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,953
Tae Hyun's the smallest,

1201
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:11,723
- This is tough. - so he could do it.

1202
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,523
One... Jump on it.

1203
00:42:14,953 --> 00:42:16,363
You can tell he's way lighter.

1204
00:42:16,923 --> 00:42:18,633
- He's light. - This is easier than you think.

1205
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:19,663
You saw us.

1206
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,933
- And go. - Do as we did it. Go.

1207
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,133
(Rocking)

1208
00:42:24,703 --> 00:42:25,803
How...

1209
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:27,803
That's it. Try and rotate.

1210
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,873
You're doing it.

1211
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:30,503
He's light, isn't he?

1212
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:31,543
(Despite worrying, he flipped with ease.)

1213
00:42:33,313 --> 00:42:35,713
(Struggling)

1214
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:36,813
He's done it.

1215
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,483
He'll do it.

1216
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:39,653
He's almost done.

1217
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:42,523
Couldn't it have been plain fabric?

1218
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:43,753
It's scraping his skin.

1219
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,523
There you go.

1220
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:46,993
(Grunting!)

1221
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:50,063
(What was that?)

1222
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:51,063
Hold on.

1223
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,793
(Sneaky)

1224
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,603
You did it.

1225
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,803
I could turn three times on this.

1226
00:42:58,803 --> 00:42:59,803
Really?

1227
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,803
Move.

1228
00:43:01,803 --> 00:43:02,843
(We won't let you do that, Tae Hyun.)

1229
00:43:02,843 --> 00:43:04,443
I won't go in the water.

1230
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:05,443
(They rock him to celebrate his success.)

1231
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:07,513
- I won't go in the water. - You succeeded.

1232
00:43:07,743 --> 00:43:09,283
(Screaming!)

1233
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:12,153
You succeeded, Tae Hyun.

1234
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:13,713
You succeeded. Congratulations.
(He's dunked in the water to celebrate his success.)

1235
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:17,553
- Seriously? - This game was made for him.

1236
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,493
- What a relief. - Why couldn't I have done it?

1237
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,293
Being smaller has an advantage.

1238
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:25,193
Seung Ho, since this is how it's going,

1239
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,063
just win every game there is.

1240
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,393
And go.

1241
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:29,903
(Seung Ho begins.)

1242
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:31,063
Nice.

1243
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:32,803
Do it in a single attempt.

1244
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,003
If you want to succeed, you must move fast.

1245
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,303
- That's it. - I'm dropping.

1246
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:37,543
You're way better at this.

1247
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,343
Wait, not yet.

1248
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:41,873
- You're still doing great. - I'm dropping!

1249
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:43,843
You're still fine.

1250
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:45,143
- You're okay. - Get me out of this.

1251
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:46,183
I...

1252
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:48,213
(Look over here.)

1253
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:50,953
- No, you can't help him. - Watch your foot.

1254
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:52,623
My heel is stuck.

1255
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:54,053
You can't help him.

1256
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:55,153
I'm good.

1257
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:57,093
- I'll give it a try. - Go for it.

1258
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,523
You might not drop.

1259
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:01,333
- I can't move my elbows. - You might not drop.

1260
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,363
You might not drop.

1261
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:03,363
(Trembling)

1262
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,473
Go for it.

1263
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,803
Considering where we're at, you should win all the games.

1264
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:09,543
Just win every prize.

1265
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:11,743
Who are you calling for?

1266
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:12,773
Win every prize.

1267
00:44:13,173 --> 00:44:14,443
- Darn. - You're almost done.

1268
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,013
(He rotates his body but...)

1269
00:44:17,013 --> 00:44:18,283
(Splash!)

1270
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:19,883
It's not as easy as it seems.

1271
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:22,923
Meanwhile, Tae Hyun almost rotated twice.

1272
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:25,393
I had the advantage.

1273
00:44:25,393 --> 00:44:26,953
The bigger you are, the harder it is.

1274
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:29,363
Anyway, Tae Hyun wins first place.

1275
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:31,063
He won fair and square.

1276
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,233
You'll have lunch with the things you bought earlier...

1277
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,803
plus the ingredients you just won.

1278
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:40,103
We suddenly have a lot to eat.

1279
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,503
Let's go!

1280
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:47,873
A meal without meat or carbs.

1281
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,713
Wait, except the winner.

1282
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:52,513
That's a lot of food.

1283
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,913
Dong Hyun, what are you going to have?

1284
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:56,183
- What? - What are you having?

1285
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:57,683
I'll make curry.

1286
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,053
- Curry? - He makes a mean curry,

1287
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:03,163
but he'll make one with lots of carrots.

1288
00:45:03,323 --> 00:45:04,323
- Curry. - Sure.

1289
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:06,163
Carrot curry.

1290
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:07,733
He'll make curry with eight carrots.

1291
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:09,303
Curry.

1292
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:10,963
The seaweed needs to soak longer.

1293
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:12,063
I should cook way later.

1294
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:14,773
(Meanwhile, these two won meat and carbs.)

1295
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,143
(The stove that'll be used to cook the meat)

1296
00:45:16,143 --> 00:45:17,943
(Fire!)

1297
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,073
You don't have to do anything.

1298
00:45:20,673 --> 00:45:22,383
All you have to do is stir-fry that.

1299
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,313
(Nice)

1300
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:27,783
(Meat he hasn't seen in a while)

1301
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:32,753
(A heap of vegetables that'll create the perfect symphony)

1302
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:36,063
(In the best mood ever)

1303
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:38,323
- Have as much as you want. - Here.

1304
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:39,333
Is this the sauce...

1305
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,763
- for the dakgalbi? - Yes.

1306
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:42,833
(Cook everything in the sauce, and the dakgalbi is ready.)

1307
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:44,233
That looks incredible.

1308
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:49,343
(Seung Ho tries the dakgalbi.)

1309
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,573
(A bite)

1310
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:57,213
(Yummy)

1311
00:45:57,943 --> 00:46:00,153
(Staring...)

1312
00:46:00,513 --> 00:46:03,023
Didn't we buy the shrimp for all of us?

1313
00:46:03,783 --> 00:46:05,153
It's not cooked yet, is it?

1314
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,493
- It is. - Really?

1315
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:11,063
(Trying a shrimp that's cooked in the dakgalbi sauce)

1316
00:46:13,493 --> 00:46:15,133
(Satisfied)

1317
00:46:15,703 --> 00:46:16,863
How is it?

1318
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:18,603
(No words are needed.)

1319
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,303
(Meanwhile, Mr. Carrot Curry...)

1320
00:46:21,303 --> 00:46:23,343
There's nothing to add in the curry.

1321
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:25,103
All I can add are these carrots.

1322
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:28,073
What a disaster.

1323
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:30,483
This...

1324
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,413
You know it's better when you cut them into random shapes.

1325
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:33,513
Of course.

1326
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,753
This is how it should be done.

1327
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:39,493
Does that all go in there? Is that how you make curry?

1328
00:46:40,993 --> 00:46:42,023
(2nd batch of carrots)

1329
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:43,463
(3rd batch of carrots)

1330
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:45,193
Curry can be made differently,

1331
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,333
and he's making his with lots of carrots.

1332
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:48,293
- Will he then boil it? - I know my curry...

1333
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:50,763
since I've been having it for 20 years now.

1334
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:52,833
You've only had curry for 20 years?

1335
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:55,233
- Aren't you over 40? - Oh, it's been longer.

1336
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:57,303
About 30 years.

1337
00:46:58,103 --> 00:46:59,973
You see, I love curry...

1338
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:01,613
- It hasn't been that long. - so much.

1339
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:04,313
My mom taught me the recipe so I could make it myself.

1340
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:05,313
(Infinitely chopping carrots going into the curry)

1341
00:47:08,513 --> 00:47:10,053
I'm sorry,

1342
00:47:10,283 --> 00:47:12,823
but there are this many carrots in the pot.

1343
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:14,853
(Is this how it should be?)

1344
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:15,963
He has two more to chop.

1345
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:17,423
Is there a stable here I didn't know about?

1346
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:20,093
This will save the day later on.

1347
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:22,563
I can't wait for Dong Hyun's curry.

1348
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:23,663
You'll fall in love with it.

1349
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:24,663
(How will it taste?)

1350
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:25,703
I mean it.

1351
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:27,973
I'll go ahead and open my soda.

1352
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,403
What a treat.

1353
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:31,503
(He won a can of coke in the additional game they played.)

1354
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:33,443
(Chugging)

1355
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:37,643
(Thrilling)

1356
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:39,413
My eyes are wide open now.

1357
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,183
Coke is what you need.

1358
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,583
Really? Got it.

1359
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,723
(They all have a can of coke.)

1360
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:49,093
This is nice.

1361
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:50,723
(Everyone has a soda but me.)

1362
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:55,193
(The beef will now be placed on the grill.)

1363
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:02,443
(With the help of the team's meat specialist)

1364
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:05,773
(Flavors are added to the beef.)

1365
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:07,043
(My gosh)

1366
00:48:07,043 --> 00:48:08,143
That's the best.

1367
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:10,283
You seem rich and privileged.

1368
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:12,553
(Laughing)

1369
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:16,953
(The glistening beef makes your mouth water.)

1370
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:18,423
I'll see what Tae Hyun's up to.

1371
00:48:20,123 --> 00:48:21,693
(No way...)

1372
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:25,693
(Mr. Carrot is drawn to the smell of the meat.)

1373
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:27,493
Hurry up with that curry of yours.

1374
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:29,803
Sure. Should we swap?

1375
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,263
No.

1376
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:33,503
We want to try the curry.

1377
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:34,503
(Bummer...)

1378
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,603
If your curry is good...

1379
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:38,503
You'll give me a chunk?

1380
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:40,013
I'll give you a few pieces.

1381
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,013
(Unimpressed)

1382
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:42,313
But curry isn't here yet.

1383
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:43,843
Curry will take a while.

1384
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:44,983
Tae Hyun.

1385
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:47,453
(Carrot curry hasn't even boiled yet.)

1386
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:48,853
Curry will take some time to cook.

1387
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:50,523
It will taste bad when it gets cold, so I'll eat this first...

1388
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:51,923
and give you curry later.

1389
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,523
- After you eat beef? - Yes.

1390
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,053
What if the curry tastes bad?

1391
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:56,393
It'll definitely taste good.

1392
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,123
I guarantee that.

1393
00:48:58,493 --> 00:48:59,593
I'll give you a refund if it tastes bad.

1394
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:00,933
We can't do that.

1395
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,033
(Negotiation failed)

1396
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:05,133
That looks amazing.

1397
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:08,433
You cut them into big pieces.

1398
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:10,173
It's done.

1399
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:12,373
Can I join you?

1400
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:13,473
Sure.

1401
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:16,443
(How Yi Kyung got to join them to eat beef)

1402
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:18,483
Can I join you when you eat beef if I succeed?

1403
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:21,113
(Tae Hyun accepted Yi Kyung's proposal to eat together.)

1404
00:49:21,613 --> 00:49:24,483
(Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung played the game to eat beef.)

1405
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:25,553
Two, three.

1406
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:28,353
(Mr. Carrot Curry failed miserably.)

1407
00:49:29,093 --> 00:49:30,893
(Surprised)

1408
00:49:30,893 --> 00:49:31,923
You got it.

1409
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:36,003
(Yi Kyung succeeded with clenched teeth.)

1410
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:39,133
(With much effort, Yi Kyung was able to eat beef.)

1411
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:41,433
Take your time.

1412
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:44,543
(Only I don't have meat to eat.)

1413
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:47,473
(They start eating meat.)

1414
00:49:47,843 --> 00:49:49,843
(A piece of well-cooked beef on plain rice)

1415
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,353
(Taking a big bite)

1416
00:49:57,183 --> 00:49:58,223
It's seasoned perfectly, right?

1417
00:49:58,223 --> 00:49:59,353
(He grilled the beef.)

1418
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:01,453
It sure is different when you have it with rice.

1419
00:50:01,723 --> 00:50:03,593
It makes your eyes fly open.

1420
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:05,863
It'll take forever...

1421
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:06,933
(Mr. Carrot is getting more impatient.)

1422
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:09,263
for this to boil. I think the fire is too weak.

1423
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:10,903
Tae Hyun.

1424
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:13,633
I'm doing my best with the curry.

1425
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,173
(They're not interested in curry when they have meat with them.)

1426
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:18,473
Can I try a piece too?

1427
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:20,173
(He willingly lets Seung Ho eat it, since he shared shrimp with him.)

1428
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:21,943
Try that one. It's delicious.

1429
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:23,683
(Feeling very impatient)

1430
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:24,783
I'll try the original flavor.

1431
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:25,953
(Feeling very impatient)

1432
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:27,453
(It looks tasty.)

1433
00:50:27,453 --> 00:50:28,953
Let me add some gochujang.

1434
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:30,283
(They somehow end up playing in teams for lunch too.)

1435
00:50:30,283 --> 00:50:32,823
It tastes sweet after some time because of the rice.

1436
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:34,393
(They somehow end up playing in teams for lunch too.)

1437
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:37,793
(He can't bring himself to leave.)

1438
00:50:37,863 --> 00:50:38,993
The curry will taste amazing.

1439
00:50:38,993 --> 00:50:40,363
I can't wait to taste it.

1440
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,233
The fire is too weak.

1441
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:44,133
It might take 20 minutes, and the meat will be gone by then.

1442
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,873
Can't you cook it faster?

1443
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:47,533
I made curry for 30 years,

1444
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:50,043
and I've never failed once.

1445
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:51,473
Today could be your first failure.

1446
00:50:51,473 --> 00:50:53,313
No, I've never failed.

1447
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:54,473
(Opening wide)

1448
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:56,483
(Disappointed)

1449
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,313
(He leaves bitterly.)

1450
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:00,053
The fire is too weak.

1451
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:01,083
Sang Uk has arrived.

1452
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,923
(Sang Uk has arrived.)

1453
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:04,023
Sang Uk has arrived.

1454
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:05,853
(Ta-da)

1455
00:51:05,853 --> 00:51:06,893
You worked hard.

1456
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:08,893
- Sang Uk. - You came at the right time.

1457
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:09,963
My gosh.

1458
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:11,763
- I'm hungry. - Sang Uk.

1459
00:51:11,763 --> 00:51:12,833
- I'm so hungry. - What about lunch?

1460
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,493
- How was it? - I haven't had one.

1461
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:15,733
- You haven't eaten? - There's a hammock outside.

1462
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:17,303
If you spin one round in it, you can eat.

1463
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:18,333
- A hammock? - Yes.

1464
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,933
Sit in the water...

1465
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,033
and avoid some balloons first.

1466
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:22,073
What? Tae Hyun.

1467
00:51:22,673 --> 00:51:24,203
(What about me?)

1468
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,743
He came back from a competition.

1469
00:51:26,973 --> 00:51:28,473
- What? - He came back from a competition.

1470
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:29,743
Why? You can't eat?
Because that's his job.

1471
00:51:30,743 --> 00:51:31,913
Am I not supposed to eat?

1472
00:51:32,383 --> 00:51:33,883
No, you can eat.

1473
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:34,953
Do you know what today is about?

1474
00:51:35,183 --> 00:51:36,523
- I don't. - You don't?

1475
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:37,783
Guess.

1476
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:41,193
As in, shortage in what?

1477
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:44,163
It's so slow.

1478
00:51:44,163 --> 00:51:45,493
(Looking around)

1479
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:46,763
When will it boil?

1480
00:51:47,293 --> 00:51:48,663
Water... No.

1481
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:50,803
What are we in shortage of today?

1482
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:52,933
Everything looks nice.

1483
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,903
You need to find out.

1484
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,443
(While Sang Uk is guessing,)

1485
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:02,343
(the beef is finishing up quickly.)

1486
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:04,583
(Glancing)

1487
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:05,783
Dong Hyun, hurry up.

1488
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:07,553
Yi Kyung is finishing it all.

1489
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:09,383
Tae Hyun.

1490
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:12,023
My curry has a long history.

1491
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:13,593
What kind of history? Tell me.

1492
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,753
- I really... - Since when?

1493
00:52:15,993 --> 00:52:17,363
(Dong Hyun's story about curry)

1494
00:52:17,363 --> 00:52:18,623
(Young Dong Hyun really liked curry.)

1495
00:52:18,623 --> 00:52:19,993
(So he often pestered his mom to make curry.)

1496
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:21,363
(One day, his mom called him and said, "I'll only cook curry...")

1497
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:22,633
("for one month. Let's see if you still like it afterward.")

1498
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:23,903
(Young Dong Hyun ate curry all the way,)

1499
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:25,103
(and his mom taught him how to make his own curry.)

1500
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:26,573
(That's how Dong Hyun's curry life started.)

1501
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:28,533
- Sang Uk. - Let's see who wins.

1502
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:30,443
- Eat this. - Yes, for the whole month.

1503
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,403
Eat this?

1504
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:33,913
(Seung Ho shares his dakgalbi with Sang Uk who's hungry.)

1505
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:35,513
(He eats it...)

1506
00:52:35,513 --> 00:52:37,183
(since it's given to him.)

1507
00:52:37,513 --> 00:52:39,143
(He sits down naturally.)

1508
00:52:39,143 --> 00:52:40,553
Isn't it good?

1509
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,683
(He has no idea about today's theme,)

1510
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:46,353
(but he eats since he's told to.)

1511
00:52:49,293 --> 00:52:50,323
Hold on.

1512
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,023
What are we in shortage of, really?

1513
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:54,533
Everything is so plentiful today.

1514
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:55,663
I love this.

1515
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:57,963
- There's a lot of delicious food. - Observe carefully.

1516
00:52:58,003 --> 00:52:59,063
Can he eat like this?

1517
00:52:59,103 --> 00:53:00,403
Things aren't exactly plentiful.

1518
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:03,573
(Strangely, only Dong Hyun's lunch is lacking.)

1519
00:53:03,573 --> 00:53:04,703
Sang Uk.

1520
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:07,573
Why won't this cook?

1521
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,783
It'll only start cooking by the time we return home.

1522
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:11,083
It's starting to cook now.

1523
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:13,153
There are three pieces left.

1524
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:15,253
Dong Hyun and Sang Uk, play rock-paper-scissors.

1525
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:17,153
The winner gets a piece.

1526
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,653
Sang Uk.

1527
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,793
You had beef already, right?

1528
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:21,253
I did.

1529
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:22,723
And I'm craving more.

1530
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:24,623
- I didn't get to try at all. - Hurry up.

1531
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:25,963
It's better to keep it that way.

1532
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:27,433
When you eat one, it makes you want more.

1533
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:28,593
Throw scissors.

1534
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:30,103
I'll throw rock, so throw scissors.

1535
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:31,103
(Dong Hyun kept losing today.)

1536
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:32,163
- Okay. - Let's play.

1537
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,633
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Who will win?

1538
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:35,303
You're clearly...

1539
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:36,803
beneath me.

1540
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:38,443
You're clearly beneath me.

1541
00:53:38,443 --> 00:53:39,443
You only thought of one step ahead, didn't you?

1542
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:40,943
- I only thought of one step ahead. - Who won?

1543
00:53:40,943 --> 00:53:41,973
I won.

1544
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:44,443
There's only one piece left.

1545
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,313
It's nice.

1546
00:53:46,313 --> 00:53:48,353
(Ecstatic)

1547
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,783
The last one.

1548
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:50,783
(One more piece)

1549
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:51,823
It's so delicious.

1550
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:54,493
Seriously though, what is today's theme?

1551
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:55,653
- I'll give you a hint. - It's so delicious.

1552
00:53:55,653 --> 00:53:57,323
It's Shortage in MCC.

1553
00:53:57,823 --> 00:53:58,923
MCC?

1554
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:01,763
(Additional hint)

1555
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:03,433
- He gave you a hint. - Carbohydrates.

1556
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:05,403
Carbonated drinks.

1557
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:06,733
What about M?

1558
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:09,073
- Meat. - Correct.

1559
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,473
But there's so much of them.

1560
00:54:10,473 --> 00:54:11,643
We played games to win them.

1561
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:13,243
(The abundance was gained with hard work.)

1562
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:15,313
We eat those three the most.

1563
00:54:15,313 --> 00:54:17,183
They really chose what we were in shortage of.

1564
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:20,153
(While Sang Uk learns about today's Life in Shortage,)

1565
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,553
(Yi Kyung's shrimp seaweed soup is complete.)

1566
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:23,823
It smells good.

1567
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:24,883
Curry.

1568
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:26,623
(Dong Hyun's curry-flavored carrot is almost done too.)

1569
00:54:26,893 --> 00:54:28,593
I cooked curry for 40 years.

1570
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:29,663
(The curry master honed his skills since he was five years old.)

1571
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:31,393
It will taste delicious...

1572
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,623
with rice.

1573
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:34,933
- There's no rice. - Forty years.

1574
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:36,463
- What? - There's no rice.

1575
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:38,403
Since there's no carbs?

1576
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:40,573
It's tear-soaked curry.

1577
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:42,473
I relied on curry to go through my toughest years.

1578
00:54:42,473 --> 00:54:43,803
Look at the floating ingredients.

1579
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:45,173
(It looks rather delicious.)

1580
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:47,513
I don't know whose this is, but it has a lot of shrimps.

1581
00:54:47,513 --> 00:54:48,973
- Here, sir. - Nice.

1582
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:50,243
- My goodness. - It's amazing.

1583
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,383
Wait.

1584
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,053
(It looks tasty.)

1585
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:55,513
It looks pretty legit.

1586
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:57,923
Of course it does. I've been saying that I've cooked curry for 40 years.

1587
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:02,453
(Tae Hyun trusts the curry master and takes a bite.)

1588
00:55:02,823 --> 00:55:04,293
(Satisfied)

1589
00:55:04,293 --> 00:55:05,323
It's not bad, right?

1590
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:07,063
Good job.

1591
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:10,433
(The curry master tries a spoonful too.)

1592
00:55:12,163 --> 00:55:13,333
It's tasty.

1593
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,673
(Sang Uk goes for shrimps instead of carrots!)

1594
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:23,543
(Humming)

1595
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:25,083
It's delicious. Good job.

1596
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,153
My gosh.

1597
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:29,153
I wasn't expecting much, but it's really good.

1598
00:55:31,283 --> 00:55:35,523
(Mr. Carrot's carrot curry is widely loved!)

1599
00:55:36,263 --> 00:55:37,823
- I approve of your curry. - How...

1600
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,023
It's good, right?

1601
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:40,833
(The first meal of Shortage in MCC is successful!)

1602
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,603
A can of coke would go so well with this.

1603
00:55:43,603 --> 00:55:46,133
(Their delicious lunch is over.)

1604
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:49,473
Just do once a day.

1605
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,073
My goodness.

1606
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:52,203
Calm down.

1607
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:53,443
Is there something inside?

1608
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:54,973
Did they set something?

1609
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:56,313
They locked the doors again, didn't they?

1610
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:57,743
Is this a negotiation table?

1611
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:00,253
(Ta-da)

1612
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:02,113
(They already had a meal, so what's this table for?)

1613
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,283
What's this?

1614
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:04,383
(They already had a meal, so what's this table for?)

1615
00:56:05,023 --> 00:56:06,693
The air conditioner is turned on.

1616
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:09,893
You all had fun...

1617
00:56:09,893 --> 00:56:10,923
playing with water...

1618
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:12,123
and eating delicious food.

1619
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:13,433
That's good and all,

1620
00:56:13,963 --> 00:56:16,733
but I thought we should talk about something more constructive.

1621
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:18,803
- Something constructive? - But...

1622
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:21,133
Sure, we need that too.

1623
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:23,443
Seung Ho. Can you open the curtains?

1624
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:25,073
What is it now?

1625
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:26,813
- I prepared something for you. - I'll open this side.

1626
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:28,473
- Did you guys do something? - One, two, three.

1627
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:32,483
(The 2nd Half of 2025, Handsome Guys Workshop)

1628
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:35,583
(Are We Really Okay to Continue This Way?)

1629

(A strategy meeting to become a regular show)

1630
00:56:38,683 --> 00:56:40,453
We're still doing this?

1631
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:43,523
(We're still a pilot with 43 episodes.)

1632
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:45,293
"Are we really okay to continue this way?"

1633
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:47,663
"A strategy meeting to become a regular show."

1634
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:49,463
But...

1635
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:52,663
you each have a forbidden phrase...

1636
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:54,533
for the discussion.

1637
00:56:55,403 --> 00:56:56,843
(A forbidden phrase?)

1638
00:56:56,843 --> 00:56:57,843
When you discuss...

1639
00:56:57,843 --> 00:56:59,303
- When we discuss? - Yes.

1640
00:56:59,303 --> 00:57:00,413
(Throughout the discussion?)

1641
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:01,573
After the discussion,

1642
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:04,583
the two who least mentioned their forbidden phrase...

1643
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:07,013
will get a dessert and carbonated drinks.

1644
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:08,213
- Carbonated drinks. - A dessert?

1645
00:57:08,213 --> 00:57:09,383
- Carbonated drinks. - What dessert?

1646
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:11,253
Show us now.

1647
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:12,653
Carbonated drinks. Nice.

1648
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:14,253
What dessert is it?

1649
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:17,823
(Sweet happiness after a meal! Desserts and carbonated drinks)

(forbidden phrase Game disguised as a discussion)

1651
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:23,263
Please reveal your forbidden phrase...

1652
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:25,003
- one by one. - Help each other remove it.

1653
00:57:25,003 --> 00:57:26,063
I'll remove it for you.

1654
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,933
(Tae Hyun's forbidden phrase)

1655
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:31,173
(Why)

1656
00:57:31,643 --> 00:57:33,243
How can you avoid using this phrase?

1657
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:35,073
(Things are getting exciting.)

1658
00:57:35,143 --> 00:57:37,143
"How can you avoid using this phrase?"

1660
00:57:39,553 --> 00:57:44,123
(I think)

1661
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:45,183
I'll help you remove it.

1662
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:46,453
This kind of phrase?

1663
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:47,593
(Seung Ho's forbidden phrase)

1664
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:49,793
(No)

1665
00:57:49,793 --> 00:57:51,093
It's perfect for him.

1666
00:57:51,193 --> 00:57:52,293
(Dong Hyun's forbidden phrase)

1667
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:53,333
It's perfect for Tae Hyun.

1668
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:55,263
Is mine good? It must be good.

1669
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:56,763
I'll remove it.

1670
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:57,863
(Yi Kyung's forbidden phrase)

1671
00:57:57,863 --> 00:57:58,903
(We, us, or our)

1672
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:00,533
The phrases are all varied.

1673
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:03,173
You all got the phrase that you use often.

1674
00:58:03,173 --> 00:58:04,743
- I agree. - What we each use often?

1675
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,013
I think it will be a close match.

1676
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:08,213
When someone mentions...

1677
00:58:08,213 --> 00:58:10,243
their forbidden phrase while talking,

1678
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:11,343
use a toy hammer.

1679
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,253
- Take these. - What toy hammer?

1680
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:15,053
Take a toy hammer each.

1681
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:18,653
Hit the person who said the phrase so they can guess what it is.

1682
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:20,453
- Don't hit right away. - Don't hit right away.

1683
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:22,423
Hit like this after some time passes.

1684
00:58:23,063 --> 00:58:24,563
Now,

1685
00:58:24,563 --> 00:58:26,833
let the discussion commence.

1686
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:29,803
Before we start getting serious...

1687
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:31,533
about whether we're okay...

1688
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,473
to continue the way we've been doing...

1689
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:34,633
(Hit)

1690
00:58:34,773 --> 00:58:36,603
Whether we're okay to continue the way we've been doing...

1691
00:58:38,503 --> 00:58:40,113
(What did I do?)

1692
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:42,343
(Team Handsome teases Dong Hyun from the start.)

1693
00:58:42,343 --> 00:58:43,783
You can't just hit me.

1694
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:45,683
- Continue what you were saying. - Did I say the phrase?

1695
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,813
I'll stop talking.

1696
00:58:48,413 --> 00:58:49,883
(It's my loss if I speak up.)

1697
00:58:49,883 --> 00:58:51,383
I didn't hear him say the phrase.

1698
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:52,993
What... I said it already?

1699
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:55,353
- Continue what you were saying. - Okay, I will.

1700
00:58:55,353 --> 00:58:57,393
I can't say I know it all,

1701
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,563
but nowadays, with the increase in OTT platforms...

1702
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:02,433
and broadcast stations,

1703
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:05,533
the overall viewer rating of TV shows...

1704
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:06,873
- have declined. - Yes.

1705
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:08,933
Since that's the case, the viewer rating...

1706
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,603
People watch our show on OTT platforms...

1707
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:13,813
and YouTube and so on.

1708
00:59:13,943 --> 00:59:15,043
Considering that...

1709
00:59:15,043 --> 00:59:16,113
(No.)

1710
00:59:16,713 --> 00:59:19,383
I think we're doing fine.

1711
00:59:19,383 --> 00:59:20,453
(Snoring)

1712
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:22,383
(Sleeping)

1713
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:25,323
(It's so boring from the start.)

1714
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:26,423
Hit him.

1715
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:28,393
Why?

1716
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,093
(He got hit in advance for saying the forbidden phrase.)

1717
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:33,893
Why?

1718
00:59:33,893 --> 00:59:36,503
Hit him.

1719
00:59:36,503 --> 00:59:37,663
(Getting hit without knowing why)

1720
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:39,463
Tae Hyun, we'll hit you if you doze off.

1721
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:42,103
The viewer rating...

1722
00:59:42,573 --> 00:59:45,743
It doesn't go up just because you give it your all.

1723
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:48,513
(A delayed attack)

1724
00:59:49,113 --> 00:59:50,543
(What did I say?)

1725
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:53,483
It doesn't go up just because we want it to.

1726
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:57,183
So I'm grateful to the viewers...

1727
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:59,653
for the viewer rating we get now.

1728
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,823
We should build a strong foundation for the show...

1729
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:04,323
So you're saying that we don't need to change?

1730
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:07,463
Tae Hyun, you can compile our opinions...

1731
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,663
and relay it to the chief director.

1732
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:12,333
- Who should do it? - You, Tae Hyun.

1733
01:00:13,033 --> 01:00:14,273
- Me? - If...

1734
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:15,373
You should go, Tae Hyun, since you're the oldest.

1735
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:16,403
- Me? - Yes.

1736
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:17,543
Why should I?

1737
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:20,473
Because you're the oldest, Tae Hyun.

1738
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,843
I have to go because I'm the oldest?

1739
01:00:22,843 --> 01:00:23,883
Among us...

1740
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,343
(The oldest and the second oldest rack up points from the start.)

1741
01:00:25,343 --> 01:00:26,653
- What? - Is my phrase "me?"

1742
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:28,213
Just because.

1743
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:30,883
Why did they hit me?

1744
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:33,123
- What is it? - For me...

1745
01:00:33,123 --> 01:00:35,323
(These two are smoothly digging their own graves.)

1746
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,323
I said this to the chief director confidently.

1747
01:00:38,693 --> 01:00:41,433
As a viewer myself, I dare say...

1748
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:43,703
I can't be objective since I'm on the show myself.

1749
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,903
I'm enjoying myself now.

1750
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:47,773
- When Dong Hyun... - I really like it now.

1751
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:50,143
fought with the hammock, for example.

1752
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:51,573
- You like how things are now? - Yes.

1753
01:00:51,743 --> 01:00:55,743
I'm curious. If Director Bong Joon Ho...

1754
01:00:56,343 --> 01:00:58,613
casts you in his movie...

1755
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,553
under the condition that...

1756
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:03,083
you have to quit Handsome Guys,

1757
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:05,483
what will you tell him?

1758
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:06,823
Okay.

1759
01:01:06,823 --> 01:01:09,863
(Okay.)

1760
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:11,063
"Okay, I will do that."

1761
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:12,623
(Did you think he'd say no?)

1762
01:01:12,623 --> 01:01:14,963
What about you, Yi Kyung?

1763
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,433
- It's Director Bong. - Director Bong is a hotshot.

1764
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:17,433
Okay.

1765
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,333
(Laughing)

1766
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,173
- Are you just going to be smiling? - No.

1767
01:01:22,173 --> 01:01:23,373
- Oh Sang Uk. - I was listening.

1768
01:01:23,373 --> 01:01:24,843
I should listen first before I speak up.

1769
01:01:24,843 --> 01:01:26,203
- I have 2 ears and 1 mouth. - Then...

1770
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:28,243
the third version of our show.

1771
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:30,513
What do you think about our show?

1772
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:31,683
(Leading him with the question to say his forbidden phrase)

1773
01:01:32,483 --> 01:01:35,983
I think now is definitely more interesting than before.

1774
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:38,523
Better than the eating show version?

1775
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:41,493
Yes. Back then, it was focused on us eating delicious food...

1776
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,463
with some fun stuff in between.

1777
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:45,023
But after the format changed...

1778
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,693
- You think it's better than before? - Sorry?

1779
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:48,393
- Better than before? - I think it's so much better.

1780
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:50,603
Then as the youngest,

1781
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:53,333
what do you think of the members?

1782
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,333
(Looking around)

1783
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,443
The members?

1784
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:57,803
Don't think about the forbidden phrase.

1785
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:59,743
- Just say what you want. - I'm not thinking about it.

1786
01:02:00,613 --> 01:02:01,613
(Hit)

1787
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:03,843
Don't think about it.

1788
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:05,143
- Don't think about it. - Don't think about it.

1789
01:02:05,183 --> 01:02:07,353
(What did I say?)

1790
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:09,583
- Don't think about it. - Don't think about it.

1791
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:11,253
After the format changed to this,

1792
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:14,993
I think everyone found their own unique character.

1793
01:02:14,993 --> 01:02:16,023
- Good. - Yes.

1794
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,163
The format changed in a way...

1795
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:20,593
that it can't be boring.

1796
01:02:20,763 --> 01:02:23,333
It's not our fault. It's the editor's fault.

1797
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:24,663
That's my thought.

1798
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:25,663
(Hit)

1799
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:29,003
I have no idea with how you hit me.

1800
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:30,843
I don't think now is the right time...

1801
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,643
- for this meeting. - Yes.

1802
01:02:32,643 --> 01:02:35,343
The third version of our show will be aired this week.

1803
01:02:35,673 --> 01:02:37,283
We should check how well it does first.

1804
01:02:37,283 --> 01:02:39,953
- I think so too. - We should see how it does first.

1805
01:02:40,213 --> 01:02:41,313
Have we...

1806
01:02:41,683 --> 01:02:44,253
ever changed the format according to our own will?

1807
01:02:45,253 --> 01:02:46,653
We were just doing our thing,

1808
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:49,593
and they suddenly tell us that we need to change it.

1809
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:50,963
"Why?"

1810
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:52,623
"Why?"

1811
01:02:52,623 --> 01:02:54,133
The higher-ups want it changed.

1812
01:02:54,433 --> 01:02:55,563
- Come here. - What?

1813
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,263
(Come here so I can hit you.)

1814
01:02:58,063 --> 01:03:00,433
(What is it?)

1815
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:02,833
The higher-ups want it changed.

1816
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:05,703
The issue isn't about becoming a regular show.

1817
01:03:05,703 --> 01:03:07,213
It's tvN's fault.

1818
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,743
- You just declared war on tvN. - Yes.

1819
01:03:10,213 --> 01:03:11,283
(We, us, or our)

1820
01:03:11,283 --> 01:03:12,743
I love tvN.

1821
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,653
I'd like to make it clear...

1822
01:03:14,653 --> 01:03:16,853
that it's purely Cha Tae Hyun's personal opinion.

1823
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:18,723
Yes.

1824
01:03:18,723 --> 01:03:19,783
- I love you, tvN. - That's the dream...

1825
01:03:19,783 --> 01:03:21,823
I had last night.

1826
01:03:23,963 --> 01:03:26,693
I had such dream last night.

1827
01:03:26,693 --> 01:03:28,633
So I got very startled and said,

1828
01:03:28,963 --> 01:03:31,533
"Don't say that!"

1829
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:35,233
(I love you, tvN.)

1830
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:38,273
When the preview of the third version was released,

1831
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:39,943
someone commented,

1832
01:03:40,973 --> 01:03:43,213
"I finally got used to the eating show format."

1833
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:44,783
"Why are you changing it again?"

1834
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,183
- Yes. - That was the comment.

1835
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:48,453
(A fan was upset about changing the format.)

1836
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:49,983
I thought this to myself.

1837
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,953
"Our show is much more interesting with the new format."

1838
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,693
It is much more interesting.

1839
01:03:53,693 --> 01:03:55,153
That's very true.

1840
01:03:55,153 --> 01:03:56,723
Did I never mention my forbidden phrase so far?

1841
01:03:56,863 --> 01:03:57,893
What?

1842
01:03:59,123 --> 01:04:00,133
Come to think of it...

1843
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,163
(Actually, you said it too many times.)

1844
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:03,133
- You didn't talk much. - I'm not sure, but I think you did.

1845
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,333
I'm constantly talking.

1846
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:08,933
("Our" show)

1847
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,043
("Our" channel)

1848
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:11,243
("We," according to "our" will)

1849
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:12,303
("We")

1850
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,313
(He's also said "us," between "us," and so on,)

1851
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:16,073
(mentioning his phrase 22 times and landing himself in 1st place.)

1852
01:04:16,073 --> 01:04:17,483
For the current third version,

1853
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:19,183
our chemistry is important.

1854
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,853
Without Sang Uk just now,

1855
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:22,353
it felt very empty.

1856
01:04:22,353 --> 01:04:23,583
(Yi Kyung, 23, Dong Hyun, 8, Seung Ho, 3, Sang Uk, 6)

1857
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,023
- When? - I agree.

1858
01:04:25,023 --> 01:04:26,283
- With one of us gone... - Without you...

1859
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:27,723
Right, there's that too.

1860
01:04:28,293 --> 01:04:30,123
We need one more member.

1861
01:04:30,393 --> 01:04:31,693
- We can do that. - So we can switch...

1862
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,163
- So it'll be more flexible. - with more flexibility.

1863
01:04:33,163 --> 01:04:34,193
- We can do that. - I think that's a good idea.

1864
01:04:34,193 --> 01:04:35,233
- And... - Yes.

1865
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:37,333
Then let's recommend a potential member.

1866
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,503
(Recommend a new member.)

1867
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,303
Six regular members...

1868
01:04:40,303 --> 01:04:41,603
and two guests each episode.

1869
01:04:41,603 --> 01:04:43,643
Six to eight people. That's just nice.

1870
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:45,543
There won't be guests.

1871
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:46,743
There won't?

1872
01:04:46,943 --> 01:04:48,973
Listen when we talk.

1873
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:50,083
Okay.

1874
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:53,513
A discussion is where you say your opinions.

1875
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:56,653
You also need to listen to what others have to say.

1876
01:04:56,653 --> 01:04:57,723
I can't listen to all.

1877
01:04:57,723 --> 01:04:59,953
Just focusing on what you want to say isn't a discussion.

1878
01:04:59,953 --> 01:05:02,053
He proudly said, "I can't listen to all."

1879
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:06,193
That's "100-Minute Discussion."

1880
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,233
Let's move on.

1881
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:09,493
Recommend one person each.

1882
01:05:09,663 --> 01:05:11,203
- My gosh. - By the way,

1883
01:05:11,263 --> 01:05:13,673
Sang Uk, are you going to keep silent?

1884
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:15,833
Since it's a discussion, I was listening.

1885
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:18,203
- I'll recommend someone first. - Okay.

1886
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:21,213
This should work out best.

1887
01:05:21,843 --> 01:05:22,973
Out of everyone we've seen,

1888
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:25,283
I think it was really funny when comedians came.

1889
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:26,853
- I see. - And?

1890
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:28,613
- Out of comedians... - Moon Se Yoon.

1891
01:05:28,613 --> 01:05:29,753
Yes, people like him.

1892
01:05:29,853 --> 01:05:31,253
Do you think it's a good idea for a comedian to join?

1893
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:32,883
I think a comedian would work nicely.

1894
01:05:33,223 --> 01:05:34,393
Because...

1895
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:35,953
(Smirking)

1896
01:05:35,953 --> 01:05:37,793
I think the show became very rich.

1897
01:05:38,263 --> 01:05:40,463
- Even for the eating show. - Hit yourself once.

1898
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:42,093
(Thinking)

1899
01:05:42,393 --> 01:05:43,703
I think? Yes?

1900
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:45,033
- Hit yourself. - Is it "yes?"

1901
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:46,103
(Yi Kyung, 23, Dong Hyun, 8, Seung Ho, 3, Sang Uk, 11)

1902
01:05:46,103 --> 01:05:47,173
(Hit)

1903
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:51,803
For me, I want to recommend the person who came on our show.

1904
01:05:51,803 --> 01:05:53,073
He's my friend who is older than me.

1905
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:54,613
We had a lot of fun with him.

1906
01:05:54,613 --> 01:05:56,043
- Sung Hoon? - If Sung Hoon joins the show,

1907
01:05:56,043 --> 01:05:57,313
it'll be fun.

1908
01:05:57,313 --> 01:05:58,543
He's very popular nowadays too.

1909
01:05:58,543 --> 01:06:00,113
Tell us about other friends you have who are older than you.

1910
01:06:00,113 --> 01:06:02,153
- You only talk about Sung Hoon. - Sung Hoon...

1911
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:03,523
Do you have other older friends?

1912
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:05,023
- Other older friends? - Yes, other older friends.

1913
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:07,753
Since many of TV watchers are in their 40s or older,

1914
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:09,123
to increase the viewer rating...

1915
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:10,363
we should get someone...

1916
01:06:10,363 --> 01:06:11,523
(Yi Kyung, 23, Dong Hyun, 11, Seung Ho, 3, Sang Uk, 11)

1917
01:06:11,523 --> 01:06:14,463
who is liked by all generations. Young Woong.

1918
01:06:14,463 --> 01:06:15,693
Lim Young Woong.

1919
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:16,763
(He's younger than you.)

1920
01:06:16,763 --> 01:06:19,603
Can you treat him as your elder?

1921
01:06:19,603 --> 01:06:22,403
(Can you treat him as your elder?)

1922
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:25,403
- If he joins the show? - Definitely.

1923
01:06:25,403 --> 01:06:27,073
Say something to Young Woong, and treat him as your elder.

1924
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:28,473
He might watch the show.

1925
01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:30,313
Young Woong.

1926
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:32,613
I'll treat you as my elder.

1927
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:33,983
Please join us.

1928
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:36,083
So that we won't have any more meetings like this,

1929
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,423
let's do this show together for five years.

1930
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,283
(Laughing)

1931
01:06:39,283 --> 01:06:41,253
- To whom? - Lim Young... What?

1932
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:42,953
- Young Woong. - Mr. Lim Young Woong.

1933
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:44,763
Don't call him "Mr."

1934
01:06:44,763 --> 01:06:46,193
- Call him more friendly. - Lim Young Woong.

1935
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,793
Address him formally.

1936
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:49,293
Lim Young Woong, I'll treat you as my older brother.

1937
01:06:50,163 --> 01:06:51,263
(Laughing)

1938
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,903
My older brother Lim Young Woong.

1939
01:06:53,003 --> 01:06:54,833
Don't call him "Lim Young Woong."

1940
01:06:55,203 --> 01:06:57,173
Call him without his surname so it sounds friendlier.

1941
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:58,943
- Older brother Young Woong. - That's nice.

1942
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,313
Older brother Young Woong sounds nice.

1943
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:02,043
- Brother Young Woong. - Brother Young Woong.

1944
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:03,243
(Brother Young Woong!)

1945
01:07:03,443 --> 01:07:04,843
That's so nice.

1946
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:06,413
- Do it. - That sounds friendly.

1947
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:08,313
- Yes. - That sounds best.

1948
01:07:08,313 --> 01:07:09,483
We'll wait for you.

1949
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,653
We... Hold on.

1950
01:07:12,123 --> 01:07:13,553
You're blood type A, right?

1951
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:15,453
- I'm blood type B. - He's A...

1952
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:18,663
We didn't talk about our blood types.

1953
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:20,063
- Why? - I'm blood type A.

1954
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:21,293
You're A?

1955
01:07:21,293 --> 01:07:23,663
If you guess mine right...

1956
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:24,933
You're type AB.

1957
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:26,303
Okay, that's your answer.

1958
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:28,033
- What about you? - Type B.

1959
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:29,173
Okay.

1960
01:07:29,173 --> 01:07:30,443
What do you think mine is?

1961
01:07:31,473 --> 01:07:32,743
I think you're type B.

1962
01:07:33,443 --> 01:07:34,473
Type B.

1963
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:36,573
- Nobody guessed mine right. - You're type O.

1964
01:07:36,573 --> 01:07:37,913
- Nobody got it right. - You got a lot of mosquito bites.

1965
01:07:37,913 --> 01:07:39,013
I'm type A.

1966
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,013
- You're type A? - Yes.

1967
01:07:40,013 --> 01:07:41,153
- I see. - What about you?

1968
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:42,813
I'm the odd one out. What about you?

1969
01:07:43,683 --> 01:07:44,723
I'm type O.

1970
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:46,823
- What about your father? - He's type A.

1971
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,953
- What about your mother? - She's type O.

1972
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:51,463
- That's how you became type O. - Yes.

1973
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:53,763
- What about your younger sister? - She's type A.

1974
01:07:53,763 --> 01:07:55,093
(She's type A.)

1975
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,733
You remember all of their blood types.

1976
01:07:56,733 --> 01:07:57,833
You remember them all.

1977
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:00,533
- Your father is type O. - Yes.

1978
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,473
- Your mother is type A. - Type A.

1979
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:04,303
My wife is type O.

1980
01:08:04,573 --> 01:08:06,343
- Your wife? - Your sister?

1981
01:08:06,343 --> 01:08:07,613
Your wife is type O?

1982
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:08,713
- My wife is type O. - What about your children?

1983
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,013
- Your sister... - Tae Hyun.

1984
01:08:10,013 --> 01:08:12,013
When two people with type O have children,

1985
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:13,453
- you only get children with type O. - Is that so?

1986
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:14,853
Yes. All of my family members are type O.

1987
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:15,953
Okay, I understand.

1988
01:08:16,853 --> 01:08:19,983
In Handsome Guys, what do you think is your position?

1989
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:21,953
The defending type or the attacking type?

1990
01:08:22,693 --> 01:08:23,793
What?

1991
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:26,263
- Su Geun? - No.

1992
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:27,833
(Mentioning all his friends who are older than him)

1993
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:28,833
Su Geun.

1994
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:30,733
Are you the defending type or the attacking type?

1995
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,263
(Dong Hyun, mention someone older than him or say "type," 33)

1996
01:08:32,263 --> 01:08:34,303
I'm a defender here.

1997
01:08:35,273 --> 01:08:38,203
(Tae Hyun hits him hard with the toy hammer.)

1998
01:08:38,203 --> 01:08:39,473
I think I'm done.

1999
01:08:39,773 --> 01:08:41,813
(Excuse me?)

2000
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:44,813
- Let's end the discussion here. - Let's end it here.

2001
01:08:44,813 --> 01:08:45,813
(The discussion ends.)

2002
01:08:45,813 --> 01:08:47,883
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2003
01:08:47,883 --> 01:08:49,813
- Thank you for your hard work. - All right.

2004
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,583
Thank you for your hard work.

2005
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,523
- Thank you for your hard work. - We're good as we are, right?

2006
01:08:53,523 --> 01:08:56,193
- Toward the end... - I think this is the conclusion.

2007
01:08:56,193 --> 01:08:57,423
We're good as we are.

2008
01:08:57,423 --> 01:08:59,723
Yes. Please watch us for a while longer.

2009
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:04,133
- Now, check your forbidden phrase. - I know what it is.

2010
01:09:04,903 --> 01:09:07,633
- For goodness' sake. - Toward the end,

2011
01:09:07,903 --> 01:09:10,033
he said it so many times.

2012
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:11,803
He said it so many times.

2013
01:09:11,803 --> 01:09:13,343
- He said it 50 times. - Suddenly...

2014
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:16,343
Suddenly, you asked me to call Young Woong "Older brother."

2015
01:09:16,343 --> 01:09:19,683
Why would I call Young Woong "Older brother?"

2016
01:09:19,683 --> 01:09:21,713
- Dong Hyun, go first. - It must be "Older brother."

2017
01:09:22,113 --> 01:09:23,453
For goodness' sake.

2018
01:09:23,453 --> 01:09:24,753
I don't know mine. Do you know yours?

2019
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:26,223
- May I go first? - Yes.

2020
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:28,053
- What do you think it is? - You had a good one.

2021
01:09:28,053 --> 01:09:29,353
He didn't say it once.

2022
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:31,163
He did say it, but only a few times.

2023
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:32,993
- Only a few times. - He did say it.

2024
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:34,063
You...

2025
01:09:34,063 --> 01:09:35,663
- What's mine? - Seriously.

2026
01:09:36,393 --> 01:09:37,633
(My goodness)

2027
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,233
- I must've said it many times. - That's right.

2028
01:09:39,363 --> 01:09:40,603
You said it many times.

2029
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:41,833
(Tae Hyun checks his forbidden phrase.)

2030
01:09:42,473 --> 01:09:44,843
Do you know what you do? When you get hit, you go, "Why?"

2031
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:46,703
I have no idea what mine is.

2032
01:09:46,703 --> 01:09:48,343
- You haven't used it once. - Hey.

2033
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:49,613
- You got a nice one. - Yi Kyung said it many times.

2034
01:09:49,913 --> 01:09:52,413
He said it many times. "Our show."

2035
01:09:52,413 --> 01:09:54,053
- He said it many times. - He said "Our show" many times.

2036
01:09:54,053 --> 01:09:56,213
I'll give you the final scores.

2037
01:09:56,213 --> 01:09:58,453
Sang Uk, 11 times. Seung Ho, 3 times.

2038
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:01,523
- "No" was a good one. - Seriously.

2039
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:03,193
- Seung Ho. - The two of you.

2040
01:10:03,423 --> 01:10:06,323
Seung Ho is too good at games. What? It's a cake.

2041
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,993
Seung Ho's life isn't in shortage at all.

2042
01:10:09,993 --> 01:10:11,633
That cake looks so nice.

2043
01:10:12,663 --> 01:10:14,003
Can't you give me that cake?

2044
01:10:14,773 --> 01:10:16,273
- Of course not. - Of course not.

2045
01:10:16,273 --> 01:10:17,643
You need to be fair and square.

2046
01:10:18,243 --> 01:10:21,243
- It looks so tasty. - Coca-Cola is nice.

2047
01:10:21,573 --> 01:10:23,173
- Thank you for the food. - Older Brother Lim Young Woong.

2048
01:10:24,613 --> 01:10:25,613
Still...

2049
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:29,283
(Eating)

2050
01:10:29,383 --> 01:10:31,783
That cake looks so tasty.

2051
01:10:31,783 --> 01:10:33,053
Why do I like cake so much?

2052
01:10:34,293 --> 01:10:36,223
(Eating)

2053
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:39,093
It's so tasty.

2054
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:43,593
Things like that get rid of stress.

2055
01:10:43,593 --> 01:10:47,033
- It's sweet. - You need a break like that.

2056
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:48,403
(The sweet dessert time ends!)

2057
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:53,303
(The sun sets.)

2058
01:10:54,143 --> 01:10:55,713
It was raining so heavily earlier.

2059
01:10:55,713 --> 01:10:56,843
(Tribe Handsome comes out of the lodging again.)

2060
01:10:57,613 --> 01:10:58,683
- Why do I feel like... - What?

2061
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:00,243
we're doing so many things?

2062
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:02,453
I see something pink.

2063
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:05,583
This place has all sorts of things.

2064
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:06,583
(They arrive at a mysterious place inside the resort.)

2065
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:08,623
What's this place?

2066
01:11:08,823 --> 01:11:10,493
(What's this?)

2067
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:12,393
It's a tomahawk.

2068
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,663
(Meat is displayed in a fancy way.)

2069
01:11:14,193 --> 01:11:15,433
(People who are still hungry...)

2070
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:16,763
I'm sorry, but...

2071
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:18,003
Gosh, is that beef brisket?

2072
01:11:18,003 --> 01:11:19,403
I'm full.

2073
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:21,973
You're full, but I want to eat some meat.

2074
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:23,803
- What? - You ate continuously.

2075
01:11:23,803 --> 01:11:25,273
- Beef brisket looks tasty. - I'm full.

2076
01:11:25,273 --> 01:11:26,403
(They can't take their eyes off.)

2077
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:27,613
Pork belly.

2078
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:31,013
- I want to eat meat. - Beef brisket, pork neck, tomahawk,

2079
01:11:31,013 --> 01:11:33,313
- You and I haven't eaten much. - sirloin, pork belly...

2080
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,753
So, what are we doing? The sun will set soon.

2081
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:40,593
Please wait. The electricity keeps going out.

2082
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:42,723
The owner is fixing it.

2083
01:11:42,723 --> 01:11:44,063
- It won't take long. - Electricity?

2084
01:11:45,363 --> 01:11:46,963
Shall we check their microphones?

2085
01:11:48,163 --> 01:11:49,293
Again?

2086
01:11:49,293 --> 01:11:51,003
(They're trying to figure out the situation.)

2087
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:52,233
I saw a Jollypong latte.

2088
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:54,273
It'll taste amazing with bibimmyeon.

2089
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:56,373
It'll be nice to play a game and have two winners eat.

2090
01:11:57,073 --> 01:11:59,843
(The staff members come to check the microphones.)

2091
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:01,643
What?

2092
01:12:04,313 --> 01:12:05,483
Why do they keep checking the microphones?

2093
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:06,613
- Oh, no. - What?

2094
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,553
It's ruined!

2095
01:12:08,883 --> 01:12:11,123
- What? - It didn't go as I planned. Hello.

2096
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,983
(What's going on?)

2097
01:12:13,303 --> 01:12:14,543
- Oh, no. - What?

2098
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:16,473
It's ruined!

2099
01:12:16,843 --> 01:12:18,973
- What? - It didn't go as I planned. Hello.

2100
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:20,313
(What's going on?)

2101
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:22,483
- Hello. - What? What are you doing here?

2102
01:12:22,683 --> 01:12:24,953
(After something gets ruined, a mysterious woman says hello.)

2103
01:12:24,953 --> 01:12:26,913
It's ruined! It didn't go as I planned.

2104
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:29,453
- Why is Yoon Eun Hye here? - How did you come here?

2105
01:12:29,453 --> 01:12:30,923
- I mean... - I was so startled.

2106
01:12:30,923 --> 01:12:32,723
Eun Hye, what are you doing?

2107
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,463
You entered most awkwardly.

2108
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:36,163
- What should I do? Hold on. - What was that?

2109
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:37,333
Shall I enter again?

2110
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,463
- She'll lead the evening game. - Really?

2111
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,033
She's the guest of the day, Yoon Eun Hye.

2112
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:42,063
(The guest of the day, Yoon Eun Hye)

2113
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:43,163
Hello.

2114
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,673
(The very 1st Korean Wave girl group of the 1st generation, Baby V.O.X)

2115
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,873
(The youngest member of Baby V.O.X)

2116
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,673
(The heroine of mega-hit dramas...)

2117
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:56,083
(such as "Princess Hours" and "Coffee Prince")

2118
01:12:56,683 --> 01:12:58,283
(She made a fancy comeback as a singer...)

2119
01:12:58,283 --> 01:12:59,853
(after "KBS Song Festival" at the end of last year.)

2120
01:13:00,453 --> 01:13:01,583
(I was born in 1987. I can't believe Baby V.O.X is back in 2024.)

2121
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,083
(Yoon Eun Hye's voice has improved even more.)

2122
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:07,093
(Yoon Eun Hye, singer and actress with 26 years of experience)

2123
01:13:07,323 --> 01:13:09,463
Suddenly, someone passed by.

2124
01:13:09,463 --> 01:13:10,493
Suddenly...

2125
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:11,663
What happened?

2126
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:13,933
The microphone crew went, "It's ruined."

2127
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:16,963
- What was ruined? - What was that?

2128
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:18,003
We didn't know.

2129
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:19,903
- Only I saw her. - It wasn't ruined. We didn't know.

2130
01:13:19,903 --> 01:13:21,073
It's good to have you here.

2131
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:22,073
(In any case, thank you for coming.)

2132
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:23,813
You came a long way.

2133
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:25,013
You really came a long way.

2134
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:26,943
- Eun Hye, it's good to see you. - Yes.

2135
01:13:28,443 --> 01:13:31,153
Sang Uk, you know who she is, right?

2136
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,353
It's my first time seeing her.

2137
01:13:32,353 --> 01:13:34,483
- It's my first time seeing her. - Do you know which group she is in?

2138
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:36,353
To be honest, I don't know.

2139
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:38,323
(She can only laugh.)

2140
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:41,093
- He's very young. - How old are you?

2141
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:42,723
I was born in 1996.

2142
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:43,723
(Sighing)

2143
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:45,233
What's the age difference between you and Sang Uk?

2144
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:46,633
- I was born in 1984. - Were you born in 1984?

2145
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:50,433
- Then we're 12 years apart. - They're 12 years apart.

2146
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:52,173
They're 12 years apart.

2147
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:54,743
We're 12 years apart. Were you born in the year of the rat?

2148
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:56,873
- The year of the rat? - Turn on the air conditioner!

2149
01:13:56,873 --> 01:13:58,973
- Don't say that so happily. - It's hot in here.

2150
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:01,043
One dozen is okay.

2151
01:14:01,743 --> 01:14:03,513
- It's hot. - Put it on full blast.

2152
01:14:03,543 --> 01:14:05,313
It's not. All right.

2153
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:07,553
Sang Uk doesn't know who Eun Hye is.

2154
01:14:07,553 --> 01:14:10,553
- I know who she is. - You don't know the group.

2155
01:14:10,553 --> 01:14:12,193
- I don't know the group. - It's understandable.

2156
01:14:12,193 --> 01:14:15,093
Many people don't know that I used to be a singer.

2157
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:17,793
- You're well-known as an actress. - That's how most people know me.

2158
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:19,363
- I see. - I had no idea.

2159
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:21,733
How have you been?

2160
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:25,473
These days, I'm practicing hard for a concert.

2161
01:14:25,473 --> 01:14:28,603
It's Baby V.O.X's concert, right?

2162
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:31,143
- That's right. - How many years has it been?

2163
01:14:31,143 --> 01:14:32,573
We reunited after 23 years.

2164
01:14:33,013 --> 01:14:35,313
- It's so meaningful. - Yes, it's very meaningful.

2165
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:40,753
(The reunion concert was successful.)

2166
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:45,553
(Handsome Guys will root for Baby V.O.X's future endeavors!)

2167
01:14:45,623 --> 01:14:47,823
For meat, you'll have...

2168
01:14:47,823 --> 01:14:50,393
a team competition with Yoon Eun Hye.

2169
01:14:50,393 --> 01:14:53,233
We prepared five kinds of meat...

2170
01:14:53,233 --> 01:14:54,503
for you guys.

2171
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:56,363
Pork belly, pork neck,

2172
01:14:56,363 --> 01:14:59,103
beef brisket, ribeye, and tomahawk.

2173
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:01,373
They look so tasty.

2174
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:02,403
(Her mouth waters.)

2175
01:15:02,403 --> 01:15:03,703
They look so tasty.

2176
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:06,373
You remember the game we played last time, Ready, Action!

2177
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:08,513
We acted out a situation.

2178
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,283
Okay.

2179
01:15:10,283 --> 01:15:12,913
(The Struggle for Meat Ready, Action!)

2180
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:15,453
You'll get a situation first.

2181
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:19,923
Then you'll draw a number card from 1 to 10.

2182
01:15:19,923 --> 01:15:23,893
The number represents the level of intensity you'll show.

2183
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,233
(Act in accordance with the intensity.)

2184
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,663
You need to guess the order.

2185
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:29,703
You have a big role to play.

2186
01:15:29,703 --> 01:15:30,833
(Feeling pressured)

2187
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:34,073
The game will consist of five rounds.

2188
01:15:34,673 --> 01:15:36,643
Every time you fail,

2189
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:38,373
you'll take out a cut of meat.

2190
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:39,613
- We'll take it out. - Yes.

2191
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:41,683
When you take out a cut of meat,

2192
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:44,013
the staff members will grill it and eat it right away.

2193
01:15:44,013 --> 01:15:45,213
Please open it!

2194
01:15:45,213 --> 01:15:46,553
Why would you grill it and eat it?

2195
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,353
For goodness' sake.

2196
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:50,183
(Please open it!)

2197
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:53,253
(Peek-a-boo)

2198
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:55,793
Is this a copy of "Amazing Saturday?"

2199
01:15:55,793 --> 01:15:57,993
Seriously. It's "Amazing Saturday."

2200
01:15:57,993 --> 01:16:01,663
The staff member and security guard who always work hard will eat.

2201
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,433
- It's "Amazing Saturday." - They're ready.

2202
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:04,673
They'll eat really well.

2203
01:16:04,973 --> 01:16:07,803
If you succeed in it, you'll get...

2204
01:16:07,803 --> 01:16:11,243
a soft drink and a bowl of rice per cut of meat.

2205
01:16:11,743 --> 01:16:12,843
Okay.

2206
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,483
I haven't had a single meal.

2207
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:15,983
- Oh, my gosh. - I must eat.

2208
01:16:16,013 --> 01:16:17,083
Let's feed Eun Hye.

2209
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,983
- You and I need to do well. - Let's go. Okay.

2210
01:16:19,553 --> 01:16:21,323
- Let's pick a number. - We'll pick our numbers.

2211
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:22,623
- Let's pick a number. - All right.

2212
01:16:23,883 --> 01:16:25,353
Pick one.

2213
01:16:26,193 --> 01:16:28,593
This is mine. I have a good feeling.

2214
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:33,693
(They check their number cards.)

2215
01:16:34,263 --> 01:16:36,133
(Nervous)

2216
01:16:36,403 --> 01:16:40,173
You're drunk at a company dinner. What's your drunken habit?

2217
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:42,073
Number one,

2218
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:44,673
a drunken habit that looks cute to both the seniors and juniors.

2219
01:16:44,673 --> 01:16:46,543
- Okay. A cute one. - Number seven,

2220
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:49,213
a drunken habit that might get you fired the next day.

2221
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:51,013
Fired?

2222
01:16:51,013 --> 01:16:52,753
- A cute one and... - You'll get fired.

2223
01:16:52,753 --> 01:16:54,453
- "We can't work with him." - Who wants to go first?

2224
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,083
Here I go.

2225
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:00,053
(Making a V-sign)

2226
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:02,863
(Rascal Seung Ho suddenly acts cute.)

2227
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,563
(Eun Hye catches on right away.)

2228
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:06,563
Here I go.

2229
01:17:06,563 --> 01:17:08,763
(What's Yi Kyung's drunken habit?)

2230
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:10,533
tvN, you punk!

2231
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:11,833
I quit!

2232
01:17:12,703 --> 01:17:13,833
(Very violent)

2233
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,303
(Shocked)

2234
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:19,173
Get lost! For goodness' sake! What's this?

2235
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,143
- I'll spit on you! - You startled me.

2236
01:17:21,143 --> 01:17:22,283
For goodness' sake!

2237
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:23,543
I quit!

2238
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:27,083
I was acting.

2239
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:28,553
That was so...

2240
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:31,723
- The two were obvious. - That was unbelievable.

2241
01:17:31,723 --> 01:17:33,023
The two couldn't be more different.

2242
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,623
We're certain about their levels, aren't we?

2243
01:17:35,623 --> 01:17:37,093
Mine is really hard.

2244
01:17:37,493 --> 01:17:38,533
As for me...

2245
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:39,793
(The next one, Sang Uk, is nervous.)

2246
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:41,363
(Ready.)

2247
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:43,533
(Action.)

2248
01:17:46,373 --> 01:17:48,173
I won't drink.

2249
01:17:48,173 --> 01:17:49,173
(His unfocused eyes add reality to the performance.)

2250
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:51,413
I need to go to bed.

2251
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:52,773
I need to go to bed.

2252
01:17:53,313 --> 01:17:54,613
Are we going for the third round?

2253
01:17:54,613 --> 01:17:55,813
Let's go for the third round.

2254
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:57,213
That's it.

2255
01:17:58,353 --> 01:17:59,913
It was a bit cute.

2256
01:17:59,913 --> 01:18:02,353
Both the seniors and juniors would find that cute, right?

2257
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:03,983
- That shouldn't be cute. - Good.

2258
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:06,353
(That shouldn't be cute.)

2259
01:18:06,453 --> 01:18:07,793
Now,

2260
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:09,123
here comes the real deal.

2261
01:18:09,593 --> 01:18:11,033
The game breaker.

2262
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:13,533
The 1st 2 were obvious.

2263
01:18:13,593 --> 01:18:15,603
Pay attention to whether it's more or less intense.

2264
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:16,603
(Will his performance bring chaos like last time?)

2265
01:18:17,603 --> 01:18:18,933
(He suddenly shouts.)

2266
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:21,073
- You startled me. - Ryu Ho Jin, come on out!

2267
01:18:21,203 --> 01:18:22,573
- Are you serious? - Come on out!

2268
01:18:22,673 --> 01:18:23,773
Are you serious?

2269
01:18:24,573 --> 01:18:25,613
Really?

2270
01:18:25,673 --> 01:18:27,613
I'll continue working here, okay?

2271
01:18:28,143 --> 01:18:29,543
I'll continue working here.

2272
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:32,253
I won't quit.

2273
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:33,753
(Timid)

2274
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,023
Okay?

2275
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:36,053
(He controls the intensity with the dialogue.)

2276
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:37,593
I must be insane.

2277
01:18:38,253 --> 01:18:39,293
(My goodness)

2278
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:41,163
I think I know the level.

2279
01:18:41,723 --> 01:18:43,893
(Eun Hye finds it clear as well.)

2280
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,193
Tae Hyun, it's your turn.

2281
01:18:45,193 --> 01:18:47,763
(Only Tae Hyun remains.)

2282
01:18:47,963 --> 01:18:49,133
Wasn't it too intense?

2283
01:18:49,133 --> 01:18:51,333
(Tae Hyun looks nervous.)

2284
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,773
- All right. - Go ahead.

2285
01:18:52,773 --> 01:18:54,273
(Here comes the performance.)

2286
01:18:54,273 --> 01:18:56,303
Gosh, I need to go.

2287
01:18:57,473 --> 01:18:58,613
Hey.

2288
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:05,053
(Truly drunk)

2289
01:19:05,713 --> 01:19:07,313
(Drunkard)

2290
01:19:07,313 --> 01:19:09,153
Why did you do that?

2291
01:19:09,153 --> 01:19:10,723
(Drunkard)

2292
01:19:10,723 --> 01:19:12,893
Eun Hye is startled.

2293
01:19:12,893 --> 01:19:14,423
Why did you do that?

2294
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:15,523
(Confused since Tae Hyun appeared very drunk)

2295
01:19:15,523 --> 01:19:16,923
That was the intensity.

2296
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,433
I don't think I did it badly.

2297
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:19,463
I think I know.

2298
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,163
(Meanwhile, the two drunkards meet.)

2299
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:23,833
Gosh, weren't you too much?

2300
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:26,273
- I can't believe you! - They're fighting.

2301
01:19:26,273 --> 01:19:27,903
(The two of them are equally drunk.)

2302
01:19:27,903 --> 01:19:29,843
All right.

2303
01:19:30,043 --> 01:19:31,143
I quit!

2304
01:19:32,213 --> 01:19:34,213
(Another drunkard enters.)

2305
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:36,483
- I quit! - Hey!

2306
01:19:36,543 --> 01:19:38,283
I won't quit!

2307
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,353
But if you do it one more time, I'll quit!

2308
01:19:40,353 --> 01:19:41,823
I quit!

2309
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,323
I won't quit, okay?

2310
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:45,193
You added too many lines.

2311
01:19:45,453 --> 01:19:46,593
You get a warning.

2312
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:48,723
It's cheating if you do that.

2313
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,693
I didn't know since it was my first time.

2314
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:53,163
Start from one.

2315
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:54,903
Who is first?

2316
01:19:54,903 --> 01:19:56,533
(She'll start from the lowest number and move up.)

2317
01:19:57,063 --> 01:19:58,103
One.

2318
01:19:58,103 --> 01:19:59,203
(Seung Ho is the lowest number.)

2319
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,803
- Hold on. The number. - Seung Ho.

2320
01:20:00,803 --> 01:20:02,443
- It has to be 1. - It has to be 1.

2321
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:03,573
(Seung Ho's card is 1.)

2322
01:20:03,573 --> 01:20:05,043
That's right.

2323
01:20:05,043 --> 01:20:06,213
The second one is...

2324
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:08,443
Sang Uk. I think his number is three.

2325
01:20:08,443 --> 01:20:09,783
(She chooses Sang Uk for the second smallest number.)

2326
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:10,983
- That's right. - What will it be?

2327
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:12,313
Is it four?

2328
01:20:12,313 --> 01:20:13,313
- Four. - What?

2329
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:15,053
Why did you talk about going for the third round?

2330
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:17,323
- That's when I get drunk. - Oh, no.

2331
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:18,493
That's when I get drunk.

2332
01:20:18,493 --> 01:20:20,453
Hold on.

2333
01:20:20,593 --> 01:20:23,023
We can do it.

2334
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:25,133
- We have 5, 6, and 7 left. - Yes. We can do it.

2335
01:20:25,163 --> 01:20:27,433
I'm a bit confused about these two.

2336
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:29,233
- Those two? - No.

2337
01:20:30,063 --> 01:20:32,203
- No. - She'll get it right.

2338
01:20:32,373 --> 01:20:33,933
- I'll go with my hunch. - Go with your hunch.

2339
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:35,603
The third one.

2340
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:36,873
Five.

2341
01:20:37,673 --> 01:20:40,543
(Tae Hyun's card is...)

2342
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:43,043
That's it. We're set.

2343
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,713
- We're set. - Did we pick consecutive numbers?

2344
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:45,783
- Well done. - Next one.

2345
01:20:45,783 --> 01:20:47,053
You said that you'd continue working.

2346
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,653
(The next one, Dong Hyun)

2347
01:20:48,653 --> 01:20:49,753
Six.

2348
01:20:50,283 --> 01:20:51,293
Seven.

2349
01:20:51,293 --> 01:20:52,593
- Seven. - Yes.

2350
01:20:53,093 --> 01:20:54,293
(Round 1 is a success.)

2351
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:56,093
Meat!

2352
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:57,193
Success.

2353
01:20:57,193 --> 01:20:59,293
- Okay. - Okay. You're good.

2354
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:01,133
Well done. You were very witty.

2355
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:02,603
We succeeded in the first round.

2356
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:03,763
Eun Hye is good.

2357
01:21:03,763 --> 01:21:04,973
- She's good. - She's reassuring.

2358
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:06,173
(The biggest contributor behind the success of Round One)

2359
01:21:06,173 --> 01:21:07,233
This is fun.

2360
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:08,343
Do well.

2361
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:10,373
Please pick your number.

2362
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:12,713
We'll hear the situation afterward.

2363
01:21:13,843 --> 01:21:15,713
How will you confess your love to a colleague...

2364
01:21:15,713 --> 01:21:17,343
you have a crush on?

2365
01:21:17,483 --> 01:21:18,753
Number one,

2366
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:21,053
a shy confession of love that's made with a shaky voice.

2367
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:22,423
Number seven,

2368
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:24,553
a charismatic confession of love that makes the heart flutter.

2369
01:21:25,123 --> 01:21:26,423
- A confession of love. - For number seven,

2370
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,693
it should be...

2371
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:31,363
- Charismatic. - On top of being charismatic,

2372
01:21:31,363 --> 01:21:32,563
it should make the heart flutter.

2373
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,133
It shouldn't only be charismatic.

2374
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:35,503
(My goodness)

2375
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:37,333
Women pay attention to such details.

2376
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,373
(Director Yoon makes a detailed request.)

2377
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:42,573
(Charismatic and heart-fluttering?)

2378
01:21:42,573 --> 01:21:43,843
When you push her,

2379
01:21:43,843 --> 01:21:45,513
should her spine break a little?

2380
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:48,083
- No. - The 3rd and 4th ones should shake.

2381
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,113
It's like this.

2382
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:50,613
You could throw her,

2383
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:51,813
but you need to support her back.

2384
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:54,083
Yes You could throw her, but you need to support her back.

2385
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:56,153
Number seven should be charismatic and heart-fluttering.

2386
01:21:56,153 --> 01:21:57,153
How about number one?

2387
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:58,993
- Shaky voice. - It should feel like...

2388
01:21:58,993 --> 01:22:00,023
(A shy confession of love that's made with a shaky voice)

2389
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:01,393
you've never been in a relationship.

2390
01:22:01,823 --> 01:22:03,193
- You should be clumsy. - That's right.

2391
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:05,293
Are you changing directions?

2392
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:08,263
She's making more requests.

2393
01:22:08,263 --> 01:22:10,063
Are you changing them to the confessions you want to hear?

2394
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:11,603
It's a good opportunity.

2395
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:13,573
- Listen to five men's confessions. - Shall I do that?

2396
01:22:13,573 --> 01:22:14,743
- Then... - Be the judge.

2397
01:22:14,743 --> 01:22:16,273
I'll judge by how much my heart flutters.

2398
01:22:16,273 --> 01:22:18,143
Guess the numbers.

2399
01:22:18,173 --> 01:22:20,173
- I love this show. - It's a crush.

2400
01:22:20,173 --> 01:22:21,713
- It's a crush. - Yes, it's a crush.

2401
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:24,113
(Mini drama 1, Tae Hyun's Confession)

2402
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:25,853
Eun Hye, let's go.

2403
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:27,783
(It's funny.)

2404
01:22:27,783 --> 01:22:29,153
- What? - Let's go.

2405
01:22:29,183 --> 01:22:30,283
Baby, let's go.

2406
01:22:31,123 --> 01:22:32,693
Baby, let's go.

2407
01:22:32,693 --> 01:22:34,023
(The line that made many women cry in the 2000s)

2408
01:22:34,023 --> 01:22:35,123
What's the number?

2409
01:22:35,323 --> 01:22:37,463
I'm in trouble. What's the number?

2410
01:22:38,063 --> 01:22:40,433
Let me answer. An old man who is walking her granddaughter.

2411
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,333
(Laughing)

2412
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,003
- That was perfect. - "Baby, let's go on a walk."

2413
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:46,473
- That was perfect. - Right?

2414
01:22:46,473 --> 01:22:47,673
I thought it was heart-fluttering.

2415
01:22:47,673 --> 01:22:48,803
- Firstly... - We don't know the number either.

2416
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,673
Let's watch the next one...

2417
01:22:50,673 --> 01:22:51,943
and see how the intensity is in comparison.

2418
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:54,173
- Adjust the intensity to this. - Yes. Let it be the standard.

2419
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:56,043
- But we don't know the number. - We have no idea.

2420
01:22:56,043 --> 01:22:57,383
Let me add a line.

2421
01:22:57,383 --> 01:22:59,213
"For goodness' sake."

2422
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:01,253
- Dong Hyun is next. - I don't know.

2423
01:23:01,253 --> 01:23:02,523
Has he begun?

2424
01:23:02,883 --> 01:23:05,223
- Ms. Eun Hye, well... - "Ms. Eun Hye."

2425
01:23:05,253 --> 01:23:06,393
"Ms. Eun Hye."

2426
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:08,863
To be honest, I bought a ticket to your concert.

2427
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:10,963
- Really? - Yes.

2428
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,693
- To be honest... - Why did you buy it?

2429
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:16,033
To listen to music.

2430
01:23:17,403 --> 01:23:19,133
Where does acting end?

2431
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,803
Is he acting or what?

2432
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:21,943
- Listen. - If that's acting,

2433
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:23,443
Dong Hyun needs to win an award at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

2434
01:23:23,903 --> 01:23:26,943
I'm doing a poor job of delivering my sincerity,

2435
01:23:27,273 --> 01:23:28,943
so I'll come back next time.

2436
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:30,413
(So I'll come back next time!)

2437
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:32,013
"So I'll come back next time?"

2438
01:23:32,313 --> 01:23:33,913
- I get it. - Hold on.

2439
01:23:33,913 --> 01:23:35,783
- I'm back. Yes. - Are you back?

2440
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:37,753
When you appeared today,

2441
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:39,093
you shone.

2442
01:23:39,823 --> 01:23:41,763
- Thank you. - I was so surprised.

2443
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:43,493
- So, - So?

2444
01:23:43,763 --> 01:23:45,363
did I get rejected?

2445
01:23:45,363 --> 01:23:46,833
(Did I get rejected?)

2446
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:48,233
- I mean... - I'll end it here.

2447
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:49,933
- What? You'll end it here? - I'll end it here.

2448
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:50,963
- I'll end it here. - I'll end it here.

2449
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:54,173
Is the last line, "Did I get rejected?"

2450
01:23:54,403 --> 01:23:55,503
You did it strangely first.

2451
01:23:55,503 --> 01:23:57,743
- It's a bit confusing. - The first one was too hard.

2452
01:23:57,773 --> 01:23:59,043
I did my best.

2453
01:23:59,973 --> 01:24:01,183
(The next one fixes his clothes and gets ready.)

2454
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,583
Here he comes.

2455
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:04,853
- Here comes the baby. - Will he approach her?

2456
01:24:04,853 --> 01:24:05,883
My heart is fluttering already.

2457
01:24:06,313 --> 01:24:07,513
- My heart is fluttering already. - Hey.

2458
01:24:07,513 --> 01:24:09,553
- Would you please stand here? - Don't be like that.

2459
01:24:10,323 --> 01:24:11,653
At this rate,

2460
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:14,723
she'll guess his number to be 7 even if it's 1.

2461
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:16,393
Seriously.

2462
01:24:16,393 --> 01:24:17,933
- Eun Hye... - What should I do?

2463
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,363
might forget about the numbers...

2464
01:24:19,363 --> 01:24:21,163
- and go by her feelings. - Is that all?

2465
01:24:21,163 --> 01:24:22,603
- Will you hold me? Okay. - I'll hold your hand.

2466
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:26,133
Hey, live with me!

2467
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,403
(Hey, live with me!)

2468
01:24:28,003 --> 01:24:29,273
Hey, live with me!

2469
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,543
(Let's watch it once more since it's nice.)

2470
01:24:32,673 --> 01:24:33,713
(She feels faint.)

2471
01:24:33,713 --> 01:24:34,783
Hey, that's...

2472
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:35,943
- Hold on. - It's seven.

2473
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:37,483
"Live with me."

2474
01:24:37,813 --> 01:24:38,813
"Let's go" and "Live with me."

2475
01:24:38,813 --> 01:24:40,453
"Baby, let's go." "Live with me."

2476
01:24:40,453 --> 01:24:41,983
- The two were too similar. - No.

2477
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,453
- No. - No.

2478
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:44,553
- You... - Please take a seat.

2479
01:24:44,553 --> 01:24:45,653
Okay. Thank you.

2480
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:47,553
This is hard.

2481
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:49,363
- What's this? - This is hard.

2482
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:51,793
- Here I go. - Okay.

2483
01:24:53,733 --> 01:24:54,963
Ms. Eun Hye.

2484
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:57,533
- Hello. - Ms. Eun Hye.

2485
01:24:57,533 --> 01:24:59,833
I like...

2486
01:25:00,533 --> 01:25:01,773
It's April Fool's.

2487
01:25:04,873 --> 01:25:06,843
- Are you serious? - Yes, that's where it ends.

2488
01:25:06,843 --> 01:25:08,083
She looks very disappointed.

2489
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,143
No.

2490
01:25:09,143 --> 01:25:10,783
- Those two are really confusing. - Really?

2491
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:12,713
Gosh, you shouldn't be confused.

2492
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:13,783
Why are you confused?

2493
01:25:14,113 --> 01:25:15,223
Let's keep going.

2494
01:25:15,523 --> 01:25:16,583
- Seung Ho. - Let's see it first.

2495
01:25:17,023 --> 01:25:18,893
(Mini drama 5, Seung Ho's confession)

2496
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:21,363
Eun Hye,

2497
01:25:22,093 --> 01:25:23,293
I think...

2498
01:25:23,293 --> 01:25:24,593
(Eun Hye, I think...)

2499
01:25:26,463 --> 01:25:27,763
I like you.

2500
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:30,233
- It's simple. - Keep going.

2501
01:25:30,303 --> 01:25:32,033
I keep thinking about you.

2502
01:25:32,803 --> 01:25:34,843
Hey, I think I like you.

2503
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:37,403
(He suddenly switches to a casual tone.)

2504
01:25:40,213 --> 01:25:42,183
This is the most heart-fluttering.

2505
01:25:42,283 --> 01:25:43,343
Eun Hye!

2506
01:25:43,343 --> 01:25:44,513
- Eun Hye! - No way.

2507
01:25:44,513 --> 01:25:46,253
Eun Hye, come to your senses.

2508
01:25:46,253 --> 01:25:48,383
I told you that you shone.

2509
01:25:48,483 --> 01:25:50,883
What was Seung Ho thinking?

2510
01:25:50,883 --> 01:25:53,323
We were like, "Baby, let's go."

2511
01:25:53,393 --> 01:25:55,123
I'll use it next time.

2512
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:56,363
(I'll use it next time.)

2513
01:25:56,363 --> 01:25:58,063
- It was very heart-fluttering. - Yes, it was very nice.

2514
01:25:58,063 --> 01:25:59,263
Hey.

2515
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,663
Eun Hye,

2516
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:01,963
- I'll come to my senses. - put your emotions aside.

2517
01:26:01,963 --> 01:26:03,503
Okay. I shouldn't let them get in the way.

2518
01:26:03,703 --> 01:26:04,833
I'll start from the highest number.

2519
01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:07,073
- Focus on the lines only. - Okay.

2520
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:09,203
Don't think about the speakers.

2521
01:26:09,703 --> 01:26:10,803
"Live with me."

2522
01:26:10,803 --> 01:26:12,273
(She picks Sang Uk's confession as the most charismatic one.)

2523
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:13,443
There you go.

2524
01:26:13,813 --> 01:26:15,583
- It's correct. - Nice.

2525
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,583
(She becomes relieved.)

2526
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:17,743
Next.

2527
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,013
- "Baby, let's go." - Baby, let's go!

2528
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:21,423
It's six.

2529
01:26:21,423 --> 01:26:22,783
Baby, let's go!

2530
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,283
(She gets two right in a row.)

2531
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:25,393
Now... Hold on.

2532
01:26:25,393 --> 01:26:26,853
- Here comes the poison. - Here comes the poison.

2533
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:29,193
- We'll succeed in it. - She might get them right.

2534
01:26:29,193 --> 01:26:30,863
- You have experience. - Now comes the important one.

2535
01:26:30,863 --> 01:26:31,933
Next.

2536
01:26:32,963 --> 01:26:34,033
Confession.

2537
01:26:34,033 --> 01:26:35,063
(She chooses Seung Ho next!)

2538
01:26:35,063 --> 01:26:36,203
Four?

2539
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:37,533
- What? Three? - Three?

2540
01:26:38,233 --> 01:26:39,303
Three?

2541
01:26:39,773 --> 01:26:40,833
No?

2542
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,703
Then only 2 and 1 remain.

2543
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:44,173
No?

2544
01:26:44,773 --> 01:26:46,213
Who is next?

2545
01:26:47,773 --> 01:26:48,883
Two, one.

2546
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:49,883
What?

2547
01:26:49,883 --> 01:26:50,983
Two, one.

2548
01:26:51,043 --> 01:26:52,653
- Is he the last one? - Yes.

2549
01:26:52,983 --> 01:26:54,413
- He... - Two, one.

2550
01:26:54,853 --> 01:26:56,083
(Dong Hyun reveals his number first.)

2551
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,553
This is very different.

2552
01:26:57,553 --> 01:26:58,823
- One, two... - Four?

2553
01:27:00,493 --> 01:27:01,623
- One, two... - Four?

2554
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,193
- Is your number four? - Four?

2555
01:27:03,193 --> 01:27:04,423
- Four. - All of us were wrong.

2556
01:27:04,423 --> 01:27:06,163
- Time out. - Dong Hyun does that.

2557
01:27:06,163 --> 01:27:07,163
- Hey. - Listen.

2558
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:09,063
- It certainly wasn't four. - Listen.

2559
01:27:09,063 --> 01:27:11,163
- It certainly wasn't four. - It was too much.

2560
01:27:11,163 --> 01:27:12,403
Do you know what the upsetting thing is?

2561
01:27:12,403 --> 01:27:14,073
Did you confess your love to your wife this way?

2562
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:15,573
It isn't like that. Listen.

2563
01:27:15,573 --> 01:27:16,973
If you compare Seung Ho's confession to mine,

2564
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:18,373
I had...

2565
01:27:18,373 --> 01:27:19,773
better lines.

2566
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:21,783
I'm one.

2567
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:23,483
- Exactly. - I knew you were one.

2568
01:27:23,483 --> 01:27:25,683
I went before you did.

2569
01:27:25,753 --> 01:27:27,953
We played this game twice.

2570
01:27:27,953 --> 01:27:29,183
- You know... - Both times,

2571
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:30,483
we got annoyed because of you.

2572
01:27:30,483 --> 01:27:32,493
Why did you underestimate my number? I confessed my love.

2573
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:33,553
"Underestimate my number?"

2574
01:27:33,553 --> 01:27:35,593
You never said that you liked me.

2575
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:37,593
Instead of sounding like a confession,

2576
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:40,833
it seems like he's just making it up.

2577
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:42,133
- Really? - Right.

2578
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:43,763
You have failed.

2579
01:27:43,763 --> 01:27:45,303
Which one do you want to get rid of?

2580
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:47,403
- You choose what to get rid of. - What do you all like?

2581
01:27:47,403 --> 01:27:48,703
- You choose. - You choose.

2582
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:50,743
You should choose the one you're okay with getting rid of.

2583
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:53,343
- This is what I think. - We have to choose.

2584
01:27:53,343 --> 01:27:55,813
Beef brisket becomes very small when grilled.

2585
01:27:55,843 --> 01:27:56,883
- Right. - Should we go with beef brisket?

2586
01:27:56,883 --> 01:27:58,953
But there some who love beef brisket.

2587
01:27:59,283 --> 01:28:00,783
Beef brisket is my favorite.

2588
01:28:00,783 --> 01:28:02,183
- Then pork belly? - Pork neck?

2589
01:28:02,283 --> 01:28:03,683
- It won't be a good match. - Pork neck?

2590
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:04,793
- Should we get rid of pork neck? - This is pork neck.

2591
01:28:04,793 --> 01:28:06,293
- Hold on. - Pork neck is good.

2592
01:28:06,293 --> 01:28:07,523
We should have pork neck then.

2593
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:09,493
They told Eun Hye to choose,

2594
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,993
but all three of them are over there.

2595
01:28:10,993 --> 01:28:12,233
They want pork neck to be removed.

2596
01:28:12,363 --> 01:28:14,393
You should just choose one for us.

2597
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:16,333
- I'll get rid of pork neck. - Okay.

2598
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:18,033
These guys have a set answer.

2599
01:28:18,573 --> 01:28:20,503
They want me to make...

2600
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:21,803
- a certain decision. - You're right.

2601
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:23,143
- That's how they are. - Enjoy the meat.

2602
01:28:23,143 --> 01:28:25,913
We have to think about the combination of the meat.

2603
01:28:25,913 --> 01:28:28,083
- We can't get rid of pork. - She was going for beef brisket.

2604
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:29,383
We can't get rid of more pork.

2605
01:28:29,983 --> 01:28:31,513
- Gosh. - It sounds insane.

2606
01:28:31,713 --> 01:28:32,913
We have to get it right no matter what.

2607
01:28:32,913 --> 01:28:35,283
- That's insane. - They're grilling the meat.

2608
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:37,153
All right. We'll move onto the next question.

2609
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:38,253
We have to get the right numbers.

2610
01:28:38,253 --> 01:28:39,353
Pick your number!

2611
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:40,553
The questions are hard.

2612
01:28:40,623 --> 01:28:41,793
When your stomach hurts all of a sudden,

2613
01:28:41,793 --> 01:28:43,223
what do you look like in the toilet?

2614
01:28:43,223 --> 01:28:44,223
I'm an expert with this one.

2615
01:28:44,223 --> 01:28:46,163
Number one...

2616
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,533
is relieving yourself pleasantly.

2617
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:49,703
It's about relieving yourself.

2618
01:28:49,703 --> 01:28:50,933
Number seven...

2619
01:28:50,933 --> 01:28:52,133
is suffering from terrible constipation.

2620
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:53,203
It's about relieving yourself?

2621
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,003
It's good bowel movement or constipation.

2622
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:57,543
Number seven means it's completely blocked.

2623
01:28:57,673 --> 01:28:58,943
Keep that in mind.

2624
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:00,243
It should almost come out the other way.

2625
01:29:00,843 --> 01:29:02,343
(Keep in mind that number 7 means it's completely blocked.)

2626
01:29:02,343 --> 01:29:04,413
Number seven means it's almost impossible.

2627
01:29:04,413 --> 01:29:06,553
I feel like I've gotten a lot closer to them after just three games.

2628
01:29:06,553 --> 01:29:08,423
- All right. - Choose each person.

2629
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:09,683
(Choose each person who will act.)

2630
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:10,683
- You should go first. - Right.

2631
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:11,693
Really?

2632
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:13,093
- You should set the standard. - All right.

2633
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:18,963
(Dong Hyun has entered the toilet.)

2634
01:29:19,963 --> 01:29:21,903
(Surprised)

2635
01:29:24,973 --> 01:29:28,143
(He obviously looks relieved.)

2636
01:29:28,303 --> 01:29:29,343
(Cheering)

2637
01:29:30,273 --> 01:29:32,613
(He even sounds very relieved.)

2638
01:29:33,043 --> 01:29:34,913
(Culture shock)

2639
01:29:35,443 --> 01:29:39,013
(Laughing)

2640
01:29:39,013 --> 01:29:40,883
That wasn't enough. I should flush twice.

2641
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,023
- Okay. - Gosh.

2642
01:29:44,023 --> 01:29:45,623
- Okay. We got it. - Okay.

2643
01:29:45,623 --> 01:29:47,753
- We got it. - That was hilarious.

2644
01:29:48,223 --> 01:29:50,763
Who do you want to see next?

2645
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:52,333
- You should go second. - Okay.

2646
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,593
I'll go second.

2647
01:29:54,093 --> 01:29:56,433
- There are tissues right here. - Gosh.

2648
01:29:56,803 --> 01:29:58,373
The toilets were like this back in your day, right?

2649
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:00,203
They were like this.

2650
01:30:00,203 --> 01:30:01,273
The chamber pot.

2651
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:02,273
(Groaning)

2652
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:05,343
(Tae Hyun!)

2653
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:07,943
(Groaning)

2654
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,583
Get out!

2655
01:30:13,453 --> 01:30:16,583
(Tae Hyun looks like he's struggling a lot.)

2656
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,653
Gosh.

2657
01:30:17,653 --> 01:30:19,493
This can't be in the middle.

2658
01:30:19,493 --> 01:30:21,253
We have to see how he ends it.

2659
01:30:23,993 --> 01:30:25,533
(Using all his might)

2660
01:30:25,763 --> 01:30:26,993
I think I got it.

2661
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:29,233
Okay.

2662
01:30:29,663 --> 01:30:31,033
That was hilarious.

2663
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:32,973
He failed in the end.

2664
01:30:32,973 --> 01:30:34,673
Right. He failed.

2665
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:36,873
Next, we will go left to right.

2666
01:30:36,873 --> 01:30:38,003
- Sang Uk will be next. - Right.

2667
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:42,013
(Sang Uk's toilet time is next.)

2668
01:30:42,013 --> 01:30:43,583
Are you going back to those days as well? Gosh.

2669
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:47,113
(Groaning)

2670
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:48,223
He's sitting high up.

2671
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:53,923
Did you really go?

2672
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:56,023
(It's suspiciously realistic.)

2673
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:57,863
- Gosh. - Hold on.

2674
01:30:59,493 --> 01:31:00,993
Why don't I feel completely done?

2675
01:31:02,363 --> 01:31:03,503
(Unsure if he's done or not)

2676
01:31:03,503 --> 01:31:04,633
Gosh.

2677
01:31:05,533 --> 01:31:06,933
Whatever.

2678
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:08,473
("Whatever?")

2679
01:31:08,473 --> 01:31:10,373
"Whatever?"

2680
01:31:11,273 --> 01:31:13,543
- What? - "Whatever?"

2681
01:31:13,673 --> 01:31:15,343
That's hard to tell!

2682
01:31:15,443 --> 01:31:16,643
"Whatever."

2683
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:18,613
You have to be certain about it!

2684
01:31:18,713 --> 01:31:20,413
It's hard to find the middle.

2685
01:31:20,413 --> 01:31:22,483
It's really hard to find the one in the middle.

2686
01:31:23,253 --> 01:31:24,893
- Are you ready, Eun Hye? - Yes.

2687
01:31:25,253 --> 01:31:26,323
Here I go.

2688
01:31:32,363 --> 01:31:33,363
(Groaning)

2689
01:31:33,693 --> 01:31:35,203
Gosh, here we go again.

2690
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,303
(Gosh, here we go again.)

2691
01:31:38,433 --> 01:31:39,433
(Shouting)

2692
01:31:41,603 --> 01:31:43,073
Gosh, it's just one out.

2693
01:31:43,173 --> 01:31:44,173
Gosh.

2694
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:45,813
(Leaving)

2695
01:31:45,813 --> 01:31:47,643
You won't wipe?

2696
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:49,913
You have to wipe yourself!

2697
01:31:49,913 --> 01:31:51,083
I used the bidet.

2698
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,913
- You didn't do anything. - I used the bidet.

2699
01:31:53,753 --> 01:31:55,653
- That was my level. - Okay.

2700
01:31:56,653 --> 01:31:58,523
- It's hard to tell. - It's really hard with these three.

2701
01:31:58,523 --> 01:32:01,193
But I can tell what is what.

2702
01:32:01,493 --> 01:32:02,993
- Right. - You can tell, right?

2703
01:32:02,993 --> 01:32:05,763
I'll show you with my part why I can tell.

2704
01:32:05,763 --> 01:32:06,763
- Okay. - Okay.

2705
01:32:06,933 --> 01:32:07,993
Gosh.

2706
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:17,473
(Clear)

2707
01:32:17,603 --> 01:32:18,943
I don't know.

2708
01:32:18,943 --> 01:32:20,273
(That was a good time.)

2709
01:32:20,273 --> 01:32:21,883
You have to flush!

2710
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:23,713
- It was automatic. - It was automatic?

2711
01:32:23,713 --> 01:32:25,513
- Got it. - Okay.

2712
01:32:25,513 --> 01:32:27,253
You said goodbye without flushing.

2713
01:32:27,653 --> 01:32:29,183
- It was automatic. - I see.

2714
01:32:29,183 --> 01:32:30,553
I got it.

2715
01:32:30,553 --> 01:32:31,853
The standards were set accurately.

2716
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:33,693
They have to be set accurately.

2717
01:32:33,693 --> 01:32:35,293
I can get everything right.

2718
01:32:35,293 --> 01:32:37,623
- Gosh. - I'm a bit confused with these two.

2719
01:32:37,623 --> 01:32:39,133
Sang Uk and Yi Kyung.

2720
01:32:39,133 --> 01:32:40,133
Right.

2721
01:32:40,133 --> 01:32:41,663
He said, "Whatever."

2722
01:32:44,003 --> 01:32:45,503
Then...

2723
01:32:45,503 --> 01:32:47,073
(If that's so...)

2724
01:32:47,403 --> 01:32:48,743
I'll start with number one.

2725
01:32:49,043 --> 01:32:50,203
- Okay. The lowest number. - Okay.

2726
01:32:50,203 --> 01:32:51,613
Okay. It's Dong Hyun.

2727
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:52,973
- Here. - Next...

2728
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,043
The lowest number.

2729
01:32:54,043 --> 01:32:55,383
- Go with the easiest one. - Right.

2730
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:56,983
- The easiest one. - Next...

2731
01:32:56,983 --> 01:32:58,613
- The easiest one. - Right.

2732
01:32:58,613 --> 01:32:59,853
- Next is Seung Ho. - Seung Ho.

2733
01:32:59,853 --> 01:33:01,083
- Right. - He must be number three.

2734
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,123
- There we go. - There we go.

2735
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,183
Nice!

2736
01:33:03,183 --> 01:33:04,823
Next is Yi Kyung.

2737
01:33:05,223 --> 01:33:09,123
- Number four! - We did it.

2738
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:10,523
- Next. - Number five!

2739
01:33:10,523 --> 01:33:12,433
- Number five! - Yes!

2740
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:15,163
- Yes! - Yes!

2741
01:33:17,063 --> 01:33:18,773
- We finally got it. - Nice one!

2742
01:33:19,473 --> 01:33:20,633
- Okay! - Nice one!

2743
01:33:20,633 --> 01:33:22,573
Gosh, how did you get it all right?

2744
01:33:22,573 --> 01:33:23,673
This one was hard.

2745
01:33:23,673 --> 01:33:25,573
Their acting helped me out.

2746
01:33:25,573 --> 01:33:26,843
- We worked together. - Right.

2747
01:33:27,073 --> 01:33:28,173
They were specific details from their parts.

2748
01:33:28,173 --> 01:33:29,683
- We got another cut. - Gosh.

2749
01:33:29,683 --> 01:33:30,713
That was hilarious.

2750
01:33:30,713 --> 01:33:32,183
We did well.

2751
01:33:32,183 --> 01:33:33,313
Would you like to switch?

2752
01:33:33,313 --> 01:33:34,353
- Switch what? - Our roles.

2753
01:33:34,353 --> 01:33:35,483
- With whom? - With whom?

2754
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:37,623
I'll switch with Sang Uk.

2755
01:33:38,123 --> 01:33:39,353
Good choice.

2756
01:33:39,353 --> 01:33:40,453
- Sang Uk? - It's because...

2757
01:33:40,453 --> 01:33:42,293
he's quite witty. His acting was pretty good too.

2758
01:33:42,293 --> 01:33:44,193
- I'm good at answering questions. - Sang Uk is terrible at this.

2759
01:33:44,293 --> 01:33:45,293
(Look who's talking!)

2760
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:46,533
He's good at answering questions.

2761
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:48,403
I got all the previous questions right.

2762
01:33:48,403 --> 01:33:49,403
Okay.

2763
01:33:49,403 --> 01:33:50,863
- Sang Uk has to get it right. - Okay.

2764
01:33:51,733 --> 01:33:53,203
- Let's trust him. - Trust me.

2765
01:33:53,933 --> 01:33:55,173
Let's pick one each.

2766
01:33:55,173 --> 01:33:57,043
(Ready, Action! Round 4)

2767
01:33:57,103 --> 01:33:58,373
Here's the question.

2768
01:33:58,913 --> 01:34:00,043
While being on a date,

2769
01:34:00,043 --> 01:34:02,813
your girlfriend bumped into a thug.

2770
01:34:02,813 --> 01:34:04,283
- A thug? - How will you react?

2771
01:34:04,813 --> 01:34:05,953
Number one...

2772
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:08,153
is being timid...

2773
01:34:08,653 --> 01:34:10,683
and unable to speak.

2774
01:34:10,823 --> 01:34:12,993
Number seven is becoming a bulldozer.

2775
01:34:13,753 --> 01:34:15,163
- "Hey!" - Okay.

2776
01:34:15,163 --> 01:34:16,423
A complete bulldozer.

2777
01:34:16,663 --> 01:34:18,533
Do you want to feel the reaction yourself?

2778
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,033
- What do you think? - I'll feel the reaction myself.

2779
01:34:20,033 --> 01:34:21,293
- You play the thug. - Okay.

2780
01:34:21,293 --> 01:34:22,603
- He feels just like a thug. - He'll play the thug.

2781
01:34:22,603 --> 01:34:23,833
Feel the reaction after bumping into each person.

2782
01:34:24,003 --> 01:34:25,573
- So I'm the boyfriend. - Right.

2783
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:26,603
Right.

2784
01:34:26,603 --> 01:34:28,543
- We're walking by. - I bump into the girlfriend.

2785
01:34:28,543 --> 01:34:30,203
You bumped into her. "Are you okay?"

2786
01:34:30,203 --> 01:34:31,203
(He bumped into his invisible girlfriend.)

2787
01:34:31,473 --> 01:34:32,513
Hey!

2788
01:34:33,013 --> 01:34:34,943
- What? - "Hey?"

2789
01:34:34,943 --> 01:34:36,283
- Come here for a second. - Why?

2790
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,513
You should apologize after bumping into someone.

2791
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,853
(He reveals his thugness while showing his arms.)

2792
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:43,253
Why should I apologize?

2793
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:44,583
Who do you think you are?

2794
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:46,453
- If you bump into someone, - Yes?

2795
01:34:46,693 --> 01:34:48,723
you should apologize before going your way!

2796
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:51,023
So what do you want me to do?

2797
01:34:52,593 --> 01:34:54,433
You should apologize,

2798
01:34:54,763 --> 01:34:55,763
but...

2799
01:34:56,363 --> 01:34:57,433
I'm running late.

2800
01:34:58,163 --> 01:35:02,043
I'm not leaving because I'm scared.

2801
01:35:02,403 --> 01:35:04,143
I'm leaving because I'm in a hurry.

2802
01:35:04,473 --> 01:35:06,343
Okay? You should watch out next time.

2803
01:35:06,443 --> 01:35:07,973
What a weirdo.

2804
01:35:07,973 --> 01:35:09,513
So that was his level.

2805
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:12,083
That was his level. Your acting is great.

2806
01:35:12,813 --> 01:35:14,353
This is hard though.

2807
01:35:15,383 --> 01:35:17,583
You have to do well! Got it?

2808
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:18,793
Dong Hyun is next.

2809
01:35:19,553 --> 01:35:21,823
Would you like her to play your girlfriend?

2810
01:35:22,263 --> 01:35:23,563
- Okay. - Eun Hye will help out.

2811
01:35:23,563 --> 01:35:25,293
- That will make things accurate. - All right.

2812
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:26,863
(Eun Hye steps out to act as the girlfriend.)

2813
01:35:26,863 --> 01:35:28,433
- Okay. - It's a slight bump.

2814
01:35:28,433 --> 01:35:29,463
Here we go.

2815
01:35:30,403 --> 01:35:31,433
A slight bump.

2816
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:34,673
Have you lost your mind?

2817
01:35:34,673 --> 01:35:36,973
(Have you lost your mind?)

2818
01:35:37,143 --> 01:35:39,143
- I'm sorry. - What's your problem?

2819
01:35:39,143 --> 01:35:41,113
- I'm sorry. - You can't be like that.

2820
01:35:41,373 --> 01:35:43,343
(You can't be like that, sir!)

2821
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:44,683
- Sir! - What's your problem?

2822
01:35:44,683 --> 01:35:46,213
- I'm sorry. - Apologize to her.

2823
01:35:46,213 --> 01:35:47,413
Mr. Thug!

2824
01:35:47,413 --> 01:35:49,183
- I'm sorry. - Apologize to her.

2825
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:50,483
What are you doing?

2826
01:35:50,953 --> 01:35:52,123
- I'm okay, Dong Hyun! - I'm sorry.

2827
01:35:52,123 --> 01:35:53,723
- Let's go. - I'm sorry.

2828
01:35:53,723 --> 01:35:55,053
You could've avoided her.

2829
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:56,193
It seems like you bumped into her on purpose.

2830
01:35:56,193 --> 01:35:57,663
What do you mean I bumped into her on purpose?

2831
01:35:58,263 --> 01:35:59,333
- What did you say? - Who do you think...

2832
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:00,493
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2833
01:36:00,693 --> 01:36:01,803
(Scared)

2834
01:36:02,163 --> 01:36:03,363
- Shall we get going? - I'm sorry.

2835
01:36:03,363 --> 01:36:04,533
Shall we get going? Let's go.

2836
01:36:04,533 --> 01:36:05,633
Let's go.

2837
01:36:05,633 --> 01:36:07,503
Both of them were weird!

2838
01:36:07,503 --> 01:36:09,503
How can the thug be scared?

2839
01:36:10,573 --> 01:36:11,943
How can you really get scared?

2840
01:36:11,943 --> 01:36:13,073
- I think I got it though. - Wait.

2841
01:36:13,073 --> 01:36:15,113
Just judge it based on what I did.

2842
01:36:15,713 --> 01:36:17,313
- I figured out the detail. - Just me.

2843
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:18,513
It's Eun Hye's turn next.

2844
01:36:18,713 --> 01:36:20,053
Okay. I'm ready.

2845
01:36:20,283 --> 01:36:21,753
- This will be nice. - Okay.

2846
01:36:21,753 --> 01:36:22,823
(Dong Hyun is the girlfriend.)

2847
01:36:25,923 --> 01:36:27,453
(Overreacting)

2848
01:36:27,453 --> 01:36:28,793
What are you doing?

2849
01:36:29,423 --> 01:36:31,263
- Are you okay? - He did that on purpose!

2850
01:36:31,263 --> 01:36:32,663
- Hold on! - What do you want?

2851
01:36:34,263 --> 01:36:35,363
Be careful.

2852
01:36:35,463 --> 01:36:36,633
You should still...

2853
01:36:37,103 --> 01:36:38,533
- Let's go. - It hurt.

2854
01:36:38,533 --> 01:36:40,473
- Your girlfriend is so ugly! - Did it hurt?

2855
01:36:40,973 --> 01:36:42,073
(They missed what he said.)

2856
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:43,143
(He does his best to improvise.)

2857
01:36:44,603 --> 01:36:46,213
- Okay. - That was it.

2858
01:36:47,043 --> 01:36:48,143
Not bad.

2859
01:36:48,143 --> 01:36:49,283
- Was that okay? - Yes.

2860
01:36:49,283 --> 01:36:50,343
All right.

2861
01:36:50,343 --> 01:36:51,953
- Okay. - Okay.

2862
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:53,813
We'll walk past each other.

2863
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:55,223
All right.

2864
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:58,853
- Yi Kyung. - Gosh.

2865
01:36:58,853 --> 01:37:00,553
- What are you doing? - Yi Kyung!

2866
01:37:00,553 --> 01:37:01,863
I'm hurt, Yi Kyung!

2867
01:37:02,223 --> 01:37:03,263
Yi Kyung!

2868
01:37:03,663 --> 01:37:05,463
Gosh, what weirdos.

2869
01:37:05,463 --> 01:37:06,463
Hey!

2870
01:37:06,463 --> 01:37:07,763
(He runs away just like that.)

2871
01:37:09,163 --> 01:37:11,163
- That one was obvious. - That one was obvious.

2872
01:37:11,163 --> 01:37:12,203
(His part was obvious.)

2873
01:37:12,203 --> 01:37:14,103
- That one was obvious. - Okay.

2874
01:37:14,503 --> 01:37:15,503
(He got it.)
All of our parts are clear.

2875
01:37:16,503 --> 01:37:18,243
- Seung Ho's part is confusing. - Our parts are clear.

2876
01:37:18,243 --> 01:37:20,143
- Seung Ho's part can be confusing. - This one is too hard.

2877
01:37:20,143 --> 01:37:21,473
No. It will be easy.

2878
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:22,843
Let's go.

2879
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:27,283
- That hurt, Seung Ho! - What was that?

2880
01:37:27,283 --> 01:37:28,853
(Staring)

2881
01:37:29,283 --> 01:37:31,223
- Hurry up and go up to him! - What?

2882
01:37:31,923 --> 01:37:33,153
What do you want?

2883
01:37:33,893 --> 01:37:34,923
Apologize to her.

2884
01:37:36,293 --> 01:37:37,923
I'm sorry. Happy now?

2885
01:37:37,963 --> 01:37:39,563
(Glaring eyes)

2886
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:40,833
Do it properly.

2887
01:37:41,433 --> 01:37:42,563
I'm sorry.

2888
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:45,703
(He ends things with a polite handshake after a warning.)

2889
01:37:45,703 --> 01:37:47,233
- You should get going. - Bye.

2890
01:37:47,233 --> 01:37:48,703
They're such weirdos.

2891
01:37:49,103 --> 01:37:51,003
- This one is confusing. - This won't do.

2892
01:37:51,003 --> 01:37:53,613
I acted based on what the members did.

2893
01:37:53,613 --> 01:37:54,813
I think I know what it is.

2894
01:37:54,813 --> 01:37:57,313
But the person who has to answer it acted as well.

2895
01:37:57,483 --> 01:37:58,483
Can you tell what the numbers are?

2896
01:37:58,483 --> 01:38:00,353
Starting from the next round,

2897
01:38:00,353 --> 01:38:01,513
we shouldn't make him act.

2898
01:38:01,813 --> 01:38:03,623
Will you be able to get it after acting as well?

2899
01:38:03,623 --> 01:38:04,623
I got it perfectly down.

2900
01:38:04,883 --> 01:38:06,793
- I'll start with the lowest number. - Are you going for it?

2901
01:38:06,793 --> 01:38:07,953
The one with the lowest number is Yi Kyung.

2902
01:38:07,953 --> 01:38:09,363
- I'm number one. - There we go.

2903
01:38:09,363 --> 01:38:10,423
(Yi Kyung is number 1 as expected.)

2904
01:38:10,423 --> 01:38:11,493
Next.

2905
01:38:12,293 --> 01:38:13,593
- It's Eun Hye. - There we go.

2906
01:38:13,593 --> 01:38:15,263
- Yes! - See?

2907
01:38:15,263 --> 01:38:16,263
(He got numbers 1 and 2 right.)

2908
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:18,463
- Then... - There are three left.

2909
01:38:18,463 --> 01:38:19,673
The one with number three.

2910
01:38:20,473 --> 01:38:22,503
- It's Tae Hyun! - Right!

2911
01:38:22,503 --> 01:38:23,773
- It's not him. - It is him.

2912
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:25,073
- It's him. - It's him.

2913
01:38:25,073 --> 01:38:26,143
- Think carefully. - It is him.

2914
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:27,473
- No! - But...

2915
01:38:27,473 --> 01:38:28,943
Go for it. You never know.

2916
01:38:29,113 --> 01:38:31,483
I thought the same as Eun Hye.

2917
01:38:31,743 --> 01:38:33,113
- Tae Hyun! - He's number five.

2918
01:38:33,113 --> 01:38:35,083
There are numbers 6 and 7 left. There's still a chance.

2919
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:36,323
- Right. - There's still a chance.

2920
01:38:36,323 --> 01:38:37,983
- Seung Ho is next. - That wasn't a six.

2921
01:38:37,983 --> 01:38:40,323
(Sang Uk thinks Seung Ho is number 6.)

2922
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:41,823
- Hey. - He's number six?

2923
01:38:41,823 --> 01:38:42,993
If I had number six,

2924
01:38:43,523 --> 01:38:45,063
I would've kicked your knee right away.

2925
01:38:49,233 --> 01:38:51,203
You were that scary when you were number three?

2926
01:38:51,203 --> 01:38:52,603
- Well... - Why were you being scary?

2927
01:38:52,603 --> 01:38:54,003
Listen to me.

2928
01:38:54,003 --> 01:38:56,173
- Why were you being scary? - Hold on.

2929
01:38:56,373 --> 01:38:58,143
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - But...

2930
01:38:58,143 --> 01:38:59,813
why did you get scared?

2931
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:02,283
- I just calmly went, - His face turned red.

2932
01:39:02,283 --> 01:39:04,343
"Apologize to her."

2933
01:39:04,743 --> 01:39:07,753
- What? He's number four? - That makes no sense.

2934
01:39:07,753 --> 01:39:09,153
(Shocking number 4)

2935
01:39:09,153 --> 01:39:10,853
- I can't play with him! - Hold on.

2936
01:39:10,853 --> 01:39:12,223
- Let me explain. - Gosh!

2937
01:39:12,223 --> 01:39:13,423
I can't play with him!

2938
01:39:13,423 --> 01:39:15,563
- That was surely a number six. - Gosh!

2939
01:39:16,223 --> 01:39:17,993
Wasn't that absurd?

2940
01:39:18,323 --> 01:39:20,433
- That was my number four for me. - Well,

2941
01:39:20,433 --> 01:39:22,703
the two of us can make things seem worse.

2942
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:25,603
Dong Hyun's part was intense.

2943
01:39:25,603 --> 01:39:28,033
(That's strange. He felt really scary.)

2944
01:39:28,573 --> 01:39:30,173
- Forget it! - Give me another chance.

2945
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:31,903
- Forget it! - Hold on.

2946
01:39:31,903 --> 01:39:33,843
Come on. It's not the number...

2947
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,273
- that is the problem. - This is what happens...

2948
01:39:35,273 --> 01:39:36,713
when he gets number four.

2949
01:39:37,043 --> 01:39:38,613
I keep getting number four.

2950
01:39:38,613 --> 01:39:39,613
(He reveals the reason they failed.)

2951
01:39:39,613 --> 01:39:40,883
I keep getting number four.

2952
01:39:40,883 --> 01:39:43,183
- Stop giving me number four! - The next one will be better.

2953
01:39:43,183 --> 01:39:44,523
All right.

2954
01:39:44,523 --> 01:39:47,723
For the next one, make sure to make Dong Hyun go first.

2955
01:39:47,723 --> 01:39:50,163
- Okay! We should do that. - Right. We should do that.

2956
01:39:50,163 --> 01:39:51,893
It doesn't matter which number you get.

2957
01:39:51,893 --> 01:39:52,933
Go with your acting.

2958
01:39:55,563 --> 01:39:57,303
I got rid of the beef brisket.

2959
01:39:57,303 --> 01:39:59,403
- Beef brisket is my favorite. - Which round are we at?

2960
01:39:59,403 --> 01:40:01,403
- This is bad. - We still have those, right?

2961
01:40:01,403 --> 01:40:04,243
You have won 2 cuts so far. The other 2 have been given away.

2962
01:40:04,243 --> 01:40:05,543
- Let's get the next one! - Right.

2963
01:40:05,543 --> 01:40:06,613
Great.

2964
01:40:07,373 --> 01:40:09,613
- Can I answer this one? - Sure.

2965
01:40:09,613 --> 01:40:11,383
- Do as you wish. - All right.

2966
01:40:11,383 --> 01:40:12,453
We watched a lot of movies based on this.

2967
01:40:12,453 --> 01:40:13,513
- Okay. - Okay.

2968
01:40:13,713 --> 01:40:15,853
You all have been infected...

2969
01:40:15,853 --> 01:40:19,793
by a zombie virus. What do you look like?

2970
01:40:19,793 --> 01:40:21,093
- I'm a zombie? - Yes.

2971
01:40:21,093 --> 01:40:22,623
- You all have been infected. - I'm a zombie.

2972
01:40:22,623 --> 01:40:25,593
This is what number one is.

2973
01:40:25,763 --> 01:40:27,863
You still can make rational decisions.

2974
01:40:27,863 --> 01:40:28,933
Rational decisions.

2975
01:40:29,433 --> 01:40:30,863
It's the initial stage of the infection.

2976
01:40:32,203 --> 01:40:34,603
Number seven means you are a monster.

2977
01:40:34,603 --> 01:40:38,103
(Terminal stage as a monster)

2978
01:40:38,103 --> 01:40:39,313
All right, everyone.

2979
01:40:39,313 --> 01:40:40,543
I watched a lot of zombie movies.

2980
01:40:42,143 --> 01:40:45,683
I'll watch Dong Hyun's part first.

2981
01:40:47,653 --> 01:40:49,753
- What? - Did you start?

2982
01:40:50,183 --> 01:40:53,453
(Dong Hyun gets infected all of a sudden.)

2983
01:40:53,493 --> 01:40:57,093
- Did you start? - When did he get bitten?

2984
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:58,093
(When did he get bitten?)

2985
01:40:59,693 --> 01:41:04,733
(Why are you good at this?)

2986
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:10,643
(An amazing performance by the zombie movie lover)

2987
01:41:10,643 --> 01:41:13,173
That was the best performance out of all of the rounds.

2988
01:41:13,173 --> 01:41:14,313
That was his best performance.

2989
01:41:15,783 --> 01:41:17,443
(I'm not done yet.)

2990
01:41:17,443 --> 01:41:19,553
Save me!

2991
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:21,813
(Zombie Dong Hyun was very clear.)

2992
01:41:21,813 --> 01:41:22,823
That was clear.

2993
01:41:23,153 --> 01:41:24,453
Next,

2994
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:25,993
I'll go with Seung Ho as he's standing up.

2995
01:41:25,993 --> 01:41:26,993
(Seung Ho will go next.)

2996
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:28,053
Here I go.

2997
01:41:37,803 --> 01:41:39,973
He still has his rationality.

2998
01:41:43,373 --> 01:41:45,543
- That's it? - It can't end like that.

2999
01:41:45,543 --> 01:41:47,573
(Seung Ho's zombie performance was short and intense.)

3000
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:49,213
Hold on. Think carefully.

3001
01:41:49,213 --> 01:41:50,643
(He writes the number down.)

3002
01:41:50,743 --> 01:41:51,813
Tae Hyun!

3003
01:41:52,483 --> 01:41:54,713
- Tae Hyun is next. - Tae Hyun!

3004
01:41:54,713 --> 01:41:55,923
- It's Tae Hyun. - You're a top actor!

3005
01:41:57,253 --> 01:41:58,353
(Bumping)

3006
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:07,563
(A new zombie appears.)

3007
01:42:10,263 --> 01:42:12,103
(Groaning)

3008
01:42:13,633 --> 01:42:15,203
(Something is a bit off about him.)

3009
01:42:15,203 --> 01:42:16,643
Is that a zombie?

3010
01:42:16,643 --> 01:42:19,343
- I know! It's a drunk old man! - Sir!

3011
01:42:19,343 --> 01:42:21,043
Where do you live?

3012
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:23,083
- Where do you live? - Throw up!

3013
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:25,013
- Throw up! - Throw up!

3014
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:26,653
- He drank a lot. - Get it out!

3015
01:42:26,653 --> 01:42:28,253
- He drank a lot. - You can get it out.

3016
01:42:28,313 --> 01:42:30,123
(Laughing)

3017
01:42:30,783 --> 01:42:33,053
- Okay. - Got it.

3018
01:42:33,393 --> 01:42:34,993
- Okay. - I'll go next.

3019
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:36,223
- Would you like to go next? - Yes.

3020
01:42:36,223 --> 01:42:37,223
(Eun Hye is next.)

3021
01:42:37,223 --> 01:42:38,563
This is hard. Here I go.

3022
01:42:41,093 --> 01:42:42,093
Well,

3023
01:42:43,463 --> 01:42:45,063
thank you for everything.

3024
01:42:47,473 --> 01:42:48,943
(Groaning)

3025
01:42:49,603 --> 01:42:50,803
Get away from me!

3026
01:42:51,873 --> 01:42:54,273
Go! Hurry!

3027
01:43:01,713 --> 01:43:03,023
- That was it. - Gosh.

3028
01:43:03,023 --> 01:43:05,523
She knew that she felt thirsty.

3029
01:43:05,523 --> 01:43:07,523
- That was clear. - Right.

3030
01:43:07,893 --> 01:43:09,263
That was the clearest one.

3031
01:43:09,263 --> 01:43:12,263
Right. That was clear. Then Seung Ho's part is...

3032
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:14,633
Okay.

3033
01:43:14,633 --> 01:43:15,633
(The last zombie, Sang Uk)

3034
01:43:18,263 --> 01:43:19,873
No!

3035
01:43:22,173 --> 01:43:23,543
No!

3036
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:28,713
(What on earth was that?)

3037
01:43:29,483 --> 01:43:30,943
- That was it. - Hold on!

3038
01:43:30,943 --> 01:43:32,353
I have no idea!

3039
01:43:32,713 --> 01:43:34,283
- Hold on! - Hey!

3040
01:43:34,283 --> 01:43:36,653
That was so entertaining. Could you show us a bit more?

3041
01:43:36,653 --> 01:43:40,523
Just a bit more. We're all confused by it.

3042
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:42,493
We shouldn't think too hard about it.

3043
01:43:42,493 --> 01:43:44,463
We have to get this one no matter what!

3044
01:43:44,463 --> 01:43:45,863
Fortunately,

3045
01:43:45,863 --> 01:43:48,593
Dong Hyun picked a high number.

3046
01:43:48,593 --> 01:43:50,503
(Zombie Dong Hyun looked 100 percent infected.)

3047
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:53,733
The other three make it quite confusing.

3048
01:43:53,733 --> 01:43:55,103
- You can surely get it right. - First of all,

3049
01:43:55,103 --> 01:43:57,303
- You can tell the difference. - Dong Hyun is 6 or 7.

3050
01:43:58,003 --> 01:43:59,213
- It had to be intense. - Right.

3051
01:43:59,213 --> 01:44:00,413
Number six had to be intense too.

3052
01:44:00,413 --> 01:44:02,513
The next one. I'll go up from the lowest one.

3053
01:44:02,513 --> 01:44:03,713
- Okay. - Okay.

3054
01:44:03,713 --> 01:44:05,513
- Eun Hye. - Number one.

3055
01:44:05,513 --> 01:44:06,883
Seung Ho.

3056
01:44:07,213 --> 01:44:08,953
Sang Uk.

3057
01:44:08,983 --> 01:44:10,123
Tae Hyun.

3058
01:44:11,523 --> 01:44:13,293
- Did he get it wrong? - Dong Hyun next.

3059
01:44:13,293 --> 01:44:14,793
You have to show your number, Tae Hyun.

3060
01:44:15,593 --> 01:44:17,063
- What? - What?

3061
01:44:17,063 --> 01:44:18,223
He's number three?

3062
01:44:18,223 --> 01:44:20,133
(An unexpected twist)

3063
01:44:20,133 --> 01:44:22,233
- You're number three? - But you transformed?

3064
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,263
- Tae Hyun! - It should've been weaker.

3065
01:44:24,563 --> 01:44:26,803
You're definitely at fault for this one.

3066
01:44:26,803 --> 01:44:28,403
You were like a number five.

3067
01:44:28,473 --> 01:44:30,043
You completely turned into a zombie.

3068
01:44:30,043 --> 01:44:31,043
I wasn't the only one that thought it was weird, right?

3069
01:44:31,043 --> 01:44:32,073
He was surely a zombie.

3070
01:44:32,073 --> 01:44:33,473
You told me off earlier!

3071
01:44:33,513 --> 01:44:36,283
But I didn't expect Sang Uk...

3072
01:44:36,313 --> 01:44:39,353
to speak so accurately as a number four.

3073
01:44:39,953 --> 01:44:41,653
I wanted to express that I was in the middle.

3074
01:44:41,653 --> 01:44:43,983
If I didn't go all in, you were like a number seven.

3075
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,823
We both would've been considered number sevens.

3076
01:44:45,823 --> 01:44:47,093
- We were both at the same level. - Really?

3077
01:44:47,093 --> 01:44:49,423
- It's okay. We have two plates. - Right. We have our meat.

3078
01:44:49,563 --> 01:44:51,093
- You should take one out, Eun Hye. - It's okay.

3079
01:44:51,223 --> 01:44:52,223
(Even the tomahawk gets given away.)

3080
01:44:52,223 --> 01:44:53,593
We only won two plates of meat.

3081
01:44:53,593 --> 01:44:55,903
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

3082
01:44:58,233 --> 01:45:00,533
- Yes. - We still won this much.

3083
01:45:00,533 --> 01:45:01,573
Right.

3084
01:45:01,573 --> 01:45:03,043
(It's time to enjoy the meat party now!)

3085
01:45:03,173 --> 01:45:05,143
(An abundant dinner is enjoyed with MCC.)

3086
01:45:05,243 --> 01:45:06,983
(I love meat.)

3087
01:45:06,983 --> 01:45:10,183
(Their shortage in MCC gets recharged.)

3088
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:11,583
(Fainting after feeling stuffed)

3089
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:14,453
(It's time to wash up and get ready for bed.)

3090
01:45:14,553 --> 01:45:16,153
(Lying down with his arms and legs stretched)

3091
01:45:16,293 --> 01:45:18,953
(Will their day end pleasantly just like that?)

3092
01:45:19,123 --> 01:45:21,563
(The night deepens.)

3093
01:45:21,563 --> 01:45:24,963
(The Handsome Guys get called somewhere before going to bed.)

3094
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:26,463
(This place feels off.)

3095
01:45:26,463 --> 01:45:27,563
(They can sense the chilly atmosphere.)

3096
01:45:27,563 --> 01:45:29,733
(I'm sure this is a horror special!)

3097
01:45:30,033 --> 01:45:31,303
Gosh! I saw it!

3098
01:45:31,303 --> 01:45:35,643
(A horror special for their shortage in courage?)

3099
01:45:39,183 --> 01:45:41,713
(The Shortage in Sleep has begun.)

3100
01:45:41,713 --> 01:45:44,053
(Fifth Life in Shortage: Shortage in Sleep)

3101
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:47,683
(They must fight against their sleepiness...)

3102
01:45:47,683 --> 01:45:48,953
(and earn their sleep!)

3103
01:45:48,953 --> 01:45:51,453
(You don't want anyone to sleep all the way through.)

3104
01:45:51,453 --> 01:45:53,123
(I'll be in big trouble if I lose this one.)

3105
01:45:53,123 --> 01:45:54,993
(Reflexes)

3106
01:45:54,993 --> 01:45:56,733
(Sense of hearing)

3107
01:45:56,733 --> 01:45:57,993
(Eyesight)

3108
01:45:57,993 --> 01:46:00,803
(X-ray vision)

3109
01:46:00,803 --> 01:46:03,203
(Use all of your hidden powers to escape.)

3110
01:46:03,203 --> 01:46:04,773
(Save us.)

3111
01:46:04,773 --> 01:46:06,603
(Am I dreaming or what?)

3112
01:46:06,603 --> 01:46:10,913
(Will we be able to escape from this suffering?)
