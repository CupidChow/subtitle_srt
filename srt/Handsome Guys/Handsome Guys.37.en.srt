1
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,738
(Is it samgyetang...)

2
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,778
(or bulgogi?)

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,808
(Season-grilled...)

4
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:23,208
(or salt-grilled?)

5
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,148
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,778
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,148
(and regret)

8
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,159
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,729
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,889
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,528
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:44,939
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,809
(Mapo-gu)

14
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,779
(The summer at the height of its heat wave)

15
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,078
(They came to a cafe by the river to avoid the heat.)

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,119
It's indoors.

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,619
It's indoors.

18
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,319
- This is nice. - Gosh, you can see the Han River.

19
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,089
- It feels cool. - We're indoors.

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,259
Seung Ho had something important to do,

21
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,089
so only the four of us are here.

22
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,358
Since there are only four of us today,

23
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,728
- we need two more people. - Yes.

24
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,029
We have one who eats well...

25
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,668
- And? - and another who looks normal.

26
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:20,739
(Hint 1 about the guests)

27
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,769
How good do you think they are at quizzes?

28
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,039
Both of them are...

29
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:25,778
For someone who's obsessed with quizzes,

30
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,109
you're terrible at them.

31
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,209
Since I'm bad at them, I need someone worse than me.

32
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,749
Based on my research so far,

33
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:36,549
they don't seem very intelligent.

34
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,388
- This is good. - They'll probably be bad.

35
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:40,619
(We're relieved to welcome you.)

36
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,498
- Hello, Seung Hwan and Ju Hwan. - Hello.

37
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:45,959
Please come this way.

38
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,398
- Hello. - Hello.

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,628
- My goodness. - Hello.

40
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,869
(Welcome, Hwan Brothers.)

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,908
(He was Tae Hyun's road manager before his debut.)

42
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,379
(He caught attention with his overflowing charm.)

43
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,748
(He fooled Tae Hyun with his method acting.)

44
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,179
(Crying)

45
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:10,089
(He even made Tae Hyun cry.)

46
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,159
(Yes, it was a success! Crying)

47
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,629
(That's how he made his first step into entertainment.)

48
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,829
(His acting has personality in every work.)

49
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,709
(An exceptional actor who captivated the screen)

50
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:32,178
(He has profound knowledge about food.)

51
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,179
(Humming)

52
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,848
(Among celebrities, he knows how to eat.)

53
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,049
(Gourmet Actor Shin Seung Hwan)

54
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,548
(Smiling)

55
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,259
(He cooks complicated dishes easily.)

56
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,529
(A hidden chef in entertainment)

57
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,059
Hello.

58
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:58,268
(As a bonus, his handsome face keeps the regulars coming back.)

59
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,368
(He's handsome.)

60
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,039
(Yes, he's handsome.)

61
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:06,739
(He can play characters of a wide spectrum.)

62
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:11,079
(A born actor with many talents)

63
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,119
(Versatile and handsome Lim Ju Hwan)

64
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,718
- Please say hello to the viewers. - Okay.

65
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,829
Hello, I'm Shin Seung Hwan. Nice to meet you.

66
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,729
That's great.

67
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,858
Hello, I'm Lim Ju Hwan.

68
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,599
(I'm Lim Ju Hwan.)

69
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,268
I like watching action movies,

70
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,868
- and you're always in them. - Right.

71
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:32,968
You always play someone...

72
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,738
- who works for the main character. - His role?

73
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,739
Either you get hurt in his place,

74
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,639
or you get punched and report it to him.

75
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,809
- Or he gets hurt in his place? - Yes.

76
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,578
You think that he would kill the villain,

77
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,479
- but he ends up being killed. - Right.

78
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,678
(Shin Seung Hwan, an actor who dies easily)

79
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,819
(Appeared in "I, the Executioner," "The Tale of Lady Ok")

80
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,088
Among the roles you've played,

81
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,748
which one had the highest position?

82
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,418
- Recently, I played the boss. - That's right.

83
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,458
- The boss? - Yes.

84
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,788
It's a British series called "Gangs of London."

85
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,558
- A British TV series. - I was in a British TV series.

86
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,859
A British TV series?

87
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,398
I play the boss.

88
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,698
Were you both cast in it?

89
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,099
Ju Hwan plays the killer.

90
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,139
(That's incredible.)

91
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:07,368
Here's the twist. He's the boss,

92
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:08,668
- but he dies immediately. - I die immediately.

93
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,238
I was just going to say that.

94
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,579
The role I play is impressive,

95
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,379
but I die immediately.

96
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:15,449
It suits you well.

97
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:17,249
Do you live much longer?

98
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,449
I live...

99
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,418
a few seconds longer than him.

100
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,088
(I still live a few more seconds.)

101
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,789
You can appear in the next season.

102
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,488
Have you seen...

103
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:27,888
Handsome Guys?

104
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:28,889
I have.

105
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,828
Are you better at eating or answering the quiz?

106
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,298
I try to answer the quizzes...

107
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,269
while watching the show.

108
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,598
My answers are mostly correct.

109
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,999
- Really? - Is that so?

110
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,209
I like how pretentious you are.

111
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:42,508
You're being pretentious.

112
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,038
- I know exactly who's terrible. - Really?

113
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,578
The terrible ones are gathered on one side today.

114
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,648
(The terrible ones are gathered on one side today.)

115
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,409
- Is that so? - His hands are...

116
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,679
pointing at us.

117
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,848
(That's correct.)

118
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,089
I don't know about quizzes,

119
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,049
but I'm relaxed. The CEO...

120
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,288
- of my agency is here. - The CEO of his agency.

121
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,358
("Lim Ju Hwan Joined Zo In Sung and Cha Tae Hyun's Team")

122
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,658
("Cha Tae Hyun and Zo In Sung's Agency Hired Lim Ju Hwan")

123
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,088
Who cares? You have to use your personal card.

124
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,728
According to our contract,

125
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,258
various expenses at work are covered by the agency.

126
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,458
"Various expenses?"

127
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,028
Do they exist?

128
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,328
Isn't this part of various expenses?

129
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,798
Tae Hyun, please explain.

130
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,998
Is this part of various expenses?

131
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,068
What do you think, sir?

132
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,639
I didn't read the contract thoroughly.

133
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,008
(Always read contracts thoroughly.)

134
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,208
I didn't know about that.

135
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,178
- Because you're at work? - Exactly.

136
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm at work right now.

137
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,048
In that case...

138
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:24,349
In that case,

139
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,549
I shouldn't be on Ju Hwan's team.

140
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:28,288
Then you can be relaxed.

141
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,588
Right, who cares?

142
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:30,719
"Various expenses."

143
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,319
I haven't thought of that.

144
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,559
So today,

145
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,488
we will be recommending food...

146
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:37,598
in Gongdeok.

147
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,929
- Right. - Gongdeok.

148
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,298
Over here...

149
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,098
Gongdeok Area One will finish redeveloping...

150
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,429
by early next year.

151
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,568
- Did you invest in it? - No.

152
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,398
He looks like a handsome real estate agent.

153
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,539
(Laughing)

154
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,739
As you may know, this place is...

155
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,538
(Today's Menu Recommendation Area)

156
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,078
(Gongdeok)

157
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,478
As it's close to Han River,

158
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,149
it served as a key logistics hub...

159
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,388
connecting Seoul with the rest of the country.

160
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,488
(As ingredients from various regions flowed in)

161
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,458
(Mapo Naru where local dishes...)

162
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,328
(and markets developed early)

163
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,628
There's a concentration of government offices...

164
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,199
and office buildings of various fields including start-ups.

165
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,098
It's packed with office-related commercial areas.

166
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,539
(Office-related commercial areas are developed in Gongdeok.)

167
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,938
It has many popular restaurants.

168
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,709
- It has many old restaurants. - Right.

169
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,078
Mapo is known for many popular restaurants.

170
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,649
(Among various things to eat in Gongdeok)

171
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,019
(What will Handsome Guys recommend today?)

172
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,218
Today's menu is...

173
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,758
bulgogi.

174
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,459
- I love bulgogi. - Bulgogi? Oh, my gosh.

175
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,858
- It's called grilled bulgogi. - I love bulgogi.

176
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,128
- "Grilled bulgogi?" - Grilled bulgogi.

177
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,558
- Have you heard of it? - Of course.

178
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,728
It's grilled.

179
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:46,898
- It's like Eonyang bulgogi. - It's flat.

180
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,569
- It's similar to Eonyang bulgogi. - I see.

181
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,469
We'll be having grilled bulgogi...

182
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,769
and samgyetang.

183
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,868
- Wasn't it Chobok yesterday? - Yes.

184
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:56,308
From the day of the shoot, yesterday was Chobok.

185
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:58,178
- I like both of them. - We're just a day late.

186
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,208
I like samgyetang.

187
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,479
I like both of them.

188
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:05,418
(Revitalizing samgyetang to fight the heat with hot food)

189
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,749
(Grilled bulgogi versus samgyetang)

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,458
I will pick...

191
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,489
samgyetang. I'd like samgyetang.

192
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,159
- I also pick samgyetang. - I need it.

193
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,458
To overcome...

194
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,028
- Right. - the hot summer.

195
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,128
That's my reason.

196
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,399
I like both dishes,

197
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,798
but I'm craving the grilled bulgogi a little more.

198
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,999
- Grilled bulgogi? - That's how I feel.

199
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,898
What would you like to eat?

200
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:27,938
- I... - I don't mind either one.

201
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,438
I don't crave samgyetang right now.

202
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,278
- When he said grilled bulgogi, - Grilled bulgogi?

203
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,909
My body reacted.

204
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,238
Is it because Dong Hyun picked it?

205
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,548
- After I picked it... - All of a sudden...

206
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:36,809
That's not why, right?

207
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,979
All of a sudden...

208
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,418
It's because you picked it.

209
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,978
(I'll definitely follow the weakest.)

210
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,248
I like your desire to win.

211
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,988
I'll wrap it with some lettuce.

212
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,318
When I take a bite,

213
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,619
- it'd be lovely. - I agree.

214
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,758
- Two for grilled bulgogi. - Should I get samgyetang?

215
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,359
- Two for samgyetang. - Yes.

216
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,628
Ju Hwan, do you prefer any of them?

217
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,058
I had samgyetang yesterday.

218
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,098
(I already ate it on Chobok.)

219
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,468
- Then you must get grilled bulgogi. - So...

220
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,169
- I'll get grilled bulgogi. - Grilled bulgogi?

221
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,499
I think Dong Hyun plays a big part in their choice.

222
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,208
- The two of you... - They joined Dong Hyun.

223
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,468
- Did you choose it because of me? - I mean...

224
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:05,279
You didn't say that you had samgyetang yesterday.

225
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,748
Since I picked samgyetang...

226
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,308
- I'll go over there. - Come this way.

227
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,878
- Okay. - This is perfect.

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,078
The three of us will get samgyetang.

229
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,089
The three of them will get grilled bulgogi.

230
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,188
- Please. - I'm nervous.

231
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,418
I don't know which one we'll get first today.

232
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,788
I bet we'll get grilled bulgogi first.

233
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,818
What are we getting first?

234
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:20,889
- Grilled bulgogi. - Okay.

235
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,728
This is huge.

236
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,298
- This is huge. - That's the best.

237
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,358
Really?

238
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,269
- Let's get grilled bulgogi first. - Let's go.

239
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,899
Let's go.

240
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,738
- Grilled bulgogi. - This is amazing.

241
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,069
I'm so happy.

242
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:38,509
Let's go.

243
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,249
- The cicadas sound loud now. - It's hot.

244
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,908
It's really hot.

245
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,079
(A sweltering midday with the sun beating down)

246
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,989
It feels like a sauna.

247
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,549
It's hot.

248
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,688
It feels like a dry sauna.

249
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:51,858
(Walking through the heat like a dry sauna)

250
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:52,888
It's hot.

251
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,558
- The office workers are holding... - They're usually out by now.

252
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,128
A cup of coffee after lunch.

253
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,199
(Heading for the grilled bulgogi while feeling like office workers)

254
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,598
- Is this it? - It must be it.

255
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,858
- This is the place. - Where?

256
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,198
- Here? - There it is.

257
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,668
- It's really big. - There it is.

258
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,538
- That's the restaurant. - It's huge.

259
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,598
Look at this.

260
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,168
- Michelin? - For nine consecutive years?

261
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,309
It's a Michelin restaurant.

262
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,769
- Seriously? - This is amazing.

263
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,839
- We made a good choice. - Oh, yes.

264
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,409
- I'm doomed again. - Let's go in.

265
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,218
How did we get this place to be on the show?

266
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:19,278
I made the wrong choice.

267
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,348
This always happens.

268
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:21,618
- Unbelievable. - Now...

269
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:22,619
Look at this.

270
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,849
She was the first generation.

271
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,719
- Up to the third generation. - Amazing.

272
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,058
She got a license back then.

273
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,388
(Licensed to be a cook)

274
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,259
It's a license from 1966.

275
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,968
(Looking around like they're at a museum)

276
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,698
- Don't you think it's... - What?

277
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,169
Tom Cruise was here.

278
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,498
There's a photo of him here.

279
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,638
He was here.

280
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,339
- It's true. - This place is amazing.

281
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,478
He really came here.

282
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,838
Tae Hyun doesn't look happy right now.

283
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,048
At this rate...

284
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,479
- Tae Hyun doesn't look happy. - I'm doomed.

285
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:50,779
I'm doomed.

286
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,849
(Time we've spent with our customers)

287
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,119
(It's been open for 97 years.)

288
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,718
(The quintessence of crispy on the outside, moist inside)

289
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,859
(Served on the table with the smoky flavor)

290
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,999
I've been a regular here for 30 years.

291
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,869
This dish doesn't exist anywhere else.

292
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,869
The meat portion is generous.

293
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,199
It's crispy and nicely grilled.

294
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:15,568
- We returned because it's tasty. - We returned because it's tasty.

295
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:16,609
(We returned because it's tasty.)

296
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,809
(LMR 1, grilled bulgogi)

297
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,408
This is one of the best.

298
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,319
Tae Hyun and I got shocked.

299
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:27,678
It isn't an ordinary restaurant.

300
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,389
It's not an ordinary restaurant.

301
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,718
I'm blessed...

302
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,689
- when it comes to eating. - Really?

303
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,158
- Hello. - Hello.

304
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,229
Hello, ma'am.

305
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,598
- Hello. - Seeing such amazing men...

306
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,059
- makes my heart beat fast. - Hello.

307
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,028
Are you the owner of this restaurant?

308
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,168
- Yes. - Which generation are you?

309
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,798
- I'm the 3rd generation. - The 3rd?

310
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,268
The 2nd and 3rd generation.

311
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,738
The first generation was...

312
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,568
my grandmother-in-law in Suncheon.

313
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,949
She started running the restaurant in 1929.

314
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,548
Then she moved to Seoul with her husband in 1962.

315
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,018
They opened a restaurant in front of Yongsan Station.

316
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,289
(The restaurant moved to the front of Yongsan Station.)

317
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,059
Near the station?

318
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:06,788
- It was a restaurant... - A restaurant near the station?

319
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:07,818
That's where the name comes from.

320
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:08,858
(It moved to Gongdeok in 2007.)

321
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:10,729
It was in front of Yongsan Station.

322
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:14,099
Did they start making bulgogi?

323
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,268
Right.

324
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,598
My father-in-law started...

325
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:20,168
to make bulgogi according to his wife's recipe.

326
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,008
Making bulgogi creates a lot of smoke.

327
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:23,538
The smell stuck to clothes...

328
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,909
of customers who were taking the train.

329
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,648
My father-in-law decided...

330
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,208
to grill the meat in the kitchen.

331
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,819
It was in consideration of his customers.

332
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,818
He served bulgogi after grilling it in the kitchen.

333
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,288
(He grilled bulgogi beforehand in the kitchen.)

334
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,488
Customers asked him...

335
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,229
why his bulgogi looked like this.

336
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,258
As a witty response,

337
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,959
my father said, "It's because it's crispy grilled bulgogi."

338
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,228
After that, customers asked...

339
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,098
for the grilled bulgogi...

340
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,538
- because it was delicious. - So that's why.

341
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,968
That's how the dish became grilled bulgogi.

342
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,508
(That's how grilled bulgogi was created.)

343
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,408
Then is this the original grilled bulgogi?

344
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,578
- Is it the original? - It's the original.

345
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,878
- It's the original. - My goodness.

346
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,048
Grilled bulgogi.

347
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,609
I can see that it's the original.

348
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,278
Around your hands...

349
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,418
- No. - You have a lot.

350
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,748
You have a lot...

351
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,188
- of accessories. - Why would you look?

352
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,358
It must be true.

353
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,319
- Why are you looking down here? - Don't misunderstand.

354
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,459
I can't help it...

355
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,189
because they sparkle.

356
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,628
Shall we order?

357
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,829
- Sure. - What should we order?

358
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,358
- By the way... - We must get grilled bulgogi.

359
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,768
Grilled bulgogi is also good,

360
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,068
but I saw one on my way here.

361
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,328
- Me too. - Did you?

362
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:25,338
I saw it too.

363
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,698
Was it grilled octopus?

364
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,038
- Live small octopus. - Live small octopus?

365
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,069
Grilled live small octopus.

366
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,209
- Dong Hyun is getting excited. - We have grilled small octopus.

367
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,678
Which is the most popular dish?

368
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
Most people order...

369
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,678
Recharge Your Energy Set.

370
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,048
It includes a combo.

371
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,848
- A combo? - You can switch the content.

372
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,448
So that's why I smelled skate.

373
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:43,588
It'd be perfect...

374
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,188
if we can add grilled small octopus.

375
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:46,258
- What do you think? - That sounds good.

376
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,289
- Doesn't it sound good? - Okay.

377
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,888
You can do that too.

378
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,189
(I'm so excited.)

379
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,828
It will include grilled small octopus.

380
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:52,928
Yes, we'll order it additionally.

381
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,098
- Thank you. - Okay.

382
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,269
Thank you.

383
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,068
- This is incredible. - Dong Hyun is very excited.

384
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,898
You picked an amazing restaurant.

385
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,068
This restaurant has...

386
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:02,668
- all the dishes that I love. - Seriously.

387
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,739
Gosh, I made such a great choice.

388
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,108
They need to pay for it at least.

389
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,348
(They need to pay for it at least.)

390
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,409
Pay?

391
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,578
- I can't bear to see you pay today. - Right now,

392
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,218
I'd be happy to pay so that I can eat.

393
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,548
(I'd be happy to pay so that I can eat.)

394
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:15,719
Seriously.

395
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,249
I totally agree.

396
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,289
Here's your order.

397
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,629
What's this?

398
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,929
(What's this?)

399
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:26,364
- Here's your order. - What?

400
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:27,765
What's this?

401
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,065
What's this?

402
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,674
Didn't we already tell you?

403
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,134
- You're being ridiculous. - I was surprised.

404
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,334
Me too.

405
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,274
- You've gotten much better. - Could you take these?

406
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,704
(Ryu Dam, the son-in-law of the grilled bulgogi restaurant)

407
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,145
How did you know that I was here?

408
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:42,214
- Seung Hwan told us. - I heard about it.

409
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:43,215
Really?

410
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,445
There must be a rumor about it.

411
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,102
I heard that it won the gold award.

412
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,442
- Yes, I made it. - We should taste it.

413
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:50,372
- You made it? - You made it yourself?

414
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,683
You're amazing.

415
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:53,983
This is called Samyangju.

416
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:57,483
It was fermented three times.

417
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:59,952
It has no additives.

418
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:03,253
It's flavored with rice and glutinous rice only.

419
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:04,823
- That's how it's made. - He's an expert.

420
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:05,992
I'm curious about the taste.

421
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:07,963
I will serve each of you a drink.

422
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,633
Shall I serve you?

423
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,562
Only the three of them can eat. We can't eat.

424
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:12,632
- Why not? - What do you think?

425
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,833
- You can't drink? - This is...

426
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,503
- Let's taste it together. - Really?

427
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,073
- We will let you. - Seriously?

428
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,802
- When they taste the alcohol, - We should let them taste it.

429
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,142
- It's because... - they won't be able to resist.

430
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,142
- Since the alcohol is strong, - They have to taste it.

431
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,012
- when the bulgogi is served, - Instead...

432
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,712
- it'll drive them crazy. - They won't be able to resist it.

433
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:28,883
- Just taste it a little. - A little?

434
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:30,953
- It will drive them crazy. - Then I'll have some.

435
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,482
- Just a little. - A little bit.

436
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:33,653
Serve him well.

437
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,453
About this much.

438
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,062
This is so fascinating.

439
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,623
- It's been a while. - I should drink with the food.

440
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,392
- Dam... - Before you drink...

441
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:42,862
- Dam made this. - It's very clear.

442
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,802
Let's clink glasses.

443
00:14:44,803 --> 00:14:46,803
- Thank you, Dam. - Tae Hyun, join us.

444
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:48,032
Dam, drink with us.

445
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,672
- Cheers. - Cheers.

446
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,272
It feels like a company dinner.

447
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,373
A company dinner.

448
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:55,313
It has a strong smell.

449
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:57,913
Gosh, this is nice.

450
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,812
- This is nice. - It tastes like the Grand Award.

451
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:06,622
Once, we went on a trip for makgeolli tasting.

452
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,723
I'm an expert in makgeolli.

453
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,993
- It's really nice and delicious. - It's very tasty.

454
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:13,393
- I'll bring another drink. - Okay.

455
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,692
I shouldn't have taken a sip.

456
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:16,933
I have more appetite.

457
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,233
(Suffering to its maximum)

458
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,462
I don't know if I should pay for it or not.

459
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:21,532
(Glancing)

460
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,372
Stop looking away.

461
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,373
Please look at us.
(Attention, please.)

462
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,242
(The CEO is upset.)

463
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,243
You know what?

464
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,242
(Stealing some kimchi in the midst of chaos)

465
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,383
Did you eat kimchi?

466
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,612
It's kimchi of 100 years.

467
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,182
- The kimchi looks delicious. - Grill some meat.

468
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:38,012
I want some meat on my empty stomach,

469
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,083
but I keep eating kimchi.

470
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:40,823
Do you want to split the bill?

471
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,323
Why are you excluding me?

472
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,493
- Are you willing to pay too? - I heard something.

473
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,492
Wouldn't it be less expensive if the three of us split it?

474
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:49,792
- Of course. - It won't be bad.

475
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:50,793
Let's take a look at the food first.

476
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,233
- Okay. - We need to discuss.

477
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,432
- It's grilled bulgogi. - Oh, my.

478
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,503
- Here's your order. - It's big.

479
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,642
(Thinly sliced beef)

480
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,313
(A perfectly balanced marinade)

481
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:11,413
(The flavor comes from the hands. Shake and mix thoroughly.)

482
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,283
(Come to the world of smoky flavor.)

483
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:19,093
(Getting a fiery massage over the rising flame)

484
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:23,433
(When it's spread out thin and flavored with fire)

485
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,303
(The pinnacle of smoky flavor and texture, grilled bulgogi)

486
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:30,433
- It's grilled bulgogi. - Oh, my.

487
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,242
It's big.

488
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,143
(Joy)

489
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,342
(Sorrow)

490
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:36,742
I can see why it's worth it.

491
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:39,043
This is our signature grilled bulgogi.

492
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,412
This is sweet and sour small octopus salad.

493
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:42,982
(Dishes that make your mouth water keep coming in.)

494
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:44,513
- It's well served. - What's that?

495
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,653
The salad looks excellent.

496
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,553
This is grilled small octopus.

497
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:50,452
- Sweet and sour salad. - What's that?

498
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:51,792
(Mouthwatering)

499
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,822
Let's go.

500
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:54,163
There are many things that I like.

501
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:57,863
This seems worth paying for.

502
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:00,562
- Shall we taste each dish? - Shall we?

503
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,002
We should try the grilled bulgogi first.

504
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:03,132
- Let's try grilled bulgogi first. - Right?

505
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,272
Go ahead.

506
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,373
This is unbelievable.

507
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:08,213
How much should I add? This much?

508
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:09,972
Help yourself.

509
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:11,783
(A heap of grilled bulgogi on a sesame leaf)

510
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,742
- Help yourselves. - Thank you for the food.

511
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,883
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

512
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,653
You can thank them for the food.

513
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:19,953
(Oh, right. There's my CEO.)

514
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,352
(Thank you for the food.)

515
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:25,262
- You just do as ordered. - Thank you.

516
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,293
I'll take that.

517
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,433
- This looks amazing. - It looks so good.

518
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,863
It looks really amazing.

519
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,433
(Happy)

520
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,272
(Ju Hwan also eats a wrap neatly.)

521
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,443
- As soon as you ate it? - Gosh.

522
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,403
(It's to die for.)

523
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,642
I want to put this in it.

524
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,312
(Seung Hwan adds water kimchi in his wrap.)

525
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,983
- It's really good. - As soon as you eat it,

526
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,553
the smoky flavor is incredible.

527
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:52,553
(Savoring with his eyes closed)

528
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:54,453
(Impressed)

529
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,623
This is...

530
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,453
very flavorful.

531
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,892
Usually, meat can taste light...

532
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:00,963
or salty.

533
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,432
This is extremely flavorful.

534
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,563
(The marinade is rich with flavor.)

535
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,732
You would lose your mind when you mix it with rice.

536
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,803
(It's also perfect with a spoonful of warm rice.)

537
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,002
It's not salty.

538
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,173
(I totally agree.)

539
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,303
This...

540
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:17,112
I bet we can eat three plates of it.

541
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,413
One plate per person?

542
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:19,912
- This is... - It'd be one plate per person.

543
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:22,152
They'll be able to eat it.

544
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,183
It's so delicious.

545
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:25,283
Seriously.

546
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:29,393
It's also excellent with dongchimi water.

547
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,722
It looks delicious. I'd be able to eat a lot.

548
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:35,263
- It's really good. - Is there more food?

549
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,293
Oh, my.

550
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:42,803
It's really delicious.

551
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,672
The texture is amazing too.

552
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,972
Let's finish the entire plate.

553
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,043
- Okay. - Let's give the last bite...

554
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,672
to the winner of the game.

555
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,043
- I see. - For each dish.

556
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,953
We should let them play every time we finish the dish.

557
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,013
We'll give a bite to one person.

558
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:58,823
If you don't get to eat this...

559
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,153
Okay.

560
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,393
- What shall we play? - What would you like?

561
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,062
Do you know what nonsense quiz is?

562
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:06,422
- Do you know it or not? - Nonsense...

563
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,562
Nonsense quiz with a sense of humor?

564
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,632
Nonsense quiz...

565
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,092
Here's an example.

566
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,262
- I read it recently. - Why wouldn't I know that?

567
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:14,532
- You know what it is? - Are you out of your mind?

568
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,732
You really know what it is?

569
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,733
I didn't think you knew.

570
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,642
You only know things like Twenty Questions.

571
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:20,242
- That brat... - All right.

572
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,073
You've gotten very sensitive.

573
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:24,542
I've never seen Tae Hyun so sensitive.

574
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,212
We're being very serious.

575
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:27,842
I've known Tae Hyun for over ten years,

576
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:28,882
and I've never seen him like this.

577
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,313
- The food is really good. - It's really good.

578
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,723
Here's a nonsense quiz.

579
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,353
What's a pine tree that's upset?

580
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,193
A pine tree that's upset?

581
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,063
A pine tree that's upset.

582
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:41,993
Upset pine.

583
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,832
- A pine tree... - I'm drawing a blank.

584
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,003
A pine tree that's upset.

585
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,062
(He's also drawing a blank.)

586
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,102
Upset pine.

587
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,332
Shall I make a wrap beforehand?

588
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,473
- Go ahead. - Yes, go ahead.

589
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,172
I'll make it according to a good recipe.

590
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,643
(Making a wrap for the winner)

591
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,142
- Just take any guess. - When a pine tree is upset?

592
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,243
A pine tree is upset.

593
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,042
Tiger cattle?

594
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:02,213
- What did you say? - Tiger cattle?

595
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,682
(Impressed)

596
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:05,823
Am I close?

597
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,652
It's incorrect, but it sounds similar.

598
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:09,952
- Really? - You're close.

599
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:11,423
- Was it a good approach? - I got it.

600
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:12,723
Toothbrush?

601
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,662
- Correct. - Correct.

602
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:15,932
(Answer: Toothbrush)

603
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:16,962
- Correct. - Correct.

604
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:19,433
(No, my grilled bulgogi...)

605
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,073
The answer was toothbrush.

606
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:24,333
I failed to answer again after giving out a hint.

607
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,542
- Thank you. - Toothbrush.

608
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:27,543
Toothbrush.

609
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,042
- Thank you. - Toothbrush?

610
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:33,682
- I told you that you wouldn't know. - Tae Hyun.

611
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,253
Tae Hyun, I suggested giving you a hint.

612
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,482
You would never know.

613
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,652
- Try it now. - Can I eat it now?

614
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,182
Grab it with your hand.

615
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:43,123
- It's a lot of food. - It's really a lot.

616
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,193
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

617
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:49,263
(Eating)

618
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:51,363
It must be so good.

619
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,933
Yi Kyung, there's ssamjang in the wrap.

620
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:58,643
The taste of the bulgogi overpowers the ssamjang.

621
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:00,802
- I mean, its flavor. - It overpowers everything.

622
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:03,612
You briefly taste the sesame leaf, and it's quickly overpowered...

623
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:04,843
by the meat.

624
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,342
You taste the garlic lightly,

625
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,352
but the meat overpowers it again. It overpowers everything.

626
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,412
It's very strong.

627
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:12,182
(The round of grilled bulgogi is over.)

628
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,882
Grilled bulgogi is gone now.

629
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:14,952
- What's next? - What's next?

630
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:16,553
Choose whichever you want.

631
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,492
- Let's go with small octopus. - Let's get small octopus.

632
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,662
- Small octopus? - Small octopus.

633
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:20,663
- Sweet and sour salad. - Small octopus.

634
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:21,863
(Round 2, sweet and sour small octopus salad)

635
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:24,893
Is it thin noodles or slices of white radish?

636
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:26,503
It's slices of white radish.

637
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:30,402
Is it white radish sliced like thin noodles?

638
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:31,733
Or is it thin noodles?

639
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:37,743
(Seasoned with sweet and sour red sauce)

640
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:44,283
(Topped with a generous amount of live small octopus)

641
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:51,093
(Humming with joy)

642
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,092
(Taking a deep breath before eating)

643
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:56,963
(Going at it)

644
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,433
This is good too.

645
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,462
It's 100 times better than seonji.

646
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:03,672
(In love with sweet and sour small octopus salad)

647
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,073
The small octopus is...

648
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,502
extremely tender.

649
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,573
It's made with live small octopus.

650
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,382
The white radish is sliced thin.

651
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:14,983
Every slice is...

652
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,152
marinated with sauce, so it's so good.

653
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:18,153
Right.

654
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:19,452
(Its flavor and texture are both excellent.)

655
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:21,223
Shall we do another riddle quiz for this one?

656
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:23,523
No?

657
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,192
Wait a little. Let us eat first.

658
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:26,693
Yes, take your time and eat.

659
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,422
(Meanwhile...)

660
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,492
- It's so good. - Even the way it looks...

661
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:33,202
This time, I will think before I say anything.

662
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,402
(A savory smell is rising.)

663
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:35,733
It must really be a tasty restaurant.

664
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,843
(Whispering)

665
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:40,242
Here?

666
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,473
Give me a piece of seonji.

667
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:44,343
(Waiting with the plate)

668
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,783
Yes, go ahead.

669
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:49,353
- Is it sungnyung? - They won't notice you eating.

670
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:51,282
You have a spoon over there.

671
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:52,353
(Directly to his mouth)

672
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,353
(Glancing)

673
00:22:57,053 --> 00:22:59,463
(Look at them.)

674
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,893
- A smell? Is there a smell? - What?

675
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:05,502
- It's a meat soup. - Isn't it amazing?

676
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,232
The small octopus isn't the only one.

677
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,502
- Tae Hyun. - My gosh.

678
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,633
Tae Hyun.

679
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:11,873
(How dare you?)

680
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,273
(Seized)

681
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:16,712
It's really good.

682
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:18,373
- Even the way it looks... - This time...

683
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:20,312
It'd also be good with rice.

684
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:21,342
Here you go.

685
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:23,282
If you'd like some, I'll mix it for you.

686
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,353
Could you mix it?

687
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:25,882
Wait a minute.

688
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,722
- We shouldn't give it to him. - I won't eat any.

689
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:28,953
Just give me a new pair of chopsticks.

690
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,222
- You really won't eat any? - I really won't.

691
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,363
I used them.

692
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,022
The thickness is completely different.

693
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:36,393
The beef tartare looks quite sticky, don't you think?

694
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:38,093
It seems wet and spongy.

695
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,133
It's different from ordinary beef tartare.

696
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,573
The beef tartare is marinated with the sauce.

697
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:46,272
It's rich and thick.

698
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,372
The smell is amazing.

699
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:49,112
- That's right. - Like this.

700
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,943
- Yi Kyung. - Like this.

701
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:52,543
This is how I mix it.

702
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,983
I'm mixing it.

703
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,312
(Approaching his dish secretly)

704
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:59,022
- No, Yi Kyung. - I'm mixing it.

705
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:00,522
No, don't try to drop it.

706
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,553
- It's okay. - Oh, come on.

707
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,123
You can't do that.

708
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:05,152
- Hey. - I'm mixing it.

709
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,862
(Tossing it quickly)

710
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,962
- I'm mixing it. - What?

711
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:11,962
Why did the bean sprouts go over there?

712
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:13,003
(They caught me. I don't care anymore!)

713
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,432
(Yi Kyung's hand is faster than the eyes.)

714
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,203
I should eat what's left on my chopsticks.

715
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:18,742
- Isn't it delicious? - It got on my chopsticks.

716
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:20,143
It's so good.

717
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:21,542
It's so good.

718
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,973
It tastes so good that you want to steal it.

719
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,013
- Put it in. - All.

720
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,653
(I could have tasted it.)

721
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,452
- It could drive you crazy. - Goodness.

722
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:33,123
They're very generous with the oil.

723
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,452
They pour a lot in it.

724
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,052
- There's plenty. - The food is seasoned very well.

725
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:40,623
(A big spoonful of savory taste)

726
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,692
Both the white radish salad and the beef tartare have...

727
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,403
a chewy texture despite the thin slices.

728
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:48,873
They get mixed on their own.

729
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:51,802
They turn into a ball like tteokgalbi.

730
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:52,873
Inside your mouth?

731
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,103
Oh, my.

732
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:56,042
I don't want it taken away.

733
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,542
(Even the beef tartare bibimbap is perfect.)

734
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:58,643
It's really delicious.

735
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:02,583
- I'll make a wrap with these. - My gosh.

736
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,582
What about our riddle quiz?

737
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,883
The riddle quiz?

738
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:08,453
Give us a riddle quiz.

739
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,453
- The winner gets a bite. - Forget it.

740
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:12,062
There's more food to taste.

741
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:13,693
You have three dishes. Let us taste them all.

742
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:16,463
(Extremely determined)

743
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,362
What's the house that sides...

744
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,063
only with the younger sibling when brothers fight?

745
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,732
- It's... - I know the answer.

746
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:23,733
This is...

747
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,043
It sides only with the younger sibling?

748
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,902
You can taste only one dish.

749
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,042
You can taste 1, not 5.

750
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,072
- Just one? - Yes.

751
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:31,973
- I heard of this from somewhere. - I know the answer.

752
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,983
This might be very unfavorable to Tae Hyun.

753
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:37,613
- Goodness. - Does it include "younger brother?"

754
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:41,653
I got it. Lousy?

755
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,593
A lousy house.

756
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,392
- Correct. - I got it.

757
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:47,692
(Answer: Lousy house)

758
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:48,793
He's the youngest after all.

759
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,332
- The youngest is different. - He's good at guessing.

760
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,562
- Goodness. - The youngest is different.

761
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:55,033
(He fails 2 times in a row.)

762
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:56,572
- Thank you for the food. - That's great.

763
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:57,573
Which one do you want to taste?

764
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,503
I'd like to take some of this.

765
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,173
Try a huge bite.

766
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,713
- "A lousy house?" - This is very delicious.

767
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,412
It's so good that you'll be surprised.

768
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:08,612
(One shot)

769
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:10,453
(One kill)

770
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,453
(I won't look.)

771
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:14,523
It's really good.

772
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:17,493
I missed this one too.

773
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,363
Is there one more question left?

774
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:21,462
There are two left.

775
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,762
- There are two left? - All right. Give them to us.

776
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:23,832
Keep going.

777
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,132
We just gave you a question.

778
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,863
Let me take another bite before we start again.

779
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,003
- Hurry up and eat. - I just served myself.

780
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,703
- Let me take a bite. - Goodness.

781
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:34,443
(One bite)

782
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:37,143
He needs to get beaten up at a UFC fight.

783
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:40,683
(Zero damage)

784
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,812
Here's another one.

785
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:43,913
- Okay. - Yes.

786
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:45,783
- Let's beat Sang Uk this time. - I know.

787
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,122
It's easy.

788
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:48,523
Which country has many miners?

789
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,793
- A country with many miners? - It's a country name.

790
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,262
Is it the name of a real country?

791
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,623
- Is it a real country? - Yes.

792
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,362
(Let me think.)

793
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:57,863
Kenya.

794
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,633
That's correct.

795
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,062
- Kenya? - Kenya.

796
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,133
(Tae Hyun's 3 consecutive failures)

797
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,533
I'm sorry, Tae Hyun.

798
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,172
- What would you like to eat? - It's Kenya.

799
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:07,603
What do you recommend?

800
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:08,812
- This one. - This?

801
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:10,072
- Yes. - Put this on top.

802
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,073
That's it.

803
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:12,243
- It's to die for. - It's the best.

804
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,582
Should I put some kimchi on top?

805
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,912
- Kimchi? No. - No.

806
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,153
Like this?

807
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:21,953
(His eyes widen.)

808
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:23,493
- It's really good. - It's excellent.

809
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:24,922
Isn't it tasty?

810
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:25,962
(Pouting)

811
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:27,222
(Strangely, nothing is working out for Tae Hyun today.)

812
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,493
The food is seasoned better than I expected.

813
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:30,763
- It's really good. - Yes.

814
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,663
- This is the best one for me. - Right?

815
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,502
(Dong Hyun prepares another spoonful...)

816
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:38,802
(after looking at Tae Hyun's face.)

817
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:41,073
I made a mountain of small octopus.

818
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:43,573
Do you want to play rock-paper-scissors?

819
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:45,412
Rock-paper-scissors?

820
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,983
Rock-paper-scissors.

821
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:48,482
(Yi Kyung is eliminated.)

822
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,082
Rock-paper-scissors.

823
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,083
(Tae Hyun is eliminated.)
(I lost it again.)

824
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,123
Darn it.

825
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:55,153
(Dong Hyun who was watching it)

826
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:57,823
Rock-paper-scissors.

827
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,163
He ate it.

828
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:01,792
(This is so unfair.)

829
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,632
- He ate it. - Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun ate it.

830
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,632
- What? - I saw it in the middle of playing.

831
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,502
He ate it. He made us play rock-paper-scissors for nothing.

832
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:08,933
That fool...

833
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:12,403
- He made us play for nothing. - By the way...

834
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,272
He didn't say, "The one who wins rock-paper-scissors."

835
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:15,472
I just said, "Rock-paper-scissors."

836
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:16,742
- Rock-paper-scissors. - He only said rock-paper-scissors.

837
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,143
That brat...

838
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:20,643
Today's meal was the best.

839
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:23,013
- We ate everything. - I can't think straight.

840
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:26,353
- We had a hearty meal. - A famous restaurant is different.

841
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:29,222
Let's see how much the total is.

842
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:30,223
It's very tender.

843
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,892
I bet it's around 300 dollars.

844
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,222
It'd be 300 dollars for this much food.

845
00:28:33,223 --> 00:28:34,263
Three hundred...

846
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,193
The total is 336 dollars.

847
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:38,062
It's exactly the price we expected.

848
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,133
Take out your card.

849
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,102
- Right. - Tae Hyun.

850
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,133
Your card.

851
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,002
Shouldn't Tae Hyun take out his card for him?

852
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,873
- That's right. - Take out your card, Tae Hyun.

853
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,142
(Oh, right. Various expenses...)

854
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:51,172
It's part of various expenses.

855
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:52,812
It's because he's the CEO of Ju Hwan's agency.

856
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,612
It was the same for Rhymer.

857
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:55,982
- My goodness. - Right.

858
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,353
Even if I pay...

859
00:28:57,513 --> 00:28:59,152
- I'll pay. - Here's the question.

860
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,682
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

861
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:02,993
According to a study conducted by a university in the UK,

862
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:06,492
cows that were gently patted by their owners produced...

863
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:10,162
significantly more milk than those that weren't.

864
00:29:10,163 --> 00:29:11,333
They were patted on their backs.

865
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,303
Here's one more thing.

866
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,462
When this was done,

867
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,133
the cows produced even more milk.

868
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,143
What was this?

869
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:23,212
- This was done to the cows? - Yes.

870
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:24,342
(When this was done, the cows produced even more milk.)

871
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:25,473
(What was this?)

872
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,983
- I got it. - It's a team game for now.

873
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,752
- It's a team game. - I see.

874
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,983
- What do you think it is? - It could be having a conversation.

875
00:29:34,683 --> 00:29:35,893
After patting them on their backs,

876
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:37,522
- Giving compliments? - they asked, "Did you sleep well?"

877
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:38,993
They had a conversation with them.

878
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,192
- Having a conversation? - It can't be a conversation.

879
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,993
Conversation means an exchange of words.

880
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:44,532
- Could it be giving compliments? - I think it's giving compliments.

881
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,702
- Giving compliments. - Giving compliments?

882
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,602
Compliments like this?

883
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,833
For them to produce a lot of milk,

884
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,933
- you tell them, "You can do it." - Like a cheerleader.

885
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,242
"You'll produce a lot."

886
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:54,303
Cheerleading for the cows?

887
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,672
- "Let's work harder." - Fight.

888
00:29:56,673 --> 00:29:58,043
(A compliment to milk cows?)

889
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,642
We'll keep it as our number one.

890
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,513
Let's think of other ideas.

891
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,913
It's either praising or having a conversation.

892
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,583
- Right? - Or you squeeze it out.

893
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:08,083
Praising?

894
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:10,152
Praising, having a conversation,

895
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:11,792
or talking with them.

896
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,823
- Yes, you talk to them. - It's 3pm already.

897
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:16,262
- It's 3pm. - Let's follow our intuition.

898
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:18,462
Who eats their first meal at 3pm?

899
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,232
- Tae Hyun hasn't eaten anything. - Who eats their first meal at 3pm?

900
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,302
That's why he's sensitive.

901
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,003
- Both of us had some food. - That's right.

902
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,172
- What are we doing? - We're fine.

903
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:26,473
- By the way... - I ate a lot.

904
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,472
(By the way...)

905
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,312
Dong Hyun always gets the wrong answer.

906
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:32,343
That's true.

907
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:35,213
- We should go with Ju Hwan's idea. - Right.

908
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:36,983
- Having a conversation? - Having a conversation.

909
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,583
Having a conversation?

910
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:40,652
I'm okay with anything. I'll follow your decision.

911
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,553
- What's your answer? - Having a conversation with them.

912
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,123
- Having a conversation with them? - Yes.

913
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:46,562
Having a daily conversation.

914
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:47,792
That's incorrect.

915
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,632
- Okay. - All right.

916
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:50,932
(Team Samgyetang is exempt from paying.)

917
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,063
(However...)

918
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,603
You have a one-third chance of paying.

919
00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:55,562
- Now it's up to the individuals. - Yes.

920
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,402
- We'll start right away. - It's about speed.

921
00:30:57,403 --> 00:30:58,472
- Hurry up. - I got it.

922
00:30:58,473 --> 00:30:59,942
- What about a massage? - A massage.

923
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,072
Giving a massage?

924
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:02,273
- Incorrect. - Or empathizing.

925
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,343
- I got it. Giving them a kiss. - Giving them a kiss? Incorrect.

926
00:31:04,443 --> 00:31:06,012
- Showing them TV. - Incorrect.

927
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:07,483
- Giving them a bath. - Incorrect.

928
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:09,753
- This is difficult. - Here's a hint.

929
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:12,682
There's a poet named Kim Chunsu.

930
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:13,683
- "Flower" by Kim Chunsu? - "Flower."

931
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:15,853
It's a famous poem by Kim Chunsu.

932
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,053
I got it.

933
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,363
Giving them a flower?

934
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,123
- Incorrect. - I got it.

935
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,163
Hanging a flower necklace on them.

936
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,132
- Incorrect. - Like in Hawaii?

937
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,143
- In a flower bed... - I know that poem called "Flower."

938
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:36,273
I know the poem roughly.

939
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:37,842
- What? - In the poem,

940
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:39,612
when he called the person's name,

941
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,082
she came to him and became a flower.

942
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,583
- I got it. - That's what the poem was about.

943
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:45,453
Calling them by their name.

944
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:48,053
Calling them by their name.

945
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,393
- That's correct. - Calling them by their name.

946
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:54,023
- Nice. - That's right.

947
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:55,462
"When I called his name,"

948
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:57,062
"he turned into this."

949
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,362
It was something like that.

950
00:31:58,363 --> 00:31:59,962
- It became my flower. - It became a flower.

951
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:01,402
- It became a flower. - When you call her name.

952
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:02,703
They must recognize their name.

953
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,673
I got it right because I wanted to.

954
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:07,502
I'm sorry. I don't have much money.

955
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:09,213
I paid a lot last week.

956
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:11,212
- You feel overwhelmed? - I feel overwhelmed.

957
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:12,742
- Who will... - Our two guests.

958
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,782
- Okay. - Here's the second question.

959
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:17,053
- It's between the guests. - That's cold.

960
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:18,683
Since cows played...

961
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,782
an important role in households,

962
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:24,093
they were treated with the same respect as humans.

963
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,623
That's why people did "this..."

964
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:29,993
when calves were born.

965
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:31,363
What is it?

966
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,832
When calves were born?

967
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:33,903
That's right.

968
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,033
I got it.

969
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,033
(Really?)

970
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:38,333
I got it.

971
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:41,202
What is that thing people used to hang outside the doors?

972
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,342
The thing with chilies or peaches?

973
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,613
They hung that.

974
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:46,282
When they had calves? Like they did with children?

975
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:47,742
- Like when children were born? - Cows were valuable at the time,

976
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:48,813
so they hung those when they were born.

977
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,552
- People hung geumjul? - Yes, geumjul.

978
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,652
- He's right. - Correct.

979
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,852
(They hung geumjul.)

980
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:55,923
He got it on his first attempt.

981
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,493
- Tae Hyun's loving it. - Tae Hyun?

982
00:32:58,693 --> 00:32:59,693
Tae Hyun dodged the bullet!

983
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:02,963
(Ju Hwan and Tae Hyun both dodged the bullet.)

984
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:04,492
(Groaning)

985
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,663
They did it.

986
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,402
I had a lot to eat.

987
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,933
(He honestly admits he had a lot to eat.)

988
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:11,033
I ate a lot.

989
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,502
The one paying for the meal is...

990
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:15,103
That'll be 436 dollars.

991
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,943
Thank you for the meal.

992
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:20,742
- We really enjoyed the meal. - Really?

993
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:21,842
We did.

994
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:23,712
- Everything was delicious. - Thank you.

995
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:24,913
Even the small octopus.

996
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,353
- I'm glad you enjoyed it. - It was the best.

997
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,593
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

998
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,462
- It's an injeolmi snack. - An injeolmi snack.

999
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:35,563
The restaurant owner gave us this on our way out.

1000
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,833
Let's go.

1001
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:38,193
We can have this for dessert.

1002
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,862
- It's so hot. - You know how it is...

1003
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:42,903
to be out in the hot weather after having makgeolli.

1004
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,673
- The alcohol will make you dizzy. - You won't be seeing straight.

1005
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,742
Normally, I eat until I'm quite full,

1006
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,642
but I've never had this much before.

1007
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:51,872
- It's a first. - Same here.

1008
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:53,742
I've never had that much...

1009
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,183
- or paid so much for lunch before. - That's not easy to do.

1010
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:56,682
It must be nearby.

1011
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,682
- It must be on the basement level. - It must be on the basement level.

1012
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,722
The underground shopping center.

1013
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,683
J Herbal Samgyetang.

1014
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,823
- Herbal. - It's a herbal samgyetang.

1015
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,622
- I love herbs. - Herbs.

1016
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:07,762
Herbs.

1017
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,533
(They enter the underground shopping center excited.)

1018
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:11,133
- It's Chobok. - Chobok.

1019
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,532
It says here that yesterday was Chobok.

1020
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,733
(They're greeted by a sign that says yesterday was Chobok.)

1021
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,172
(On Bok days)

1022
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,143
(Bustling with people)

1023
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:25,512
(A place you're reminded of in the summer)

1024
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:28,082
I'm reminded of this place during the Bok days.

1025
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,353
I definitely feel more energized the next day.

1026
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,453
The chicken is tender and the dish is delicious.

1027
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:36,553
The soup tastes so special and beautiful.

1028
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:38,952
(Delighting the taste buds of everyone, )

1029
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,723
(no matter their nationality)

1030
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:45,903
(A time-honored invigorating dish loved by many)

1031
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:50,133
(Lunch Menu Recommendation 2, Samgyetang)

1032
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,702
- Hold on. - I can smell the oriental herbs.

1033
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:54,142
- I smell the oriental herbs too. - Nice.

1034
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,173
(I can smell it.)

1035
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:58,372
Each of us should probably order...

1036
00:34:58,373 --> 00:35:00,943
- Right. - a dish we'd like to have.

1037
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,583
What's samgyetang with perilla seeds?

1038
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:04,313
- The broth... - It has perilla seeds.

1039
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:05,812
The broth is thick thanks to the perilla seeds.

1040
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,483
The broth is thick and delicious.

1041
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,023
I haven't tried it before.

1042
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:10,753
That dish...

1043
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:13,323
(His mouth waters all of a sudden.)

1044
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:14,922
- She must be the owner. - Let me take your order.

1045
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:15,962
Hello, ma'am.

1046
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:17,592
- Hello. - Hi, ma'am.

1047
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:19,033
I bet you were extremely busy yesterday.

1048
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:20,663
It was insane.

1049
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,202
(It was Chobok the day before.)

1050
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,332
It was one of the Bok days yesterday.

1051
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,143
How many chickens did you cook yesterday?

1052
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:27,402
Yesterday?

1053
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:28,642
Over 500.

1054
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:31,112
(Yesterday... Over 500?)

1055
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,713
- What? - Over 500 chickens?

1056
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:34,682
Do you prepare more chickens...

1057
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,612
- for Bok days? - We do.

1058
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:37,652
Although we had opening hours,

1059
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:38,952
we sold out...

1060
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:39,982
before they were over.

1061
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:41,182
I felt terrible that many people left...

1062
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,423
without being able to eat.

1063
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,422
I feel like you'd do well on a home shopping channel.

1064
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,123
- Really? - You have a sweet voice.

1065
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,462
She's speaking Korean...

1066
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:49,493
as though she were speaking French.

1067
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:52,932
It feels like watching an anime.

1068
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:53,963
(She's like a French animation character.)

1069
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,563
You're not an actress, right?

1070
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,402
Goodness.

1071
00:35:57,403 --> 00:35:58,873
(The owner is sweet, and her voice matches her personality.)

1072
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:02,042
There must be a dish that the restaurant is known for.

1073
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,112
- Which is most popular? - Didn't you say...

1074
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:05,543
- you could smell oriental herbs? - We did.

1075
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:07,212
Herbal samgyetang is a favorite,

1076
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:08,782
and samgyetang with perilla seeds has its own fan base.

1077
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,752
Live abalones just came in today.

1078
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,853
- Live abalones. - Right.

1079
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:13,722
- Here's what I think. - Sure.

1080
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:15,182
The herbal samgyetang...

1081
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,652
- is its signature dish. - Right.

1082
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,653
Let's not order abalones, but order...

1083
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,122
an addition bowl of herbal samgyetang.

1084
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:22,192
The owner sweetly mentioned that live abalones...

1085
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,663
just came in today.

1086
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,663
Got it. I hear you.

1087
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,463
That's a go.

1088
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:28,862
We'll take the three dishes at the top of the menu.

1089
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:30,672
- Abalone... - Abalone, herbal, perilla seeds.

1090
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:32,632
What about the stir-fried gizzard and vegetables?

1091
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,503
Is that mainly for those who come here for dinner?

1092
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:35,873
That's right.

1093
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:37,772
There's spicy boneless chicken feet...

1094
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:38,842
and stir-fried...

1095
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,012
- gizzard and vegetables. - Vegetables.

1096
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,843
Can you make the chicken feet less spicier?

1097
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,253
Absolutely.

1098
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,283
- Then, we'll request that. - Sure.

1099
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,953
(We'll serve you delicious food.)

1100
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:51,292
(They open the snack the second they're done ordering.)

1101
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,493
I'll enjoy this.

1102
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,323
(Dong Hyun has caught Tae Hyun's eye.)

1103
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:55,863
What are you two doing?

1104
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,963
Have some.

1105
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,992
Wait, why?

1106
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:59,763
- You can't have this. - Why not? It's ours.

1107
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:01,063
I just don't want you to have it.

1108
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:02,973
Tae Hyun's upset.

1109
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:04,732
Why are you taking it out on us...

1110
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:05,832
when you're the one who lost the game?

1111
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:06,972
I won't let you have this.

1112
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:08,703
(He's upset he wasn't able to freeload today.)

1113
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,372
I won't let you have this.

1114
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:12,473
- The staff should have some. - All right. They can have it.

1115
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:13,843
Here are your side dishes.

1116
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,382
She's serving us liquor.

1117
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:17,012
- It's a given. - No way.

1118
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:19,052
- Is this ginseng wine? - That's right.

1119
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,422
Is this complimentary?

1120
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:21,682
- Of course. - Really?

1121
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,023
There's more where that came from.

1122
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:24,993
Don't we need to pay for this?

1123
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:26,222
If you want more,

1124
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,263
please just ask.

1125
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:29,532
Thank you so much.

1126
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,062
(Thank you so much.)

1127
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,362
Here are the gizzards.

1128
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,132
- Do they get served first? - Yes, here are the gizzards.

1129
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,802
- The chicken feet will follow. - Nice.

1130
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:37,632
You wanted it mildly spicy.

1131
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:38,733
Thank you.

1132
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,073
This looks good.

1133
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:41,743
Boneless chicken feet sound easy to eat.

1134
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,312
Please enjoy.

1135
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:44,313
- Sure. - Thanks.

1136
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,542
Tae Hyun, you should have some.

1137
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:47,642
That I should.

1138
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:48,812
You should try some.

1139
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:49,952
Why don't we say cheers?

1140
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:51,082
Here.

1141
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,852
I love you all.

1142
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,282
Good luck to you all.

1143
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,052
- What's that I'm smelling? - Ginseng.

1144
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:58,153
Judging from its smell, the ginseng is from Geumsan.

1145
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:00,923
It's like a clear wine.

1146
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,593
This isn't the ginseng wine I expected.

1147
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:04,492
It's not bitter or too strong.

1148
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:05,562
The wine is mild and clean.

1149
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:06,962
(The flavors are clean, unlike typical handmade liquor.)

1150
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:08,832
I can't really taste the alcohol.

1151
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,373
The aftertaste hits you hard though.

1152
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:12,173
The flavors are clean.

1153
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:14,172
Should we try the spicy dish or the non-spicy dish?

1154
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:15,843
- Let's have the gizzards first. - The gizzards?

1155
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,243
I haven't seen a samgyetang place that offers gizzards.

1156
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:19,813
- Exactly. - It's fascinating.

1157
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:24,013
It's nice and chewy.

1158
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:26,583
(Yi Kyung tries a gizzard too.)

1159
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,652
I know what this tastes like.

1160
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,423
It's like stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

1161
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,763
But it's not too greasy.

1162
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,463
This is tasty.

1163
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:38,432
This goes great with alcohol.

1164
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,803
The gizzards are extremely fresh.

1165
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:41,802
- It smells nice. - I'd love a bite.

1166
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,703
This is making me hungry again.

1167
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,503
Try one of the chicken feet.

1168
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,302
We weren't expecting this.

1169
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:50,642
This wasn't something we were expecting to have.

1170
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:52,913
Who knew we'd have chicken feet today?

1171
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:55,043
I asked for it to be less spicy.

1172
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:56,713
I can't handle spice that well.

1173
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:02,553
I prefer this.

1174
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:06,363
They use extremely fresh ingredients.

1175
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,562
Check this out. Look how bouncy it is.

1176
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:09,892
They cooked 500 chickens yesterday,

1177
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:11,233
so these must have come in today.

1178
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:14,933
(Trying a piece of fresh chicken feet)

1179
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:17,272
You just can't stop eating this.

1180
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:18,933
It's covered in what's like a tteokbokki sauce.

1181
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,643
This is absolutely delicious.

1182
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,742
I'm intrigued by the dish...

1183
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:23,913
despite being full.

1184
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,112
Seeing them enjoy a whole bunch of food...

1185
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,682
makes me feel like...

1186
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:29,143
I've lost a battle.

1187
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,383
It's natural to be intrigued.

1188
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,882
Here's the abalone samgyetang.

1189
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:33,582
Who's having the abalone samgyetang?

1190
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,423
- That'll be me. - The abalone samgyetang.

1191
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:37,192
- The abalone samgyetang. - That looks good.

1192
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:38,752
- Careful, it's hot. - That abalone is huge.

1193
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,963
(The abalone samgyetang with a large fresh abalone)

1194
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,993
Here's your herbal samgyetang.

1195
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,032
- Is this herbal samgyetang? - Yes.

1196
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,033
Who's having samgyetang with perilla seeds?

1197
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,402
- That'll be me. - That looks so good.

1198
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:49,463
Please enjoy.

1199
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:50,803
Stir before you eat.
Check out the perilla seeds.

1200
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:52,972
That looks delicious.

1201
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,042
The oriental herbs smell incredible.

1202
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,703
(Topped with lots of perilla seeds)

1203
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:59,743
(Samgyetang with perilla seeds)

1204
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:03,983
(The 3 samgyetang dishes are served.)

1205
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:07,983
I can smell the oriental herbs.

1206
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,993
The smell is strong.

1207
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,992
(Trying the broth of the herbal samgyetang first)

1208
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,123
The oriental herbs smell amazing.

1209
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,003
- That's so good. - Don't.

1210
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,173
The smell of oriental herbs is strong.

1211
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:30,042
(Touched by the deep flavors)

1212
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:31,942
- The herbs. - Let me tell you why this is good.

1213
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:33,742
If cooked wrong, it can taste like medicine.

1214
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:35,342
- That's not the case. - It's perfect.

1215
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:36,353
It's so good.

1216
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,612
It stuck to the basics.

1217
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:41,223
(Clean and healthy flavors cooked with oriental herbs)

1218
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,823
I'd love to just drink the broth...

1219
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:46,562
of the herbal samgyetang.

1220
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:48,293
(I'd love to have it as a soup.)

1221
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:49,763
That's good.

1222
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,932
(Now, they try the chicken.)

1223
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:54,003
You know,

1224
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:56,503
the chicken was prepared...

1225
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,632
so that it could be easily deboned.

1226
00:40:57,633 --> 00:41:00,343
(The meat slides off the bone.)

1227
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:07,943
(Yummy)

1228
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,552
Have it all before it's gone.

1229
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,312
(Tae Hyun has a drumstick.)

1230
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:13,383
That looks good.

1231
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,222
- There's no need to debone this. - The meat slides off.

1232
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:20,522
You know it was cooked well,

1233
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,292
- as the meat easily falls apart. - Exactly.

1234
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,993
- No way. - The meat slides off the bone.

1235
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,132
That dish is good for your health.

1236
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:29,033
(The tables have turned.)

1237
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,632
Now, this.

1238
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,402
- Yes? - Are these perilla seeds?

1239
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:33,573
(Next, he tries the samgyetang with perilla seeds.)

1240
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:37,942
(Cooling it down)

1241
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:40,483
(He tries the broth first.)

1242
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:42,483
- How is it? - How's that one?

1243
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:44,283
Isn't it good?

1244
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:46,623
It's like perilla seed sujebi,

1245
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:48,552
but just with a whole chicken.

1246
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:50,293
(A samgyetang that is like perilla seed sujebi)

1247
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:51,693
You should try this.

1248
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:53,322
The broth is nutty and savory.

1249
00:41:53,323 --> 00:41:54,323
(Sang Uk and Yi Kyung try the samgyetang with perilla seeds.)

1250
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,433
- This... - Let's see.

1251
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,663
I'd love to just drink the broth...

1252
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,933
- That broth. - of the herbal samgyetang.

1253
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,003
No way.

1254
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:07,343
(Blowing)

1255
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:10,643
- This... - That's hot.

1256
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,913
(Full of rich, nutty flavor)

1257
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:16,182
- As for the perilla seeds, - The perilla seeds taste good.

1258
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:17,583
The broth shouldn't be thicker than this.

1259
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:19,883
And it shouldn't be thinner. This is just right.

1260
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:22,523
For some reason, it feels very hearty.

1261
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:26,592
The broth will become thicker as it cools down.

1262
00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:29,093
When you put rice in that,

1263
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:31,663
it becomes like a perilla porridge.

1264
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,733
He knows everything about eating.

1265
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:40,273
For that one, how are you going to share with us?

1266
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:42,203
Let us have a bite of each.

1267
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:44,773
We just want to try it.

1268
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:48,412
Please get us bowls, spoons, and chopsticks.

1269
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:49,882
- Okay. - Three sets, please.

1270
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:50,883
(Casually asking for spoons)

1271
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:53,452
- That... herbal broth. - I'm curious about the broth.

1272
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:55,152
- That herbal one. - Do you want it?

1273
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:57,023
Yes. Let us try each of them.

1274
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:59,353
- We're not going to share them. - Why not?

1275
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,622
- We shared almost all of ours. - We won't share these.

1276
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,663
- You can't do that. - I don't want to.

1277
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,902
- Tae Hyun, give me the broth. - The perilla seeds one.

1278
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:07,962
There are rules here, Tae Hyun.

1279
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:10,002
- Give us the perilla seeds one. - Tae Hyun.

1280
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:11,732
- Just the broth. - No.

1281
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:12,933
But why not?

1282
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:14,143
Why aren't you sharing?

1283
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,943
- Give me a reason. - For us to steal it.

1284
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,143
That's what I feel like doing today.

1285
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:21,412
- Hey. You got the riddle wrong. - That's exactly right.

1286
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:22,482
I hated that.

1287
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:24,782
Come on. It was you who got it wrong.

1288
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:26,723
Should we let the fourth place eat after a rock-paper-scissors?

1289
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,882
- We'll give it to the 4th place. - The 4th place. I'd like that.

1290
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:31,653
There is no 4th place since there are 3 of us.

1291
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,162
The fourth place.

1292
00:43:33,163 --> 00:43:34,663
(He's smart.)

1293
00:43:34,963 --> 00:43:36,593
(Amid the chaos...)

1294
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:37,933
(Reaching)

1295
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,433
That was smooth.

1296
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,703
(Smoothly adding the ladle too)

1297
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:44,233
Can you ladle us a bowl?

1298
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:46,673
One scoop of each broth.

1299
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,672
No way.

1300
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:49,943
This is truly medicine.

1301
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:52,412
(He can't believe it.)

1302
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,242
- You should play a game. - Let's play it.

1303
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:55,342
- A game for the herbal one. - We'll do it together.

1304
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,712
- Can you ask for more broth? - The broth and... Okay.

1305
00:43:56,713 --> 00:43:57,783
Ask for more broth?

1306
00:43:57,953 --> 00:43:59,053
- Gosh. - You can ask for more broth.

1307
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:00,982
He added the glutinous rice too.

1308
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,623
I put some rice in it.

1309
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:03,852
Nice. That's a lot.

1310
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,193
(The broth is ready.)

1311
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:07,263
I love it.

1312
00:44:07,793 --> 00:44:08,863
Do the rock-paper-scissors.

1313
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,862
Which place should we give the broth to?

1314
00:44:10,863 --> 00:44:12,793
- The 2nd place. - The 2nd place in the game.

1315
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,003
The second place in the rock-paper-scissors?

1316
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:15,863
What are you going to throw?

1317
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,833
- Scissors. - Scissors?

1318
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:19,002
- A rock. - This is...

1319
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:21,473
Scissors and a rock. Then I should pick scissors.

1320
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:22,943
- Then you'll be the first place. - Okay.

1321
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:24,243
Rock-paper-scissors.

1322
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,082
- You're in last place. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1323
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,113
(Dong Hyun fails to freeload.)

1324
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:29,443
Rock-paper-scissors.

1325
00:44:30,553 --> 00:44:31,913
It's me.

1326
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,852
- You won. - So, I'm in second place.

1327
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:34,952
He's in 1st place, and I'm in 2nd place.

1328
00:44:34,953 --> 00:44:36,593
- Were you in the first place? - I'm in the last place.

1329
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,093
- Were you in the first place? - I'm in the last place.

1330
00:44:38,323 --> 00:44:40,022
He's the last. And you're the 1st, and I'm the 2nd.

1331
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:41,622
- I'm right. - The second place gets to eat.

1332
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,733
(He drinks the broth amid the chaos.)

1333
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:44,862
We threw scissors. Right. You threw a paper.

1334
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:45,892
He's in last place.

1335
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:46,932
- You're 1st. I'm 2nd. - You're right.

1336
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:47,933
(Ju Hwan is indeed in 1st place.)

1337
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,503
(Disappointed)

1338
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:50,802
I already had it, though.

1339
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:51,972
(I just went for it.)

1340
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:53,103
While the two were arguing. Gosh.

1341
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,602
- How is it? Is it rich? - Is it rich?

1342
00:44:55,603 --> 00:44:56,673
I mean, it's a little...

1343
00:44:57,373 --> 00:45:00,713
It's as if I visited a renowned Korean medicine clinic.

1344
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:04,613
- The doctor checked my pulse. - Yes.

1345
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,622
- He said I was physically weak. - I see.

1346
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,353
- He sent herbal medicine. - Yes.

1347
00:45:08,483 --> 00:45:10,093
It's like drinking it with honey.

1348
00:45:10,353 --> 00:45:11,422
- Honey? - Gosh.

1349
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:12,952
It tastes healthy yet sweet.

1350
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:15,262
Gosh. It's the perfect time to drink it.

1351
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:16,592
It's tonic.

1352
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:17,693
(Gulping it as if he was drinking tonic)

1353
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,363
Do you want to play the final game for this one?

1354
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,532
- Yes, please. - This one too?

1355
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,332
You drank it up.

1356
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,432
A ladleful of it?

1357
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,433
I'll ladle it for you.

1358
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:29,303
Do you want to play it for a shallow amount of new broth?

1359
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:31,142
- Is it possible? - It's possible.

1360
00:45:31,143 --> 00:45:32,572
- That's possible. - Give a really tough one.

1361
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:34,042
- In that case... - What?

1362
00:45:34,043 --> 00:45:35,413
Is it a quiz? Gosh.

1363
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:37,983
- That's a lot. - That's almost a full bowl.

1364
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:39,982
(They're captivated.)

1365
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:42,022
- Should I add some salt? - Do you want the quiz?

1366
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:43,822
- Is it a riddle? - I'm so bad at it.

1367
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:45,323
I like it.

1368
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:46,662
Okay.

1369
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,723
It gets works done...

1370
00:45:49,023 --> 00:45:50,633
for being hot-tempered.

1371
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,263
What is this?

1372
00:45:54,203 --> 00:45:57,002
A fighter.

1373
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:59,173
- A fighter? - This is a riddle.

1374
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:00,973
That was realistic.

1375
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:02,942
Was it? Was it a riddle?

1376
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:04,112
A real fighter.

1377
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:05,443
A fighter gets work done for being hot-tempered.

1378
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,712
- This is a good one. - I wouldn't have guessed it.

1379
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:08,882
This is a nice quiz.

1380
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:10,253
I feel so frustrated.

1381
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:12,283
For being...

1382
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:14,923
hot-tempered.

1383
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:17,793
Hot-tempered thing?

1384
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:19,963
Right. Hot temperature.

1385
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:21,463
A steam iron.

1386
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:23,693
- I got it. A steam iron. - You got it?

1387
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:25,733
- You got it? - I got it. A steam iron.

1388
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:26,902
(He smoothly stole the answer.)

1389
00:46:26,903 --> 00:46:27,963
It's correct.

1390
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:29,562
That was nice and clean.

1391
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:30,603
(I said it first.)

1392
00:46:30,673 --> 00:46:32,833
Dong Hyun was so close.

1393
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:34,273
Thanks for the tip.

1394
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:35,873
Gosh. The broth with perilla seeds must be so good.

1395
00:46:37,273 --> 00:46:39,943
(He enjoys the broth two times in a row.)

1396
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,013
I can't say anything.

1397
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:43,852
(Jealous)

1398
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:44,983
- They make good broth. - Yes.

1399
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:46,652
It's completely different...

1400
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:47,852
- from the other one? - Is it?

1401
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:49,022
It's really flavorful.

1402
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:50,323
When I drank it,

1403
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:52,692
- I felt healthier and... - Okay. Stop it.

1404
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:53,962
- It's so good. - It's a quiz time.

1405
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:55,022
- I'll try to guess it right again. - Hold on.

1406
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,463
Why am I getting hungry?

1407
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,063
The herbal broth is here.

1408
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,603
- What? - Gosh. Okay.

1409
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:03,473
- Thank you. - It's a separate one.

1410
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,872
- The quiz is over. - Let's finish it.

1411
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,202
- We don't have a quiz. - The quiz is over.

1412
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:08,672
- What? - We don't have any quiz.

1413
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:09,873
Please give us one chance.

1414
00:47:10,673 --> 00:47:11,713
Just once.

1415
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:13,313
Gosh. Come on.

1416
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:14,813
Just this once.

1417
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,753
- Just once. - There was one left.

1418
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:18,783
Why did the dog become a teacher?

1419
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:20,852
- "Why did a dog become a teacher?" - Yes.

1420
00:47:20,853 --> 00:47:22,752
Gosh. I can't connect things.

1421
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:24,623
Why is a dog a teacher?

1422
00:47:25,353 --> 00:47:26,452
Exactly.

1423
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,023
Does it include English? Dog...

1424
00:47:28,863 --> 00:47:30,033
Because it was paw-sible?

1425
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:32,693
Paw... Dong Hyun. Because it was paw-sible.

1426
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:33,963
Incorrect.

1427
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,263
I got it. Because it was good at paw-sitive reinforcement.

1428
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,632
- Correct. - Nice. "Paw-sitive reinforcement."

1429
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:41,272
(Finally, Dong Hyun has won the freeloading chance.)

1430
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:42,343
- Finally. - Gosh.

1431
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:46,172
I should have a lot of it by using the ladle.

1432
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:47,442
(Is he using the ladle instead of his spoon?)

1433
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,542
- I love it. - It's a medicine.

1434
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:49,683
It's truly a medicine.

1435
00:47:50,653 --> 00:47:51,782
It has all 12 ingredients.

1436
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:52,783
(He filled it up greedily.)

1437
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:54,122
(He brings it to his mouth.)

1438
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:55,283
I'm so full.

1439
00:47:57,193 --> 00:47:58,293
I'm so full.

1440
00:47:58,523 --> 00:48:00,493
(Protecting the viewers' eyes)

1441
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:02,293
What are you doing?

1442
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:05,532
- What did he do? - He spat it out because it was hot.

1443
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:07,163
- It's over. - How hot is it?

1444
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:08,932
- What? - What's the temperature of it?

1445
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,273
It's 2,000°C.

1446
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:13,132
- It's lava. - Tell me its temperature.

1447
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:14,473
(Happy)

1448
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:16,172
(Standing up)

1449
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,912
- Dong Hyun, it was steaming. - Sorry.

1450
00:48:18,913 --> 00:48:19,942
- Why? - You can't have it now.

1451
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:20,943
- You can't. - You had a spoonful.

1452
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,013
- What are you saying? - You had a spoonful.

1453
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,343
You tried it.

1454
00:48:23,453 --> 00:48:25,312
Wait. Don't I get to finish it?

1455
00:48:25,313 --> 00:48:26,382
- You spat it out. - It was for one spoonful.

1456
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:27,582
I didn't spit it out. Sorry.

1457
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,622
- I didn't try to spit it. - It's all right.

1458
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:29,823
I almost lost all my teeth.

1459
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:32,192
I'm serious. Tae Hyun.

1460
00:48:32,193 --> 00:48:34,362
- It's... - Sorry. Gosh. My bad.

1461
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:39,163
(So desperate Dong Hyun didn't get to eat.)

1462
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:40,732
- How much is it? - Gosh.

1463
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,032
- I can't believe it. - It's simple.

1464
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,602
- It's nice. - After stuffing ourselves,

1465
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:45,133
- It's clean. -we only have to pay 84 dollars.

1466
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:46,573
- Here's the quiz. - Okay.

1467
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,842
On the Bok days during the Joseon Dynasty,

1468
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,783
the king gave special food to the Sungkyunkwan's scholars.

1469
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,082
On Chobok, he gave a plate of meat.

1470
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,512
On Jungbok, he gave two of this fruit.

1471
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:02,653
On Malbok, he gave one of this fruit.

1472
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,992
What are these fruits?

1473
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:06,652
- Each of them? - You have to get them both.

1474
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,163
- It's so hard. - It's so difficult.

1475
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:09,793
Do we have to guess three fruits?

1476
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,232
Two kinds of fruits.

1477
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,902
I heard mangosteens were famous back then.

1478
00:49:13,903 --> 00:49:15,062
(Laughing)

1479
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:16,602
The mangosteens were famous during the Joseon Dynasty.

1480
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,503
- I got it. - No, don't guess it.

1481
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,442
(Why does he try to guess it?)

1482
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:25,173
- We didn't eat. - Say the answer.

1483
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:26,572
We'll be in big trouble.

1484
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:27,612
What do you think?

1485
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:29,013
Don't say it.

1486
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,852
- Two kinds on Jungbok. - We need to guess two fruits.

1487
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:34,852
There are 2, but for the 2nd one, they gave 2 of this fruit.

1488
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:36,422
- For the last one... - For the last one, they have one.

1489
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:37,452
- Am I right? - Yes.

1490
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:40,192
So, it must be a small one to give two.

1491
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:41,393
Aren't peaches in season right now?

1492
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,222
- Peaches sound about right. - Summer.

1493
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:44,832
What are in season in summer?

1494
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,802
Is it possible not to be watermelons?

1495
00:49:46,803 --> 00:49:49,663
It sounds right to give 1 watermelon and 2 peaches.

1496
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,403
Why did you raise your hand?

1497
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,242
- What made you so sure? - It came across my mind.

1498
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,243
- What was it? - What came across your mind?
A fruit.

1499
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,612
I'm curious because you're so confident about it.

1500
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:01,283
- No. - I shouldn't say it.

1501
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:03,013
It's because it'll be correct.

1502
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,253
- Tell me. - It must be nothing.

1503
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,553
I think it's nothing.

1504
00:50:06,883 --> 00:50:08,053
I don't think it's the correct answer.

1505
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:12,193
Do you think it's correct? Can he tell us?

1506
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:13,793
I think you can tell them.

1507
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:16,422
Tell us, then.

1508
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:17,662
What are the fruits?

1509
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:20,163
- Plums. - Why?

1510
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:23,133
Because by the door over there,

1511
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:25,333
- the plums are up. - It's the photo of the plums.

1512
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,472
That's true. They are plums.

1513
00:50:27,473 --> 00:50:29,102
This is a restaurant that sells stamina foods.

1514
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:31,072
It's weird to have the photo of plums up there.

1515
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:32,413
Why are the plums up there?

1516
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:34,682
Why are the plums...

1517
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:35,812
- from Gimcheon up here? - Why?

1518
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:38,312
- And I wanted to say a watermelon. - The plums are really here.

1519
00:50:38,313 --> 00:50:39,912
(Their suspicion grows suddenly.)

1520
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,182
Do you want to go with plums and a watermelon, Tae Hyun?

1521
00:50:41,183 --> 00:50:42,983
They are from Gimcheon.

1522
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:44,993
Why are the plums up here all of a sudden?

1523
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:47,293
It has to do with Bok days, doesn't it?

1524
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:49,962
- Should we go with the plums? - Should we?

1525
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,362
- Plums and a watermelon? - Two plums and a watermelon?

1526
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,163
- Plums and a watermelon. - Plums and a watermelon? Okay.

1527
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,502
- Let's go. - Plums and a watermelon.

1528
00:50:54,503 --> 00:50:56,363
- Okay. It's summer. - Since they're summer fruits.

1529
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,533
- I'll say the answer. - Okay.

1530
00:50:58,603 --> 00:50:59,603
Okay.

1531
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:02,073
A watermelon and plums.

1532
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:06,312
- It was peaches. - Let's have another round.

1533
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,583
(Was the photo of the plums really a hint?)

1534
00:51:08,213 --> 00:51:09,913
- I don't think... - Incorrect.

1535
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:11,653
It must be a peach.

1536
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:13,252
Did we get both wrong?

1537
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:15,122
You got the watermelon right.

1538
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:18,053
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1539
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:19,352
He won.

1540
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:20,362
(Tae Hyun gets to guess the answer.)

1541
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:22,123
Go ahead, Tae Hyun. Then we'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1542
00:51:22,523 --> 00:51:24,463
- Peaches. - Peaches.

1543
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:26,033
- Incorrect. - What?

1544
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:28,033
- What do I eat at home? - Grapes.

1545
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:29,363
Grapes?

1546
00:51:29,763 --> 00:51:31,173
- There are more than two. - Incorrect.

1547
00:51:31,903 --> 00:51:33,903
You can say whatever from now on.

1548
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:35,203
I got it. Dates.

1549
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:37,513
Incorrect.

1550
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:40,012
I got it. Korean melons.

1551
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,943
- Korean melon? Correct? - What? Korean melons.

1552
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:43,752
There are Korean melons.

1553
00:51:43,753 --> 00:51:46,112
We couldn't think of them before.

1554
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:47,453
We got it wrong because of that.

1555
00:51:47,683 --> 00:51:49,023
- Those Gimcheon plums. - That's right.

1556
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:51,222
- Nice. I love it. - We got it wrong because of that.

1557
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:52,922
Okay. Let's go.

1558
00:51:52,923 --> 00:51:54,193
- Do I take mine back? - Okay.

1559
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:55,362
- Thank you. - Yes.

1560
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:56,392
(Yi Kyung avoids paying.)

1561
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:58,162
- Are you ready for the final one? - Yes.

1562
00:51:58,163 --> 00:51:59,292
(Tae Hyun versus Sang Uk to choose the final payer)

1563
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:01,032
Samgyetang is a well-known stamina food...

1564
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:02,763
to overcome the heat.

1565
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:06,172
During the Joseon Dynasty, the king bestowed a special card...

1566
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:09,342
to the high-ranking officials to overcome the heat.

1567
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,472
- A card? - A card?

1568
00:52:10,473 --> 00:52:12,542
- A card? - They used this card...

1569
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:15,542
in exchange for this outside the palace.

1570
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:16,713
What was this?

1571
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:19,513
You hand the card and ask for it.

1572
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:23,253
Are we supposed to guess the card?

1573
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:24,852
- No. What did they get in exchange? - For what?

1574
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:25,952
- What did they get? - They used this card...

1575
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:27,092
in exchange for this.

1576
00:52:27,093 --> 00:52:28,693
- That's... - What is this?

1577
00:52:30,163 --> 00:52:31,863
- That's it. - What?

1578
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:34,032
Gosh. It has to be ice.

1579
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,562
- It was so precious. - It could be ice.

1580
00:52:35,563 --> 00:52:37,073
I got it. Ice.

1581
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,133
It just has to be ice.

1582
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:42,142
- Ice. - Correct.

1583
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:43,772
(Correct)

1584
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:44,843
Why didn't you say it, Tae Hyun?

1585
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:46,873
(Sang Uk steals the answer successfully.)

1586
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:48,313
Why didn't you say it, Tae Hyun?

1587
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:50,983
(Laughing)

1588
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,353
I thought it might not be the answer.

1589
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:56,752
- There was a very small chance. - Exactly.

1590
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:58,422
- I said it as it was too obvious. - That was what I thought.

1591
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:00,153
Yes. It was too obvious.

1592
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:01,793
Gosh. Ice.

1593
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:03,262
- Thank you, Tae Hyun. - Okay.

1594
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,092
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you.

1595
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:06,792
But it's okay.

1596
00:53:06,793 --> 00:53:08,463
It's better than Seung Hwan's case.

1597
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:09,762
- He paid 340 dollars. - With what I paid,

1598
00:53:09,763 --> 00:53:10,802
we can come here for Chobok, Jungbok, Malbok...

1599
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:12,573
and even next year's Chobok.

1600
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,572
- With that money. - We can come next year...

1601
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:16,802
with what I paid before.

1602
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:18,412
- Did you enjoy the food? - Yes.

1603
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:20,442
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you.

1604
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:21,483
Thank you.

1605
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:26,313
It was really nourishing for the summer.

1606
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,352
(It's a lazy afternoon...)

1607
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:30,893
(after stuffing themselves with a heavy lunch.)

1608
00:53:35,323 --> 00:53:39,063
(It's about time they wanted cold coffee.)

1609
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:42,732
We've come to a cafe,

1610
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,172
- so we should get coffee. - Yes.

1611
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:45,632
Should we place the order first?

1612
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,443
(The members have come to a cafe to have a coffee time.)

1613
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:49,373
Are you drinking wine?

1614
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:51,172
- No. - Why do they have wine?

1615
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:52,842
They have ice cream too.

1616
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:53,843
Do they have ice cream?

1617
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:56,112
Why do they put salt and pepper on an ice cream?

1618
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:57,113
They put olive oil too.

1619
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:58,713
- It's tasty with salt and pepper. - Yes.

1620
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:00,452
- It's good. - When you add olive oil,

1621
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:01,582
- it tastes nice. - What?

1622
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,583
(Tae Hyun is confused.)

1623
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:03,652
- Really? - Ma'am.

1624
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:05,223
The first one looks good.

1625
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:06,922
Will you come to the spot to educate us?

1626
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,722
(They ask the owner to teach them about the menu.)

1627
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:10,322
- It's because of the camera angle. - "To educate us."

1628
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:12,932
- "Educate." - What is it really, ma'am?

1629
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,363
You can come here.

1630
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:16,103
Is this popular?

1631
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:18,073
-Yes. These days, - The one with salt and pepper.

1632
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,042
- people have that combo a lot. - What are these stars?

1633
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:23,443
The stars mark the dishes that are popular here.

1634
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:25,013
- Are they your signature dishes? - Yes.

1635
00:54:25,143 --> 00:54:26,672
What's S Lycano?

1636
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:28,712
Like the iced tea with a shot,

1637
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:32,053
we add a shot to a lychee drink.

1638
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:34,023
- I see. The lychee drink. - I see.

1639
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:35,252
It's the red fruit, and inside is...

1640
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:37,022
Is there a reason you're selling wines too?

1641
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,152
Drinking wine with ice cream is popular...

1642
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:42,263
among the young people these days.

1643
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:44,162
- Really? It's wine-scream. - That's crazy.

1644
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:45,763
- Yes. That's right. - "Wine-scream."

1645
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:48,803
I think this is such a trendy cafe.

1646
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:50,802
There are so many things I want to try.

1647
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:52,372
(The hottest trends fill up the menu.)

1648
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,602
- What? - This is nothing special.

1649
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,872
Wait. Do you add cilantro to chocolate ice cream?

1650
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:58,872
(Wait. Do you add cilantro to chocolate ice cream?)

1651
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:00,073
- Yes, you're right. - That's cho-cilantro.

1652
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:02,742
Yes. It's sold only at our cafe.

1653
00:55:02,743 --> 00:55:04,153
- Really? - It's one of our bestsellers.

1654
00:55:04,483 --> 00:55:06,283
Would chocolate go well with cilantro?

1655
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:07,852
Why did you put cilantro in chocolate ice cream?

1656
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:10,252
Like mint chocolate, I wanted to create a dessert...

1657
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:12,423
- that's new and controversial. - Mint chocolate.

1658
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:14,062
- It must taste like it. - Cho-cilantro.

1659
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:15,092
- Really. - Cho-cilantro?

1660
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:17,463
I don't really like mint chocolates, but cho-cilantro is different.

1661
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:19,662
She's describing it with such confidence, so...

1662
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:22,202
Many people ask for extra cilantro.

1663
00:55:22,203 --> 00:55:25,873
Also, excuse me for saying this, but when I see your face,

1664
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:28,303
I can tell how much you like to eat.

1665
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:30,873
- Does she like eating? - Like crazily.

1666
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:32,642
- Her face says that? - Yes.

1667
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:34,282
- Is she serious about food? - It feels...

1668
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:35,942
- she's my kind. - Is this a compliment?

1669
00:55:35,943 --> 00:55:37,612
When it comes to eating, I think she loves it.

1670
00:55:37,613 --> 00:55:39,053
- Is this true? - Is she a master?

1671
00:55:39,183 --> 00:55:41,352
- It's true. - I see.

1672
00:55:41,353 --> 00:55:43,252
- You love to eat. - I'll get cho-cilantro too.

1673
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,422
You're the owner, aren't you?

1674
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:46,792
- Yes, I am. - I haven't seen such food.

1675
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:48,022
- Cho-cilantro. - You look so young.

1676
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:50,122
- Aren't you in your 20s? - Yes. I'm in my mid-20s.

1677
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:51,192
That's amazing.

1678
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:52,432
(Amazed)

1679
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,063
- You're truly amazing. - Gosh. Really?

1680
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:55,802
How did you come up with such surprising dishes?

1681
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:57,832
Her dad must be so proud of his daughter.

1682
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,003
(Her dad must be so proud.)

1683
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,402
- I'll get choco-cilantro too. - Me too.

1684
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:02,602
- Are you getting cho-cilantro? - Yes.

1685
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:04,273
I'll get the one with oil.

1686
00:56:04,813 --> 00:56:06,542
I want to try vanilla ice cream with honeycomb.

1687
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:08,512
- I ordered it. We can share it. - Did you order it?

1688
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:10,383
Then we'll get one dessert each.

1689
00:56:10,883 --> 00:56:13,012
- I'll get them. - Did we order too much...

1690
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:14,922
- when she's working alone? - Please add more cilantro for me.

1691
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:15,923
- More cilantro? - Yes, please.

1692
00:56:15,924 --> 00:56:17,422
We'll spend too much time here.

1693
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:18,752
- I'm so curious. - How can she manage this place...

1694
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,053
by herself?

1695
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:21,962
That's amazing for a 25-year-old.

1696
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:26,333
She runs a trendy cafe with great dessert menus.

1697
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:28,103
- Seung Hwan, you said... - Yes.

1698
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:29,602
To her that it'd be wonderful...

1699
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:31,332
- if your daughter grew up like her. - Yes.

1700
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,373
- How old is your eldest daughter? - She's 16.

1701
00:56:33,673 --> 00:56:34,772
She's 16 years old.

1702
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:36,443
- Then she's in 3rd grade. - In 3rd in middle school.

1703
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:38,343
- The 2nd eldest is 13. - She's in 3rd grade.

1704
00:56:38,613 --> 00:56:40,043
Do your daughters...

1705
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:42,212
like your movies and series more?

1706
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:43,543
Or your variety shows more?

1707
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,512
My daughters can't watch most of the movies I'm in.

1708
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:47,583
That's right.

1709
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,452
I am always working, but they don't get to watch them.

1710
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,353
- That's right. - They like my variety shows.

1711
00:56:52,423 --> 00:56:53,592
They like it when I'm on variety shows.

1712
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:56,322
They monitor all of them when I thought they didn't.

1713
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:57,833
- After watching them... - Really?

1714
00:56:57,963 --> 00:57:00,962
Because I was confused what year I was in, I didn't know...

1715
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:02,833
how old they were, though I knew what grades they were in.

1716
00:57:02,963 --> 00:57:04,072
So I mess up their ages...

1717
00:57:04,073 --> 00:57:05,233
- a few times. - Your daughters' ages?

1718
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:07,542
I said she was 9 when she was 10.

1719
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:09,743
I said she was 10 when she was 11. When I messed it up,

1720
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:12,042
they scolded me for six months.

1721
00:57:12,043 --> 00:57:13,372
- They were upset. - It's not that I can be...

1722
00:57:13,373 --> 00:57:14,713
on variety shows when I want to.

1723
00:57:15,243 --> 00:57:17,552
Until I appear on a show again, they give me a hard time.

1724
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:19,912
- "You don't know how old I am." - When it comes to ages,

1725
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,052
I don't really know.

1726
00:57:21,053 --> 00:57:22,152
- They're confusing. - Right. They're confusing.

1727
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,353
Then what grade and class is your second eldest daughter in?

1728
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,823
How could he know that?

1729
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:27,293
- I do know. - Why wouldn't he when he's a dad?

1730
00:57:27,463 --> 00:57:28,792
- She's in 6th grade, Class 8. - I have no idea.

1731
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:29,892
You should know it like him.

1732
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:31,192
I don't know what class they are in.

1733
00:57:31,193 --> 00:57:32,892
- She's Number 34, Class 8, Grade 6. - I have no idea.

1734
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:33,933
Nice.

1735
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:37,033
- What? - Number 38, Class 9, Grade 6?

1736
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:39,032
- You said Class 8 before. - You just said Class 8.

1737
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:40,503
- I said Number 34, didn't I? - Yes.

1738
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:43,072
- You got all of the wrong. - It was Class 8, then Class 9.

1739
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:45,612
When your daughter watches this, she'll get upset again.

1740
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:46,713
Okay. What's the answer?

1741
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,342
She's in sixth grade.

1742
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:50,482
(Grade 6...)

1743
00:57:50,483 --> 00:57:51,783
Number 34, Class 9.

1744
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:54,183
It has suddenly changed from Class 8 to Class 9.

1745
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,683
Was I in Class Nine? Hold on.

1746
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,353
Do they have even nine classes these days?

1747
00:57:58,723 --> 00:58:02,662
It's 6:30pm right now. Is your daughter at home?

1748
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:04,562
My kids are at home as they don't have private lessons.

1749
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:06,163
You said Number 34, Class 9, Grade 6.

1750
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,002
Gosh. It's getting out of hand.

1751
00:58:08,003 --> 00:58:10,302
- If it's wrong, I'm in trouble. - How does he know that?

1752
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,802
Are you sure about Class Nine?

1753
00:58:11,803 --> 00:58:12,803
I have no idea.

1754
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:14,942
- She'll yell at me. - Then you'll get yelled at.

1755
00:58:14,943 --> 00:58:16,942
- She never forgets about it. - Hello?

1756
00:58:16,943 --> 00:58:18,873
(Hello?)

1757
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:21,283
Eun Seo, you're a sixth grader.

1758
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,413
- This is Ji Eun. - Right. Sorry, Ji Eun.

1759
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:26,182
(Right. Eun Seo is my eldest daughter.)

1760
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:28,383
- What are you doing? - I was nervous.

1761
00:58:28,953 --> 00:58:30,823
Eun... Ji Eun, what class are you in?

1762
00:58:31,853 --> 00:58:32,953
Class Eight.

1763
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:36,393
You're right. It's Class 8. And you're Number 34, right?

1764
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:39,463
(And you're Number 34, right?)

1765
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:41,802
I'm Number 23.

1766
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:44,272
(I'm Number 23.)

1767
00:58:44,273 --> 00:58:46,832
He got everything wrong.

1768
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:47,973
(What is he going to do?)

1769
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,543
- She's angry. - You're in trouble.

1770
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:52,372
He's in trouble.

1771
00:58:52,373 --> 00:58:53,772
- He's in big trouble. - I was wrong.

1772
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:56,943
There was a three-second pause.

1773
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,382
- Hello, Ji Eun. - I should have known.

1774
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:01,023
I'm on the show...

1775
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:02,952
- with your dad. - I missed it by one.

1776
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:04,192
- This is Lee Yi Kyung. - Number 23, Class 8.

1777
00:59:04,193 --> 00:59:05,452
Number 34, Class 9.

1778
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:06,453
Hello.

1779
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:09,392
Your dad was a little bit confused.

1780
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:10,863
You're not upset, are you?

1781
00:59:11,393 --> 00:59:13,163
No. He's always like that.

1782
00:59:13,363 --> 00:59:15,203
- "He's always like that." - She's sulky.

1783
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:16,762
- "She's sulky." - Well...

1784
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,102
Did you know your dad is here...

1785
00:59:19,103 --> 00:59:21,642
- to shoot Handsome Guys? - Does she know about our show?

1786
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:22,643
- Yes. - What?

1787
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:24,743
Do you know the show called Handsome Guys?

1788
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:29,243
I watched it because Mom and Dad were watching it.

1789
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,782
Then you know our members...

1790
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:34,252
and who are on the show.

1791
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:36,022
- I guess. - Yes.

1792
00:59:36,023 --> 00:59:38,623
Based on the order you pick,

1793
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:40,552
we'll make last place pay.

1794
00:59:40,553 --> 00:59:42,462
Then Ji Eun will feel the pressure.

1795
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,632
- Will she? - Just ask her to rank us.

1796
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:47,033
- Do what? - Don't tell her about the payment.

1797
00:59:47,093 --> 00:59:50,163
Please rank us by how much you like us...

1798
00:59:50,363 --> 00:59:52,803
from 1st place to 6th place.

1799
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:55,072
- It's for our honor. - Fourth place?

1800
00:59:55,073 --> 00:59:57,002
Who is your favorite member?

1801
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:58,272
(Cooking up a plan without Ji Eun knowing)

1802
00:59:58,273 --> 00:59:59,742
We'll go with fourth place.

1803
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:02,342
(The one in 4th place will pay.)

1804
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:03,513
The one in fourth place will pay.

1805
01:00:03,713 --> 01:00:05,182
- Who's in first place? - In first place.

1806
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:07,352
(Who does Ji Eun put in 1st place?)

1807
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,422
- Go with the flow. - Yes. Based on your feelings.

1808
01:00:09,423 --> 01:00:10,792
We know it'll change again tomorrow.

1809
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:12,453
(He looks forward to it.)

1810
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:13,793
Dad.

1811
01:00:15,123 --> 01:00:16,393
- Your dad. - Yes.

1812
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:17,833
Gosh. Yes.

1813
01:00:18,393 --> 01:00:20,902
- And who's in 2nd place? - Who's in 2nd place?

1814
01:00:20,903 --> 01:00:22,663
(Who is in 2nd place out of 5 people?)

1815
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:25,602
- Tae Hyun. - It's Tae Hyun.

1816
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:26,632
She saw him a lot.

1817
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,302
She sees him at least 2 to 3 times a year.

1818
01:00:28,303 --> 01:00:30,172
- He's the best. - Good.

1819
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:31,772
- He buys her delicious meals. - You meet on holidays and all.

1820
01:00:31,773 --> 01:00:33,272
- Of course. - Who's in third place?

1821
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:35,312
Wait. Ju Hwan has to pass this test too.

1822
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:37,613
(The real owner of Tae Hyun's wallet still remains.)

1823
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:40,682
Sang Uk.

1824
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:42,252
(Sang Uk is in 3rd place.)

1825
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:43,383
I'm in third place.

1826
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:47,352
Gosh. It's based on the looks now.

1827
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:50,022
- Now, three people are left. - She makes me so happy.

1828
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:52,932
There are Dong Hyun, Yi Kyung,

1829
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:54,862
and Ju Hwan.

1830
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,932
Ju Hwan, it's better to be in last place.

1831
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,333
Will you say who's in last place first?

1832
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:00,032
- Who's in last place? - In last place.

1833
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:02,442
(Who's in last place?)

1834
01:01:02,443 --> 01:01:03,772
It's Yi Kyung.

1835
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,213
(It's Yi Kyung.)

1836
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:06,612
(He's happy yet sad.)

1837
01:01:06,613 --> 01:01:07,783
I was happy.

1838
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,183
Thank you.

1839
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:11,052
It's okay.

1840
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:13,113
Right. I shouldn't ask why, should I?

1841
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:14,723
- No. - Okay.

1842
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:18,023
I got it. We have 4th and 5th place left.

1843
01:01:18,393 --> 01:01:21,723
Dong Hyun and Ju Hwan remain.

1844
01:01:21,963 --> 01:01:23,093
Who's in fourth place?

1845
01:01:24,037 --> 01:01:25,706
Uncle Kim Dong Hyun...

1846
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:27,437
and Uncle Lim Ju Hwan remain.

1847
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:28,647
Who's in fourth place?
(Who will come in 4th place and pay?)

1848
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,116
Uncle Dong Hyun.

1849
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:32,276
(Uncle Dong Hyun)

1850
01:01:32,277 --> 01:01:34,416
Uncle Kim Dong Hyun is in fourth place.

1851
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:36,886
Uncle Lim Ju Hwan is in fifth place.

1852
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:38,916
- I survived. - Thank you.

1853
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:41,686
I'll put Uncle Kim Dong Hyun in fourth place on the phone.

1854
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,287
You and I avoided that fate.

1855
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:45,496
Hello.

1856
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,557
I'm Uncle Kim Dong Hyun in fourth place.

1857
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:48,826
(Chuckling sadly)

1858
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:50,766
- Thank you. - He's thankful.

1859
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,767
Thank you for not putting me in last place.

1860
01:01:52,867 --> 01:01:55,236
Ji Eun, I knew that you were Number 23 in Class 8.

1861
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:57,336
I also know that you're 13 years old.

1862
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:58,437
You're lying.

1863
01:01:58,937 --> 01:02:00,476
Don't lie.

1864
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:01,647
- It isn't a lie. - You're lying.

1865
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:04,207
I'll put your dad back on the phone. Say bye.

1866
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,017
Well,

1867
01:02:06,217 --> 01:02:07,917
enjoy your dinner. See you later.

1868
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:09,416
- Okay. - Okay.

1869
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:11,056
(Ji Eun, thank you for the phone conversation.)

1870
01:02:11,057 --> 01:02:12,456
Dong Hyun, thank you for the food.

1871
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:13,586
- I had a bad feeling about it. - Thank you for the food.

1872
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:15,226
- Thank you for the food. - It happened naturally.

1873
01:02:15,227 --> 01:02:16,426
For goodness' sake.

1874
01:02:16,427 --> 01:02:18,627
- Why did I do this? - Number four suits you.

1875
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:19,826
I did this without thinking...

1876
01:02:19,827 --> 01:02:20,956
when we were deciding on the place.

1877
01:02:20,957 --> 01:02:22,326
- You picked it yourself, right? - Yes.

1878
01:02:22,327 --> 01:02:23,466
I could've done this or this.

1879
01:02:23,467 --> 01:02:24,637
Why did I do this?

1880
01:02:24,837 --> 01:02:26,766
I'll serve ice cream first.

1881
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:27,907
It looks so pretty.

1882
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:29,637
-It's chocolate and cilantro. - Yes.

1883
01:02:29,737 --> 01:02:31,176
Cilantro and honeycomb.

1884
01:02:31,177 --> 01:02:32,437
Hold on. I've never seen something like this.

1885
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:34,306
It's pretty.

1886
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:36,606
It's like a tree that's planted on a barren mountain.

1887
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:37,777
(A tree on the mountain of rich chocolate)

1888
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:41,217
(An unbelievable combination, chocolate and cilantro ice cream)

1889
01:02:43,017 --> 01:02:45,216
(A combination that has to be tasty, )

1890
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:47,457
(vanilla ice cream with honeycomb and granola)

1891
01:02:47,557 --> 01:02:48,557
- What's this? - It's...

1892
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:49,787
- vanilla ice cream with olive oil. - Olive oil.

1893
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:51,256
It contains olive oil.

1894
01:02:51,257 --> 01:02:52,427
(Salt and pepper that are sprinkled on ice cream...)

1895
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:55,267
(and olive oil create a harmony.)

1896
01:02:55,297 --> 01:02:57,836
(A trendy combination, vanilla ice cream with olive oil)

1897
01:02:57,837 --> 01:02:59,537
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1898
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,207
- I like this one. - It's tasty.

1899
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:02,906
- That's right. - He's bound to pay once.

1900
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:04,066
It'll be strange if he doesn't pay once.

1901
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:05,737
- It'll be strange. - It'll be strange.

1902
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:09,707
(Ju Hwan tries the combination of chocolate and cilantro.)

1903
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:13,116
(Smiling)

1904
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:14,217
This is...

1905
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:16,086
- You know... - It's very unique.

1906
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,146
- Really? - Really?

1907
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:19,117
I can't imagine the taste. Cilantro...

1908
01:03:19,517 --> 01:03:20,756
- This is... - At first,

1909
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:22,486
I taste chocolate.

1910
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:24,086
Then it disappears...

1911
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:25,457
and the taste of cilantro fills my mouth.

1912
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:26,826
Why would you eat that?

1913
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,097
(Tae Hyun doesn't like cilantro.)

1914
01:03:28,627 --> 01:03:31,597
(Seung Hwan tries it right away.)

1915
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:36,337
I think it'll be tasty.

1916
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,637
- Really? - Yes.

1917
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:40,277
How did they come up with this combination?

1918
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:45,977
The taste of cilantro hits you at the end.

1919
01:03:46,777 --> 01:03:48,887
- It's so unique. - Cilantro... Chocolate... Cho...

1920
01:03:49,717 --> 01:03:51,017
It's cho-cilantro.

1921
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:52,217
You know,

1922
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,887
The taste of chocolate can't beat the taste of cilantro.

1923
01:03:54,927 --> 01:03:55,987
It can't.

1924
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:57,626
But the taste of chocolate is strong too.

1925
01:03:57,627 --> 01:03:58,897
You know,

1926
01:03:58,957 --> 01:04:01,366
it's tasty in a piquant way. It's strange.

1927
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:02,826
It makes you go, "What's this?" But it's tasty.

1928
01:04:02,827 --> 01:04:06,967
(You go, "What's this?" But it's tasty.)

1929
01:04:07,037 --> 01:04:08,606
I like something like this.

1930
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:10,567
(He's curious, but suspicious.)

1931
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:15,647
(What?)

1932
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:17,307
It's Thai food.

1933
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:20,177
It's like chocolate ice cream from Southeast Asia.

1934
01:04:20,347 --> 01:04:22,747
I think it's much better than mint chocolate.

1935
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,316
- Same here. - That's what I think.

1936
01:04:24,317 --> 01:04:25,957
I don't like mint chocolate.

1937
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:27,926
The two ingredients don't seem to go together,

1938
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:28,987
but it's nice.

1939
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:30,627
It's so unique.

1940
01:04:31,297 --> 01:04:32,396
(The man who doesn't like cilantro gives up.)

1941
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:33,497
I won't try it.

1942
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,597
(Reaching)

1943
01:04:36,827 --> 01:04:39,336
It doesn't taste strange at all.

1944
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:40,696
- Olive oil? - Yes.

1945
01:04:40,697 --> 01:04:41,867
Try it.

1946
01:04:42,807 --> 01:04:44,036
Hey, this is tasty as well.

1947
01:04:44,037 --> 01:04:45,037
(Impressed)

1948
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:46,937
This combination isn't...

1949
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:48,876
- strange. - It doesn't taste weird.

1950
01:04:48,877 --> 01:04:50,507
Even though it contains olive oil...

1951
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:53,447
It's tastier than the food at most restaurants.

1952
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:57,916
Ma'am, how do you know so much about desserts?

1953
01:04:57,917 --> 01:04:59,756
Have you always liked them?

1954
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:02,887
Yes, I always make what I like.

1955
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,127
I think that's why they come out tasty.

1956
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:07,457
When there's something new like this...

1957
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:09,826
- People will try it. - It's fun to try it.

1958
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,196
It's unique. At this place,

1959
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:12,796
- people will be able to talk... - That's right.

1960
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:14,737
While eating desserts as we're doing now.

1961
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,736
- It's here. - Here's your dessert.

1962
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:18,506
(Here's your dessert.)

1963
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:19,736
Look at that.

1964
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:21,976
The roll cake looks tasty.

1965
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,176
- Look at that. - What do we have here?

1966
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:24,916
- The cream bread looks amazing. - This is incredible.

1967
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,146
- What are these noodles? - It looks like japchae.

1968
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:27,447
- Yakisoba. - Yakisoba.

1969
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:30,116
It's a stir-fried noodle dish from Japan.

1970
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:31,457
(A hearty item, yakisoba salt bread)

1971
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:33,456
(A combination of softness and crunchiness, )

1972
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:34,887
(fruit and biscuit roll)

1973
01:05:35,257 --> 01:05:36,826
(A tasty and pretty item, fig open toast)

1974
01:05:36,827 --> 01:05:38,126
You don't get these items...

1975
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,856
from somewhere, right? You make them yourself.

1976
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,597
- Yes, I make them. - Right?

1977
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,767
This cream is bound to be tasty.

1978
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:45,897
Try it.

1979
01:05:46,397 --> 01:05:48,407
- We need to cut it well. - Let's cut it.

1980
01:05:48,437 --> 01:05:50,066
- Cut it well. - Can someone cut it well?

1981
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:51,306
- I'll try it. - Here.

1982
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:52,436
- Here. - This one is cut.

1983
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:53,476
You just need to cut this well.

1984
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:54,806
- I'll cut it. - Cut it.

1985
01:05:54,807 --> 01:05:57,346
(Sang Uk will cut the yakisoba salt bread.)

1986
01:05:57,347 --> 01:05:59,346
- He's really quick. - It isn't easy.

1987
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:00,876
Gosh, the way the knife goes in...

1988
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:02,646
- Can I eat this? - There are four pieces...

1989
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:04,346
- of the fig toast. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1990
01:06:04,347 --> 01:06:05,557
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1991
01:06:06,157 --> 01:06:07,616
- I don't think Tae Hyun will eat. - I won't eat.

1992
01:06:07,617 --> 01:06:09,586
Then we just need to pick 1 out of 5 people.

1993
01:06:09,587 --> 01:06:11,297
The winner shouldn't eat.

1994
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:12,626
- Number 1 shouldn't eat. - Number 1 shouldn't eat.

1995
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:13,827
Rock-paper-scissors.

1996
01:06:16,427 --> 01:06:17,726
Gosh, it's you versus me again.

1997
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,866
(The winner won't get to eat.)

1998
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:19,936
I mean...

1999
01:06:19,937 --> 01:06:21,136
- I'll play scissors. - Scissors?

2000
01:06:21,137 --> 01:06:22,267
What should I play then?

2001
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:23,566
What should I do?

2002
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:24,936
(He's confused.)

2003
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:27,276
- He's confused. - It's bad to win. I need to lose.

2004
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:28,306
Then I should play rock, right?

2005
01:06:28,307 --> 01:06:29,376
Then I'll be able to eat.

2006
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:31,446
Okay. Then I'll play rock. You play scissors.

2007
01:06:31,447 --> 01:06:33,476
- Then you'll eat. - Yes. Then you'll eat.

2008
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:34,946
- Play paper. - If it's scissors versus rock,

2009
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,186
- I'll eat. - Yes.

2010
01:06:36,187 --> 01:06:37,616
But you won't play rock.

2011
01:06:37,617 --> 01:06:38,686
You'll play this instead.

2012
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:40,417
- How do you know? No one knows. - So I'll play this.

2013
01:06:40,487 --> 01:06:41,656
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2014
01:06:41,657 --> 01:06:42,727
Okay.

2015
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:44,526
(Oh, that's right.)

2016
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:46,157
- Did you give it another twist? - Yes.

2017
01:06:46,427 --> 01:06:47,827
I should've made plans in my head.

2018
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:49,796
I showed you everything.

2019
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,037
(I should've made plans in my head. I showed you everything.)

2020
01:06:52,797 --> 01:06:53,936
He's smart.

2021
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,507
(The winner takes a bite in a leisurely manner.)

2022
01:06:59,237 --> 01:07:01,607
(Eating)

2023
01:07:04,177 --> 01:07:05,177
- It's so tasty. - It's my first time eating it.

2024
01:07:05,178 --> 01:07:06,217
Is it tasty?

2025
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:09,517
(He eats it in one bite.)

2026
01:07:10,087 --> 01:07:11,187
It's tasty.

2027
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:12,987
You need to play rock-paper-scissors.

2028
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,657
Eat this first.

2029
01:07:15,457 --> 01:07:16,726
This is yours.

2030
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:17,856
You don't want it, right?

2031
01:07:17,857 --> 01:07:18,996
(You don't want it, right?)

2032
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:19,997
You don't want it, right?

2033
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,026
(He asks a strange question, "You don't want it, right?")

2034
01:07:21,027 --> 01:07:22,126
You don't want it, right?

2035
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:23,366
Hey.

2036
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:25,067
(Eating)

2037
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:26,337
Hey.

2038
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:28,667
(Disappointed)

2039
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:30,136
There are four pieces...

2040
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:31,167
- of yakisoba bread. - Then...

2041
01:07:31,237 --> 01:07:32,636
There are four pieces of yakisoba bread.

2042
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:33,676
Rock-paper-scissors? What should we do this time?

2043
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:34,677
- Then... - I see six pieces.

2044
01:07:34,678 --> 01:07:36,346
- Oh, there are four pieces. - Then...

2045
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:37,476
You aren't going to eat.

2046
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:38,646
Why would you play rock-paper-scissors?

2047
01:07:38,647 --> 01:07:39,776
It's his goal to win.

2048
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:42,147
I'll play rock-paper-scissors. Then the first place...

2049
01:07:42,217 --> 01:07:44,187
Let's eliminate the first and last places.

2050
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:45,457
- The first and last places. - Okay.

2051
01:07:45,587 --> 01:07:46,756
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2052
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:47,917
- I need to come in the middle. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2053
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:49,127
Rock-paper-scissors.

2054
01:07:49,128 --> 01:07:50,586
- Stop. Okay. - Okay.

2055
01:07:50,587 --> 01:07:51,927
- Okay. - One from each group.

2056
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:53,996
Okay.

2057
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:56,596
(Two groups)

2058
01:07:56,597 --> 01:07:59,136
- Here, the first place can't eat. - The winner can't eat.

2059
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:00,866
- Here... - Here, the last place can't eat.

2060
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:02,066
- We'll go first. - I need to come in the middle.

2061
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:03,107
Rock-paper-scissors.

2062
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:04,737
We won!

2063
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:06,936
(Sang Uk is in last place.)

2064
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:08,946
It was so hard to cut the bread.

2065
01:08:08,947 --> 01:08:11,176
He cut it diligently. He cut it into pieces.

2066
01:08:11,177 --> 01:08:12,947
- I can't eat. - Try to avoid placing first.

2067
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,217
Rock-paper-scissors.

2068
01:08:17,147 --> 01:08:20,717
(Dong Hyun is in 1st place.)

2069
01:08:21,787 --> 01:08:23,626
How did this happen?

2070
01:08:23,627 --> 01:08:25,197
(Dong Hyun can't eat again.)

2071
01:08:25,857 --> 01:08:28,096
I have no luck when it comes to a match.

2072
01:08:28,097 --> 01:08:29,227
Sang Uk, go ahead and eat.

2073
01:08:29,427 --> 01:08:31,597
Tae Hyun, why won't you give it to me?

2074
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:32,967
Tae Hyun!

2075
01:08:33,297 --> 01:08:34,636
You played rock-paper-scissors...

2076
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:36,567
even though you didn't want to eat.

2077
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:38,977
- For goodness' sake. - I can do whatever I want with it.

2078
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:41,137
Why did you look at me?

2079
01:08:42,677 --> 01:08:46,216
(This is so much fun.)

2080
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:48,146
- This is tasty. - I know.

2081
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:49,846
This place has tasty food.

2082
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:51,087
Seriously.

2083
01:08:51,187 --> 01:08:53,817
Earlier, I heard...

2084
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:56,627
- that you joined Tae Hyun's agency. - Yes.

2085
01:08:56,857 --> 01:09:00,027
I want to know what kind of a CEO Tae Hyun is.

2086
01:09:00,097 --> 01:09:01,597
It's my first time seeing him after joining the agency.

2087
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:02,727
Really?

2088
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:04,496
How long has it been since you joined the agency?

2089
01:09:04,497 --> 01:09:05,796
- About three months? - Three months.

2090
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:06,996
- It has been three months. - Three to four months.

2091
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:08,367
- It hasn't been long. - No.

2092
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:09,736
After signing the contract,

2093
01:09:09,737 --> 01:09:10,906
the CEO usually meets up with the talent...

2094
01:09:10,907 --> 01:09:11,976
- to talk and dine together. - That's right.

2095
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:13,476
- They usually dine together. - We've known each other for years,

2096
01:09:13,477 --> 01:09:15,306
- so we talked over the phone. - That's right.

2097
01:09:15,307 --> 01:09:16,647
For how long have you guys known each other?

2098
01:09:17,447 --> 01:09:19,547
- Over ten years. - It has been many years.

2099
01:09:19,647 --> 01:09:21,647
- It has been long. - At first,

2100
01:09:21,717 --> 01:09:23,216
articles about how he was setting up an agency...

2101
01:09:23,217 --> 01:09:25,086
with Zo In Sung got released. The next day,

2102
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:27,617
he called me while I was practicing for a play.

2103
01:09:27,757 --> 01:09:29,127
"Ju Hwan, did you read the articles?"

2104
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:30,526
"Yes, Tae Hyun."

2105
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:32,057
"You're setting up an agency with a partner."

2106
01:09:32,457 --> 01:09:33,626
"You're joining it too."

2107
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:34,656
(Confused)

2108
01:09:34,657 --> 01:09:35,726
"Me?"

2109
01:09:35,727 --> 01:09:36,927
Did you recruit him that way?

2110
01:09:37,027 --> 01:09:38,067
Yes.

2111
01:09:38,437 --> 01:09:39,437
"You're joining it too."

2112
01:09:39,438 --> 01:09:41,037
I was like, "Doesn't my opinion matter?"

2113
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:42,866
"Do you have any other agency to join?" "No."

2114
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:44,037
"Then just sign the contract."

2115
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:45,876
For a few months...

2116
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:47,406
You were a free agent at the time.

2117
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:48,447
I was a free agent.

2118
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,207
Then he hung up.

2119
01:09:50,907 --> 01:09:52,647
- He was in a play. - It happened in a casual way.

2120
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:54,916
Ju Hwan was only appearing...

2121
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:56,387
in plays at the time.

2122
01:09:56,647 --> 01:09:58,317
"Ju Hwan,"

2123
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:00,116
"you don't need to share what you make..."

2124
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,456
"from the plays."

2125
01:10:01,457 --> 01:10:02,686
- Didn't he need to share it? - No.

2126
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:03,726
"You can keep going. However,"

2127
01:10:03,727 --> 01:10:05,856
"There won't be any financial support from us."

2128
01:10:05,857 --> 01:10:06,996
(However, there won't be any financial support from us.)

2129
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:08,466
- He takes the subway. - That's why he takes the subway.

2130
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,366
I take the subway and bus.

2131
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:13,136
He takes the bus.

2132
01:10:13,137 --> 01:10:14,196
As you know,

2133
01:10:14,197 --> 01:10:16,107
there are 2 CEOs among the 6 of us.

2134
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:17,737
- What? - Shin Star ENM.

2135
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:19,176
- He's the CEO of Shin Star ENM. - Shin Star ENM.

2136
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:20,306
- Really? - Yes. I'm the CEO of an agency.

2137
01:10:20,307 --> 01:10:21,606
- Are you the CEO of an agency? - He's a CEO.

2138
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:22,607
Really?

2139
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:24,576
There are many other celebrities in your agency, right?

2140
01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:25,646
I'm the only one.

2141
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:26,876
(Shin Seung Hwan, the agency's CEO and only artist)

2142
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,746
- Yes. You pretend to be the CEO. - Yes.

2143
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:30,786
- When I get a call... - "I'll tell Shin Seung Hwan."

2144
01:10:30,787 --> 01:10:31,787
Really?

2145
01:10:31,788 --> 01:10:33,356
Back in the day, I used a dialect.

2146
01:10:33,357 --> 01:10:35,057
- But it was too much. - Really?

2147
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:36,856
Would you use a dialect just once?

2148
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,396
- We want to hear it. - I'm from Busan,

2149
01:10:38,397 --> 01:10:40,156
so I use a dialect when I answer a call from an unknown number.

2150
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,257
"Hello."

2151
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:43,166
"I see."

2152
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:44,326
"Okay. Please wait."

2153
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,366
"Seung Hwan,"

2154
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:47,066
"it's a call from a director."

2155
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:48,367
Okay.

2156
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:49,637
"Hello."

2157
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,706
- "Hello." - Your tone...

2158
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:53,106
Your tone stayed the same.

2159
01:10:53,107 --> 01:10:54,536
Exactly. But...

2160
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:55,877
people don't even imagine it.

2161
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:57,877
People don't even imagine it.

2162
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,646
- People don't even imagine it. - Of course not.

2163
01:11:00,647 --> 01:11:02,386
I always do it. I've done it often in front of Tae Hyun.

2164
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:03,586
It isn't a rare occasion.

2165
01:11:03,587 --> 01:11:05,386
- I always do it. - He does it all the time.

2166
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:06,786
There are uncomfortable requests...

2167
01:11:06,787 --> 01:11:08,756
- the actor can't turn himself down. - You're right.

2168
01:11:08,757 --> 01:11:10,957
- That's when the CEO enters. - The talk of payment is the same.

2169
01:11:11,087 --> 01:11:13,427
Hey, your secret will be out once this episode airs.

2170
01:11:13,457 --> 01:11:15,267
Still, people won't imagine it.

2171
01:11:15,427 --> 01:11:16,427
I'll deny it outright.

2172
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:20,997
"Seung Hwan was joking around on TV."

2173
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:24,037
"I'm the CEO."

2174
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:26,107
People don't even imagine it.

2175
01:11:26,607 --> 01:11:27,807
No one does.

2176
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:29,477
That's unbelievable.

2177
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:32,376
I'll bring the bill so that we can check out the total.

2178
01:11:32,377 --> 01:11:34,616
- Okay. - The total can't be very big.

2179
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:36,346
- It can't be very big. - You're wrong.

2180
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:37,416
Desserts are pretty expensive.

2181
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:38,487
How much is the total?

2182
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:39,687
It's 51 dollars.

2183
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:40,816
(Total: 51.80 dollars)

2184
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:41,857
It's 51 dollars.

2185
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:44,656
- The total is understandable. - We didn't eat much.

2186
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:46,197
The total is really small.

2187
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:47,396
The total went down due to Seung Ho's absence, right?

2188
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:51,696
Compared to the quality, the price is reasonable.

2189
01:11:51,697 --> 01:11:52,967
It's reasonable.

2190
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:55,106
I'll go ahead and pay.

2191
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:56,606
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2192
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:57,736
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2193
01:11:57,737 --> 01:12:00,106
- I enjoyed the desserts. - Here you go.

2194
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,176
(Total: 51.80 dollars)

2195
01:12:01,177 --> 01:12:03,777
I want to bring some home. It was really tasty.

2196
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:07,476
Chocolate and cilantro make a pretty tasty combination.

2197
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:09,487
(Shall we go and eat dinner now?)

2198
01:12:10,787 --> 01:12:16,357
(Everyone is hurrying to go home at this hour.)

2199
01:12:20,957 --> 01:12:24,927
(Let's pass through Mapo-daero's forest of buildings.)

2200
01:12:26,497 --> 01:12:27,796
Every restaurant looks good.

2201
01:12:27,797 --> 01:12:30,237
- The signs give off that vibe. - The vibe is on another level.

2202
01:12:31,737 --> 01:12:34,437
I didn't expect to see an alley market here.

2203
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:37,047
This is the Gongdeok Market in Mapo.

2204
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:39,717
- Gongdeok Market. - So this is the Gongdeok Market.

2205
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:42,787
- This is the real deal. - The real deal.

2206
01:12:42,887 --> 01:12:45,016
This vibe isn't artificial. It's the real deal.

2207
01:12:45,017 --> 01:12:46,287
(Gongdeok Market's scenery has the old, homely vibe.)

2208
01:12:47,717 --> 01:12:49,327
Sikhye is tasty at such markets.

2209
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:51,456
I bet they sell yakgwa too.

2210
01:12:51,457 --> 01:12:52,597
It's bound to be tasty.

2211
01:12:52,897 --> 01:12:53,927
Agar jelly.

2212
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:55,867
Each alley looks incredible.

2213
01:12:56,797 --> 01:13:00,337
There are so many places inside the market.

2214
01:13:00,597 --> 01:13:02,766
- If you go down this way... - You're right. Jokbal.

2215
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,667
- Jokbal. - If you go down this way,

2216
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:06,777
you'll find the places for jeon and jokbal.

2217
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,307
- I see. - The jokbal alley.

2218
01:13:10,147 --> 01:13:11,206
If you go inside...

2219
01:13:11,207 --> 01:13:12,946
- It was on TV many times. - Hey.

2220
01:13:12,947 --> 01:13:15,516
Although I ate so much, the food looks tasty.

2221
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:17,117
Right? Although the stomach is full...

2222
01:13:18,387 --> 01:13:19,716
Coming out of the market and seeing the buildings...

2223
01:13:19,717 --> 01:13:21,087
makes me feel like I'm in the new world.

2224
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:23,456
Right next to the market...

2225
01:13:23,457 --> 01:13:25,856
are the new buildings.

2226
01:13:25,857 --> 01:13:28,296
It's a mix of old and new.

2227
01:13:28,297 --> 01:13:29,597
Here, the buildings are low. There...

2228
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:33,196
There is a row of pork ribs restaurants.

2229
01:13:33,197 --> 01:13:35,306
You're right. These are pork ribs restaurants.

2230
01:13:35,307 --> 01:13:36,307
Where are we going?

2231
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:38,636
Among them, we're going to the original one.

2232
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:40,737
Is it the place with the sign that says, "The authentic original?"

2233
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:43,777
- It's the authentic original. - The original one.

2234
01:13:44,407 --> 01:13:46,616
(The authentic original restaurant that's the oldest...)

2235
01:13:46,617 --> 01:13:48,847
(in the Mapo's ribs alley.)

2236
01:13:49,347 --> 01:13:51,487
(Since 1956, it has been in Gongdeok-dong.)

2237
01:13:51,957 --> 01:13:56,487
(Korea's first seasoned pork ribs)

2238
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:06,836
Please give us two servings of pork ribs.

2239
01:14:06,837 --> 01:14:11,607
(For the tourists, it's a must-visit restaurant.)

2240
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:14,106
(For the workers, )

2241
01:14:14,107 --> 01:14:16,677
(it's a place to relax on their way home.)

2242
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:21,047
(Both the taste and the atmosphere are always homely.)

2243
01:14:21,717 --> 01:14:26,986
(DMR, pork ribs)

2244
01:14:26,987 --> 01:14:28,216
- My goodness. - Hello.

2245
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:30,387
- Please enjoy the food. - What's up with the smell?

2246
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:31,996
This is incredible.

2247
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:33,026
(The hall is full of customers even though it's a weekday.)

2248
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:34,397
- It's my first time coming here. - I'm hungry.

2249
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:37,267
- My goodness. - It smells amazing.

2250
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:39,337
- What's this? - I love the vibe.

2251
01:14:39,697 --> 01:14:41,266
- What's this? - The vibe is incredible.

2252
01:14:41,267 --> 01:14:42,366
(The huge restaurant stretches out forever.)

2253
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:43,367
What's this?

2254
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:45,477
- What's this? - This is incredible.

2255
01:14:46,037 --> 01:14:47,277
Seriously.

2256
01:14:47,677 --> 01:14:48,977
- This is incredible. - From the entrance,

2257
01:14:49,207 --> 01:14:52,446
it looked like the restaurant would be 33m² big.

2258
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:53,447
The inside is bigger.

2259
01:14:53,847 --> 01:14:54,947
It has to be over 330m² big.

2260
01:14:55,717 --> 01:14:56,747
It's no joke.

2261
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:58,287
What's this?

2262
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:01,386
- It's an old newspaper. - Newspaper.

2263
01:15:01,387 --> 01:15:05,297
It's from August 27, 1976.

2264
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:07,927
- Tae Hyun was born in that year. - Is it a real newspaper?

2265
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:09,026
- Yes. - Yes.

2266
01:15:09,027 --> 01:15:10,467
Tae Hyun, I want to read you something.

2267
01:15:11,297 --> 01:15:13,967
An advertisement for an apartment in front of Gangnam-gu Office.

2268
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:16,937
A 72m² apartment cost 6,560 dollars.

2269
01:15:17,307 --> 01:15:19,077
- Really? - That's what it says here.

2270
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:20,736
Which apartment was it?

2271
01:15:20,737 --> 01:15:22,847
A 89m² apartment cost 8,050 dollars.

2272
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:25,316
Did an apartment 6,000 to 8,000 dollars?

2273
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:26,317
In Gangnam?

2274
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:27,677
Eight units remain.

2275
01:15:27,817 --> 01:15:29,487
Buy a 72m² apartment.

2276
01:15:30,117 --> 01:15:31,986
How much did the price jump since then?

2277
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:33,657
(How much did the price jump since then?)

2278
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:36,356
About 100 times. Over 100 times.

2279
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:37,927
That's right.

2280
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:41,396
- It's so interesting. - This place is unbelievable.

2281
01:15:41,397 --> 01:15:42,766
This place is no joke.

2282
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,126
- It's a real deal. - It's incredible.

2283
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,637
This place is legendary.

2284
01:15:45,997 --> 01:15:47,966
To be honest, we've had...

2285
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:49,966
pork ribs many times on the show.

2286
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,267
How will we see anything new?

2287
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:53,636
There must be a reason why the restaurant has been around.

2288
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,306
It's over 60 years old.

2289
01:15:55,307 --> 01:15:58,576
Customers don't come if the food tastes bad.

2290
01:15:58,577 --> 01:16:00,246
It's the first pork ribs place in Korea,

2291
01:16:00,247 --> 01:16:02,047
so it's meaningful.

2292
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:04,747
- Hello. - Hello.

2293
01:16:05,287 --> 01:16:07,487
- He's young. - He's young.

2294
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:12,396
Is this the restaurant that began selling pork ribs?

2295
01:16:12,397 --> 01:16:13,397
That's right.

2296
01:16:13,398 --> 01:16:15,466
How did it happen?

2297
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:20,136
This restaurant opened in June of 1956.

2298
01:16:20,137 --> 01:16:22,866
Back then, people...

2299
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:26,106
- mostly ate pork as suyuk. - I see.

2300
01:16:26,107 --> 01:16:29,006
The man who opened this restaurant began selling...

2301
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:32,476
pork ribs people could grill at the table.

2302
01:16:32,477 --> 01:16:36,587
(It was a pub that sold cheap food and big bowls of makgeolli.)

2303
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:40,857
(Thanks to the word of mouth, Mapo Galbi Alley came to be.)

2304
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:44,856
(Pork ribs went beyond a simple dish...)

2305
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:47,826
(and became recognized as cultural heritage.)

2306
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:50,596
On a busy day,

2307
01:16:50,597 --> 01:16:52,796
how much meat do you sell?

2308
01:16:52,797 --> 01:16:54,137
Do you have an idea?

2309
01:16:54,297 --> 01:16:56,867
About 700 to 800 servings.

2310
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:59,036
About 700 to 800 servings? In a single day?

2311
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:00,376
- Sometimes, we sell more. - About 700 to 800 servings?

2312
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:01,507
That's impressive.

2313
01:17:01,607 --> 01:17:03,706
- It must be really tasty. - That's impressive.

2314
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:07,946
Even if it isn't the original place, it'd be a real deal.

2315
01:17:07,947 --> 01:17:09,586
- That's right. - I'm curious.

2316
01:17:09,587 --> 01:17:12,987
What should we order?

2317
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:16,656
Pork ribs, salt-grilled pork, and pork rind are...

2318
01:17:16,657 --> 01:17:17,657
- our original items. - Then...

2319
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:20,357
we should order those three.

2320
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:22,467
Shall we grill one kind each and share?

2321
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:24,326
- Let's do that. - Shall we share?

2322
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:26,036
Let's cook seasoned ribs here and salt-grilled pork here.

2323
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:27,166
Then we can cook pork rind separately.

2324
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,866
Let's cook three servings of ribs and salt-grilled pork.

2325
01:17:29,867 --> 01:17:31,237
- That sounds good. - Then we can share.

2326
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:33,506
- Black rice noodles. - Black rice noodles.

2327
01:17:33,507 --> 01:17:35,136
- We want one too. - One.

2328
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:36,146
(We want black rice noodles too.)

2329
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:37,506
- We need to taste it. - We need to taste it.

2330
01:17:37,507 --> 01:17:38,676
That'll be our order.

2331
01:17:38,677 --> 01:17:40,216
Will you taste pork rind as well?

2332
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:41,576
- Of course. - We should taste it too.

2333
01:17:41,577 --> 01:17:44,016
- We also want one pig heart. - One pig heart.

2334
01:17:44,017 --> 01:17:45,957
- We also want one skirt meat. - One skirt meat.

2335
01:17:46,057 --> 01:17:47,386
You ordered everything on the menu.

2336
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:50,886
- Well, we should get a taste. - We should get a taste.

2337
01:17:50,887 --> 01:17:52,527
If we win in the game,

2338
01:17:52,757 --> 01:17:54,527
- the production crew will pay. - That's right.

2339
01:17:55,097 --> 01:17:56,366
(I can't believe them.)

2340
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,266
- That'll be our order. - Okay.

2341
01:17:58,267 --> 01:17:59,537
- Let's go. - Thank you.

2342
01:17:59,597 --> 01:18:00,597
- That was quick. - Let's go.

2343
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:02,406
I can't wait.

2344
01:18:02,407 --> 01:18:03,407
(They can't hide their excitement.)

2345
01:18:03,408 --> 01:18:04,567
Seriously.

2346
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:06,976
I hope the meat gets cooked fast. The grill is small.

2347
01:18:06,977 --> 01:18:08,037
(The worrywart can't hide his anxiety.)

2348
01:18:08,077 --> 01:18:09,507
When I come to a restaurant like this,

2349
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:12,577
there's some excitement about tasty food.

2350
01:18:13,077 --> 01:18:15,276
But I also think, "I'm surrounded by these big people,"

2351
01:18:15,277 --> 01:18:17,147
"but cooking meat on this tiny grill will take forever."

2352
01:18:17,787 --> 01:18:19,587
"What if I can't eat a lot?"

2353
01:18:20,017 --> 01:18:21,356
- I always think that. - Really?

2354
01:18:21,357 --> 01:18:22,587
Am I the only one who does that?

2355
01:18:22,787 --> 01:18:25,126
"When will the meat get cooked? The grill is too tiny."

2356
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:26,427
(The grill gives him anxiety.)

2357
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:28,497
I've never had that thought in my life.

2358
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:30,327
It's because you eat your meat well done.

2359
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,566
The meat is here.

2360
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:33,096
- Your meat is here. - Okay.

2361
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:34,237
(Korea's first pork ribs is here.)

2362
01:18:34,397 --> 01:18:36,407
The seasoning looks strong.

2363
01:18:38,937 --> 01:18:40,476
(Welcome. Is it your first time watching someone prepare...)

2364
01:18:40,477 --> 01:18:42,007
(700 servings of meat?)

2365
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:47,817
(Ribs get sliced.)

2366
01:18:48,947 --> 01:18:50,587
(Spread out)

2367
01:18:51,347 --> 01:18:54,287
(The meat gets scored thoroughly so that it absorbs the seasoning.)

2368
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:57,157
(The scored pork ribs...)

2369
01:18:57,527 --> 01:19:02,667
(get marinated in the secret red seasoning.)

2370
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:08,967
(Mapo ribs)

2371
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,506
This restaurant was the first to sell the seasoned ribs.

2372
01:19:11,507 --> 01:19:13,707
- That's right. - These are seasoned ribs.

2373
01:19:13,777 --> 01:19:16,276
They're a bit red.

2374
01:19:16,277 --> 01:19:18,547
This isn't soy sauce.

2375
01:19:19,077 --> 01:19:20,077
Is it garlic?

2376
01:19:20,217 --> 01:19:21,346
It looks like it contains gochujang.

2377
01:19:21,347 --> 01:19:23,286
I think I smell gochujang...

2378
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:24,687
and garlic.

2379
01:19:24,847 --> 01:19:26,657
(Yi Kyung takes a sniff.)

2380
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:29,726
- It's garlic. - Garlic and gochujang, right?

2381
01:19:29,727 --> 01:19:30,727
It's the piquant aroma of garlic.

2382
01:19:31,127 --> 01:19:33,157
I haven't had seasoned ribs in a while.

2383
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:34,357
You're right.

2384
01:19:34,497 --> 01:19:35,927
It's totally seasoned.

2385
01:19:36,027 --> 01:19:37,197
This is seasoned meat.

2386
01:19:37,297 --> 01:19:40,167
The seasoning is dripping from the meat.

2387
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:42,107
The sizzling sound is nice.

2388
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:44,507
Pork ribs need to be grilled well.

2389
01:19:44,807 --> 01:19:46,406
(He's another worrywart when it comes to food.)

2390
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,907
You should keep bothering the pork ribs.

2391
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:50,407
- They get burnt easily. - You should keep bothering them.

2392
01:19:50,547 --> 01:19:51,577
You should be diligent.

2393
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:53,717
You should keep flipping them.

2394
01:19:53,977 --> 01:19:56,387
That way, they get cooked to perfection.

2395
01:19:57,487 --> 01:20:00,117
Even the meat next to the bone is scored.

2396
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,226
- It'll be easier to eat it. - It'll come off right away.

2397
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:03,227
Right away.

2398
01:20:04,227 --> 01:20:05,257
That's a delicate touch.

2399
01:20:05,527 --> 01:20:07,097
All successful restaurants have a reason.

2400
01:20:07,697 --> 01:20:08,697
They really do.

2401
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:10,827
All right.

2402
01:20:10,828 --> 01:20:11,867
(They cook salt-grilled pork at the same time.)

2403
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:14,966
This meat looks high-quality.

2404
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:16,407
It looks high-quality.

2405
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,567
- This meat is nice. - It's like a pork steak.

2406
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,107
It's glossy.

2407
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:23,746
How is the salt-grilled pork so big and thick?

2408
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:25,516
- I don't know. - I've never had it so thick.

2409
01:20:25,517 --> 01:20:26,977
It's high-quality meat.

2410
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:29,146
- Flip it. - Seasoned ribs.

2411
01:20:29,147 --> 01:20:31,086
- It should be like this. - You should flip it once...

2412
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:32,817
when the other side is completely cooked.

2413
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,517
- Well done. - It should be like this.

2414
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:37,226
- This is incredible. - It'll be amazing with salt.

2415
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:38,287
It's like a pork shoulder steak.

2416
01:20:38,827 --> 01:20:39,956
It's getting smoky already.

2417
01:20:39,957 --> 01:20:41,556
(Grimacing)

2418
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:43,267
There's so much smoke.

2419
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:47,137
No way. The temperature keeps rising.

2420
01:20:48,097 --> 01:20:49,237
It's 31°C.

2421
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,907
But our passion for meat is hotter.

2422
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:53,836
This is the taste.

2423
01:20:53,837 --> 01:20:55,406
That's right. This is the taste.

2424
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:56,606
When you eat at a place like this,

2425
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:58,107
- your clothes should smell smoky. - That's right.

2426
01:20:58,307 --> 01:21:00,746
You get on the subway with the perfume of pork ribs.

2427
01:21:00,747 --> 01:21:02,847
(The smoke, heat, and smell add to the romance.)

2428
01:21:03,117 --> 01:21:06,886
(The seasoned ribs and salt-grilled pork...)

2429
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:10,627
(get cooked to perfection.)

2430
01:21:10,927 --> 01:21:12,957
- CEO. - Please say a few words.

2431
01:21:13,127 --> 01:21:14,157
All right.

2432
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:17,227
We don't know when it'll be the last for us.

2433
01:21:18,297 --> 01:21:20,596
- You always mention this. - Let's fight until the end.

2434
01:21:20,597 --> 01:21:22,966
- It isn't over until it's over. - You're right.

2435
01:21:22,967 --> 01:21:24,107
This is the zombie show.

2436
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:26,576
Handsome Guys has a subtitle.

2437
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:27,777
- "Go Until the End." - "Go Until the End."

2438
01:21:28,507 --> 01:21:29,906
This is something that we only know.

2439
01:21:29,907 --> 01:21:30,946
- All right. "Let's go!" - "Let's go!"

2440
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:32,316
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2441
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:33,547
Thank you.

2442
01:21:34,217 --> 01:21:35,447
It's going to be really cold.

2443
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:45,187
Hurry up and start with this as this is ready.

2444
01:21:46,927 --> 01:21:49,397
(He takes a bite of the first piece of pork ribs.)

2445
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:51,367
(Shouting)

2446
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:52,467
Is it good?

2447
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:54,467
(Astonished)

2448
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:58,167
This can be eaten with three bowls of rice.

2449
01:21:58,507 --> 01:22:01,407
The sauce goes, "I'm the sauce!"

2450
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:03,246
- Right. - It says this inside your mouth.

2451
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:04,807
Right. That's what it's like.

2452
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,187
It tastes a lot stronger than I thought.

2453
01:22:09,387 --> 01:22:10,416
- Right. - Right?

2454
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:11,916
- The sauce tastes strong. - "I'm the sauce!"

2455
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:13,957
- This is what it's saying. - Gosh, it's strong.

2456
01:22:14,357 --> 01:22:17,627
It feels new. This is what the sauce should be like.

2457
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:20,926
- Dong Hyun. - Give it a try.

2458
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:22,667
- Right. - Start with the seasoned ribs.

2459
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:29,766
(Impressed)

2460
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:30,867
Gosh, this looks delicious.

2461
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:32,706
It's the part with the fat.

2462
01:22:32,707 --> 01:22:33,936
(Smelling)

2463
01:22:33,937 --> 01:22:35,807
- You just tried it as is. - Right.

2464
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:38,806
This can be eaten with three bowls of rice.

2465
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:39,846
It's good.

2466
01:22:39,847 --> 01:22:42,017
(This is it.)

2467
01:22:42,387 --> 01:22:44,847
- You just tried it as is. - Right.

2468
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:47,486
This can be eaten with three bowls of rice.

2469
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:48,617
Gosh, it's good.

2470
01:22:49,087 --> 01:22:50,787
Look at how there are cuts.

2471
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:52,186
You can eat that now.

2472
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:53,556
It's grilled just like this when it's placed on the grill.

2473
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:54,627
Go ahead.

2474
01:22:54,897 --> 01:22:58,227
(Biting)

2475
01:23:01,137 --> 01:23:02,637
The pig really gives us its all.

2476
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:07,477
(He's chewing on the rib with his all.)

2477
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:12,517
(Tearing until the last bite)

2478
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:16,147
The meat on the bone is soft and chewy.

2479
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:17,817
Soft and chewy.

2480
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:19,317
Gosh, look at its thickness.

2481
01:23:20,087 --> 01:23:21,956
- The salt-grilled pork is here. - I'll pass some over there.

2482
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:24,456
- Cook it a bit more over there. - Just slightly.

2483
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:25,587
- Right. - Here.

2484
01:23:26,457 --> 01:23:29,067
- Grill it just a bit more. - I think it's ready now.

2485
01:23:29,697 --> 01:23:34,637
(Putting in their mouths as they can't wait)

2486
01:23:37,707 --> 01:23:39,676
Sir, can we eat this now or do we have to wait a bit more?

2487
01:23:39,677 --> 01:23:41,236
- You can eat it. - You can eat it.

2488
01:23:41,237 --> 01:23:42,976
(You can totally eat it.)

2489
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,076
- The meat... - You can eat it.

2490
01:23:44,077 --> 01:23:45,647
- is completely amazing. - What is this dipped into?

2491
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,047
Can we really eat this?

2492
01:23:47,947 --> 01:23:50,217
- It's good! - Gosh, the salt-grilled pork!

2493
01:23:50,747 --> 01:23:52,657
- Gosh, the salt-grilled pork! - Is the salt-grilled pork good?

2494
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:55,216
- The salt-grilled pork is good! - It was grilled really well.

2495
01:23:55,217 --> 01:23:56,887
- Was it grilled well? - It was grilled well!

2496
01:23:57,927 --> 01:24:00,127
- Gosh! - That would've been bad.

2497
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,827
(Groaning)

2498
01:24:03,297 --> 01:24:04,396
It's really good.

2499
01:24:04,397 --> 01:24:05,796
(Falling for the salt-grilled pork right away)

2500
01:24:05,797 --> 01:24:07,167
It's crunchy on the outside.

2501
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,867
It's crunchy on the outside, but it holds the juice inside...

2502
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:11,107
as it's thick.

2503
01:24:11,507 --> 01:24:13,636
It really feels like pork belly.

2504
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:15,776
But the meat was cut nicely.

2505
01:24:15,777 --> 01:24:17,876
- It was cut really nicely. - Right.

2506
01:24:17,877 --> 01:24:19,516
It doesn't feel tough.

2507
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:20,947
This is what I do.

2508
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:23,246
You see the grain of the meat, right?

2509
01:24:23,247 --> 01:24:27,557
There's the fat grain in the middle between the flesh and fat.

2510
01:24:27,717 --> 01:24:30,227
That part is usually cut, but I don't cut it like that.

2511
01:24:30,457 --> 01:24:32,126
I cut it the other way around,

2512
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:34,597
so that the fat grain comes to the middle.

2513
01:24:34,827 --> 01:24:37,697
I cut it so that it has a good balance of the flesh and fat.

2514
01:24:40,697 --> 01:24:42,297
- They were placed perfectly. - It's a good balance.

2515
01:24:42,437 --> 01:24:43,866
It's easier to cut off the fat,

2516
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:44,906
but that means you have to eat the dry meat separately.

2517
01:24:44,907 --> 01:24:45,907
Look at this.

2518
01:24:46,137 --> 01:24:47,506
It doesn't feel dry...

2519
01:24:47,507 --> 01:24:49,477
and it's moist with the oil.

2520
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:52,547
The bibim sauce is really good.

2521
01:24:55,577 --> 01:24:58,147
(Sang Uk has fallen for the red sauce's charms.)

2522
01:24:59,317 --> 01:25:00,856
The red sauce is really good.

2523
01:25:00,857 --> 01:25:03,227
(The kick for the salt-grilled pork, red sauce)

2524
01:25:03,287 --> 01:25:04,386
What is this red sauce called?

2525
01:25:04,387 --> 01:25:06,197
The red sauce feels a bit like this.

2526
01:25:07,157 --> 01:25:08,996
It's like the sauce for bibim naengmyeon.

2527
01:25:08,997 --> 01:25:10,427
- It's good. - Right.

2528
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:12,736
(Perfect comparison)

2529
01:25:12,737 --> 01:25:15,137
It mixes up with the oil.

2530
01:25:15,437 --> 01:25:17,206
It puts together a really good taste.

2531
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:18,606
It whets your appetite...

2532
01:25:18,607 --> 01:25:19,736
as the sauce seeps in.

2533
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:20,837
You don't get sick of the meat because of it.

2534
01:25:21,007 --> 01:25:22,977
If you have the meat with this sauce,

2535
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:26,646
you are bound to eat around 1.5 times more than what you eat.

2536
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:28,816
- Right. - It gets rid of the greasiness.

2537
01:25:28,817 --> 01:25:30,387
The sauce doesn't feel strong either.

2538
01:25:30,747 --> 01:25:32,857
It disappears after hitting you with its taste.

2539
01:25:32,957 --> 01:25:34,216
With the speed of us eating...

2540
01:25:34,217 --> 01:25:35,886
and how big we are, we're like some sort of service company.

2541
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:37,986
(It's like a service company team dinner.)

2542
01:25:37,987 --> 01:25:40,457
When you come here after feeling upset about your company,

2543
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:43,697
it's a great place to cry in secret...

2544
01:25:43,897 --> 01:25:45,836
with the smoke from the grill.

2545
01:25:45,837 --> 01:25:47,396
(It's a good place to cry in secret with the grill of the smoke.)

2546
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:48,796
This place has great vibes.

2547
01:25:48,797 --> 01:25:49,967
You can use the smoke as an excuse.

2548
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:51,267
It's great here.

2549
01:25:51,407 --> 01:25:53,407
It's a great place to come after getting fired.

2550
01:25:55,037 --> 01:25:56,546
(Getting emotional)

2551
01:25:56,547 --> 01:25:58,277
It's hard to tell if you're shedding tears...

2552
01:25:58,807 --> 01:26:00,177
because of the smoke or your sadness.

2553
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:01,676
Have you ever cried because you felt upset?

2554
01:26:01,677 --> 01:26:03,146
- I've never done that. - No?

2555
01:26:03,147 --> 01:26:05,717
I barely cry. I'm usually positive.

2556
01:26:05,887 --> 01:26:06,956
- I've never done that either. - Really?

2557
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:08,586
As for me,

2558
01:26:08,587 --> 01:26:10,486
I tend to forget everything that happened that day...

2559
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:12,496
after going to bed.

2560
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,157
Gosh, you have great mental health.

2561
01:26:14,557 --> 01:26:16,296
I'm extreme when it comes to feeling up and down emotionally.

2562
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:17,626
(Extreme when it comes to feeling up and down emotionally)

2563
01:26:17,627 --> 01:26:19,636
I cry right away...

2564
01:26:19,637 --> 01:26:21,997
when I don't get good results.

2565
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:25,537
I feel so much joy when things go well.

2566
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:27,406
But this is what I'm like.

2567
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:29,246
I feel just at that moment when things don't go well...

2568
01:26:29,247 --> 01:26:31,076
and end it there.

2569
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:32,747
- You don't hold grudges. - What else can I do?

2570
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:34,217
There's nothing I can do about it.

2571
01:26:35,377 --> 01:26:36,787
- You just let it out. - Right.

2572
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:39,987
I went shopping right after a fight.

2573
01:26:40,757 --> 01:26:42,456
Even after getting knocked down and losing.

2574
01:26:42,457 --> 01:26:43,687
- When your face is all swollen? - Right.

2575
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:46,056
I hate it the most when the staff members around me...

2576
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:47,057
feel depressed because of me.

2577
01:26:47,058 --> 01:26:49,497
- Right. - I feel terrible when that happens.

2578
01:26:49,967 --> 01:26:52,667
I just went shopping and spent a good time as it was over anyway.

2579
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:54,136
Right. It was over anyway.

2580
01:26:54,137 --> 01:26:56,667
I lost because the opponent was better.

2581
01:26:57,107 --> 01:26:59,036
We have to react accordingly with our jobs.

2582
01:26:59,037 --> 01:27:00,707
We can't be piling up things inside our hearts.

2583
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:02,677
The naengmyeon is here.

2584
01:27:03,207 --> 01:27:04,506
Gosh, it looks really cold!

2585
01:27:04,507 --> 01:27:05,807
- What is this? - Thank you.

2586
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:07,576
- Gosh, this is amazing. - What is this?

2587
01:27:07,577 --> 01:27:08,616
What is this?

2588
01:27:08,617 --> 01:27:10,686
Hold on. This is the pho.

2589
01:27:10,687 --> 01:27:12,716
- How is this pho? - Since the weather is hot,

2590
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:14,986
the cold steam is coming up.

2591
01:27:14,987 --> 01:27:16,787
Who would think that this is pho?

2592
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:19,057
I have to try this out of curiosity.

2593
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:20,556
The noodles are a bit dark.

2594
01:27:20,557 --> 01:27:22,357
- Right. - Just like buckwheat noodles.

2595
01:27:23,427 --> 01:27:25,296
But they aren't buckwheat noodles.

2596
01:27:25,297 --> 01:27:26,566
- They are black rice noodles. - Black rice.

2597
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:28,836
These are rice noodles.

2598
01:27:28,837 --> 01:27:30,206
- This is fascinating. - You're right.

2599
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:31,937
- You're right. - The noodles are flat.

2600
01:27:32,137 --> 01:27:34,307
Let's try wrapping the meat with the noodles first.

2601
01:27:34,837 --> 01:27:37,077
I love wrapping the meat like this.

2602
01:27:38,877 --> 01:27:40,617
Does anyone need a bowl?

2603
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:43,087
- Would you like one? - Sure.

2604
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:44,747
Right.

2605
01:27:50,757 --> 01:27:53,096
I'm not sure if it's just me or because it's cold,

2606
01:27:53,097 --> 01:27:55,596
it feels a lot chewier than regular pho.

2607
01:27:55,597 --> 01:27:56,896
- Right. - Right.

2608
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:57,996
You're right.

2609
01:27:57,997 --> 01:28:00,267
It's somewhere between naengmyeon and pho.

2610
01:28:01,437 --> 01:28:03,237
It would taste amazing with the seasoned ribs.

2611
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:06,706
(CEO Cha slurps the noodles too.)

2612
01:28:06,707 --> 01:28:08,477
Does anyone need a bowl?

2613
01:28:09,137 --> 01:28:10,707
- Would you like one? - Sure.

2614
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:14,147
(What?)

2615
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:16,217
(Impressed)

2616
01:28:17,117 --> 01:28:18,186
You should try this quickly.

2617
01:28:18,187 --> 01:28:22,387
(A shower of thumbs-up in silence)

2618
01:28:23,057 --> 01:28:25,187
- Dong Hyun. - Oh, right. I'll take it.

2619
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:27,296
- Have them together. - The broth is regular naengmyeon,

2620
01:28:27,297 --> 01:28:29,596
but it's a lot better with these noodles.

2621
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,527
Gosh, the noodles make this much of a difference.

2622
01:28:32,837 --> 01:28:34,567
I'm having the noodles with the well-cooked meat.

2623
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:45,106
I like this better than naengmyeon.

2624
01:28:45,107 --> 01:28:46,246
- The noodles are cut more easily. - Same here.

2625
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:48,276
Right. There are times when naengmyeon noodles are too tough.

2626
01:28:48,277 --> 01:28:50,217
- These feel easier to digest. - Right.

2627
01:28:50,887 --> 01:28:52,147
These noodles are easier to eat.

2628
01:28:54,657 --> 01:28:56,286
I prefer this to regular pho.

2629
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:57,887
(A refreshing taste that chills up your bones)

2630
01:28:58,427 --> 01:29:00,426
- As expected. - Different noodles...

2631
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:02,226
make this much of a difference.

2632
01:29:02,227 --> 01:29:04,597
The kick is important, isn't it?

2633
01:29:05,727 --> 01:29:06,997
A small change makes a massive difference.

2634
01:29:08,597 --> 01:29:11,937
Gosh, new dishes keep popping out endlessly.

2635
01:29:12,777 --> 01:29:14,107
One must always be humble.

2636
01:29:14,537 --> 01:29:16,677
Gosh, this is a true delicacy.

2637
01:29:17,147 --> 01:29:19,577
I didn't expect anything special with pork ribs.

2638
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:21,276
- But... - I was proved wrong though.

2639
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:22,917
We were all surprised.

2640
01:29:23,017 --> 01:29:24,547
- This is so good. - It's surprising.

2641
01:29:25,087 --> 01:29:27,087
- I'm afraid to order another dish. - It's amazing.

2642
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:28,486
It's going to be delicious again.

2643
01:29:28,487 --> 01:29:30,687
Could we ask for the bill, please?

2644
01:29:31,257 --> 01:29:32,757
- Sir. - Please.

2645
01:29:33,227 --> 01:29:34,497
- How much is it? - Today,

2646
01:29:35,327 --> 01:29:37,496
- lunch was the most expensive. - It must be over 200 dollars.

2647
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,596
I don't think it will be over 300 dollars.

2648
01:29:38,597 --> 01:29:39,696
Lunch was the most expensive?

2649
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:41,737
You paid the most for lunch.

2650
01:29:41,797 --> 01:29:43,906
(Lunch was more expensive than a dinner for 6.)

2651
01:29:43,907 --> 01:29:45,637
I hope we can beat them today.

2652
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:47,937
We never won against them, right?

2653
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:50,907
Why couldn't we make it even with three attempts?

2654
01:29:51,307 --> 01:29:55,346
I'm planning to make an offer that all of you will like.

2655
01:29:55,347 --> 01:29:57,117
- An offer? - Please!

2656
01:29:57,847 --> 01:30:00,086
- You get three attempts, right? - Right.

2657
01:30:00,087 --> 01:30:01,186
(Three attempts are given for the dinner mission.)

2658
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:05,287
If you make it in the first attempt,

2659
01:30:05,627 --> 01:30:08,627
including the bill for dinner being cleared,

2660
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:12,997
the card payments for two places...

2661
01:30:13,437 --> 01:30:15,397
visited during the day...

2662
01:30:16,507 --> 01:30:18,836
- will be canceled. - Please!

2663
01:30:18,837 --> 01:30:20,076
(Including the bill for dinner being cleared, )

2664
01:30:20,077 --> 01:30:21,336
(the card payments for 2 places will be canceled.)

2665
01:30:21,337 --> 01:30:23,377
Let's make it happen! I'm begging you!

2666
01:30:24,707 --> 01:30:26,416
I don't even work under a CEO.

2667
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:28,046
- All right. - I don't even work under a CEO.

2668
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:29,076
Hold on.

2669
01:30:29,077 --> 01:30:30,917
Does that include the dessert place?

2670
01:30:31,087 --> 01:30:32,286
- You can decide. - We can decide.

2671
01:30:32,287 --> 01:30:34,457
- Two places out of three. - I see.

2672
01:30:34,717 --> 01:30:36,486
If we make it in 1 attempt out of 3,

2673
01:30:36,487 --> 01:30:37,656
the card payments for two places will be canceled.

2674
01:30:37,657 --> 01:30:39,327
If we make it in 2 attempts out of 3, it'll be 1 place.

2675
01:30:39,427 --> 01:30:40,427
If you make it on the third attempt...
Just dinner will be paid for.

2676
01:30:41,428 --> 01:30:42,627
- Just for this place. - Just for this place.

2677
01:30:42,967 --> 01:30:44,766
- That's nice. - Let's include Seung Hwan first.

2678
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:46,496
- No matter what. - Right.

2679
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:48,237
- This is such a good show. - Just for this place.

2680
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:50,807
- But you guys never made it. - Right.

2681
01:30:52,977 --> 01:30:54,476
- Even so, - We can make it this time.

2682
01:30:54,477 --> 01:30:56,006
- this is a really good opportunity. - Let's make it happen.

2683
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:57,806
We've never had card payments canceled before.

2684
01:30:57,807 --> 01:30:58,846
- Right. - Right.

2685
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:00,276
Let's do our best for Seung Hwan.

2686
01:31:00,277 --> 01:31:01,816
- Please. - Right.

2687
01:31:01,817 --> 01:31:02,986
- Please help me out. - Okay.

2688
01:31:02,987 --> 01:31:04,616
- Let's do a cheer. - All right.

2689
01:31:04,617 --> 01:31:05,886
This has never happened before.

2690
01:31:05,887 --> 01:31:07,456
Out of all the games we played,

2691
01:31:07,457 --> 01:31:09,116
there never was a time when payments were canceled.

2692
01:31:09,117 --> 01:31:10,156
Card payment canceled.

2693
01:31:10,157 --> 01:31:11,987
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2694
01:31:12,227 --> 01:31:13,227
Gosh, I feel so nervous.

2695
01:31:13,228 --> 01:31:15,027
I feel so nervous. How many do I have to think of?

2696
01:31:15,827 --> 01:31:17,527
- All right. - This is hard.

2697
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:19,897
- Let's go! - The first attempt.

2698
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:23,366
Names of African countries.

2699
01:31:23,367 --> 01:31:25,506
- Names of African countries? - Africa?

2700
01:31:25,507 --> 01:31:26,906
One, two, three.

2701
01:31:26,907 --> 01:31:28,976
- Cameroon. - One, two, three.

2702
01:31:28,977 --> 01:31:30,746
- Rwanda. - One, two, three.

2703
01:31:30,747 --> 01:31:32,476
- Uganda. - One, two, three.

2704
01:31:32,477 --> 01:31:34,246
- Nigeria. - One, two, three.

2705
01:31:34,247 --> 01:31:36,186
- Senegal. - One, two, three.

2706
01:31:36,187 --> 01:31:37,246
Kenya.

2707
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:39,687
(They reach the halfway point in a flash!)

2708
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:42,317
Is Egypt right?

2709
01:31:43,057 --> 01:31:44,086
One, two, three.

2710
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:45,857
Jamaica.

2711
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:47,456
- Incorrect! - Gosh!

2712
01:31:47,457 --> 01:31:48,496
- Why? - Why?

2713
01:31:48,497 --> 01:31:49,697
- Is it in South America? - South America.

2714
01:31:49,827 --> 01:31:51,397
- Isn't Jamaica one? - Jamaica!

2715
01:31:51,597 --> 01:31:53,437
You were on so many plane rides. Jamaica!

2716
01:31:53,567 --> 01:31:54,796
- Jamaica... - No?

2717
01:31:54,797 --> 01:31:55,837
Is in Central America.

2718
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,166
Central America?

2719
01:31:57,167 --> 01:31:59,267
There's another guy that doesn't know Central America.

2720
01:31:59,367 --> 01:32:01,007
It's next to Cuba and below the US.

2721
01:32:01,837 --> 01:32:02,976
(That was close.)

2722
01:32:02,977 --> 01:32:04,607
There are so many African countries.

2723
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:06,817
- What were you going to say? - Sudan.

2724
01:32:07,377 --> 01:32:08,746
- Sudan? - Congo.

2725
01:32:08,747 --> 01:32:09,816
- Congo. - Congo. What about you?

2726
01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:10,946
I was going to say South Africa.

2727
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:13,717
Gosh, we were going to make it!

2728
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:15,087
Jamaica!

2729
01:32:15,217 --> 01:32:17,356
- Wasn't Jamaica an African country? - Gosh.

2730
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:18,656
I was confused with Jamaica too.

2731
01:32:18,657 --> 01:32:20,456
- Me too. - There was that movie.

2732
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:22,157
- "Cool Runnings." - Right.

2733
01:32:22,257 --> 01:32:24,526
- I thought that movie... - Right.

2734
01:32:24,527 --> 01:32:26,096
Was based in Africa.

2735
01:32:26,097 --> 01:32:27,237
It felt that way.

2736
01:32:27,697 --> 01:32:28,836
Where is Brazil?

2737
01:32:28,837 --> 01:32:30,207
- South America. - South America.

2738
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:31,366
You were going to get it wrong anyway.

2739
01:32:31,367 --> 01:32:32,406
I was going to get it wrong anyway.

2740
01:32:32,407 --> 01:32:33,906
(I was going to get it wrong anyway.)

2741
01:32:33,907 --> 01:32:35,377
That spot is difficult.

2742
01:32:35,577 --> 01:32:36,776
- It is a difficult spot. - Would you like to switch spots?

2743
01:32:36,777 --> 01:32:37,906
- You should switch with Dong Hyun. - No.

2744
01:32:37,907 --> 01:32:38,946
I can't move.

2745
01:32:38,947 --> 01:32:40,546
- Gosh. - I like it here.

2746
01:32:40,547 --> 01:32:41,617
"I can't move."

2747
01:32:41,717 --> 01:32:44,216
- What about you? - It's your bill anyway.

2748
01:32:44,217 --> 01:32:45,217
Okay!

2749
01:32:45,218 --> 01:32:46,556
It's my grave anyway.

2750
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:47,557
He's good. We're the ones that are bad.
- I got a good spot. - We can do this.

2751
01:32:48,558 --> 01:32:49,887
- My gosh. - We're too bad at this.

2752
01:32:50,087 --> 01:32:51,526
(Nervous to the max)

2753
01:32:51,527 --> 01:32:52,756
This is so intense!

2754
01:32:52,757 --> 01:32:54,696
Hey, Tae Hyun!

2755
01:32:54,697 --> 01:32:55,796
Hey!

2756
01:32:55,797 --> 01:32:57,296
Why feel so intimidated...

2757
01:32:57,297 --> 01:32:59,667
by a game like this? Gosh.

2758
01:32:59,697 --> 01:33:00,896
- I feel so nervous. - Hey.

2759
01:33:00,897 --> 01:33:02,496
- Just say the answer right away. - But...

2760
01:33:02,497 --> 01:33:04,436
I think his counting is getting faster each time.

2761
01:33:04,437 --> 01:33:06,207
Right. It's too fast.

2762
01:33:06,237 --> 01:33:07,377
- That's just what you think. - Just...

2763
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:08,476
- easily say the answer. - "That's just what you think."

2764
01:33:08,477 --> 01:33:10,577
We are the ones that are feeling chased.

2765
01:33:10,747 --> 01:33:11,776
If we make it this time,

2766
01:33:11,777 --> 01:33:13,216
- we can cancel one payment. - We should cancel Seung Hwan's.

2767
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:14,716
- Okay. - Please.

2768
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:16,077
- Let's get that one canceled. - Let's go for it.

2769
01:33:16,247 --> 01:33:17,247
- All right. - All right.
Erase African countries from your heads.

2770
01:33:18,248 --> 01:33:19,586
- All right. "Payment canceled." - One, two, three.

2771
01:33:19,587 --> 01:33:20,816
- Payment canceled! - Payment canceled!

2772
01:33:20,817 --> 01:33:21,957
- Let's go. - All right.

2773
01:33:22,157 --> 01:33:23,187
Please!

2774
01:33:23,587 --> 01:33:25,456
Come on, Tae Hyun. Feel comfortable.

2775
01:33:25,457 --> 01:33:27,027
Feel comfortable about this.

2776
01:33:27,257 --> 01:33:28,526
- Just easily say the answers. - All right.

2777
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:30,167
We still have a chance to get a payment canceled. Let's go.

2778
01:33:30,427 --> 01:33:31,866
(Sighing)

2779
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:33,537
- Here's the topic. - Easily.

2780
01:33:34,197 --> 01:33:35,437
Names of flowers.

2781
01:33:36,137 --> 01:33:37,937
- What? - Flowers.

2782
01:33:38,207 --> 01:33:39,937
Don't get mixed up with names of trees.

2783
01:33:40,277 --> 01:33:41,936
One, two, three.

2784
01:33:41,937 --> 01:33:44,306

01:33:44,307 --> 01:33:46,516

One, two, three.

2791
01:33:56,117 --> 01:33:57,986
Cotton flower.

2792
01:33:57,987 --> 01:33:59,486
One, two, three.

2793
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:01,826
- Baby's breath. - One, two, three.

2794
01:34:01,827 --> 01:34:02,926

01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:04,526
- Gosh! - One, two, three.

2796
01:34:04,527 --> 01:34:05,996
- Pasqueflower. - Gosh!

2797
01:34:05,997 --> 01:34:08,596
(Dong Hyun is the only one left!)

2798
01:34:08,597 --> 01:34:10,736
- Gosh! - One, two, three.

2799
01:34:10,737 --> 01:34:11,767
Rape flower.

2800
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:13,406
Rape flower.

2801
01:34:13,407 --> 01:34:14,436
I think this could be controversial.

2802
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:15,437
Why?

2803
01:34:16,407 --> 01:34:17,847
- It should be called rapeseed. - He got it right!

2804
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:19,777
- Rape flower. - He's right, isn't he?

2805
01:34:19,847 --> 01:34:21,416
- They both mean the same thing. - Right.

2806
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:23,347
- Rapeseed or rape flower. - Right.

2807
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:25,147
- Here's the evaluation. - What?

2808
01:34:25,687 --> 01:34:26,817
Our evaluation...

2809
01:34:28,217 --> 01:34:29,286
is that it's correct.

2810
01:34:29,287 --> 01:34:34,357
(They make it in Round 2.)

2811
01:34:36,367 --> 01:34:38,566
- Thank you! - We did it.

2812
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:39,697
We did it!

2813
01:34:39,767 --> 01:34:41,067
We did it!

2814
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:42,196
Seung Hwan!

2815
01:34:42,197 --> 01:34:43,506
Gosh, congratulations!

2816
01:34:43,507 --> 01:34:45,267
- Gosh. - He paid 400 dollars for lunch.

2817
01:34:45,367 --> 01:34:46,806
You could've just said rapeseed.

2818
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:47,936
Why say rape flower?

2819
01:34:47,937 --> 01:34:49,846
What has gotten into you all of a sudden?

2820
01:34:49,847 --> 01:34:51,506
I was going to say that, but...

2821
01:34:51,507 --> 01:34:52,707
Okay.

2822
01:34:52,777 --> 01:34:54,316
- Gosh. - That was the first time.

2823
01:34:54,317 --> 01:34:55,516
For the first time,

2824
01:34:55,517 --> 01:34:57,946
they will pay for our dinner...

2825
01:34:57,947 --> 01:35:00,086
and Seung Hwan's payment will be canceled.

2826
01:35:00,087 --> 01:35:01,356
(First win against the crew and Seung Hwan's payment canceled)

2827
01:35:01,357 --> 01:35:02,457
Hold on.

2828
01:35:02,557 --> 01:35:04,227
Shouldn't the three of us play rock-paper-scissors?

2829
01:35:04,987 --> 01:35:07,326
(Lunch 1 payer, lunch 2 payer, dessert payer)

2830
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:08,797
Hold on.

2831
01:35:09,197 --> 01:35:10,297
- Gosh. - I see.

2832
01:35:10,467 --> 01:35:12,326
We haven't decided on which payment was going to be canceled.

2833
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:13,366
Right.

2834
01:35:13,367 --> 01:35:15,397
We already talked about it before playing!

2835
01:35:15,697 --> 01:35:17,106
That was when two payments were going to be canceled.

2836
01:35:17,107 --> 01:35:18,667
We were going to cancel yours and play rock-paper-scissors.

2837
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:20,637
But it's only one payment canceled.

2838
01:35:21,477 --> 01:35:23,706
- No. We were just joking. - Right.

2839
01:35:23,707 --> 01:35:25,006
Will we cancel Seung Hwan's payment then?

2840
01:35:25,007 --> 01:35:26,106
- He paid the most. - Right.

2841
01:35:26,107 --> 01:35:27,146
- Thank you. - It's much more expensive.

2842
01:35:27,147 --> 01:35:28,147
Right.

2843
01:35:29,217 --> 01:35:30,846
- This is the first time. - Well,

2844
01:35:30,847 --> 01:35:33,156
I want to know how it was for you.

2845
01:35:33,157 --> 01:35:35,857
After getting the payment secured,

2846
01:35:36,117 --> 01:35:37,186
I got it canceled.

2847
01:35:37,187 --> 01:35:38,357
That really...

2848
01:35:38,757 --> 01:35:40,656
multiplied the joy.

2849
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:41,726
- Of course. - Right.

2850
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:43,026
My gosh.

2851
01:35:43,027 --> 01:35:45,167
We all felt like fellow soldiers at a boot camp.

2852
01:35:45,527 --> 01:35:47,036
- Right. - It feels great...

2853
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:48,196
- to end with this feeling. - Right.

2854
01:35:48,197 --> 01:35:49,806
- That's how it felt. - We were like college schoolmates.

2855
01:35:49,807 --> 01:35:51,106
- Right. - It felt like a retreat.

2856
01:35:51,107 --> 01:35:52,837
- We're all looking at each other. - Right.

2857
01:35:52,867 --> 01:35:54,877
We can see that everyone is full of dopamine.

2858
01:35:55,407 --> 01:35:56,576
I got a great burst of dopamine...

2859
01:35:56,577 --> 01:35:58,177
- at the end. - Right.

2860
01:35:58,347 --> 01:35:59,916
- I had a really great time. - Thank you!

2861
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:01,746
- Thank you! - We won!

2862
01:36:01,747 --> 01:36:03,386
- We won! - I had a great time.

2863
01:36:03,387 --> 01:36:04,747
(We felt happy thanks to you.)

2864
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:06,587
It feels nice to win.

2865
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:09,016
- Gosh, I had a lot of fun. - Thank you.

2866
01:36:09,017 --> 01:36:10,786
Let's hit the slate. Please focus on Dong Hyun.

2867
01:36:10,787 --> 01:36:11,827
One, two, three.

2868
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:14,856
Yes!

2869
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:15,897
Let's go!

2870
01:36:16,097 --> 01:36:17,267
Let's go!

2871
01:36:18,597 --> 01:36:20,597
It feels even more exciting to come now than before.

2872
01:36:21,537 --> 01:36:23,337
It's more exciting than coming here to eat. Hello.

2873
01:36:23,767 --> 01:36:25,967
We ate earlier...

2874
01:36:26,807 --> 01:36:28,976
- and I want to cancel the payment. - Cancel the payment?

2875
01:36:28,977 --> 01:36:30,207
- Yes. - Please pass it to me.

2876
01:36:30,377 --> 01:36:32,846
And it will be paid for again with this card.

2877
01:36:32,847 --> 01:36:34,316
(Seung Hwan's card payment of 336 dollars gets canceled.)

2878
01:36:34,317 --> 01:36:35,976
Handsome Guys is the best.

2879
01:36:35,977 --> 01:36:38,516
(Paying with the card of the production crew)

2880
01:36:38,517 --> 01:36:39,716
- Here you are. - Right.

2881
01:36:39,717 --> 01:36:40,886
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2882
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:42,817
Thank you. I'll come again.

2883
01:36:45,157 --> 01:36:46,327
Thank you, sir.

2884
01:36:46,527 --> 01:36:47,597
- Thank you for being with us today. - Right.

2885
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:49,966
- I'll be off now. - Right.

2886
01:36:49,967 --> 01:36:50,997
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

2887
01:36:53,097 --> 01:36:54,497
Gosh, this feels great.

2888
01:36:57,916 --> 01:37:00,116
(Today's Menu Recommendation, Bundang)

2889
01:37:00,256 --> 01:37:02,115

2890
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:04,885
(The center of cutting-edge technology)

2891
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:10,195
(Two talents have come to Handsome Guys)

2892
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:11,665
(Variety show intern, Ryu Kyung Soo)

2893
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,126
(The chief of unofficial dishes)

2894
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:15,835
(They know how to eat...)

2895
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:18,705
(and are proud about their tastes.)

2896
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:21,475
(Menu recommendations chosen by office workers)

2897
01:37:21,476 --> 01:37:25,005
(Amazing restaurants are lined up in Bundang for Handsome Guys.)

2898
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:28,375
(Chief Poong feels relaxed...)

2899
01:37:28,376 --> 01:37:31,686
(and Intern Kyung Soo is just innocent.)

2900
01:37:31,816 --> 01:37:32,886
Is this the butter?

2901
01:37:34,156 --> 01:37:38,326
(Intern Ryu keeps catching Chief Poong's attention.)

2902
01:37:38,426 --> 01:37:40,626
(You look really good-looking when you eat.)

2903
01:37:40,756 --> 01:37:42,055
(Intern Ryu and Chief Poong...)

2904
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:46,596
(keep getting closer.)

2905
01:37:47,436 --> 01:37:49,835
(Share the chicken leg out of love)

2906
01:37:49,836 --> 01:37:51,036
(No. Just take a look.)

2907
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,806
(Chief Poong gets betrayed by the one he trusted.)

2908
01:37:56,306 --> 01:37:58,076
(The intern goes wild after getting adjusted.)

2909
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:02,245
