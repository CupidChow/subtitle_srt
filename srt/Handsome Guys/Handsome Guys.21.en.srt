Where is Sang Uk?

18
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,673
He's not here today.

19
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,403
We've been here for a long time.

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,573
Aren't you being too indifferent?

21
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:12,843
No, but Sang Uk...

22
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:13,873
Are you that self-centered?

23
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,643
Sang Uk won't be here for the next two weeks.

24
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:16,773
- This and next week? - Yes.

25
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,213
- Doesn't he have matches? - Right...

26
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,213
Why are you pretending to know all of a sudden...

27
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,953
- when you didn't? - Right.

28
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:24,183
- It's because Sang Uk is missing. - You should be more interested.

29
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,184
Be more interested?

30
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,923
Some people remember things differently.

31
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:27,924
- Okay. - Anyway,

32
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,823
- Sang Uk is at his primary job. - Right.

33
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,794
- There are four of us today. - Right.

34
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:33,564
Who will be replacing Sang Uk today?

35

36
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,534
- He's the perfect man for this. - He's perfect.

37
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,364
He's been on Handsome Guys before.

38
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:43,073
Our show has a high retention rate...

39
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:44,533
- of guests. - Yes, it's high.

40
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:46,944
When it comes to paying for food,

41
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,874
he's generous.

42
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:50,214
He's quite well-off.

43
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:52,014

Hello, it's nice to see you. I'm Rhymer.

58
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:33,254
It's good to see you too.

59
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:36,454
It was sad to see you on the show so briefly last time.

60
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,954
For me, it felt very long.

61
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,864
- Right. - Normally, it was brief...

62
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,763
I appeared on the show longer than I thought.

63
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,963
He dominated the screen time.

64
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,103

65
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:46,303
Even my parents said...

66
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,503
that I was on the screen longer than Kim Woo Bin.

67
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,643
- Right. - They were very happy about it,

68
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,773
so I felt thankful.

69
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,444
As you know, the direction of our show has changed.

70
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,313
- Do you like to eat? - I love it.

71
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,713
I know so many tasty restaurants.

72
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,753
I also love cooking.

73
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,313
- That's right. - You're serious about it.

74
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,853
I'm very serious about food.

75
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:06,623
By the way, where are we today?

76

(both traditional and trendy restaurants.)

I lived in Bukgajwa-dong during my childhood.

- Isn't it nearby? - Yes.

89
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:45,124
I'm sure it hasn't changed since then. Isn't this...

90
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,863
- Right. - a very rich neighborhood?

In old dramas with Yeonhui-dong as the background,

92

- What's Yeontral Park? - He said that he's heard of it.

What's Yeontral Park?

105
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,253
- There's a place like that... - Isn't it very old?

106
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,653
- in Yeonnam-dong. - It's very popular.

107

but there's a restaurant where my parents frequent here.

126
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,304
- While you didn't know? - A tteokgalbi restaurant.

127

- What? - A tteokgalbi restaurant?

128
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,573
Tteokgalbi is incredible.

129
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:06,173
If your parents frequent there, it must be an old restaurant.

130

(Lunch Menu Recommendation 2: Tteokgalbi set menu)

You may not know this,

133
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,283
but a real tteokgalbi restaurant makes...

134
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:14,743
tteokgalbi from scratch.

135
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:16,553
- It's very delicious. - Of course they make tteokgalbi...

136
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:17,653
- from scratch. - I mean...

137
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:18,883
They don't buy it...

138
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,723
- They make tteokgalbi from scratch. - from somewhere else.

139
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:21,993
How else would they do it?

140
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:24,953
There's ready-to-eat tteokgalbi, which is frozen.

141
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:27,193
Are you saying that a restaurant that buys...

142
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,594
tteokgalbi from somewhere else...

143
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,764
isn't a real restaurant?

144
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,104
I can't say that exactly.

145
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:34,464
It's because they're busy.

146
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:36,233
These days, ready-to-eat tteokgalbi is also good.

147
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,103
- It's well-made. - Of course they make it.

148
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,273
It's well-made,

149
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:40,903
but the taste could be common.

150
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:44,373
You're saying that the restaurant serves tteokgalbi of a big brand.

151
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:47,344
That's my favorite. It's always at my house.

152
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:50,213
When the restaurant makes it from scratch, it tastes unique.

153
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,154

Chinese food for me, Rhymer, and Seung Ho.

177
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:32,393
- Okay. - It's 3 to 2.

178
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,864
Gosh, I love tteokgalbi.

179
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,163
- Let's get going. - Okay.

180
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,793
- Good. - Shall we walk to Yeonhui-dong?

181
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,304
- Yes. - Please go down this way.

182
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,503
You really don't know where we're going?

183
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,034
- None of us know. - We don't know.

184
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:46,704
It will be the first restaurant we enter.

185
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,614
I'm already starving.

186
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,614
(About to meet in a quiet residential area)

187
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,323
(What is the first LMR?)

188
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,554
I believe that it'll be Chinese food.

189
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,893
(Eating first is less tormenting.)

190
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:06,764
Where is it? Tteokgalbi?

191
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:08,064
We're turning onto another street.

192
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,233
- From a moment ago... - Here it is.

193
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,334
The Chinese restaurant on our way here?

194
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,163
- I saw a Chinese restaurant. - It must be the place we saw.

195
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,304
That must be it.

196
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,474
- It's a Chinese restaurant. - We were right.

197
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,074
- I wanted to eat first. - This is great.

198
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:22,613
We should get Chinese food first.

199
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,514
- It's Chinese food. - This is good.

200
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:27,414
- This is a tasty restaurant. - It's the place.

201
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:28,654
It definitely is.

202
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:36,323
- Hello. - Hello.

203
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,354
This is great.

204
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,524
- I'm hungry. - This place looks very old.

205
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,804
(Yeonhui-dong, a mecca for Chinese food in Seoul)

206
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,604
(A Chinese restaurant that's been running for 3 generations)

207
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,174
(A prestigious restaurant)

208
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:58,244
(The world of Chinese cuisine that's fancy and diverse)

209
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:03,114
(Seeking flavors that are natural, not spicy or salty)

210
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:08,084
(LMR 1, Chinese food)

211
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:10,354
- Please come in. - Yes!

212
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,723
(They're in the mecca for Chinese food.)

213
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,824
This is great. Hello.

214
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:15,294
This looks amazing.

215
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:18,294
- The table has been set. - This is great.

216
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:19,703
Gosh, I'm sorry.

217
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,233
We get to eat Chinese food first.

218
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,234
All right.

219
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,934
I'm hungry today.

220
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,244
Today...

221
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,504
I made the wrong choice. This is a real tasty restaurant.

222
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,813
The food is amazing here. I made a mistake again.

223
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:31,944
Did you pick already?

224
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,313
- When you start... - Let's see.

225
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,914
- This is... - This is the best.

226
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,753
(Those who get to eat look at the menu.)

227
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,884
- From looking at the menu... - There are course meals.

228
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:42,253
Why don't we order one of the salads?

229
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,953
- You must like Chinese food. - I do.

230
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,494
You know how to set the table.

231
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:46,924
Based on the menu,

232
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,594
they make five-spice braised meat with beef.

233
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,234
- I see. - This sounds fancy.

234
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,964
- Other places make it with pork? - Usually, it's made with pork.

235
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,173
Hello.

236
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,573
- Hello. - Hello.

237
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:59,004
(The restaurant owner arrives to take the order.)

238
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,743
You don't have to serve them.

239
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:04,273
- You can serve us only. - Hold on. Stop it.

240
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,713
I'll let you eat some chunjang.

241
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:07,184
(Okay)

242
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,984
It definitely looks like a tasty restaurant.

243
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:10,714
How long have you been running this place?

244
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,453
It's been 23 years.

245
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,683
- Twenty-three years? - Twenty-three years?

246
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:17,223
- What about those old photos? - Including my grandfather's days,

247
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,553
it's been 90 years.

248
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:19,964
Ninety years?

249
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,424
In Korea?

250
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,933
I saw very old photos,

251
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,203
so I thought that this must be a real tasty restaurant.

252
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,564
The restaurant used to be in Chungmu-ro.

253
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:34,444
(This family started...)

254
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,974
(a Chinese restaurant in Myeongdong in 1940s.)

255
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:43,484
(It's running at a current place after moving a few times.)

256
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,693
I saw another Chinese restaurant next door.

257
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,324
Is there a reason why there are so many?

258
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,394
Yes, there are many. I'm Chinese.

259
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:54,894
Are you Chinese?

260
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,393
Why are there so many Chinese here?

261
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,594
It's close to the Chinese school.

262
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:04,734
(When the Chinese school moved from Myeongdong to Yeonhui-dong in 1969,)

263
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,714
(Chinese people moved naturally to Yeonhui-dong.)

264
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:14,943
(That's how this little Chinatown was formed.)

265
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:16,553
Oh, I see.

266
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,254
Do we get to taste the authentic...

267
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:20,923
- Right. - Chinese food?

268
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:21,994
This is amazing.

269
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:24,693
- At your restaurant, is there... - A signature dish?

270
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,323
Right. A dish that everyone must try.

271
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:30,163
- Our yuringi, - Yuringi.

272
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,104
- chili shrimp, - Chili shrimp.

273
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,734
And bichi naengmyeon.

274
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,704
- What's that? I saw it outside. - I saw it too.

275
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,044
You know jade bracelets...

276
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,714
and jade rings?

277
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:44,244
"Bichi" must mean jade.

278
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,284
When I was young,

279
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,284
I saw my grandmother's jade ring.

280
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:52,284
I recreated the same color.

281
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:53,624
(Bichi naengmyeon was inspired by his grandmother's jade ring.)

282
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,554
- With the color of jade? - "Bichi" from the color of jade?

283
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,964
It's a dish that he created.

284
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,364
Chicken?

285
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,594
Gosh, I'd like to try that too.

286
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,434
Goodness.

287
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:08,333
- Why don't we try... - You'll regret it.

288
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,134
Many small dishes?

289
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,773
- One small five-spice braised meat, - Okay.

290
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:15,473
- one small chili shrimp, - Small?

291
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,743
And one small yuringi.

292
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,013
Why don't we try bichi naengmyeon...

293
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,313
and something else?

294
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,353
Like jjam-jjamyeon...

295
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:23,984
- Our jjajangmyeon is good too. - Jjajangmyeon.

296
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,953
We have to try jjajangmyeon.

297
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,653
Yes, that's a must at a Chinese restaurant.

298
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,223
That will be our order.

299
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:30,324
(One jjajangmyeon, please.)

300
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,023
You ordered so much.

301
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,123
(They finished ordering without hesitation.)

302
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,123
- Can we not eat this much? - Either way...

303
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,434
Of course we can.

304
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:37,963
(Tae Hyun, on the other hand)

305
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,233
At a Chinese restaurant, I can't help but eat this first.

306
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,003
- It's salty and addictive. - It looks so delicious.

307
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,704
- My mouth is watering. - Can they eat that?

308
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:48,503
Can they eat that?

309
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,174
Should I take it from him?

310
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:52,643
- Just now... - It's up to us.

311
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:55,313
Tae Hyun just had some tsa tsai.

312
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,514
- I want some too. - Dong Hyun.

313
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,954
It's the rule. He had some.

314
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:01,084
- This doesn't count. - Then side dishes don't count?

315
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:02,953
- Side dishes? - Side dishes don't count.

316
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,193
This is a side dish.

317
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:06,863
- The tteokgalbi restaurant... - Side dishes with tteokgalbi...

318
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,094
will have amazing side dishes.

319
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,763
There will be many side dishes at the tteokgalbi restaurant.

320
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,263
I won't eat this.

321
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,103
(Forget about it.)

322
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,133
(Laughing)

323
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,834
There will be many side dishes at the tteokgalbi restaurant.

324
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:19,243
You can't compare this to side dishes at a Korean restaurant.

325
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:20,273
All right.

326
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,544
Fine. I won't eat any.

327
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:25,273
(Today's LMR starts off again with their love for each other.)

328
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:26,583
(At that moment)

329
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,913
- It's for free. - Fried dumplings.

330
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,653
- Why is he serving them for free? - Thank you.

331
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,453
- We'll put it down. - This is great.

332
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:32,654
On this side...

333
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,853
- It's served nicely. It's insane. - Thank you.

334
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,724
(The service is quite majestic.)

335
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,393
Can we get a separate dish too?

336
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:40,394
No, you can't.

337
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,293
- Soy sauce? - For now...

338
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,964
- One of us might eat. - Vinegar, chili oil.

339
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,034
That's a lot.

340
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:49,703
- The dipping sauce is important. - Of course.

341
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,904
You have to add a lot of vinegar and chili powder to the soy sauce.

342
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,543
Let's try the fried dumplings first.

343
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:57,344
(Seung Ho reaches for fried dumplings politely.)

344
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,854
(Startled)

345
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,024
The meat juice bursts from the inside.

346
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:09,853
(Seung Ho also takes a bite.)

347
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,254
- Did the meat juice get on you? - Yes.

348
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:13,894
(Impressed)

349
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:17,793
(Deserving respect with one dumpling)

350
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,964
The fried dumplings are hot. Please be careful.

351
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:23,033
- The dumpling is insane inside. - It's incredible.

352
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,434
- Really? - Seriously.

353
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,703
I didn't want to fill my stomach with this,

354
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,043
but you've got to try this fried dumpling.

355
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,244
- Really? - Yes.

356
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,313
It's a dish on its own.

357
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,343
(One dumpling is a masterpiece.)

358
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:36,083
(Should I have chosen Chinese food?)

359
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:38,454
Is it possible to eat one of those?

360
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,683
In my opinion, you should definitely try it.

361
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,753
- Really? - You aren't giving us any,

362
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,353
but I definitely want to try it.

363
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:46,624
It's because you aren't giving us any.

364
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,094
If you give it to me...

365
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,493
- With chili powder. - Can they try...

366
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:51,964
- It's starting. - Sir.

367
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,803
- Goodness. - Is it another free dish?

368
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:54,833
(Here they are.)

369
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,403
(The dishes keep being served.)

370
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,674
- Five-spice braised meat. - It's chili shrimp.

371
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,844
(Dishes that are full of sweet and salty sauce)

372
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:09,954
- Is this five-spice braised meat? - It's five-spice braised meat.

373
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:12,354
(You can tell right away that it's a fancy dish.)

374
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,653
- It's made with beef shank. - Yes, it's beef shank.

375
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,893
(It's made with beef shank.)

376
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,963
So this is what you used.

377
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:20,323
How can you tell that it's beef shank?

378
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,093
You can tell just by looking at it.

379
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,133
Is it meat with tendons?

380
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:25,193
Right.

381
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:26,263
It looks nice.

382
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:30,503
Five-spice braised meat is...

383
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:31,734
an amazing appetizer...

384
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,374
in Chinese cuisine.

385
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:35,813
I didn't know. I never had it before.

386
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:36,873
It's very delicious.

387
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,343
(To beef shank coated with chili oil)

388
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,444
(Sliced green onions)

389
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:40,783
(Cucumber)

390
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:43,184
(Topped with piquant garlic)

391
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,284
(Pile them up high.)

392
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,454
Five-spice braised meat.

393
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,023
I've seen it often.

394
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:50,524
(Eating)

395
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,124
It's really delicious.

396
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:54,993
(Preparing it whole)

397
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,433
The quality of meat is excellent too.

398
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:58,733
(Anticipating)

399
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,134
This is insane.

400
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:01,964
- That's right. - This is insane.

401
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,634
- Add a piece of cucumber. Yes. - I've never ordered it.

402
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,643
The smell of Chinese food is incredible.

403
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:10,074
(They're almost getting sucked into it.)

404
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,014
It tastes very light.

405
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,754
(Exclaiming)

406
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,183
(Seung Ho also takes a bite neatly.)

407
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,184
How is it?

408
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:22,994
- Is it good? - It's very good.

409
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,624
The green onions look good.

410
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,363
Aren't green onions very healthy?

411
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,634
- This is yuringi. Yes. - Is it?

412
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:36,604
(Thin slices of chicken are deep fried.)

413
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:45,314
(Deep-fry them roughly one more time to make them crunchier.)

414
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,914
(Pouring sweet and sour sauce)

415
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:54,824
(Yuringi with lots of sliced green onions)

416
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:56,553
(Rhymer first)

417
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,063
- Seung Ho, give me your plate. - You have to...

418
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,723
dip this in a lot of sauce.

419
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:01,823
(Sliced green onions with a lot of yuringi sauce)

420
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:03,063
The sauce?

421
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,394
(A lot of sauce)

422
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:07,304
Are you getting ready to start a restaurant business?

423
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,833
- You know so much about food. - The restaurant industry suits him.

424
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,473
Yes, it does. He's genuine about it.

425
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,604
(As he learned, he sets up a bite of yuringi.)

426
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,943
- It tastes very light. - Right.

427
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,383
- It's neither salty nor spicy. - The sauce...

428
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:23,914
I can see why it's served with so much green onion.

429
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,323
The oil from the chicken...

430
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,923
and salty and sweet sauce get mixed in the mouth.

431
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,553
The green onion arranges all the flavors.

432
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:32,623
(Sliced green onions are in charge of removing the heaviness.)

433
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,524
It arranges everything with the texture.

434
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,893
Then you get a sudden taste of ginger.

435
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:38,064
- Right. - Right.

436
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:40,564
There's ginger in it.

437
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,173
It needs some ginger.

438
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,603
- There are slices of ginger. - You need to add them.

439
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,144
- There isn't much ginger. - No, there isn't.

440
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,414
Don't rummage it.

441
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:52,313
(It makes him sad.)

442
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:54,843
- It's food. You can't eat anyway. - It's food.

443
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,553
Don't rummage the food.

444
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,454
(They won't go easy on the eldest either.)

445
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,554
Goodness.

446
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,453
(I should've picked Chinese food.)

447
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,694
- Goodness. - Seriously, this is the best.

448
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,063
- This is great. - It's impossible.

449
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:09,993
Two pieces at once? That's cheating.

450
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,294
Cheating?

451
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:14,333
When athletes eat together and someone grabs two pieces at once...

452
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,573
Doesn't Rhymer look like an athlete?

453
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,233
- Yes, definitely. - Didn't you play sports?

454
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,404
What sports did you play?

455
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,713
I boxed and practiced professional taekwondo.

456
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:25,713
- Professional taekwondo? - Martial arts?

457
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:28,814
He keeps a lot of things in order among rappers.

458
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,183
With force?

459
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,313
I'm serious.

460
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:34,524
For example, the social hierarchy.

461
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,254
When Rhymer arrives,

462
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,053
the social hierarchy becomes clear.

463
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,894
I heard such rumors about him.

464
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:41,863
- Aren't rappers... - I heard such rumors about him.

465
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,334
Supposed to diss each other?

466
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,593
When things get overheated between rappers...

467
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:48,904
As an arbitrator for such rappers,

468
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:52,274
- I tell them, "You, come here." - It's true.

469
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,804
"Come here. Why did you do that?"

470
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,644
"Instead, let's make peace."

471
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,444
"Sir, please come here for a minute."

472
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:00,813
"Come here."

473
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,883
You even call your senior?

474
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:03,153
"You can't do that to him."

475
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,954
"How could you behave like that?"

476
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,423
Seriously.

477
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:09,024
After that, do you treat them at a Chinese restaurant?

478
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:10,893
While having a drink together,

479
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,394
I tell them that hip-hop is one love.

480
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,893
As an arbitrator and a wise man,

481
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,834
- he tries to keep peace. - Right.

482
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:21,033
I'll serve the chili shrimp.

483
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,304
- Chili shrimp. - Chili shrimp.

484
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,833
- So this is chili shrimp. - For Rhymer.

485
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,704
- Gosh. - It's like seasoned fried chicken.

486
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,174
- It's like seasoned fried chicken. - Shut it.

487
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,813
Tae Hyun, is that appropriate?

488
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,613
- Rhymer will put things in order. - Rhymer.

489
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,913
Wasn't that being harsh? You punk.

490
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,153
My goodness.

491
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,753
Don't talk like that to Dong Hyun.

492
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,053
- Okay. - Why you...

493
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,193
- How could you... - Yi Kyung, apologize to him.

494
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:47,094
You should also calm down and accept his apologies.

495
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,123
- He can't talk to me like that. - Apologize to him.

496
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,033
- Aren't you being harsh? - Apologize.

497
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:52,833
Stop acting up in front of food.

498
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,263
- Don't raise your voice. - I just said...

499
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:55,433
Don't raise your voice.

500
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,934
- We're at a restaurant. - Okay, Rhymer.

501
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,773
- You should apologize first. - That's nice and clean.

502
00:18:58,774 --> 00:18:59,903
I'm sorry.

503
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,673
- Gosh, that's nice and clean. - Say something...

504
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,613
to help him keep his face.

505
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:04,814
Goodness.

506
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,084
Here you go, Dong Hyun.

507
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,254
What?

508
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:14,053
Is this really possible?

509
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,054
Dong Hyun.

510
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,054
- Aren't you glad that we fought? - Yes.

511
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,593
- I... - He cursed at you.

512
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:21,223
He said "shut it," so I couldn't let him get away with it.

513
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,093
That can happen.

514
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,463
- So you should... - It's very...

515
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,693
be understanding and let it slide.

516
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:26,733
I made fun of him too much.

517
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,734
Thank you, Rhymer.

518
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,004
You even recognized your fault.

519
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:30,933
Dong Hyun, enjoy the fried dumpling.

520
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:33,143
He's an amazing arbitrator.

521
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,343
This is the real arbitrator.

522
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,374
The hip-hop arbitrator.

523
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,284
You'll see when you taste it. It's just different.

524
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:40,944
Forget that it's a fried dumpling.

525
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,984
- Look at it dripping. - Look at it dripping.

526
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:44,814
Gosh, it's filled inside.

527
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,923
It's unbelievable.

528
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:47,754
It's a dish of its own.

529
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:50,793
Now that he had a fried dumpling,

530
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,093
- He'll be hungrier. - it could get harder.

531
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,123
- Right. - I agree.

532
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,964
It'll make you smack your lips.

533
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,293
It's delicious. It's really amazing.

534
00:19:57,294 --> 00:20:00,164
Later in the evening, I imagine having food...

535
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:02,774
- with a drink with Rhymer. - That sounds nice.

536
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:05,633
I'd love some Chinese liquor right now, but...

537
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:06,973
What do you mean?

538
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:07,974
Chinese liquor?

539
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,344
- It's like kaoliang liquor. - Kaoliang liquor?

540
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,173
With Chinese food...

541
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:13,943
Have a drink. It doesn't matter, does it?

542
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,914
- It's possible but unnecessary. - It's unnecessary.

543
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:17,483
If you'd like, go ahead.

544
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,653
- Shall we get a tiny one? - Shall we?

545
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,023
Okay, let's do that.

546
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:22,254
(Shall we? Okay, let's do that.)

547
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,724
Then is there Confucius Family liquor?

548
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:26,993
Is there a small one of that?

549
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,693
For Handsome Guys.

550
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,293
- Cheers. - Cheers.

551
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,033
(Suddenly, it turns into a work get-together.)

552
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,004
- My goodness. - Gosh.

553
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:36,804
- This is lovely. - It's nice.

554
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,443
(Too much drinking is harmful to one's health.)

555
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:41,143
- It's really nice. - It really is.

556
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,614
Gosh, this is good.

557
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:44,213
- Seriously. - Rhymer.

558
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:45,614
You look so happy.

559
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:49,014
I love this show.

560
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,314
I'm serious.

561
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:52,954
He looks so happy.

562
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,167
- The bichi naengmyeon is here. - Thank you.

563
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,167
Gosh, thank you.

564
00:20:58,197 --> 00:20:59,737
- It looks proper... - Thank you.

565
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,937
These are all for us.

566
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:04,376
- Jjajangmyeon. - Jjajangmyeon looks amazing.

567
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:06,777
(From jjajangmyeon, the basic dish in Chinese cuisine, )

568
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,346
It looks delicious.

569
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,647
(to refreshing noodles washed in cold water)

570
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:13,447
(Topped with colorful garnishes)

571
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:21,687
(And green Chinese naengmyeon)

572
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,627
(6 bowls of noodles full of dignity)

573
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:28,527
They're eating so much.

574
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,767
I didn't think I'd eat this much today.

575
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,566
- You're supposed to eat... - I can't help it.

576
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,767
Until you're full.

577
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:37,576
(How?)

578
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:41,277
(Like this!)

579
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,547
It's so easy to eat.

580
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,047
With some egg garnish.

581
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:55,797
That naengmyeon looks delicious.

582
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,696
- It's definitely good. - If I could pick one,

583
00:21:58,697 --> 00:21:59,867
I'd try that naengmyeon.

584
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:01,897
- Eat until you're full. - It's very tasty.

585
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,496
(Exclaiming)

586
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:05,836
Is it similar to Pyongyang naengmyeon?

587
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:06,866
- Well, it's... - Compared to that...

588
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,037
- It's richer than that. - It's richer than that.

589
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,977
This is chicken broth.

590
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:13,607
The chicken broth is made very light.

591
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,077
To the broth that'd go with anything,

592
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,147
these noodles are the highlight.

593
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,217
The color is unique, and the noodles are well cooked.

594
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,817
The noodles are colored with spinach.

595
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,797
It's subtle and somewhat bland.

596
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,566
I love it.

597
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,867
Is it similar to Pyongyang naengmyeon?

598
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:38,137
It's richer than that.

599
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:40,467
(Smiling)

600
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,977
I got so excited...

601
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,676
that I blew on them.

602
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:47,046
(I blew on the noodles.)

603
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,047
But you didn't see me.

604
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:50,646
These are cold noodles.

605
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,686
(This time, he slurps them without blowing on them.)

606
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:54,986
I wouldn't envy them even if...

607
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,187
- a tteokgalbi master gets here. - Right?

608
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,227
You didn't answer the quiz yet.

609
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:03,426
- Where's the receipt? - What's the total?

610
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,456
- Thank you. - You ordered so much food.

611
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,866
- Goodness. - What is it?

612
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,327
It's 235 dollars.

613
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,636
- Gosh. - How did that happen?

614
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,667
If we get the question wrong,

615
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:14,506
let's not compete among us. I'll pay.

616
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:15,937
(Let's not compete among us. I'll pay.)

617
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:18,006
I don't want to be persistent...

618
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,877
about winning against the younger members.

619
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,307
I knew it. He's amazing.

620
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:23,676
(Total: 235 dollars)

621
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:26,687
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

622
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,686
When it comes to Chinese food, the first dish we think of...

623
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,087
- is jjajangmyeon. - It's about jjajangmyeon.

624
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,696
There's "jjajang" as a native Korean word...

625
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:39,197
which has nothing to do with jjajangmyeon.

626
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,697
Listen to the following sentence...

627
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:44,037
and guess the meaning of jjajang.

628
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,467
"When I entered the village,"

629
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:51,606
"I was jjajang hungry that I almost collapsed."

630
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,347
(What is the meaning of jjajang?)

631
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:56,347
- "When I entered the village..." - Wait a minute.

632
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,147
When I entered the village,

633
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,386
I got so hungry that I almost collapsed.

634
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,517
Jjajang hungry that I almost collapsed?

635
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,986
It must be "very." It must be an adverb.

636
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,586
Very hungry.

637
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:09,696
Or extremely hungry that he almost collapsed.

638
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:11,527
Or could it be...

639
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:14,597
Or jjajang.

640
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:17,666
That sounds like the right answer.

641
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,067
- When I entered the village... - Jjajang.

642
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:21,837
Because I was hungry.

643
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:23,436
My first thought is...

644
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:24,877
"right away."

645
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:26,047
Then jjajang?

646
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,146
- Jjajang. - Jjajang.

647
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:29,576
- Jjajang. - When you enter the village...

648
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,577
"When I entered the village."

649
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,246
It's when I entered the village.

650
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,217
- "When" is meaningful. - Right.

651
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,356
- It was different from other times. - Right.

652
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:41,326
When he entered the village,

653
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,826
he suddenly got hungry unlike other times.

654
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,596
- Right. - It's along those lines.

655
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,467
Without realizing it or strangely.

656
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,537
- Something like that. - Strangely?

657
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,536
Or suddenly.

658
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,106
It's very...

659
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,406
- On the other hand. - You're right.

660
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,037
Wouldn't that be the most reasonable?

661
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:02,077
I think it means something like that.

662
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:03,717
You're jjajang coughing.

663
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,716
(Something like that?)

664
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,146
Why did you jjajang cough?

665
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,286
- Like that? - Yes.

666
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:10,486
What else can we come up with?

667
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,487
- "I almost collapsed." - How about...

668
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,687
I got so hungry that I almost collapsed.

669
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,096
When I entered the village...

670
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:18,756
The tteokgalbi is ready?

671
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:21,096
We'll be right there.

672
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:23,466
- The food is getting cold. - We're a team.

673
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,866
- They called to say... - You ate what we gave you.

674
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,036
- that the food is getting cold. - They asked you to arrive soon?

675
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:29,236
That restaurant makes it from scratch like you said,

676
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,536
- so it won't get cold. - It won't?

677
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:32,136
That's strange. How is it possible?

678
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,877
- It'll be served on hot stone. - Is it magic?

679
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,147
All right.

680
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:37,217
Here's the answer.

681
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,247
When I entered the village...

682
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:44,556
(Answer: What?)

683
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:45,817
- He's acting. - Oops.

684
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,157
Jjajang?

685
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:48,527
Jjajang?

686
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:50,196
- All of a sudden? - Strangely.

687
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,096
- Without realizing it. - It's very strange.

688
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,927
Oh, my. What? Gosh.

689
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:55,227
Come on.

690
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:57,936
There's no context. You can't list all the answers.

691
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:58,966
Even I can do that.

692
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,206
- It's what it means. - The meaning is inclusive.

693
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,976
You need to pick one.

694
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,206
If none of them are correct,

695
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:06,877
it'd be more annoying.

696
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:08,847
The answer has to be one of them.

697
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:10,277
Seriously.

698
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,986
- The answer is... - Is there the answer?

699
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:15,417
Not among your guesses.

700
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,216
You got it wrong.

701
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,386
It's incorrect.

702
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:19,886
This can't be helped.

703
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,687
Then we're completely off.

704
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,026
It's very hard.

705
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,856
Now you have to play individually.

706
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:26,026
Individually?

707
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:27,467
- Play individually. - Start right away.

708
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:29,536
Go ahead and answer first.

709
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:32,537
I don't want to look petty.

710
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:34,736
You guys go first.

711
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,577
I'll guess later.

712
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,037
- Is the answer annoyingly? - Incorrect.

713
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,806
- Suddenly? - Incorrect.

714
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,077
- Textual? - Incorrect.

715
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:43,047
- The answer... - In the word,

716
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:45,116
"jja" is key.

717
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,817
When he entered the village...

718
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:48,417
"Jja."

719
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,487
I got so hungry that I almost collapsed.

720
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:54,026
- It's one... - I'll just keep guessing.

721
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,986
When I got into the village...

722
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:57,157
The word we use the most.

723
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,697
Hey!

724
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:01,127
(Hey!)

725
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:02,966
Hey?

726
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,996
- That was nice. - It means something like that.

727
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,136
Onomatopoeia.

728
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:10,007
- It's onomatopoeia. - When I entered the village,

729
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,306
- hey! - Hey!

730
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,946
I got so hungry that I almost collapsed.

731
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,807
- All right! - All right!

732
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:18,146
- Hey! This is it. - One of us...

733
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:19,886
Hey, you.

734
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,116
(He laughs for a minute.)

735
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,546
Hey, listen.

736
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:23,987
(Is this "Amazing Saturday?")

737
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,956
- Hey. - Is that the answer?

738
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:27,027
"Hey" is incorrect.

739
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:28,487
- Is it two-syllable? - I got it.

740
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,896
- Yi Kyung. - Really.

741
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:31,296
- Yes, that's it. - Correct.

742
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,397
Exactly.

743
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:34,127
It was an easy one.

744
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:35,427
All right, we're done.

745
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,466
- Honestly... - But...

746
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:40,436
- you have to compete against him. - Again? Gosh.

747
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:42,566
As Yi Kyung said, play rock-paper-scissors.

748
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:43,576
Rock-paper-scissors?

749
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:45,836
Rhymer, you can play paper.

750
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:47,207
Seung Ho can play scissors. Right?

751
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:48,677
Shall we do that?

752
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,646
(Is he unwilling to do it?)

753
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,147
Let's start with this.

754
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:57,057
It's to test their loyalty.

755
00:27:57,317 --> 00:28:00,556
Play rock, both of you.

756
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,486
(Rock versus rock, loyal rock-paper-scissors)

757
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:03,496
- We don't know. - Like that?

758
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:05,357
- It's up to them to decide. - Okay.

759
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:06,766
- What? - What is it?

760
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:07,826
What's the matter?

761
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:08,996
We promise to play rock.

762
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:11,297
- Play rock? - Both of you must play rock.

763
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,266
I'm going to play rock, but let's say that you play paper.

764
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,636
Then I'll pay the total without complaining.

765
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:17,876
Be cool about it.

766
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,777
- Actually, I'm the youngest. - Right.

767
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,906
By enduring an embarrassing moment,

768
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,816
I can eat happily.

769
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,576
- Right. - That's possible.

770
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:27,216
Rhymer, I'll play rock.

771
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:28,386
- I promise. - Okay.

772
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:29,856
- Ready or not, - Ready or not,

773
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:30,957
- rock-paper-scissors. - rock-paper-scissors.

774
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:34,356
(Both of them stayed loyal and played rock.)

775
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,226
They chose to be loyal.

776
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:37,227
To be honest...

777
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:39,256
If Rhymer played scissors, he would've lost.

778
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:40,266
Exactly.

779
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:42,326
- Exactly. He didn't want to lose. - You know what?

780
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,496
Rhymer said...

781
00:28:43,497 --> 00:28:45,166
that he'd pay the total.

782
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,136
He could've played scissors.

783
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:49,267
Oh, right. That's possible too.

784
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:51,377
I thought that he'd play scissors.

785
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:53,076
He could've done that.

786
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,847
- But I like... - He played rock instead.

787
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:58,447
To keep my promises.

788
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,617
Then what will you play next?

789
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,616
You should promise each other.

790
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:03,787
This time,

791
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:06,486
- I'll play rock again. - How about you, Seung Ho?

792
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:08,326
It depends on Seung Ho's decision.

793
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:09,456
(What should I do?)

794
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,026
- Okay. - You should play paper.

795
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:12,596
Be generous and play paper.

796
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,026
- Rhymer kept his promise. - I won't feel comfortable.

797
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,296
Don't do this.

798
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,866
Please don't do it.

799
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,937
If he played scissors, it would've been over.

800
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,536
- It would've been over. - I mean...

801
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:22,937
You should've played scissors a moment ago.

802
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:25,036
- No. - In my opinion,

803
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:27,206
he doesn't have any plan at all.

804
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,576
I showed you that I keep promises.

805
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,246
I'll end it heartwarmingly.

806
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:32,777
- Today... - It's not heartwarming.

807
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,486
- I'll make it heartwarming. - Okay.

808
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:35,616
I'll play paper.

809
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:36,686
- I don't know about him. - Okay.

810
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:37,886
- He can play whatever he wants. - Go.

811
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,627
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

812
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:42,127
Okay!

813
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:43,896
That's good.

814
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:44,996
(Yes, as I said, I'll pay for it.)

815
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,196
Thank you for the food.

816
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:47,726
- Thank you for the food. - Don't mention it.

817
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:48,927
Okay.

818
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,596
- Thank you. - Thank you.

819
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:53,107
Thank you.

820
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,736
- It went through. - Thank you.

821
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:58,037
- I enjoyed the food. - Goodbye.

822
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,176
Rhymer, I jjajang enjoyed the food.

823
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:03,317
- Let's go. - Now...

824
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,976
- We should go and get tteokgalbi. - Let's get tteokgalbi.

825
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,016
Let's go.

826
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:07,216
Let's get some tteokgalbi.

827
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,316
- This is amazing. - You must be envious.

828
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,516
(Now they go to eat tteokgalbi, )

829
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,757
(the 2nd LMR.)

830
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:17,427
(The second LMR in Yeonhui-dong)

831
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:19,427
I really enjoyed the food.

832
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,566
- How nice. - Rhymer, thank you for the food.

833
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:22,726
- Goodness. - Thank you for the food.

834
00:30:22,727 --> 00:30:24,797
You're welcome. I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

835
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:28,137
Will you also be treating us to dinner?

836
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:29,407
Dinner?

837
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,937
- Is that a different case? - "Dinner?"

838
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:34,576
Look at that house.

839
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:36,717
- There's a mansion here. - It looks amazing.

840
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:49,056
(Among fancy houses in Yeonhui-dong)

841
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,297
Here's a tteokgalbi restaurant.

842
00:30:51,597 --> 00:30:52,597
(They spot the tteokgalbi restaurant's signboard.)

843
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:55,026
Only tteokgalbi is written on it.

844
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,166
The restaurant must specialize in tteokgalbi.

845
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,597
- It's huge. - Really?

846
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:01,006
- It's big. - It's enormous.

847
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,277
(The size of the building as big as any mansion)

848
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:06,377
Do they run such a big restaurant just to sell tteokgalbi?

849
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:08,577
- Hello. - Hello.

850
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:10,546
This doesn't seem like an ordinary restaurant.

851
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:11,617
I mean...

852
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,217
It's fancy.

853
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,617
It looks antique and has a nice atmosphere.

854
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:19,516
(Inside Yeonhui-dong where it's quiet and still)

855
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:22,257
(Korean Restaurant that We're Proud of)

856
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:26,027
(Where you can taste a decent and clean Korean set meal)

857
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:28,966
(Yeonhui-dong residents' tasty restaurant)

858
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,066
(Perfect for meetings and treating guests)

859
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,897
(I went there for the first time. The food was decent and delicious.)

860
00:31:33,507 --> 00:31:36,907
(LMR 2: Tteokgalbi set menu)

861
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:38,037
Dong Hyun,

862
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,746
- it's our time now. - Yes.

863
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,376
Suddenly, I feel hungry.

864
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,916
After the Chinese restaurant... You can tell from Rhymer's eyes.

865
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,447
Actually, we feel relaxed.

866
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:46,947
We're in a food coma.

867
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:48,447
(Exclaiming)

868
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:50,217
Ma'am?

869
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:52,157
- Yes. - Can we have the menu?

870
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:55,026
- Hello. - Hello.

871
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,056
Hello.

872
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:57,156
- We should... - Let's look at the menu.

873
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:58,326
We can look at the menu.

874
00:31:58,327 --> 00:31:59,767
It's a restaurant sent from above.

875
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,497
- Yes. - Isn't this place...

876
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,237
Which one is the most popular on the menu?

877
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:08,306
We don't have a lot on the menu.

878
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:09,406
- You're right. - Yes.

879
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:10,536
Tteokgalbi, soy sauce marinated crab,

880
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,636
and barley-aged dried yellow corvina.

881
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:13,346
- Everyone likes them all. - Barley-aged dried yellow corvina?

882
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,447
Yes.

883
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,617
An order of a set meal for three people would be perfect.

884
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:19,076
(Why is he choosing for them?)

885
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:20,746
- I picked for them. - It's just a suggestion.

886
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:22,216
- Yes, it's a suggestion. - A suggestion.

887
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,556
You can taste tteokgalbi, soy sauce marinated crab,

888
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,087
and barley-aged dried yellow corvina.

889
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:26,526
- This looks good. - Set Two?

890
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,527
It's a set meal for three people.

891
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,086
A meal for three people should be enough.

892
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,296
- It'll be enough for us. - It'll be enough.

893
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,326
(They pick what he suggested.)

894
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,597
Ma'am, is the tteokgalbi...

895
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:34,966
named after you?

896
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,296
No, the name means serving precious guests.

897
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:39,736
- "Precious?" - I see.

898
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,937
Have precious customers come to this restaurant?

899
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:45,337
- Famous chefs visit here often. - Chefs?

900
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:47,476
Goodness. Your parents frequent here too.

901
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,007
(More important than anyone)

902
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,916
My parents come here too.

903
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:51,976
- Really? - My parents.

904
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:53,917
- Is this the restaurant? - My parents.

905
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,886
- I should ask them later. - That's amazing.

906
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,186
- We'd like to order that. - Shall I get it ready?

907
00:32:58,187 --> 00:32:59,356
- We'll get... - A set meal for three.

908
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,527
- Thank you. - Thank you.

909
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:04,457
When did my parents come here?

910
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:05,796
I should ask.

911
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,326
- Hello? - Hello?

912
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,827
- Mom. - Yes?

913
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,536
Do you go to the tteokgalbi restaurant...

914
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,236
in Yeonhui-dong?

915
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:13,367
Do you come here often?

916
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,506
- They sell marinated crab too. - Yes.

917
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:16,606
You came here a month ago?

918
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,376
We're here for a shoot.

919
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:19,607
I hear the food is good here.

920
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,946
- Really? - Yes.

921
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:21,947
I go there often.

922
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:23,447
- Really? - Yes.

923
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:25,616
- Is the food delicious? - It is.

924
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,047
Usually...

925
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:28,416
I don't know about other restaurants,

926
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,257
and that place is the most reliable.

927
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:32,116
She's a frequent customer.

928
00:33:32,117 --> 00:33:33,687
- A reliable restaurant? - Okay.

929
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:35,257
Which show are you shooting?

930
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:38,397
I'm at a shoot for Handsome Guys.

931
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:40,266
Does Handsome Guys still get aired?

932
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,366
(Does Handsome Guys still get aired?)

933
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,766
- Yes, it still gets aired. - "Still?"

934
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:44,836
(Luckily, we still get aired.)

935
00:33:44,837 --> 00:33:46,606
- Yes, it still gets aired. - Handsome Guys.

936
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,806
Does it still get aired?

937
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:48,906
- So it's continuing. - What?

938
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,136
- Tae Hyun. - Is it continuing?

939
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,576
Yes, it's continuing.

940
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:52,876
- What did you tell her? - That's great.

941
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:53,877
Yes.

942
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:55,606
Did you tell her that it could disappear?

943
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:56,876
What did you tell her?

944
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,146
(What did he say to his mother?)

945
00:33:58,147 --> 00:34:00,017
It's because she doesn't know much about it.

946
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:01,786
All right, talk to you later.

947
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:03,617
- Bye. - Take care.

948
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,456
His mother sounds very young.

949
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:08,757
- She's 80. - Her voice is beautiful.

950
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:10,796
- She's 80? - Really?

951
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,526
- It's impossible to tell. - His mom would hate that.

952
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,296
His mother is a voice actress.

953
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:15,596
It's because she's a voice actress.

954
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,496
- That's why her voice is... - She's a voice actress.

955
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:18,767
I didn't know!

956
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:20,466
Which famous characters' voice-over has she done?

957
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,467
In the past...

958
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,906
The voice-over? She was in "Yeongsimi."

959
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:23,936
Her voice is Yeong Sim's?

960
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:24,937
Yes.

961
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,006
(Yeong Sim whom I know?)

962
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:27,007
Seriously?

963
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:29,347
- In "Run Hani," - Is this widely known?

964
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:30,817
She was the narrator and did the voice-over for Na Ae Ri.

965
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,377
Na Ae Ri's voice?

966
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,087
(Na Ae Ri from "Run Hani")

967
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:40,487
(Yeong Sim from "Yeongsimi")

968
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:41,726
- If she's a voice actress, - Really?

969
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:42,857
Does she still work?

970
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,156
Yes, she does.

971
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:46,897
- Even now? - She does acting now.

972
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:48,466
- I don't know. - I didn't know.

973
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:49,467
Does her face appear on screen?

974
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:51,467
She's a very famous voice actress.

975
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:54,306
(In "Birthcare Center,")

976
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:57,107
(she played the role of a veteran nurse.)

977
00:34:57,607 --> 00:34:59,306
(Isn't that right, Ra On?)

978
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:01,207
(Her voice acting is included.)

979
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,077
(Oh, my son.)

980
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:05,777
(Peekaboo)

981
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:09,747
(Tae Hyun also appeared as a cameo as her son.)

982
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,016
It's true. She acts.

983
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:13,786
Recently, she appeared in "The Fiery Priest 2..."

984
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:15,256
and "Dear Hyeri."

985
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:16,596
She's more successful than me.

986
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:17,927
She's playing more roles than you.

987
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:20,266
That's amazing. I didn't know about that.

988
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,696
That's why she has a great voice.

989
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:23,997
(While talking about the restaurant's frequent customers)

990
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,396
The food is here.

991
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:27,566
(The food arrives fancily in two carts.)

992
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:28,767
It's coming in two carts.

993
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,337
- My goodness. - The side dishes look incredible.

994
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:33,806
(The side dishes already make a sumptuous feast.)

995
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,777
I'm so glad that they won't get to eat the side dishes.

996
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:38,677
- There's everything. - There are over 12 side dishes.

997
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:41,017
This one is spicy.

998
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:45,517
(The main dish with beautiful looks appears.)

999
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:49,727
(Softly minced meat that's marinated)

1000
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:52,496
(It's shaped beautifully...)

1001
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:55,897
(and grilled for the first time.)

1002
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:02,067
(Main Dish 1: Tteokgalbi)

1003
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,437
(When sprinkled with Cheongyang chili on top)

1004
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:09,476
(Main Dish 2: Spicy Tteokgalbi)

1005
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:10,647
This one is spicy.

1006
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,547
- The tteokgalbi looks nice. - Oh, my.

1007
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:15,286
(It stimulates his palate right away.)

1008
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,017
It's making my mouth water.

1009
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,657
- The tteokgalbi looks nice. - This one is spicy.

1010
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,326
The tteokgalbi looks nice.

1011
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,827
(The food catches their attention automatically.)

1012
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:26,157
You don't need to serve him.

1013
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:28,366
Just serve the two of us.

1014
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,136
You don't have to serve them. Only we are eating.

1015
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:31,137
On this side?

1016
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:32,336
- Yes. - It's for three people.

1017
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:33,636
- Two of us will eat three portions. - If you put the extra one...

1018
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:35,767
somewhere, one of them will eat.

1019
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:37,037
Goodness.

1020
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:38,306
It must be salted pollack roe.

1021
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,506
(The table is filled with side dishes.)

1022
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:41,647
Thank you.

1023
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:43,877
This is really...

1024
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:45,616
The one who wins...

1025
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,016
I love marinated crab the most.

1026
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:48,417
(I love marinated crab the most.)

1027
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:52,586
(Main Dish 3: Soy Sauce Marinated Crab)

1028
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,587
The marinated crab.

1029
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:54,927
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:56,927
Look how big the barley-aged dried yellow corvina is.

1031
00:36:57,827 --> 00:36:59,157
- Are you removing the bones? - Yes.

1032
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,467
She's removing the bones by hand.

1033
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:02,927
A deboning show.

1034
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:10,206
(Main Dish 4: Barley-aged Dried Yellow Corvina)

1035
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,237
That's it.

1036
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:13,746
We know how they all taste.

1037
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:14,747
(Clapping)

1038
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,716
- This is great. - Korean food can be...

1039
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:18,676
visually filling.

1040
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:20,586
(A set meal that makes you feel full...)

1041
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:22,486
(just by looking at it)

1042
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,317
- Let's eat. Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1043
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:25,887
Look at the tteokgalbi.

1044
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:28,227
Please have some tteokgalbi.

1045
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,257
- That's it. - Gosh, they're connected.

1046
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:32,857
This looks amazing.

1047
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:34,027
(A huge mouthful of tteokgalbi)

1048
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,167
Gosh.

1049
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:41,836
Usually, the bones aren't at the bottom.

1050
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:44,006
That's how tteokgalbi is served.

1051
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:45,677
- Some restaurants plant them. - Right.

1052
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:48,547
- The tteokgalbi... - It's so tender.

1053
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:50,416
(The two savor the flavors.)

1054
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:51,747
It's like LA galbi.

1055
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,287
That's meat.

1056
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,187
Their postures have changed.

1057
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:57,816
(Their backs are away from their chairs now.)

1058
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,357
- This... - Hey.

1059
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,326
You ate earlier.

1060
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,956
Could you have the crab roe too?

1061
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,726
- Check what's here. - Give us a second.

1062
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:05,756
- Really? - Let us enjoy this first.

1063
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:06,966
- Got it. - Okay.

1064
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,927
(What a bummer...)

1065
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:10,366
This is...

1066
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,196
- Is it spicy? - It's spicier than it seems.

1067
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:13,406
Tae Hyun doesn't enjoy spicy food.

1068
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:15,166
I need to compare this with something else.

1069
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,506
The spiciness of Cheongyang chili...

1070
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,236
- The meat can be too heavy. - Right.

1071
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:19,937
The spice comes from natural sources.

1072
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:21,077
Gosh, this.

1073
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,416
- I actually prefer this. - Really?

1074
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,846
- Is that so? - It's not as rich and heavy.

1075
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,116
It's tteokgalbi with Cheongyang chili.

1076
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,487
- It isn't too spicy either. - Right.

1077
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,127
- Right? - It's not that spicy.

1078
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,486
The spiciness isn't overwhelming,

1079
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:37,997
but it makes itself known at the end.

1080
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:40,667
- It lightens the dish a bit. - Exactly.

1081
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,496
Could you please have the marinated crab?

1082
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:44,866
- Not yet. - Not yet?

1083
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,867
(Grabbing their attention)

1084
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,466
Why don't I put some gloves on and remove the meat for you?

1085
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,806
- That's okay. - I'm actually good at that.

1086
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,077
(Sounding desperate for some reason)

1087
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:53,136
(Since it's their wish, he grabs a piece of the crab.)

1088
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:54,447
- Look. - It's so plump.

1089
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:55,947
Look how meaty it is!

1090
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:57,416
This wouldn't even be too salty.

1091
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,747
That's a meaty crab. Are you kidding me?

1092
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:00,046
(Mouth-watering)

1093
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,187
- It's really meaty. - I know.

1094
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:03,217
Suck on it hard.

1095
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:09,957
Isn't it salty?

1096
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,227
It's not salty at all. I don't need any rice with it.

1097
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,367
It's not at all salty.

1098
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:18,537
(The perfect amount of saltiness to awaken the palate)

1099
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:19,597
Are you going to have the back shell?

1100
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,067
- No, you go ahead. - Thanks.

1101
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,036
(Dong Hyun gets the back shell.)

1102
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:25,407
- I love marinated crabs. - Really?

1103
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:27,906
- You know about the gunk inside. - Of course.

1104
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,006
- Have all of that. - Sure.

1105
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,007
(Don't I know it.)

1106
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:31,547
This is pure luxury.

1107
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:36,816
- Hold on a second. - Mix some rice in that.

1108
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:37,857
Of course.

1109
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:40,526
This must be why my mom comes here.

1110
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:42,426
She likes food that's less salty.

1111
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:44,797
- Of course. Moms are like that. - It can't be too salty.

1112
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:47,467
This place is spot on.

1113
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:49,166
This is insane.

1114
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,296
(Eyes are fixed.)

1115
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,737
This is at its best.

1116
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,207
(Groaning)

1117
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:59,907
(Slurping)

1118
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,877
(He can't help his mouth from twitching.)

1119
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:06,477
Should I try this one? You know this is the best piece.

1120
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:08,886
- This is the tastiest piece. - Suck up all that juice.

1121
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:09,987
Of course.

1122
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:12,217
You know it's not easy to find a place that does this well.

1123
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:14,526
The crabs aren't meaty enough, or they're too bland or too salty.

1124
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,026
- This place does it brilliantly. - Is it perfect?

1125
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,926
The meat, the roe, and the white part.

1126
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,796
All that together...

1127
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:20,927
It's not too salty.

1128
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,537
(Their eyes are fixed on him.)

1129
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:27,436
(They're the same people...)

1130
00:40:27,437 --> 00:40:29,166
(who just had Chinese food for about 15 people.)

1131
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,307
That needs a lot of rice.

1132
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,876
Have it with a piece of that.

1133
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,206
- Have it together. - Exactly.

1134
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:35,376
Have one of that.

1135
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:36,946
- And the seaweed soup. - The seaweed soup.

1136
00:40:36,947 --> 00:40:38,546
Why do you keep ignoring the soup?

1137
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:39,946
Have the seaweed soup.

1138
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:41,486
- Slurp. - Are you commanding him?

1139
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:44,856
- Yes, that's it. - Have radish kimchi as well.

1140
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:46,217
Enjoy the texture.

1141
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,157
- How's the texture? - That's good.

1142
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:53,197
But that doesn't work.

1143
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:55,397
Not the eggplant.

1144
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:58,837
- Hey. You almost ruined it. - But...

1145
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:00,067
Everything was in perfect harmony.

1146
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,436
This time, why don't you try this?

1147
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:03,437
- This. - Yes?

1148
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:04,637
Have this pumpkin leaf wrap.

1149
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,247
Try it with some barley-aged dried yellow corvina.

1150
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,946
- That'd be amazing. - Of course! Come on!

1151
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:11,276
I'll do as Rhymer says.

1152
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:12,346
Unbelievable.

1153
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,387
- That'd be awesome. - This should be spread like so.

1154
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,416
- Sure. - Should I add rice?

1155
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,786
- Of course. - But not too much.

1156
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,326
- Don't forget the ssamjang. - Done.

1157
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:21,356
Good.

1158
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,226
Don't forget the barley-aged dried yellow corvina.

1159
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,296
There's more rice over there.

1160
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:25,996
(In one bite)

1161
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:27,826
(That's it!)

1162
00:41:27,827 --> 00:41:30,127
Tae Hyun, isn't that good?

1163
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:31,366
What did I say?

1164
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,367
(Switching channels)

1165
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:33,907
- And now... - Three times?

1166
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,266
(Dong Hyun will enjoy the meal as you want him to!)

1167
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,137
- Check this out. - That looks good. There you go.

1168
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:39,836
- That's sweet. - Nice.

1169
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:42,206
- How rustic is that? - That's unbelievable.

1170
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:43,207
(The viewers can't get enough of it.)

1171
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:44,716
You know,

1172
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:47,616
this pumpkin leaf is slightly bitter.

1173
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:48,916
Barley-aged dried yellow corvina and ssamjang are a perfect combo.

1174
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,457
- They enhance the flavors. - Right.

1175
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:52,056
- Here's your green tea water. - The green tea water is here.

1176
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:53,626
- Green tea water. - More rice.

1177
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:55,526
- Can we have another bowl of rice? - Would you like another bowl?

1178
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:56,527
Yes, we'll order one more.

1179
00:41:56,528 --> 00:41:58,457
- Do we add the water to this? - Yes.

1180
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:01,329
- How do you eat this? - Yes, with the corvina.

1181
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,568
- Have it with the corvina. - Here you go.

1182
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:04,698
Add water to the rice.

1183
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:05,898
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

1184
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,868
- Soak rice in that water. - Yes, and drink the rice.

1185
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:10,108
Take a piece of the barley-aged dried yellow corvina...

1186
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:11,378
and slurp it all together.

1187
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:12,808
This would also be good with gochujang.

1188
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,848
- Like this. - There can be small chunks.

1189
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,949
Scoop up the rice and add a piece of the corvina.

1190
00:42:19,549 --> 00:42:21,718
(He soaks the rice in water like he was told.)

1191
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,918
- That's how you eat it. - Isn't it good?

1192
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:23,919
(He soaks the rice in water like he was told.)

1193
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:25,889
- Hold on. - That's the perfect combo.

1194
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,658
(Meanwhile)

1195
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:28,688
I'll add this.

1196
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:31,628
(He starts with a fresh bowl of rice.)

1197
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:32,658
Scoop up the rice...

1198
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:35,569
- and add a piece of the corvina. - This is how you eat it.

1199
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:38,499
No, soak the rice in the water.

1200
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,198
No, that's one way to eat it.

1201
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,608
- That's one way to eat it. - Soak the rice in the water.

1202
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:43,768
This is also a way to enjoy this dish.

1203
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,579
- By dipping? - Yes, you can also dip. Like this.

1204
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:51,678
That'll have you gobbling a bowl of rice.

1205
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,218
(This is how you enjoy it. By dipping.)

1206
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:54,449
That looks so good.

1207
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:59,559
- Rhymer is on another level. - What do you mean?

1208
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,029
- It's just meat. - Well,

1209
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,559
isn't it about time we did something?

1210
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:08,728
- No? - I thought you were fine.

1211
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:10,368
But you see...

1212
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:12,868
You're clearing the plates too quickly.

1213
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:14,769
You'll eat all of it at this rate.

1214
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,508
- Look at Dong Hyun. - It's okay, but...

1215
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:19,009
He'll eat it all at this rate.

1216
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,208
- Leave us a piece of this. - You should.

1217
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,748
- This. - That's what I was going to eat.

1218
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:24,248
- You can't. - No way.

1219
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:26,379
- Leave this for us. - Sure.

1220
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,818
- Should we order more crab? - The crab and corvina, my gosh.

1221
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:30,988
- I think you should. - Should we order some more?

1222
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:32,058
- The marinated crab. - Sure.

1223
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:33,458
- Goodness. - My gosh.

1224
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:34,988
Now I'm motivated to answer the question.

1225
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,858
- Thank you so much. - It's my pleasure.

1226
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:39,928
- Dong Hyun, we got more, so eat up. - I should.

1227
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:42,898
- Can't you leave that piece alone? - Here.

1228
00:43:42,899 --> 00:43:45,099
(Can't you leave that piece alone?)

1229
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,538
(While you're at it, leave us a decent piece.)

1230
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,008
- That's it. Thanks. - Sure.

1231
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:50,268
There's a chance for us to try some.

1232
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,809
Seung Ho will curse you out if you take this back shell.

1233
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,978
- That's ours. - Hold on.

1234
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,048
(What we leave for you to eat is up to us.)

1235
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:58,648
- That's not part of the deal. - One should get this chance.

1236
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:01,689
Dong Hyun, do you remember how I gave you the fried dumpling?

1237
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:04,119
Do you remember that or not? Just tell me that.

1238
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,288
I do remember, and I was grateful.

1239
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,928
I gave you the dumpling when you were most desperate.

1240
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,689
That's right. I remember that.

1241
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:11,758
- Okay. - Got it, Rhymer.

1242
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:13,398
You can have this if you get the question right.

1243
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:14,428
(I won't touch the back shell for your sake.)

1244
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:15,469
The back shell.

1245
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:19,768
(A quiz for the freeloaders)

1246
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,609
Why don't I give you a simple game to play?

1247
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:25,709
Name a four-syllable dish.

1248
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:28,879
- That's a tough one. - Four-syllable dishes?

1249
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:30,108
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Rock-paper-scissors?

1250
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:31,619
Rock-paper-scissors.

1251
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,378
Whoever wins decides the order. I'll go first.

1252
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,789
- Sure. - I'll start and go this way.

1253
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:37,988
- Okay. - One, two, three.

1254
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:39,089
Spicy marinated crab.

1255
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:41,089
Beef tripe hot pot.

1256
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:42,629
Soy sauce marinated crab.

1257
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:44,858
- That was said. - Hold on.

1258
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,428
- They're not the same. - They're different.

1259
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:47,968
- Of course. - One has a red marinade.

1260
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:49,599
Streusel bun.

1261
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,199
- Streusel bun? - Yes.

1262
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,868
Five, four...

1263
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:54,209
Noodle hot pot.

1264
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,069
Cornbread.

1265
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:59,608
Are you going with bread and buns?

1266
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:00,779
So that's how it'll be?

1267
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:03,608
- Five, four, - Four.

1268
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:05,918
Three, two...

1269
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,019
Tteokgalbi's the best!

1270
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,719
- You're out. - What could I have said?

1271
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:13,258
- How unfortunate. - This is a tough game.

1272
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:14,529
- Please resume. - What can there be?

1273
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,089
Doenjang stew.

1274
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:17,858
He'll probably go with kimchi stew.

1275
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:19,599
Five, four,

1276
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:20,899
- three... - Kimchi stew.

1277
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:24,098
Nice and simple.

1278
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,099
(He's the master at getting ideas from other people.)

1279
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,608
It might not be a bad time for me to let him win...

1280
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,468
like I did so with the rock-paper-scissors.

1281
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,778
- Five, four, three... - Don't.

1282
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:33,578
- Just keep playing. - Keep playing.

1283
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:35,348
- You should have this. - Really?

1284
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:36,548
- Three... - Then, here goes.

1285
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:37,719
Stir-fried anchovies.

1286
00:45:38,379 --> 00:45:40,048
The game is still on.

1287
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:41,488
This has been going on for quite a long time.

1288
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,689
Chili pepper japchae.

1289
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:45,888
- Nice. - Five, four, three...

1290
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:47,089
Seasoned chili pepper.

1291
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:49,629
Unbelievable.

1292
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,059
- I'm impressed. - Five, four...

1293
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:52,499
Stir-fried meatballs.

1294
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,128
(He actually named a decent dish.)

1295
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:57,498
- He named a decent dish. - Three,

1296
00:45:57,499 --> 00:45:58,569
two,

1297
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,168
one. Time's up!

1298
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:03,939
(Rhymer is eliminated.)

1299
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:06,409
- Seung Ho's good at this game. - He sure is.

1300
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:07,949
Thank you.

1301
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:11,018
I never wanted this game to drag on for this long.

1302
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,548
(After letting it drag on for this long?)

1303
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:14,918
I was out of ideas. When I said seasoned chili pepper,

1304
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:16,649
I was ashamed of myself.

1305
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:19,558
I'd like to ask my brothers.

1306
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,258
May I have this back shell?

1307
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:23,428
- Of course. - You won, so it's yours.

1308
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:24,758
- Go ahead. - Not so fast.

1309
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,198
(Hold on...)

1310
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:27,669
I haven't approved yet.

1311
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:29,928
I won't eat it if Dong Hyun's against it.

1312
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:32,599
Okay, fine. Don't sulk. Unbelievable.

1313
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:37,878
- He's sulking. - Give it to him personally.

1314
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,938
You're good at mediating.

1315
00:46:39,939 --> 00:46:42,408
- You should hand it over to him. - I can't believe it.

1316
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:44,778
That's it. Good job.

1317
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:46,718
(Handing over the back shell like extending an olive branch)

1318
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:48,949
- It's heavy. - Thanks, Dong Hyun.

1319
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:51,458
- That's one of the best pieces. - Nice.

1320
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:52,589
What a heartwarming scene.

1321
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:56,058
Is this how you mediate conflicts at your company?

1322
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:57,059
Yes.

1323
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,099
I believe that people like Rhymer...

1324
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:01,199
should win the Nobel Prize.

1325
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:04,298
- The Peace Prize? - The Nobel Peace Prize.

1326
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:05,999
(Worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize)

1327
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:08,569
Scrape it all onto the rice and have it together.

1328
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,279
- Have a big scoop of it. - There's a lot of roe.

1329
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,949
The orange thing should show when you scoop up the rice.

1330
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,078
This is what you see on televised shopping channels.

1331
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,679
Here's your money shot.

1332
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:20,878
Hold on. Let's have it together. I'll have this piece while you eat.

1333
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,088
I'll feel like having what you're having.

1334
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,318
(This might taste the same if I eat it while you eat.)

1335
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:26,488
I might taste it if we eat it together.

1336
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:27,828
- This is what you're having. - Sure.

1337
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:29,159
One, two, three.

1338
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:32,499
(Yummy)

1339
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:37,469
(He tasted it!)

1340
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:39,369
I had the insides of the back shell just now.

1341
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:41,408
- Let's do that again. - Really?

1342
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:42,538
One, two, three.

1343
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:43,568
(An encore)

1344
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,579
(Yummy)

1345
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,179
Come on.

1346
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,648
That's a new type of...

1347
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:49,878
imagined consumption.

1348
00:47:49,879 --> 00:47:52,078
- Imagined consumption. - That's what it is.

1349
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,279
I love marinated crabs.

1350
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,618
- Will you let one of us... - Yes.

1351
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,489
Try a bite of the barley-aged dried yellow corvina?

1352
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,358
Let us squeeze the soy sauce marinated crab...

1353
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,929
- and have a bite. - That's right.

1354
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:03,458
- Listen. - Should we go for it?

1355
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:04,998
You don't even have to give us rice.

1356
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,098
- Seriously. - Just...

1357
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,428
Okay. Give them a quiz.

1358
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,568
- We have to taste it. - Yes.

1359
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:09,598
- You have to try it. - That one. Gosh.

1360
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,998
- Just this. We won't ask for more. - That's right.

1361
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:13,738
- We don't have a spare quiz. - What?

1362
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:16,139
Why don't you play the multiplication game?

1363
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,778
(For goodness' sake.)

1364
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:20,338
- That's... - I have...

1365
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:21,678
I have nothing to lose.

1366
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,248
I'll be fine, but he...

1367
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:25,578
- But he has his employees and... - It doesn't matter.

1368
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:27,248
Not getting to taste it is one thing,

1369
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:29,919
but to be humiliated on top of that is...

1370
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,319
- Are you bad at multiplication? - No.

1371
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:34,988
- Shall we? - Let's do it.

1372
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:37,129
- Okay. I'll attack first. - Okay.

1373
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:40,258
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1374
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:42,128
- What's 7 times 8? - It's 56.

1375
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,068
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1376
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:46,768
- What's 9 times 5? - It's 45.

1377
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:49,368
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1378
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:50,539
What's 7 times 8?

1379
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:52,739
It's 57.

1380
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,509
It's 57.

1381
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,548
You got the 7 times 8 right before.

1382
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:06,018
I asked 7 times 8 before and asked 8 times 7 this time.

1383
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:07,558
It was 8 times 7.

1384
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:08,559
(Laughing)

1385
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:10,928
Turn the cameras off. I'm serious.

1386
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,228
This can't happen.

1387
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:13,998
I won't allow it.

1388
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:16,029
Let's edit this out. Seriously.

1389
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:17,768
We have to edit it out.

1390
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:18,899
(Screaming)

1391
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:20,139
(Making a scene)

1392
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,839
This isn't right.

1393
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:23,838
Come on. Seriously.

1394
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,008
(Happy)

1395
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:28,379
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1396
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:29,978
(His ears are about to explode.)

1397
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:31,478
- Gosh, Mother. - I'm so happy.

1398
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:32,818
I asked what 8 times 7 is.

1399
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:33,878
(His ears are about to explode.)

1400
00:49:33,879 --> 00:49:36,819
Gosh, Mother. Please forget about this.

1401
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:38,488
What's 8 times 7? It's 57.

1402
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:39,858
Rhymer, thanks for the food.

1403
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:42,558
There isn't any occasion where 57 can be an answer.

1404
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,859
- How can we get 57? - Gosh.

1405
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:45,598
- Gosh. Look. - Goodness.

1406
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,029
For goodness' sake.

1407
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:49,129
Okay. I got it.

1408
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,099
(Biting)

1409
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:55,139
They were getting along, though.

1410
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:59,139
Gosh. I guess sometimes it's hard to recall the times table.

1411
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,878
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1412
00:50:00,879 --> 00:50:03,509
- Okay. Right. We have to pay. - We have to pay.

1413
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:04,618
How much is it, Tae Hyun?

1414
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:05,879
- It's 142 dollars. - I see.

1415
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:07,648
- That's it. - It's quite expensive.

1416
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:09,519
- We ordered Meal Number Two. - Or all of these?

1417
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:12,919
Of everyone here,

1418
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:14,358
I'm the only one...

1419
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,628
- who didn't eat anything. - You're right.

1420
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:17,659
You won't make me pay, right?

1421
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:19,228
- Right? - No way.

1422
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:20,558
- I didn't even have a bite. - No way.

1423
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,028
- They won't make you pay. - Exactly.

1424
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:23,368
- Let's go. - Here we go.

1425
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:24,369
Okay.

1426
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:25,639
To make tteokgalbi,

1427
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,569
you knead the finely ground beef rib fingers,

1428
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:32,208
stick it back to the bone, to grill it.

1429
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,849
It's a dish that inherits the tradition of the royal cuisine.

1430
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:37,918
During the Joseon Dynasty, it was made...

1431
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:39,848
so that it was easy for the elderly people to eat.

1432
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:41,789
Off of that considering mind,

1433
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,819
it is also called galbi of this.

1434
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,659
What is this?

1435
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:49,159
The Joseon Dynasty. Basically,

1436
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:51,728
it's something like galbi of filial duty.

1437
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:54,059
- Galbi of good sons or filial duty. - For elderly people.

1438
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:55,628
Or the galbi of the elderly.

1439
00:50:55,629 --> 00:50:57,398
Something like the galbi of respect, right?

1440
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:58,938
- It's something like that. - Since they made it tender,

1441
00:50:58,939 --> 00:51:01,369
it can also be smooth galbi.

1442
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:03,468
- What? Come on, Rhymer. - The meat was tender.

1443
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,738
They kneaded it so that it'd be tender.

1444
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,979
- Rhymer, I think you're nervous. - No, I'm not.

1445
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:11,008
Why do you think people didn't use English back then?

1446
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,418
Since it's tender,

1447
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:13,849
- call it "smooth galbi." - Don't give up.

1448
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:16,288
Even when you're toothless, you can use your gum to eat this...

1449
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,018
- smooth galbi. - Call it "smooth galbi."

1450
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:20,118
It's...

1451
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,558
(Pulling themselves together)

1452
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:24,128
Okay. The key is the "elderly."

1453
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:26,629
- It was for them to eat easily. - Exactly. Seriously.

1454
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,199
Will it be something like the galbi of respect?

1455
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:35,108
Or will it have to do more with the fact it was tender?

1456
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:36,638
Since it was named...

1457
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:38,178
- after their considerate heart, - It was about the consideration.

1458
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,179
- It's of piety or filial duty. - Because of a considerate mind.

1459
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,409
But the galbi of piety is too obvious.

1460
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:46,879
Piety, filial duty, filial love... There are many options.

1461
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,919
- The galbi of filial love. What? - Yes.

1462
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,688
They said it was based on that considerate heart.

1463
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:52,688
- Yes. - Call it the galbi of filial love.

1464
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:53,859
The filial love sounds good.

1465
00:51:54,759 --> 00:51:57,059
- Tae Hyun, even if it's wrong, - Out of respect...

1466
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:59,629
let's go for the answer Rhymer said.

1467
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,399
If it's correct,

1468
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,029
he'd be so upset.

1469
00:52:03,129 --> 00:52:05,199
The galbi of filial love. It sounds good, Tae Hyun.

1470
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:06,338
Let's go with the filial love.

1471
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:07,498
- The filial love? - Yes. That's better.

1472
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,708
- Let's go. - Let's go with the filial love.

1473
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,269
- It'll be close. - Yes.

1474
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:12,209
- Okay. - Okay. We have the answer.

1475
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:14,379
- The galbi of filial love. - The galbi of filial love.

1476
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:16,609
- It's so random, though. - "The galbi of filial love."

1477
00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:19,219
The old name of tteokgalbi was the galbi of filial love.

1478
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:21,548
The galbi of filial duty, piety, or filial love.

1479
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,888
(Will it be the answer?)

1480
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:25,088
"The galbi of filial love."

1481
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:27,159
The galbi of filial duty, piety, or filial love.

1482
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:29,528
- Correct. - What?

1483
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:30,628
(Correct.)

1484
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:32,059
No, it can't be.

1485
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,358
- Correct. - Is it correct?

1486
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,899
- What? - Stop lying.

1487
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:36,969
- You'll say, "Not." - You'll say it's not correct.

1488
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,998
(Surprised)

1489
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,998
(A bit relaxed)

1490
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,538
It's correct.

1491
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:46,009
(It's correct.)

1492
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:49,608
- Wait. - I told you.

1493
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:51,918
- What's going on? - I...

1494
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,278
I told you.

1495
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:54,548
Come on. You gave them the answer.

1496
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:55,618
What are you talking about?

1497
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,488
- Hold on. - It's unbelievable.

1498
00:52:57,489 --> 00:52:58,718
I can't believe this.

1499
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:00,918
- It's unbelievable. - Hold on.

1500
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:02,758
Rhymer should pay for this now.

1501
00:53:02,759 --> 00:53:03,988
- This is... - Come on. He...

1502
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:06,298
- I gave you the answer. - Come on, Rhymer.

1503
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:07,458
What's going on?

1504
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:09,299
Is this a lie, Tae Hyun?

1505
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,199
Rhymer, what happened?

1506
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:12,738
Rhymer, say something.

1507
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:14,668
Why did you say "filial love?"

1508
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:17,108
- You look upset. - No.

1509
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:18,378
Rhymer, do you know your mustache has grown?

1510
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:19,679
- I mean... - Why did you...

1511
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:21,139
- I thought... - I mean...

1512
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:22,778
I thought...

1513
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:25,218
this show and I had good chemistry.

1514
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:26,718
- Gosh. Seriously. - What happened, though?

1515
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:28,548
- This is so strange. - Did you not know about the answer?

1516
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:29,889
You didn't, did you?

1517
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,088
- Why did you... - Do the multiplication game again.

1518
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:34,788
(Do the multiplication game again.)

1519
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:36,689
- Come on. - Rhymer.

1520
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:39,199
If you play the multiplication game, you'll pay 99.9 percent.

1521
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:41,498
- It's the ratio of solid gold. - Gosh.

1522
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:43,098
There's a chance that Rhymer...

1523
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:45,568
- will pay for everything today. - He might pay for everything.

1524
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:47,669
After paying 10 and 20 dollars repetitively...

1525
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:49,008
Do you want to play the multiplication game?

1526
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,338
Don't do it!

1527
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:52,908
(The remaining part is...)

1528
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:54,708
- Is it an individual game? - It's an individual game.

1529
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:56,008
What are you going to do for it?

1530
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,108
- Is it a quiz? - Do you want a quiz?

1531
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,148
Yes. A quiz.

1532
00:53:58,149 --> 00:53:59,879
It's a multiple choice quiz with three options.

1533
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,018
We'll decide who'll choose the answer first...

1534
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:04,818
with rock-paper-scissors.

1535
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:06,218
- Then I'll give the quiz. - This is important.

1536
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:08,128
The loser won't even have to choose.

1537
00:54:08,129 --> 00:54:11,658
You yelled at me for not showing scissors before.

1538
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:13,228
I'll show scissors this time in any case.

1539
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:14,629
- Okay. - Okay.

1540
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:16,869
Rock-paper-scissors.

1541
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,268
Come on. He did show scissors.

1542
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:23,608
(He really showed the scissors.)

1543
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:24,778
Come on.

1544
00:54:24,779 --> 00:54:26,708
- Come on. Why? - Are you serious?

1545
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:29,379
- What's wrong with you? - I mean...

1546
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:31,979
Why is he... When I first saw him,

1547
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:33,918
I thought he was really smart.

1548
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:35,648
He's becoming stupid.

1549
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:37,519
This is what this place is like.

1550
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:38,888
- I didn't know. - Rhymer.

1551
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:40,758
- I see. - Of course.

1552
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:42,929
- You're like, "I'll pay for it." - Rhymer.

1553
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,328
Please don't change.

1554
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:45,899
I want to be on the same team as you.

1555
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:48,498
- Please. Be on my team later on. - I see. This is...

1556
00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:50,398
- what it's like here. - My stomach hurts from laughing.

1557
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:52,269
- Seung Ho. Rock-paper-scissors. - But...

1558
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:54,068
- Seung Ho, me, and... - You're a giving tree.

1559
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:55,509
- Rhymer. - Okay.

1560
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,839
It was hilarious.

1561
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,978
Okay. In Korean table d'hote,

1562
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:00,838
namul, the seasoned vegetables, is essential.

1563
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,909
- That's right. - Namul.

1564
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,209
Since the past, in the palace,

1565
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,378
- when it was spring, - It's about spring greens.

1566
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:09,288
They used five greens that sprout in early spring...

1567
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:12,158
to make something called Five Spring Greens...

1568
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,619
- for the King. - Spring greens.

1569
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:17,329
Of the three options, choose the ones...

1570
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:19,799
that are included in the Five Spring Greens.

1571
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,669
- Number One, wild chives. - Wild chives.

1572
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:25,499
Number Two, dong quai.

1573
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,968
- Dong quai, don't cry. - Don't cry.

1574
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:29,669
Number Three, mung bean sprouts.

1575
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,639
- Mung bean sprouts? - Mung bean sprouts.

1576
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:33,639
Gosh. It's easy.

1577
00:55:34,279 --> 00:55:35,609
- Yes. It's so easy. - It's easy.

1578
00:55:35,909 --> 00:55:37,348
- It's so easy. - Look at him.

1579
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:39,378
Actually, I don't know it for sure.

1580
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,749
My mother always makes namul with spring greens.

1581
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:43,418
Seung Ho can choose first.

1582
00:55:43,419 --> 00:55:44,718
- You can choose. - He should choose.

1583
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:46,459
- Should I answer it first? - Yes.

1584
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:49,358
- I'll choose the wild chives. - Okay. The wild chives.

1585
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,858
That was the only one I wanted to choose.

1586
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:52,029
That can't be wrong.

1587
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:53,528
The remaining options are...

1588
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:56,129
- dong quai and mung bean sprouts. - Dong quai and mung bean sprouts.

1589
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:59,839
The answer is so obvious to everyone.

1590
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,139
You have to consider this.

1591
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:04,608
- Sometimes, what seems obvious... - That's right.

1592
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:05,738
Is wrong.

1593
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,108
(Sometimes, it's wrong.)

1594
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:08,848
- I'm serious. - You're nervous.

1595
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:09,948
No, I'm not.

1596
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,348
You might think, "Isn't it obvious?"

1597
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,348
But then you might say, "This isn't a spring green?"

1598
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:17,019
It might be a spring vegetable, just not the Five Spring Greens.

1599
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:18,558
- You have to choose. - If you...

1600
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,088
were the second person to choose,

1601
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:21,729
which one would you choose?

1602
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,229
Me?

1603
00:56:23,389 --> 00:56:24,788
I think dong quai is correct.

1604
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:25,959
- Do you? - Yes.

1605
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:27,758
I'll go with dong quai, then.

1606
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,968
(I'll go with dong quai, then.)

1607
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,268
Come on.

1608
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:33,169
You said that was the correct one,

1609
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:34,769
so I'd better choose that one.

1610
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:37,809
How am I supposed to plan my strategy?

1611
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,779
My brain is fried.

1612
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:43,009
Okay. I'll choose the mung bean sprouts, then.

1613
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:44,409
- Yes. - Dong quai.

1614
00:56:44,479 --> 00:56:45,578
- You never know. - The mung bean sprouts.

1615
00:56:45,579 --> 00:56:47,018
- You never know. - Mung bean sprouts sound wrong.

1616
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:48,848
- You're right. - It might not be wild chives.

1617
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,018
I have a feeling...

1618
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:51,318
As for wild chives,

1619
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:53,519
- you eat them a lot in spring. - Yes.

1620
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:56,089
But actually, they're in season during winter.

1621
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,529
I do think it might not include wild chives.

1622
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,329
Okay.

1623
00:57:00,399 --> 00:57:02,028
- Okay. Here's the answer. - Yes.

1624
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:03,068
I have no idea, though.

1625
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:05,668
During the Joseon Dynasty, there was a tradition...

1626
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:08,198
of eating Five Spring Greens.

1627
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:10,268
To increase appetite and energy during spring,

1628
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:13,279
they ate greens with a strong and spicy taste.

1629
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:14,979
- Is it the mung bean sprouts? - The vegetables...

1630
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:17,208
for Five Spring Greens vary by period and region,

1631
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:18,719
but usually, it includes...

1632
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:21,618
- wild chives, - What? He's right.

1633
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:22,989
- shepherd's purse, - What?

1634
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,019
- water parsley, - Water parsley.

1635
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:26,889
- chives, - Chives.

1636
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:29,658
(What is the last one?)

1637
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:31,188
(Mung bean sprouts, dong quai)

1638
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:32,359
- and dong quai. - What?

1639
00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:33,899
- and dong quai. - What?

1640
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:39,999
- Seriously. - Dong quai. Don't cry.

1641
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:42,168
Come on. Seriously.

1642
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:43,408
How is this possible?

1643
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:44,908
Is there no such thing as an unexpected twist?

1644
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:46,479
Rhymer, when is dong quai in season again?

1645
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,279
I don't know. Darn it.

1646
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:49,879
Look at him.

1647
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:51,178
I don't know.

1648
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:53,718
(Does it even matter now?)

1649
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:54,989
- Wait. - Rhymer.

1650
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:56,689
- Wild chives are... - Look.

1651
00:57:57,289 --> 00:57:59,359
I'm paying for them anyway.

1652
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:01,959
Come on. Why?

1653
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:03,728
- What? - Come on, Rhymer.

1654
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:05,098
Don't you dare touch them.

1655
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:06,959
- Gosh. - You'll pay for them,

1656
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:08,598
so have them all.

1657
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:10,169
(Laughing)

1658
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:12,338
(Savoring)

1659
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:13,998
Rhymer. In fact, wild chives are in season...

1660
00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:15,308
between March and May.

1661
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:17,709
He's devouring them. Come on, Rhymer.

1662
00:58:18,439 --> 00:58:19,809
Don't chip your teeth.

1663
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:22,908
My stomach hurts from laughing.

1664
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:24,449
(Chewing)

1665
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:27,148
(Rhymer pays in the end.)

1666
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:30,388
(Today's LMR)

1667
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:31,588
(The LMR in Yeonhui-dong)

1668
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:33,358
(Korean Set Meal: It's a perfect and hearty lunch!)

1669
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,958
(Korean Set Meal: Great side dishes, It can't get better than this.)

1670
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:36,558
(Chinese food: It's perfect with beer.)

1671
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,058
(Chinese food: It's better as dinner to wrap a day with beer.)

1672
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,599
So, this is Yeonhui-dong.

1673
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:41,528
- In Yeonnam-dong... - That's for dinner.

1674
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:43,929
If we're having dinner in Yeonnam-dong,

1675
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:46,438
- we should drink, shouldn't we? - Are we drinking?

1676
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,569
(A place to enjoy the evening?)

1677
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,268
If we were to drink beer, lamb skewers might be good.

1678
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:52,478
Athletes eat a lot of mutton.

1679
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:53,778
- It's good for you. - I see.

1680
00:58:53,779 --> 00:58:54,978
There aren't many dishes...

1681
00:58:54,979 --> 00:58:56,178
- that are healthy and tasty. - Lamb skewers.

1682
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:57,808
Drinking beer with a lamb skewer is...

1683
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,148
Drinking beer with a lamb skewer.

1684
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:01,148
You have to watch the skewers turn,

1685
00:59:01,149 --> 00:59:02,289
and move them around.

1686
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:04,549
(You can watch the skewers as they spin.)

1687
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:06,958
(Lamb skewers)

1688
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:08,019
Gosh. That's...

1689
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,558
If you eat the spinning skewers,

1690
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,258
it'll cost a lot.

1691
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:14,728
You know how the skewers pile up like this?

1692
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:16,898
A bunch of steel skewers pile up.

1693
00:59:16,899 --> 00:59:19,068
I'm curious how much it will cost...

1694
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:20,969
- if you eat until you're full. - Yeonnam.

1695
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,239
Yeonnam,

1696
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:25,338
beer, and a cool place.

1697
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:26,779
- If we combine these three, - Yes?

1698
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:28,948
- we got pizza with beer. - Right. Pizza.

1699
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,908
- Pizza with beer. - Young people enjoy pizza...

1700
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,879
- with beer these days. - Yes. Pizza with beer.

1701
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:38,149
(Enjoy various flavors with diverse toppings.)

1702
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:43,028
(Pizza)

1703
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:44,788
(So, here's today's DMR.)

1704
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,098
(Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1705
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:48,429
Lamb skewers with beer.

1706
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:49,799
- Or pizza with beer. - I love them both.

1707
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:51,698
- I love both options. - We have to choose now.

1708
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:52,799
How should I decide?

1709
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:55,809
I'll be on Rhymer's team.

1710
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:57,609
Me too.

1711
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:00,708
- Then the four of us... - You too?

1712
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:02,379
- Me too. - should play rock-paper-scissors.

1713
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:04,378
The winner gets to choose...

1714
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:05,648
- to be on Rhymer's team first. - Then let's do this.

1715
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:06,819
Rhymer, which one are you going to choose?

1716
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,549
Gosh. What is this...

1717
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:10,719
Gosh.

1718
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,758
He's Rhymer, the Pied Piper.

1719
01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:14,488
- Rhymer, the Pied Piper. - Goodness.

1720
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,158
I'm good at making this kind of decisions.

1721
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:17,229
- Okay. - When I think about it,

1722
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,559
I don't really like various toppings.

1723
01:00:21,029 --> 01:00:22,429
Instead of choosing the pizza with beer,

1724
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:25,198
I'll choose the lamb skewers with beer because...

1725
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,338
- I've really been craving... - I'll choose lamb skewers.

1726
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:27,938
- lamb skewers today. - I came up with the lamb skewers.

1727
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:29,808
- I came up with them. - I...

1728
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,878
I really wanted to drink beer with lamb skewers.

1729
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,238
- Which one do you prefer? - What?

1730
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:35,708
- What about you? - Both of them are fine with me,

1731
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:36,908
so I'll go with Rhymer.

1732
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:39,318
(I'll go with Rhymer.)

1733
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:40,779
Lamb with beer, pizza with beer, and Rhymer with beer.

1734
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,248
- Rhymer with beer. - I'll choose Rhymer with beer.

1735
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:44,418
Rhymer with beer, it's up to you.

1736
01:00:44,419 --> 01:00:45,458
- Choose two people. - Yes.

1737
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:47,859
Once a team, always a team.

1738
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,029
That's what I believe in.

1739
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,128
- Once a team, - I knew it.

1740
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:53,298
I'll go until the end.

1741
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:54,659
No wonder he's a CEO of an entertainment company.

1742
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:56,529
That's who I am.

1743
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:57,799
- Cool. - Amazing.

1744
01:00:57,999 --> 01:00:59,338
In that case, Team Pizza with Beer is...

1745
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,098
- Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun. - Okay.

1746
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:02,908
And Team Lamb Skewers with Beer is...

1747
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,569
the same. It's Rhymer, Seung Ho, and me.

1748
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:06,878
(It's time to pay.)

1749
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:07,879
Thank you for the meal.

1750
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,408
- Did you enjoy it? - Yes.

1751
01:01:09,409 --> 01:01:10,908
I didn't really get to taste it, though.

1752
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,119
(Total: 142 dollars)

1753
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:14,478
(Accumulated Rhymer's payment, Total: 377 dollars)

1754
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:15,488
Yes. Thank you.

1755
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:16,918
- Thank you. We enjoyed it. - Thank you.

1756
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:17,989
Bye.

1757
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:21,261
(The sun starts to set before they know it.)

1758
01:01:21,731 --> 01:01:24,130
(Around dinner time after work, )

1759
01:01:24,131 --> 01:01:27,301
(people gather around this neighborhood.)

1760
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:29,371
(Yeonnam)

1761
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:34,410
(Yeonnam-dong)

1762
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:36,911
(Workers as well as foreigners)

1763
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:38,340
(In this area...)

1764
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:41,581
(where there are so many good dishes that can be enjoyed with alcohol, )

1765
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:47,721
(which dish will the members get to eat first?)

1766
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,390
(Current time: 6pm)

1767
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:52,360
Yeonnam-dong is the place for youngsters.

1768
01:01:52,361 --> 01:01:54,661
Gosh. Don't say, "The place for youngsters."

1769
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:55,961
For goodness' sake.

1770
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,760
- It's the place for youngsters. - "Youngsters."

1771
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:58,930
It's the town of the new generation.

1772
01:01:58,931 --> 01:01:59,931
- The new generation. - Exactly.

1773
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:01,230
- He said, "the new generation." - Right?

1774
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:02,601
- Isn't it? - The Orange Clan?

1775
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:05,441
The older brothers are excited about coming to Yeonnam-dong...

1776
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:09,111
filled with youngsters from the new generation.

1777
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:11,980
Gosh. It looks like this when this isn't even the main road?

1778
01:02:11,981 --> 01:02:13,651
Gosh. I like the vibe here.

1779
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:17,651
We'll have lamb skewers while drinking cold beer.

1780
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:20,351
Gosh. This place looks special.

1781
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:21,821
It's a pizza place.

1782
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:22,960
- What? - It looks special.

1783
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,260
- Do they have pizza here? - It's a pizza place.

1784
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:25,560
- Where? - Okay.

1785
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:27,360
I can tell it's an alleyway...

1786
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,931
- of pizza places. - How?

1787
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,131
- What is this? - Where is it?

1788
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,430
That's the vibe. I think it's that place.

1789
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:34,730
- Here. It's here. - The second floor.

1790
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:35,740
- Here. - Yes.

1791
01:02:35,741 --> 01:02:37,341
- It's here. - That's right.

1792
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:40,571
- Gosh. - It's Rat Pizza House.

1793
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:45,411
(A famous pizza place in Yeonnam-dong)

1794
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:50,281
(The minimal decor generates a cool vibe.)

1795
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:52,890
(They have a special pizza...)

1796
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:55,721
(that can only be enjoyed here.)

1797
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:01,590
(DMR 1: Pizza)

1798
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:02,830
Hello.

1799
01:03:02,831 --> 01:03:04,301
- Hello. - It's here.

1800
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:06,830
- Hold on. These are our seats. - It's here.

1801
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:08,470
The three of us will sit here.

1802
01:03:08,471 --> 01:03:10,340
Rhymer and the boys can sit here.

1803
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:12,541
Come.

1804
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:14,370
The lamb skewer place might be cool too.

1805
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:15,611
The lamb skewers are hip-hop.

1806
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:17,981
- The vibe is pretty. - I like it.

1807
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:20,050
- It has a pretty vibe. - I love it.

1808
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:21,551
(Both teams take their seats.)

1809
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:23,150
Look how they've decorated the place.

1810
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:24,751
It's a pizza place.

1811
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:28,191
Their signature dish is the chicken skin pizza.

1812
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:30,020
What is a chicken skin pizza?

1813
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:31,521
(A chicken skin pizza is an unfamiliar dish.)

1814
01:03:31,691 --> 01:03:32,961
Why is it called Rat Pizza?

1815
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:34,761
A rat is like a mouse.

1816
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,600
Does it have to do with rats?

1817
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:37,700
- Why is it? - I love pizzas.

1818
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:39,371
Why did you name it Rat Pizza?

1819
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:42,441
Is Rat just a name?

1820
01:03:43,071 --> 01:03:45,501
I listened to hip-hop when I was young.

1821
01:03:45,771 --> 01:03:48,711
When you say, "I like that" quickly...

1822
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:50,611
Hip-hop. Brand New Music.

1823
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:53,210
(Big Daddy greets a hip-hop fan.)

1824
01:03:53,211 --> 01:03:54,251
- Gosh. - Hip-hop.

1825
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,651
Do you know him?

1826
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,221
- Yes. - No?

1827
01:03:57,281 --> 01:03:58,720
He's a fencer.

1828
01:03:58,721 --> 01:03:59,750
I'm Brand New Music's...

1829
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,321
- A fencer? - A fencer? Gosh.

1830
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:03,121
- I... - What did he say?

1831
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:04,491
What?

1832
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:06,461
He thinks he's Sang Uk.

1833
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:07,590
Sang Uk, Oh Sang Uk.

1834
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:09,230
- I don't really watch TV. - He thinks you're Sang Uk.

1835
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:10,231
Sorry.

1836
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:13,301
Do you know a rapper called Rhymer?

1837
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:15,530
- Rhymer? - It's as if time has stopped

1838
01:04:15,531 --> 01:04:16,871
As soon as I saw you

1839
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:20,110
(It's as if time has stopped as soon as I saw you)

1840
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:21,140
(Promoting himself)

1841
01:04:21,141 --> 01:04:22,781
Do you know him?

1842
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:25,040
- I do know him. - Do you?

1843
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,050
- Do you know him? - Yes.

1844
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:27,380
- Do you know him? - Yes, I do.

1845
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:29,320
- I've only listened to his songs. - Right. You know the songs,

1846
01:04:29,321 --> 01:04:30,380
but you haven't seen him.

1847
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:32,120
- He's Rhymer. - I'm Rhymer

1848
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:33,121
(Your saver)

1849
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:34,650
(I stand against all evil deeds)

1850
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:36,291
I stand against all evil deeds

1851
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:38,760
(Down-to-earth old-school rhymes)

1852
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,991
(He loves it.)

1853
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,130
- Thank you. - No problem.

1854
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:43,131
(Touched)

1855
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:45,001
He's enlivened as we talk about hip-hop.

1856
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,500
- Pizza is hip-hop. - Really?

1857
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:49,470
- Pizza is hip-hop. - I see.

1858
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:51,700
(The pizza place in Yeonnam-dong is filled with hip-hop.)

1859
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:53,641
By the way, I'm curious about something.

1860
01:04:53,771 --> 01:04:55,910
- A chicken skin pizza... - Exactly.

1861
01:04:55,911 --> 01:04:57,840
Sounds so unfamiliar.

1862
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,811
How did you come up with it?

1863
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:04,721
I loved both pizzas and fried chicken so much.

1864
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:07,950
I thought it'd be nice to enjoy them at the same time.

1865
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:11,720
At that time, the fried chicken skin...

1866
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:14,131
- was starting to get popular. - Right. It was in trend.

1867
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:15,630
- That was how. - Then...

1868
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,630
- is your signature dish... - The signature dish.

1869
01:05:17,631 --> 01:05:19,030
- the chicken skin pizza? - Yes.

1870
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:21,301
- Chicken skin pizza? - We have to order it.

1871
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:23,070
As for the chicken skin pizza,

1872
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:24,341
there are spicy sauce and soy sauce.

1873
01:05:24,471 --> 01:05:26,711
- Can we order half and half? - Yes.

1874
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:28,241
- Then let's order that. - Then that one.

1875
01:05:28,441 --> 01:05:30,611
Okay. We'll have that one and...

1876
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:33,350
Why are they making an order when we have to?

1877
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,180
- You seemed less excited. - No.

1878
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,720
We'll have the chicken skin pizza with spicy and soy sauce.

1879
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,350
- Also. - And four pizzas...

1880
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,490
- It's a four-flavor pizza. - What is that?

1881
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,591
What are in it?

1882
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:44,660
- You can choose. - I see.

1883
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:46,231
You go ahead and mix up four toppings.

1884
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:48,531
Do you have the one with a drizzle of sweet potato mousse?

1885
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:49,730
- For that, - A cheese crusted one.

1886
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,560
There's one with bacon and sweet potatoes.

1887
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:52,570
- Is there? - Yes.

1888
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:54,101
- I don't like those. - Do you have it?

1889
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,501
I love them.

1890
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:57,400
Sweet potato pizzas are my favorite.

1891
01:05:57,401 --> 01:06:00,510
Hey. That's a disgrace to pizzas.

1892
01:06:00,511 --> 01:06:01,810
- Why? - Seriously.

1893
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:02,940
- I mean... - Dong Hyun,

1894
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:04,580
just order the cheddar cheese pizza instead.

1895
01:06:04,581 --> 01:06:06,310
- Yes, do that. - That's the original.

1896
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:07,650
Or pepperonis.

1897
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:09,150
- Yes. Pepperonis are the basics. - Yes.

1898
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:10,780
- Order the basic topping. - We're the ones eating,

1899
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:12,750
but why are they choosing everything?

1900
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,050
That's the Rat Style.

1901
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:15,250
(Come on.)

1902
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,721
Come on. Why not?

1903
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,920
Okay. I got it.

1904
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:20,560
- And... Okay. - Yes.

1905
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,600
- What else? - Should we order it here?

1906
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:25,231
- Garlic potatoes. - Garlic potatoes.

1907
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:26,600
- Pepperonis? - Pepperonis.

1908
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:27,670
Okay.

1909
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:29,241
- And... - And...

1910
01:06:29,371 --> 01:06:30,800
- A cheddar cheese pizza. - Cheddar.

1911
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:32,040
Sweet potatoes and corn.

1912
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,841
- That wasn't it. - It wasn't corn.

1913
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,210
(Orders: Garlic potato, pepperoni, sweet potato and bacon)

1914
01:06:35,211 --> 01:06:36,211
(Corn)

1915
01:06:36,212 --> 01:06:37,710
- This is it. The sweet potatoes. - Okay. Are we good?

1916
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:39,180
- No, not the corn. - Not the corn.

1917
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:40,710
- We said cheddar cheese. - Gosh.

1918
01:06:40,711 --> 01:06:42,480
He craves corn now.

1919
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:44,081
I think corn will taste good too.

1920
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:45,680
- Pepperonis. Good. - Pepperonis.

1921
01:06:45,681 --> 01:06:47,951
- Let's add the corn too. - Just go with four, man!

1922
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,361
(Just go with 4, man!)

1923
01:06:50,461 --> 01:06:51,461
Just go with four!

1924
01:06:51,462 --> 01:06:54,391
- Let's add some corn, please. - This is the rap style, man.

1925
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:56,060
I want some corn.

1926
01:06:56,061 --> 01:06:57,100
(What is going on?)

1927
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:59,171
Please make it five toppings and add some corn.

1928
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,330
- No, man! - I'm sorry.

1929
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,601
Please add some corn.

1930
01:07:04,071 --> 01:07:05,441
I love corn.

1931
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:08,040
(It becomes a corn pizza as he wishes.)

1932
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,310
I'll get it ready quickly.

1933
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:10,880
- It'll be 4.5 toppings. - Right.

1934
01:07:10,881 --> 01:07:12,611
You would all want some beer too.

1935
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:15,580
- Of course. - You would want some beer.

1936
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:17,581
- I do want some beer. - I'm thirsty.

1937
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:20,350
It would be great to clink all of our glasses together.

1938
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:21,850
Wouldn't it be better to get over with the quiz quickly...

1939
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,320
and have all three drink together?

1940
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:24,360
Right.

1941
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:25,760
We'll do it before the food gets served.

1942
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:26,990
- Either way... - It's for eating together...

1943
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:28,190
from the start.

1944
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,230
Right.

1945
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:30,860
Are you guys okay with that?

1946
01:07:30,861 --> 01:07:32,870
- The winner will eat. - I think that'll be a good idea.

1947
01:07:32,871 --> 01:07:35,201
- Okay. - Naming the capital of the country.

1948
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:36,971
This will be really hard.

1949
01:07:37,371 --> 01:07:39,611
- We're doomed! - This will be really hard.

1950
01:07:39,741 --> 01:07:41,071
This will be really hard.

1951
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:43,410
- We'll do it like earlier? - Right.

1952
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:45,311
- Right. - One, two, three.

1953
01:07:46,711 --> 01:07:47,980
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

1954
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,681
We'll start with Yi Kyung and move in.

1955
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:52,521
- Republic of Korea. - Seoul.

1956
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:55,351
- Thank you. - That's the order.

1957
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,921
- Thailand. - Thailand? Bangkok.

1958
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,190
- Japan. - Tokyo.

1959
01:08:01,191 --> 01:08:02,900
The first round was a freebie. It will start now.

1960
01:08:02,901 --> 01:08:03,901
The first round was easy.

1961
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:05,401
Italy.

1962
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,431
Hold on. I can think about this, can't I?

1963
01:08:08,971 --> 01:08:11,470
- Five, four, - I can have some time to think.

1964
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,070
Three, two,

1965
01:08:13,071 --> 01:08:14,271
- Milan? - One.

1966
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:15,910
- Incorrect. - Incorrect.

1967
01:08:15,911 --> 01:08:17,010
(Incorrect)

1968
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:18,310
- Rome. - Isn't it Rome?

1969
01:08:18,311 --> 01:08:20,110
- It's Rome. - It's Rome.

1970
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:21,950
I understand Yi Kyung though. This is why.

1971
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:23,880
When we have events, we never go to Rome.

1972
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,891
- They are usually in Milan. - They are usually in Milan.

1973
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:30,060
What does that have to do...

1974
01:08:30,061 --> 01:08:31,920
with the capital?

1975
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:33,960
What does you having events there have to do with it?

1976
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:35,860
- Milan is known for soccer too. - Right.

1977
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:36,900
AC Milan and Inter Milan.

1978
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:38,760
- AC Milan. - Okay.

1979
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:40,400
All right. One person is out.

1980
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:42,271
- I got eliminated again. - I got reminded of that.

1981
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:45,101
- You two will go back and forth. - Right.

1982
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:47,270
- France. - Paris.

1983
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:48,341
Right.

1984
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:51,211
- China. - Beijing.

1985
01:08:51,281 --> 01:08:52,281
Beijing.

1986
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:54,151
Vietnam.

1987
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:57,021
I know this one.

1988
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:59,491
Five, four...

1989
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:01,790
(He takes longer to think.)

1990
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:02,891
Hold on!

1991
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:05,261
- Hold on! - Go for it.

1992
01:09:05,561 --> 01:09:08,230
- It's 1 out of 2 choices. - Right. Top or bottom.

1993
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,631
- But... - It's top or bottom.

1994
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,830
It's not Hanoi,

1995
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:13,701
but I can't think of the other one.

1996
01:09:13,831 --> 01:09:15,900
- You can't think of it? - I lost the name.

1997
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,470
Go for it with the other place.

1998
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:18,940
Right. It isn't Hanoi.

1999
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:20,910
- It's that one. - It's that place!

2000
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:21,941
Go for it.

2001
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:23,911
- It's placed up north. - Right.

2002
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,751
I suddenly can't remember. I must be out of my mind.

2003
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:29,051
Vietnam.

2004
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:31,520
(Vietnam)

2005
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:32,521
Ho Chi Minh City!

2006
01:09:32,551 --> 01:09:34,121
- Gosh. - It's Hanoi.

2007
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:37,991
It's Hanoi.

2008
01:09:37,992 --> 01:09:41,230
(Laughing)

2009
01:09:41,231 --> 01:09:42,430
My gosh!

2010
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:44,300
(Hanoi)

2011
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:45,501
He went with Ho Chi Minh City.

2012
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:48,401
I love you, Rhymer.

2013
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:51,640
Gosh. I mean...

2014
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:53,141
(Hanoi is up north, actually.)

2015
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:54,971
There's nothing...

2016
01:09:55,211 --> 01:09:57,240
Rhymer can do today.

2017
01:09:57,241 --> 01:09:59,551
(The Hip-Hop Big Daddy cannot be saved.)

2018
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:02,211
Be honest with us. You're here to take Sang Uk's position, right?

2019
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:04,520
- Aren't I right? - Gosh.

2020
01:10:04,521 --> 01:10:06,390
This is hilarious.

2021
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:09,561
- My gosh. - Why did I think it wasn't Hanoi?

2022
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:11,760
Right. I was confused why he thought Hanoi was wrong.

2023
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:13,361
I love this guy.

2024
01:10:13,561 --> 01:10:15,530
Seung Ho will have all of the food, right?

2025
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,030
- Right. - Right.

2026
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:18,131
I'll join in.

2027
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:21,601
- Would you prefer pizza or beer? - Beer would be better.

2028
01:10:22,201 --> 01:10:23,341
Then it should be pizza.

2029
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:26,441
I do want to try some of the chicken skin pizza too.

2030
01:10:26,711 --> 01:10:29,070
- I am curious about it. - Right.

2031
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:31,041
I do want to try some of the chicken skin pizza.

2032
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:32,980
Then choose out of the two.

2033
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:34,710
- I choose the chicken skin pizza. - I choose beer.

2034
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:35,981
- Sure. - I've made up my mind.

2035
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:37,380
- Okay. - All right.

2036
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:38,480
We'll begin.

2037
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:39,490
(Bonus round of the quiz for the freeloaders)

2038
01:10:39,491 --> 01:10:41,951
All right. What is the capital of Canada?

2039
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,060
I know. This one is too easy.

2040
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:45,120
Would you like a chance?

2041
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,730
- I definitely know it. - I definitely know it too.

2042
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:48,190
- It's three syllables. - I've been there too.

2043
01:10:48,191 --> 01:10:49,500
- It's three syllables. - Right.

2044
01:10:49,501 --> 01:10:52,631
- Toronto. - Gosh! No. It's Ottawa.

2045
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:54,070
Ottawa.

2046
01:10:54,071 --> 01:10:55,200
(Ottawa versus Toronto)

2047
01:10:55,201 --> 01:10:56,201
Correct.

2048
01:10:56,202 --> 01:10:58,300
(Ottawa wins.)

2049
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,301
Correct.

2050
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:01,541
(On fire with 2 consecutive losses)

2051
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:03,711
It seems like you do not know anything.

2052
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,280
My gosh.

2053
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:06,310
(Sighing)

2054
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:09,011
I was thinking if it was Vancouver.

2055
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:11,250
It would be confusing as it's really famous.

2056
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:13,250
- Right. - There are those places.

2057
01:11:13,251 --> 01:11:14,451
He said he went there.

2058
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,491
I lived in Canada when I was young.

2059
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:20,231
- I see. - I lived in Kingston.

2060
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,031
- Why? - I went back and forth.

2061
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:25,300
- Can I not be there? - Well...

2062
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:26,331
Why ask?

2063
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:28,901
I'm just asking, man!

2064
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,370
- Can I not be there? - "Man!"

2065
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:31,441
Gosh.

2066
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:33,241
You keep getting on my nerves!

2067
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:36,580
(The 2nd quarrel begins.)

2068
01:11:36,581 --> 01:11:38,010
- Can't I ask about that? - No.

2069
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,310
- Why are you... - What's wrong with that?

2070
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:41,280
So offensive about it?

2071
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,310
I was just asking.

2072
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:43,580
- No. - I was just asking.

2073
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:45,621
This isn't hip-hop.

2074
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:48,720
(The mediator reappears.)

2075
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,091
Let's have a glass together.

2076
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,631
(You guys are better than this.)

2077
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:55,690
Let's have a glass together and make up with each other.

2078
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:56,730
All right.

2079
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:57,801
(I was being too sensitive.)

2080
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:02,101
(I will listen to you.)

2081
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:05,241
(Getting things solved)

2082
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:08,341
(You guys should stop.)

2083
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:11,280
Gosh, Rhymer is just mediating things today.

2084
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:13,751
That's all he's doing. He can't even eat.

2085
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:15,010
He paid for the food too.

2086
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:17,580
He's a true man of peace.

2087
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:18,780
(The true mediator that lives for peace)

2088
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,321
He's like Switzerland.

2089
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:22,191
Right.

2090
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:23,861
What is the capital of Switzerland?

2091
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:25,221
It is Zurich.

2092
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:27,730
- It's Bern. - He got it wrong again?

2093
01:12:27,731 --> 01:12:28,731
You got it wrong again?

2094
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,130
The beer is here.

2095
01:12:30,131 --> 01:12:31,761
(Four glasses of beer get served first.)

2096
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:33,971
I missed this so much.

2097
01:12:35,471 --> 01:12:36,540
It looks refreshing.

2098
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,740
(Jealous)

2099
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:38,971
- All right. - All right.

2100
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:41,041
- Cheers! - Cheers!

2101
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:49,621
(Water)

2102
01:12:51,821 --> 01:12:54,220
(Feeling bitter)

2103
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:55,720
The pizza is here!

2104
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:57,521
(The pizza gets served right after too.)

2105
01:12:58,091 --> 01:12:59,831
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2106
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:01,331
This is the chicken skin pizza?

2107
01:13:01,631 --> 01:13:02,760
This part is seasoned, and this part is the soy sauce base.

2108
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:04,761
(The signature chicken skin pizza makes an appearance.)

2109
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,270
This is the perfect combination of pizza and chicken.

2110
01:13:07,271 --> 01:13:09,131
This is amazing. I've never seen anything like this.

2111
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:13,411
- This part is the soy sauce base. - Right. This part is seasoned.

2112
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:16,911
(On top of the cheese pizza with a tomato base, )

2113
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,011
(the fried chicken skin is added.)

2114
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:26,191
(The savoriness and crunchiness can be enjoyed together.)

2115
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,620
- It looks like fried chicken. - Right.

2116
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:30,821
(Chicken skin pizza, spicy and soy sauce)

2117
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:34,591
(The representative pizzas can be enjoyed at once.)

2118
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:38,430
(The 4-flavor pizza)

2119
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:40,071
(Garlic potato, corn, sweet potato bacon, pepperoni)

2120
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:43,001
The seasoned one is the signature dish, right?

2121
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,540
- That is the seasoned one. - Right.

2122
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:46,340
(Tae Hyun picks up the seasoned chicken skin pizza first.)

2123
01:13:46,341 --> 01:13:48,271
Gosh, the cheese is great too.

2124
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,880
What will you go for first? The corn pizza?

2125
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:52,011
I like the corn pizza.

2126
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:56,080
(Tae Hyun gets the pizza for the younger one.)

2127
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:57,320
That's great. Thank you.

2128
01:13:57,321 --> 01:13:59,991
Gosh, Tae Hyun!

2129
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,421
That's great. Thank you.

2130
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:03,990
(Corn falling)

2131
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:05,021
The corn!

2132
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,890
(Disappointed)

2133
01:14:06,891 --> 01:14:07,931
- Gosh. - Tae Hyun!

2134
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:09,491
They all fell out.

2135
01:14:10,361 --> 01:14:11,431
Do it yourself.

2136
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:13,631
Come on!

2137
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:14,871
(I did so much to get the corn.)

2138
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,041
Gosh, thank you for the food.

2139
01:14:18,571 --> 01:14:19,571
That looks amazing.

2140
01:14:19,572 --> 01:14:20,741
(Smacking his lips)

2141
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:23,041
(He scrapes up the toppings that have fallen.)

2142
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:26,551
(Crunchy)

2143
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:32,350
(Groaning)

2144
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:33,750
This totally tastes like...

2145
01:14:33,751 --> 01:14:35,191
- seasoned chicken. - Really?

2146
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,491
It's topped on the pizza.

2147
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:38,521
I'm curious about the soy sauce base.

2148
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:43,831
Look at Tae Hyun! This is a rare sight.

2149
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,471
(Satisfied)

2150
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,470
(Eyes opening wide)

2151
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:53,710
If there are people who are torn about having pizza or chicken,

2152
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:54,811
they should definitely have this.

2153
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:57,340
There's no doubt about that.

2154
01:14:57,341 --> 01:14:58,610
This is the only place that has this.

2155
01:14:58,611 --> 01:15:01,011
As it's chicken skin, it doesn't feel heavy.

2156
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:05,421
(The chicken skin pizza has a crunchy texture.)

2157
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:08,721
This looks amazing.

2158
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,220
This is hard to eat. All of it is falling off.

2159
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,331
What is this?

2160
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:14,961
All of the corn has fallen off.

2161
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:16,501
That's the Gen MZ pizza.

2162
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:18,031
All of it should fall off.

2163
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:20,701
My gosh!

2164
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:23,370
All of it should fall off.

2165
01:15:23,371 --> 01:15:25,301
(Stretching out)

2166
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,371
(The Gen MZ pizza stretches out endlessly.)

2167
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:29,511
This is great.

2168
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:31,711
The cheese stretches out really well.

2169
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:34,481
The cheese is thick, and the dough is thin.

2170
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:37,420
The cheese is thick and chewy.

2171
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,421
Right.

2172
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:40,191
(Taking a bite of the pizza...)

2173
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,561
(and scraping up the corn that has fallen)

2174
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:48,890
(Seung Ho who has become a freeloader starts eating too!)

2175
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:50,401
Eat it like this.

2176
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:55,031
Seung Ho has to eat lamb skewers too. That's amazing.

2177
01:15:55,071 --> 01:15:56,700
- He's able to eat it. - He's able to eat it.

2178
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:59,601
It means it's good if Seung Ho is willing to eat it.

2179
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:06,381
(Enjoying the chicken skin pizza with the dough now)

2180
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:10,881
(Frown of truth)

2181
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:14,251
Shouldn't there be one more person to describe the taste?

2182
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:16,520
It will be based on preference,

2183
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:17,720
but I like the soy sauce base a lot more.

2184
01:16:17,721 --> 01:16:19,661
- You prefer the soy sauce base? - Yes.

2185
01:16:20,331 --> 01:16:22,561
(Having some beer after eating the pizza)

2186
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:26,500
It's like the pizza is topped with seasoned fried chicken.

2187
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:28,201
It's like dakgangjeong.

2188
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,100
Could there be a chance for one of us...

2189
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:31,941
to have a slice?

2190
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:33,771
A slice of any pizza.

2191
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:36,041
Finish this up first.

2192
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,911
I was waiting to have some with the beer.

2193
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:40,280
You're not drinking it as you're not eating the pizza.

2194
01:16:40,281 --> 01:16:42,711
(Yi Kyung must really want the pizza.)

2195
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:43,881
You should do that then.

2196
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:46,321
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2197
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:47,520
Let's play rock-paper-scissors since it's simple.

2198
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,521
- It'll end too quickly. - It's okay.

2199
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:51,161
This time as well,

2200
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,661
I'll play scissors as I did earlier.

2201
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:54,430
Gosh, what's this?

2202
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:56,190
Do you want to eat or not?

2203
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,400
- Seriously. - I don't understand.

2204
01:16:57,401 --> 01:16:58,700
- Will you really play scissors? - Yes.

2205
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:00,131
What do you want me to play?

2206
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:01,971
I want you to play rock.

2207
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:04,471
- Don't you want to eat? - Well,

2208
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,970
his drink is ready. If I win, I'll only get pizza.

2209
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:10,111
I think it'll be better to give...

2210
01:17:10,141 --> 01:17:12,411
both the drink and the pizza to one person.

2211
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:13,711
I'm touched.

2212
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:16,581
Then I'll play as you planned and win in rock-paper-scissors.

2213
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:19,381
(Is that so?)

2214
01:17:19,451 --> 01:17:21,491
What if we order beer for the winner?

2215
01:17:22,321 --> 01:17:23,390
Well...

2216
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:24,461
Okay then.

2217
01:17:25,561 --> 01:17:28,561
(It's an unexpected variable.)

2218
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,231
- Shall we begin? - Okay.

2219
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:32,300
- Play or lose, - Play or lose,

2220
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:34,730
- rock-paper-scissors. - rock-paper-scissors.

2221
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:37,301
(Scissors, paper)

2222
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,371
- Hold on a second. Hey. - I mean...

2223
01:17:41,441 --> 01:17:43,410
- Hold on. - Hold on a second.

2224
01:17:43,411 --> 01:17:45,511
- How did this happen? - I mean...

2225
01:17:45,611 --> 01:17:47,511
Rhymer.

2226
01:17:48,211 --> 01:17:50,050
How did this happen?

2227
01:17:50,051 --> 01:17:51,720
- You promised to play scissors. - Just now...

2228
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:52,950
You promised to play scissors...

2229
01:17:52,951 --> 01:17:55,220
- and asked me to play rock. - Seriously.

2230
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:57,460
You played paper in order to beat me,

2231
01:17:57,461 --> 01:17:58,961
but I played scissors.

2232
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,361
At the end,

2233
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:03,531
Tae Hyun talked about ordering beer as well.

2234
01:18:03,761 --> 01:18:05,830
After he said that...

2235
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:09,131
(He couldn't ignore Tae Hyun's temptation.)

2236
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,870
- "I'm someone who keeps his word." - Seriously.

2237
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:13,470
Didn't you say that you always keep your word?

2238
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:15,640
- Seriously. - I'm okay with not eating,

2239
01:18:15,641 --> 01:18:17,010
but this is so embarrassing.

2240
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:19,111
I look so cheap. Seriously.

2241
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:21,111
Between this and the times table, what's more...

2242
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:22,950
Let's say you can edit out 1 of the 2.

2243
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:24,780
- You can edit out 1 of the 2. - Let's say you receive that chance.

2244
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:26,150
- That's right. - Which one do you want to edit out?

2245
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:27,551
Please edit out this one.

2246
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:29,421
It's because...

2247
01:18:29,491 --> 01:18:31,991
I appear so small-minded.

2248
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:34,290
- Seriously. - As for the times table incident,

2249
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,860
I can go, "I'm stupid!"

2250
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:39,601
I can say that.

2251
01:18:40,201 --> 01:18:43,901
(The winner, Yi Kyung takes a bite of the chicken skin pizza.)

2252
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:50,211
(Savoring the taste)

2253
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,481
Yi Kyung, how is the taste?

2254
01:18:53,581 --> 01:18:56,011
I feel like I'm eating fried chicken that has been wrapped...

2255
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:57,481
with pizza.

2256
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:59,620
It's like a wrap.

2257
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:00,690
It's like eating them at once.

2258
01:19:00,691 --> 01:19:02,120
(Gulping)

2259
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,620
Why did you talk about...

2260
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:07,160
ordering beer for the winner at the end?

2261
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:08,961
Would you give us the bill?

2262
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:10,330
The total is 104 dollars.

2263
01:19:10,331 --> 01:19:11,360
- Okay. - Okay.

2264
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:14,531
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2265
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:15,900
Please look at this.

2266
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:17,141
What?

2267
01:19:17,171 --> 01:19:18,240
(It's an object you can see easily on a delivered pizza.)

2268
01:19:18,241 --> 01:19:19,970
- That object. I know what it is. - I know what it is.

2269
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:21,871
- Yes. It's placed on a pizza. - I know what it is.

2270
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:25,211
This object is called a pizza saver.

2271
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:27,050
- A pizza saver. - I knew that.

2272
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:28,510
He learned about it on "Amazing Saturday."

2273
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,480
- Yes, it was on "Amazing Saturday." - Really?

2274
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:32,751
- I knew about it. - That isn't the question.

2275
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,251
I got excited because I thought that was the question.

2276
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,221
Although it looks like a decorative object,

2277
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:41,291
it actually serves a special purpose.

2278
01:19:41,961 --> 01:19:43,261
What could be the purpose?

2279
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:45,560
- It's too easy. - It's easy.

2280
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,500
It doesn't hold the pizza...

2281
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:49,330
- in place, does it? - What do you mean?

2282
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,970
Perhaps it keeps the pizza from moving...

2283
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:52,471
by pinning it in the middle.

2284
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:55,040
- No. - Maybe that isn't the case.

2285
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,010
- You got the answer just now. - That's how it is.

2286
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:59,540
- We got the answer? What was it? - That's right.

2287
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,350
- Well... - Did we guess correctly?

2288
01:20:02,351 --> 01:20:04,120
It's because of the heat.

2289
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:05,821
I read about it somewhere.

2290
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:07,450
I'm serious.

2291
01:20:07,451 --> 01:20:09,521
Why are you solving it with them?

2292
01:20:09,821 --> 01:20:11,220
- I mean... - Because of the heat,

2293
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,720
- the pizza box gets pushed down. - That's right.

2294
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:13,830
- Yes. - Okay.

2295
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,990
Let's go with Rhymer's answer.

2296
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,031
All right.

2297
01:20:17,301 --> 01:20:18,360
Let me answer.

2298
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,570
- Why did they make a pizza saver? - They made it...

2299
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,731
because of the reason Rhymer mentioned.

2300
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:25,000
Due to humidity...

2301
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:27,470
or other pizza boxes, the top can get crushed.

2302
01:20:27,471 --> 01:20:29,370
When there's a pizza saver,

2303
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,381
it keeps the box and the toppings from touching.

2304
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:36,480
It keeps the box and the toppings from touching.

2305
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:37,650
- Yes. - That's right.

2306
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:40,521
(Will it be like the last time?)

2307
01:20:41,151 --> 01:20:42,620
- It's correct, right? - Correct.

2308
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:43,820
(It keeps the box and the toppings from touching.)

2309
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:44,921
Rhymer!

2310
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:46,760
Rhymer, come on.

2311
01:20:46,761 --> 01:20:49,161
- Thank you. - Rhymer.

2312
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,731
- You were exactly right, Rhymer. - Seriously.

2313
01:20:52,001 --> 01:20:54,830
- Why did you tell them everything? - Thank you.

2314
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:57,140
- You told them about the heat too. - Seriously.

2315
01:20:57,141 --> 01:20:58,141
Why...

2316
01:20:58,142 --> 01:20:59,301
did I do that?

2317
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:02,010
- You told them about the heat. - I feel like...

2318
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:04,040
I'm in a trance. Seriously.

2319
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,740
- Thank you. - You told them about the heat.

2320
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,151
Did you know it for certain?

2321
01:21:07,211 --> 01:21:09,981
- I read about it somewhere. - He knew it.

2322
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:12,450
(Team Pizza succeeds in the quiz.)

2323
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,620
(Team Lamb Skewer will now have a quiz to decide who pays.)

2324
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:15,090
You know,

2325
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:18,691
you should give me a quiz I can answer correctly.

2326
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:20,690
As you know,

2327
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:23,631
I can do well when the question is high-class.

2328
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:25,430
- Let's have a quiz. - Really?

2329
01:21:25,431 --> 01:21:26,671
The person who answers correctly will be exempt.

2330
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:29,500
Yeonnam-dong and Yeonhui-dong are the neighborhoods...

2331
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:31,600
that get a lot of foreign tourists.

2332
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:34,970
According to the data, foreign tourists buy...

2333
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:38,111
the most amount of clothes in Hongdae.

2334
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,810
Now, say the names of the neighborhoods...

2335
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:45,451
that match the following description.

2336
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:48,851
- Foreigners buy clothes in Hongdae, - Okay.

2337
01:21:49,491 --> 01:21:52,291
Cosmetic products in "Blank,"

2338
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:56,161
meals in "Blank,"

2339
01:21:56,661 --> 01:22:00,070
and clothes and coffee in "Blank."

2340
01:22:00,071 --> 01:22:01,400
Do we need to get all three of them?

2341
01:22:01,401 --> 01:22:03,001
- Say one first. - Let me answer.

2342
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:04,601
I think...

2343
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:05,770
(Foreigners buy cosmetic products in "Blank.")

2344
01:22:05,771 --> 01:22:08,671
they buy cosmetic products near the Ewha Womans University.

2345
01:22:08,811 --> 01:22:10,840
(How did he answer...)

2346
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:12,940
(so fast?)

2347
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:14,851
- Near the Ewha Womans University? - Yes.

2348
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:16,011
Incorrect.

2349
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:18,081
Let me ask you something.

2350
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:20,550
- There's no way they travel far. - All right.

2351
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:22,651
They buy clothes in Hongdae.

2352
01:22:22,691 --> 01:22:25,690
- There's no way they travel far. - Seriously.

2353
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,230
- Was that your approach? - I mean...

2354
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:29,690
- Think about it. - Hongdae.

2355
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,130
- They buy clothes in Hongdae. - They begin in Hongdae.

2356
01:22:31,131 --> 01:22:33,101
- They walk. - Yes.

2357
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:35,601
There's no way they go to Cheongdam-dong.

2358
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:37,870
He doesn't understand the key point of the question.

2359
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:39,401
(Cheongdam-dong is quite far.)

2360
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:40,510
Should we give the subway station?

2361
01:22:40,511 --> 01:22:42,411
- The area. - The neighborhood.

2362
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:44,040
I'll give it a go. Let me answer.

2363
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,741
They buy cosmetic products in Myeongdong.

2364
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,781
They buy cosmetic products in Myeongdong?

2365
01:22:48,651 --> 01:22:49,711
Correct.

2366
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:53,020
(Yi Kyung is exempt from paying for the meal.)

2367
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:54,721
- Correct. - My goodness.

2368
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:56,691
It isn't over yet.

2369
01:22:57,221 --> 01:22:58,761
Would you repeat the question?

2370
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,791
They buy cosmetic products in Myeongdong.

2371
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:03,801
What would come next, you punk?

2372
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:05,330
Please repeat it.

2373
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:06,630
What would they do?

2374
01:23:06,631 --> 01:23:08,471
They would have a meal.

2375
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:10,301
- Please repeat it. - Meals.

2376
01:23:11,271 --> 01:23:13,040
Meals and clothes and coffee.

2377
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,510
(The neighborhoods for meals and clothes and coffee remain.)

2378
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:16,881
I see that they travel a lot.

2379
01:23:17,181 --> 01:23:18,510
- Seriously. - Rhymer.

2380
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:20,310
- They travel around Seoul. - Seriously.

2381
01:23:20,311 --> 01:23:21,381
The itinerary is...

2382
01:23:21,451 --> 01:23:24,020
- ineffective for a single day. - They travel a lot.

2383
01:23:24,021 --> 01:23:26,080
(We never said that it was an itinerary for a single day.)

2384
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:28,420
- All right. I'll give it a go. - Seung Ho will give it a go.

2385
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:29,891
They buy clothes and coffee in Gangnam.

2386
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,561
Gangnam is incorrect.

2387
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:33,460
Let me answer. Sinchon for clothes and coffee.

2388
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:34,591
- Incorrect. - Let me answer.

2389
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,131
- Yeonnam for clothes and coffee. - Incorrect.

2390
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:39,060
Don't you know this neighborhood?

2391
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:40,531
(There's great confusion.)

2392
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:44,170
(Thinking)

2393
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:45,370
Despite everything,

2394
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:47,711
it's the center of Korea.

2395
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:50,411
Let me answer. Jongno for meals.

2396
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:51,911
- Jongno for meals? - Yes.

2397
01:23:52,011 --> 01:23:53,910
Jongno for meals.

2398
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:55,451
- Jongno for meals? - Yes.

2399
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,850
Jongno-gu.

2400
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:57,980
Correct.

2401
01:23:57,981 --> 01:23:59,751
(Answer: Foreigners eat in Jongno.)

2402
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:02,691
Finally.

2403
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:04,191
Finally.

2404
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:07,130
(Impossible...)

2405
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:09,730
(is nothing.)

2406
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:12,260
- I'm so happy for you. - Thank you.

2407
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,771
- I shouldn't be so happy about it. - Seriously.

2408
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:17,340
- It must be unsightly. Is it okay? - Seriously.

2409
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:19,440
- You were way too happy. - My goodness.

2410
01:24:19,441 --> 01:24:21,510
If they go from Hongdae to Jongno,

2411
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:23,041
they walk a lot.

2412
01:24:23,881 --> 01:24:25,210
How does it feel to get one right?

2413
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:26,541
You know,

2414
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:28,750
- I feel so uncomfortable. - Why?

2415
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:30,781
- Seung Ho is the youngest. - Rhymer.

2416
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:33,620
- I'm happy to pay. - Really?

2417
01:24:33,621 --> 01:24:35,751
Thanks to you, I laughed so much today.

2418
01:24:36,091 --> 01:24:37,790
I'm happy...

2419
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,120
to break the vicious cycle...

2420
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:41,460
- of you paying. - Still,

2421
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:43,630
- he's the youngest member. - It's okay.

2422
01:24:43,631 --> 01:24:44,730
What should we do then?

2423
01:24:44,731 --> 01:24:46,260
- You should pay. - Shall we have another quiz?

2424
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:48,131
While I got the correct answer, Jongno,

2425
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:50,401
I'll pay in a cool way.

2426
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:53,240
- I just needed to prove... - Come on.

2427
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:56,241
That I wasn't wrong.

2428
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,941
To me, 100 dollars isn't important.

2429
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:00,950
Seriously.

2430
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:02,050
You should know this. You gave...

2431
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:03,580
the highest number of correct answers today.

2432
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,750
- You got the galbi name right. - Yes.

2433
01:25:05,751 --> 01:25:07,990
- You got the pizza saver right. - He got everything right.

2434
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:09,991
- He got Jongno right. - Jongno for meals.

2435
01:25:10,821 --> 01:25:12,421
Seriously, I'll pay.

2436
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,991
I'm having so much fun today.

2437
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,491
- How nice. - I'm having so much fun.

2438
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:18,300
It's really tasty.

2439
01:25:18,301 --> 01:25:19,801
Thank you.

2440
01:25:20,131 --> 01:25:22,731
He flexed with 104 dollars.

2441
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:24,240
Thank you.

2442
01:25:24,241 --> 01:25:26,071
(The accumulated sum of Rhymer's payments: 481 dollars)

2443
01:25:26,401 --> 01:25:32,511
(It's time to go to the last restaurant!)

2444
01:25:32,781 --> 01:25:35,680
(Current time: 8pm)

2445
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:39,450
(The team moves to the next location.)

2446
01:25:39,451 --> 01:25:41,450
- The sun has set, right? - Seriously.

2447
01:25:41,451 --> 01:25:42,890
- The sun has set again. - The sun has set.

2448
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:45,021
This is the night of Yeonnam-dong.

2449
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:48,360
(Even when the darkness falls, )

2450
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:52,331
(Yeonnam-dong is full of people's warmth.)

2451
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:57,571
(Which food will they eat last in the crowded Yeonnam?)

2452
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:59,700
Is it this place? We passed by it earlier.

2453
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:00,740
This place?

2454
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:01,840
- It's this place. Earlier... - Really?

2455
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:03,371
- It's this place. - I see.

2456
01:26:03,411 --> 01:26:06,080
- Lamb skewers. - We should've come here first.

2457
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:08,010
(The second DMR restaurant is nearby.)

2458
01:26:08,011 --> 01:26:09,050
This is great.

2459
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:10,081
(Lamb skewer)

2460
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:13,320
(The lamb skewer restaurant is famous...)

2461
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:16,221
(among men and women of all ages and nationalities.)

2462
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:24,831
(While its lamb skewers are famous, there are other dishes.)

2463
01:26:25,201 --> 01:26:28,871
(The 1st-generation lamb skewer restaurant in Yeonnam-dong)

2464
01:26:29,131 --> 01:26:32,901
(DMR 2, Lamb skewer)

2465
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:34,870
(The CEO opens the menu upon entering.)

2466
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:36,341
That's how it is.

2467
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:38,840
- Earlier, we did that. - Back then...

2468
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:42,211
- We need to try the lamb skewers. - That's right.

2469
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:44,850
Let's order the lamb belly and lamb ribs...

2470
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:46,181
- as skewers. - Okay.

2471
01:26:46,621 --> 01:26:49,090
Let's order the lamb hot pot too.

2472
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:50,121
Ma'am.

2473
01:26:51,421 --> 01:26:52,990
Two servings of lamb belly,

2474
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:55,390
two servings of lamb ribs, and one lamb hot pot.

2475
01:26:55,391 --> 01:26:56,830
- That'll be our order. - Okay.

2476
01:26:56,831 --> 01:26:59,830
Since it's the last restaurant, neither one of you wants to eat.

2477
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:01,771
- There isn't much desire toe at. - As for me...

2478
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:03,601
As for me, there's no desire whatsoever.

2479
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:07,340
You know what I'm like. I don't eat even when I win the last round.

2480
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,571
- I keep the others from eating. - That's right.

2481
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:12,410
- You guys use good charcoal. - Does it come to here?

2482
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:13,441
(As they talk, the charcoal arrives.)

2483
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:15,781
They use this charcoal.

2484
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:18,021
It's nice.

2485
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:20,591
I'll grill the skewers well.

2486
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:22,150
You can leave them as they are.

2487
01:27:22,151 --> 01:27:23,450
- The machine will grill them. - That's right.

2488
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,460
You need to switch the skewers.

2489
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:26,461
I see.

2490
01:27:26,462 --> 01:27:28,661
Dong Hyun, don't touch them. I'll take care of them.

2491
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:30,530
You need to switch the inner ones and the outer ones.

2492
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:32,001
Shut it, okay?

2493
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:33,431
I can't believe you.

2494
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:34,900
(The 3rd conflict breaks out.)

2495
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:36,300
- I told you earlier. - Hold on.

2496
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:37,671
I suppressed myself the 1st 2 times.

2497
01:27:37,901 --> 01:27:39,300
- Why do you keep... - He can't do it for the third time.

2498
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:40,840
- Listen. - Yes?

2499
01:27:40,841 --> 01:27:42,711
Will you do this at every restaurant?

2500
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,480
- Seriously. - He started it.

2501
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:46,681
Will you seriously do this?

2502
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:48,081
Seriously.

2503
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:50,051
- I mean... - Listen.

2504
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:52,320
Please talk to him.

2505
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:53,950
- Please stop. - All right.

2506
01:27:53,951 --> 01:27:54,951
- Shall we stop? - Yes.

2507
01:27:54,952 --> 01:27:56,490
- All right. - "Shut it" was too much.

2508
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:57,960
- Okay. I'm sorry. - Okay.

2509
01:27:57,961 --> 01:27:59,690
My words were a bit tough.

2510
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,590
But this is our time to eat.

2511
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:03,190
You shouldn't meddle.

2512
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:04,201
Seriously.

2513
01:28:04,231 --> 01:28:06,160
(The king of mediation is exhausted.)

2514
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,700
I'm so tired.

2515
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:10,700
The way the three of us got up at the same time was funny.

2516
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:11,701
Seriously.

2517
01:28:11,702 --> 01:28:13,141
(It's time to stop.)

2518
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:16,170
Look at the skewers.

2519
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:17,440
- Let's see. - Thank you.

2520
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:18,610
- This is... - This is the real deal.

2521
01:28:18,611 --> 01:28:19,980
- Lamb ribs. - There's no seasoning.

2522
01:28:19,981 --> 01:28:21,611
That's lamb belly.

2523
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:24,351
- Shall we eat the belly 1st? - Yes. Let's eat the lamb belly 1st.

2524
01:28:27,091 --> 01:28:29,190
(Tender lamb...)

2525
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:34,361
(gets grilled over charcoal.)

2526
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:38,060
(When the doneness is just right, )

2527
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:42,871
(dip it in the seasoning and take a bite!)

2528
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:45,971
- They go on the grill. - So that's how you grill them.

2529
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:47,840
Tae Hyun really doesn't know.

2530
01:28:47,841 --> 01:28:49,040
(They begin to grill the lamb skewers.)

2531
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,041
Here.

2532
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:51,511
My goodness.

2533
01:28:53,681 --> 01:28:55,981
(You just need to place them on the grilling machine.)

2534
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:59,280
(The lamb hot pot gets served right away.)

2535
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:00,350
My goodness.

2536
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:02,220
It smells like mala.

2537
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:03,321
(Is this mala as well?)

2538
01:29:03,621 --> 01:29:06,691
(This is the hot pot you can taste right away.)

2539
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:09,190
(The ingredients...)

2540
01:29:09,191 --> 01:29:11,931
(are boiled in one place.)

2541
01:29:12,731 --> 01:29:14,800
(After they're transferred to a pot, )

2542
01:29:14,801 --> 01:29:18,071
(chili oil gets sprinkled on the top.)

2543
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:22,641
(Spicy lamb hot pot)

2544
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:24,281
Lamb hot pot...

2545
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:27,510
can smell very bad if it isn't cooked right.

2546
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,711
(He takes a big scoop of the lamb hot pot.)

2547
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:33,821
I like such dishes. It's hot.

2548
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:36,521
The taste is smooth. It isn't too eccentric.

2549
01:29:36,891 --> 01:29:39,260
- You can smell it. - It's a nice menu.

2550
01:29:39,261 --> 01:29:40,261
For goodness' sake.
(My goodness)

2551
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:43,561
Isn't it great?

2552
01:29:44,201 --> 01:29:45,760
Now, it's...

2553
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:47,170
(Touched)

2554
01:29:47,171 --> 01:29:48,471
It's good.

2555
01:29:49,331 --> 01:29:51,000
- It's so good. - The mala flavor isn't strong.

2556
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:54,511
(Yi Kyung tries the lamb hot pot as well.)

2557
01:29:55,071 --> 01:29:57,981
The mala flavor isn't strong, so it's nice.

2558
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:01,751
(Seung Ho tries a spoonful right away.)

2559
01:30:02,811 --> 01:30:04,451
(It's nice.)

2560
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:07,651
You like soup, don't you?

2561
01:30:08,421 --> 01:30:09,990
People call me Gukbap Kim.

2562
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:11,161
He's similar to me.

2563
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:16,191
(Gukbap Kim takes another spoonful.)

2564
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,930
- It's tasty. - Seriously.

2565
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:22,031
(Very satisfied)

2566
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,171
We were very considerate when we ate.

2567
01:30:25,841 --> 01:30:27,470
- Is that so? - "Let's eat together."

2568
01:30:27,471 --> 01:30:28,640
- That's right. - We said that from the start.

2569
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:30,310
We said that right away. We played a game right away.

2570
01:30:30,311 --> 01:30:32,110
- Yes. - There's no unpleasant smell.

2571
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:34,111
(There's no unpleasant smell.)

2572
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:38,581
How should I say it? The texture of lamb and...

2573
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:40,650
- This is tofu. Dried tofu. - It's dried tofu.

2574
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:41,721
(There's dried tofu, the ingredient that charmed Rhymer.)

2575
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:46,120
(The spicy soup and ingredients)

2576
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,031
I love how the texture mixes in.

2577
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,730
How nice.

2578
01:30:49,731 --> 01:30:52,730
(Jealous)

2579
01:30:52,731 --> 01:30:54,730
When can you eat the lamb skewers?

2580
01:30:54,731 --> 01:30:55,900
They can eat them now.

2581
01:30:55,901 --> 01:30:56,971
It depends on your taste.

2582
01:30:57,131 --> 01:30:58,600
- As for me... - Will you eat them now?

2583
01:30:58,601 --> 01:30:59,640
Like this.

2584
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:01,070
- Let's grill them a bit more. - A bit more.

2585
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:02,611
It depends on your taste.

2586
01:31:03,011 --> 01:31:04,440
As for me, I grill them less.

2587
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:05,811
- Then you should eat them now. - Then they're more tender.

2588
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:07,810
- Then you should eat them now. - Then they're more tender.

2589
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:08,851
Hey.

2590
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:11,620
Thank you for your hard work today.

2591
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:12,720
Thank you.

2592
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:14,190
- Hey. - Handsome...

2593
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:15,351
- Guys. - Guys.

2594
01:31:15,891 --> 01:31:17,391
I'll be on this show forever.

2595
01:31:18,021 --> 01:31:19,061
Nice.

2596
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:20,521
Like this.

2597
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,090
(The food captivates his attention.)

2598
01:31:22,091 --> 01:31:23,231
Do you take out the meat?

2599
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:24,730
I take out the meat like this.

2600
01:31:24,731 --> 01:31:26,301
(CEO Rhymer takes out the meat from the skewer.)

2601
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:30,101
- It's so tender. - Suddenly...

2602
01:31:30,841 --> 01:31:32,800
- Seriously. - It's really tasty.

2603
01:31:32,801 --> 01:31:33,801
It's so tasty.

2604
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:34,911
(Since it's tasty, he takes another bite.)

2605
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:38,381
(Yi Kyung takes a bite from the skewer.)

2606
01:31:38,841 --> 01:31:40,440
(It makes him exclaim.)

2607
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:41,511
It's so tender.

2608
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:42,981
Once you eat it like this...

2609
01:31:43,281 --> 01:31:47,321
(Seung Ho dips it in the seasoning.)

2610
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:51,791
(He refuses to miss even a single piece.)

2611
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:54,930
(They keep reaching for more.)

2612
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:55,991
This is it.

2613
01:32:00,201 --> 01:32:01,630
(These three men are obsessed with lamb skewers.)

2614
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:03,501
It'll end right away.

2615
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:04,941
Seriously.

2616
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:08,971
- It's so tender. - Gosh, suddenly...

2617
01:32:09,211 --> 01:32:10,270
It's so tender.

2618
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,381
I wanted to eat this from the very start.

2619
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:14,780
I wanted to eat this more than pizza from the very start.

2620
01:32:14,781 --> 01:32:16,210
- I know that. - Why...

2621
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:19,620
Dong Hyun, it's so chewy and bouncy.

2622
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:20,891
Why aren't they being considerate?

2623
01:32:21,091 --> 01:32:22,991
We should play a game.

2624
01:32:23,421 --> 01:32:24,891
Won't you let us eat with you guys?

2625
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,521
No, we won't.

2626
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:28,761
(After saying no, )

2627
01:32:29,091 --> 01:32:32,961
(Seung Ho focuses on the lamb belly.)

2628
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:35,900
It looks so tasty.

2629
01:32:35,901 --> 01:32:38,470
(Dong Hyun marvels at a lamb belly skewer.)

2630
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:40,541
I'd push down the pieces like this.

2631
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:43,371
I'd eat them like this.

2632
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,611
Then I'd dip them in the seasoning...

2633
01:32:46,011 --> 01:32:48,151
and eat them like this.

2634
01:32:49,551 --> 01:32:51,220
Dong Hyun, put the lamb skewers on the top.

2635
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:53,881
- They're burning. - Hey.

2636
01:32:54,421 --> 01:32:55,820
- Hurry up. - Put them on the top.

2637
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:56,890
- Put them on the top. - Come to think of it,

2638
01:32:56,891 --> 01:32:58,420
why do I need to grill them?

2639
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:00,320
You were the one who offered to grill them.

2640
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:02,431
I grilled them because I thought you'd give me a piece.

2641
01:33:02,631 --> 01:33:04,160
Why would I grill them otherwise?

2642
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,461
- I can't believe you guys. - I told you so.

2643
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:07,571
- I won't grill them. - Let them do the work.

2644
01:33:08,101 --> 01:33:09,130
I'll fill the rack.

2645
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:10,631
(Team Lamb Skewer takes over in the end.)

2646
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:13,000
- It looks so tasty. - It's insane.

2647
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,040
(How is the taste of the lamb rib skewer...)

2648
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:15,071
(that contains Dong Hyun's sadness?)

2649
01:33:17,511 --> 01:33:19,611
(Rhymer takes the first bite.)

2650
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:20,881
(My goodness)

2651
01:33:21,051 --> 01:33:22,111
Did you get it?

2652
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:23,451
- Is it different? - It's so tasty.

2653
01:33:25,051 --> 01:33:27,690
(Yi Kyung quickly takes off the meat.)

2654
01:33:27,691 --> 01:33:28,951
The lamb rib skewer is so tasty.

2655
01:33:29,391 --> 01:33:30,551
It's so moist.

2656
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:35,390
I can taste the difference when I eat the lamb ribs.

2657
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:38,631
The meat isn't dry. It's very juicy.

2658
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:40,430
- Juicy? - Yes.

2659
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:41,701
What does that mean?

2660
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:44,270
- It contains the meat juice. - The meat juice.

2661
01:33:44,271 --> 01:33:45,501
- That's what it means. - Yes.

2662
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:47,811
Juicy? I see.

2663
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:50,741
Lamb belly has the taste we know and recognize.

2664
01:33:50,841 --> 01:33:52,680
Lamb rib pieces are smaller,

2665
01:33:52,681 --> 01:33:55,351
but they're both chewy and tender in the mouth.

2666
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:58,521
The lamb rib skewers are so tasty. The meat is so juicy.

2667
01:33:59,251 --> 01:34:03,090
(Seung Ho takes a bite as well.)

2668
01:34:03,091 --> 01:34:04,660
(I agree with you guys.)

2669
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:06,921
Why don't you give us a question?

2670
01:34:07,431 --> 01:34:09,090
- For 1 person? - Yes, for 1 person.

2671
01:34:09,091 --> 01:34:11,560
To be honest, I want to do this.

2672
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:14,171
I don't know if it's against the rules.

2673
01:34:14,301 --> 01:34:15,500
I learned today...

2674
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:17,671
that so much effort went into filming this show.

2675
01:34:18,241 --> 01:34:21,110
- Will we have a get-together? - If they get it right,

2676
01:34:21,111 --> 01:34:22,140
I want us to eat together.

2677
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:24,010
I want to do that.

2678
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:25,280
Why don't you give them a difficult question?

2679
01:34:25,281 --> 01:34:27,010
- If they get it right, - That's a good idea.

2680
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:28,210
- we should eat together. - Together...

2681
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:29,211
That's a good idea.

2682
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:31,080
I want to clink glasses with Tae Hyun.

2683
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,150
That's right. I bet he wants to do that.

2684
01:34:32,151 --> 01:34:33,881
I love it. That's a good idea.

2685
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:35,851
- You agreed to it. - Shall we answer together?

2686
01:34:35,991 --> 01:34:37,560
If the two of them answer correctly,

2687
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:38,990
- this will become a get-together. - Okay.

2688
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:39,991
If they answer incorrectly, it's game over.
It's like yes or no.

2689
01:34:40,992 --> 01:34:42,430
- If you fail, neither one eats. - Okay.

2690
01:34:42,431 --> 01:34:43,791
- If you do it, we eat together. - Okay.

2691
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:47,731
(Will There Be a Get-Together? Time for Quiz)

2692
01:34:48,001 --> 01:34:50,300
Pizza is the first food...

2693
01:34:50,301 --> 01:34:52,971
that was purchased with "Blank" in 2010.

2694
01:34:53,241 --> 01:34:55,970
This transaction is known as a symbolic event in history...

2695
01:34:55,971 --> 01:34:57,880
which broke down the barriers between technology and daily life.

2696
01:34:57,881 --> 01:35:01,350
- Stop. - It's his specialty!

2697
01:35:01,351 --> 01:35:03,450
- I don't need to hear more. - The question isn't over.

2698
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:05,150
- Okay. - I don't need to hear more.

2699
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:06,281
It's his specialty.

2700
01:35:06,551 --> 01:35:07,551
- Are you sure? - Yes.

2701
01:35:07,552 --> 01:35:09,390
Hey, this is a team event.

2702
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:10,550
- I'm certain. - Dong Hyun,

2703
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:12,420
- the question reminded me of you. - I'm certain.

2704
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:15,030
Tae Hyun, there's no need to hear more.

2705
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:16,130
Okay. It's a team event.

2706
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:17,960
Shall we listen to the question?

2707
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:19,600
If you're wrong, we won't get to eat.

2708
01:35:19,601 --> 01:35:21,300
- You only get one chance. - Okay.

2709
01:35:21,301 --> 01:35:24,671
Tae Hyun, there's even something called the Pizza Day in this scene.

2710
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:25,940
- I see. - Pizza Day.

2711
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:28,510
- It was the first transaction... - Transaction.

2712
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:30,340
For an actual item.

2713
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:33,210
With this, someone bought pizza.

2714
01:35:33,211 --> 01:35:34,551
He bought two pizzas.

2715
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:36,611
- Let me answer. Bitcoin. - Bitcoin.

2716
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:37,980
I think it's correct.

2717
01:35:37,981 --> 01:35:39,051
(He totally agrees.)

2718
01:35:39,781 --> 01:35:40,781
Correct.

2719
01:35:41,521 --> 01:35:43,190
- All right. - My goodness.

2720
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:44,660
With 20,000 Bitcoins,

2721
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:46,590
he bought two pizzas.

2722
01:35:46,591 --> 01:35:49,230
For 2 pizzas, he paid 10,000 Bitcoins.

2723
01:35:49,231 --> 01:35:51,360
So it was 10,000. I'm sorry.

2724
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:53,460
- It's his specialty. - Ten thousand Bitcoins...

2725
01:35:53,461 --> 01:35:54,631
are worth one billion dollars now.

2726
01:35:55,001 --> 01:35:56,970
- Had I bought them then... - One billion dollars.

2727
01:35:56,971 --> 01:35:58,000
That amount.

2728
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:59,900
- Can we eat with you guys? - Go ahead and eat.

2729
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:00,941
All right.

2730
01:36:01,441 --> 01:36:02,810
Dong Hyun, have a glass.

2731
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:03,840
- Me? - This is great.

2732
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:04,940
I apologize...

2733
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:06,480
- for what I did today. - All right.

2734
01:36:06,481 --> 01:36:08,180
It's okay. It happens.

2735
01:36:08,181 --> 01:36:09,410
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2736
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:10,411
It's so nice.

2737
01:36:10,412 --> 01:36:11,420
- All right. - It's so nice.

2738
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:12,751
Do you accept my apology?

2739
01:36:13,051 --> 01:36:14,750
- I'll give you just a bit. Okay. - Okay.

2740
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:15,820
Thank you.

2741
01:36:15,821 --> 01:36:17,120
- All right. - We're friends.

2742
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:18,390
I'll say a few words.

2743
01:36:18,391 --> 01:36:19,461
- Okay. - Okay.

2744
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:22,430
Handsome Guys, forever!

2745
01:36:22,431 --> 01:36:25,061
- Forever! - Forever!

2746
01:36:28,201 --> 01:36:30,231
Dong Hyun, try this.

2747
01:36:30,601 --> 01:36:32,270
- It's tasty. - The charcoal...

2748
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:34,671
Try the one I just gave you and this.

2749
01:36:34,771 --> 01:36:35,940
There are bones.

2750
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:37,171
Be careful not to break your teeth.

2751
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:39,840
(It goes straight into his mouth.)

2752
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:41,911
- I hope that happens. - I know.

2753
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:43,481
(Sucking)

2754
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:48,621
(He takes a bite of the hot pot too.)

2755
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:50,820
You can feel it go down, right?

2756
01:36:50,821 --> 01:36:52,060
Right. It's around here.

2757
01:36:52,061 --> 01:36:53,391
(Tae Hyun who didn't want to eat starts eating before he knows it.)

2758
01:36:56,231 --> 01:36:57,800
You can feel it right?

2759
01:36:57,801 --> 01:37:02,501
(Rhymer starts eating so that he doesn't fall behind.)

2760
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:08,071
(I won't miss a single bite.)

2761
01:37:08,411 --> 01:37:11,941
(They all enjoy it!)

2762
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:14,180
- So... - All right then.

2763
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:15,450
- Right. - It looks like we're done.

2764
01:37:15,451 --> 01:37:16,611
Right.

2765
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:19,320
- Let's send Rhymer home. - Right.

2766
01:37:19,321 --> 01:37:21,250
Let's send Rhymer home.

2767
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:22,450
(Let's end things.)

2768
01:37:22,451 --> 01:37:24,151
It's 9:30pm now.

2769
01:37:24,251 --> 01:37:27,060
- We have to conclude things. - Right.

2770
01:37:27,061 --> 01:37:28,190
We have to have an ending.

2771
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:29,861
Right. Make sure to get it right.

2772
01:37:30,331 --> 01:37:33,160
- I wish Rhymer would avoid paying. - All right then.

2773
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:35,831
- Please pass us the bill. - Please pass us the bill.

2774
01:37:36,371 --> 01:37:37,530
Right. Pass it to me.

2775
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:40,000
(What is the price written on the receipt?)

2776
01:37:40,001 --> 01:37:41,071
How precise.

2777
01:37:41,241 --> 01:37:43,111
(How much is it?)

2778
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:45,081
It's precisely 150 dollars.

2779
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:47,140
There are no additional numbers. It's precisely 150 dollars.

2780
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:49,110
No additional numbers, and it's 150 dollars.

2781
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:51,450
It's just a game, so we'll just go for it.

2782
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:53,051
- Let's get it right this time. - Okay.

2783
01:37:53,351 --> 01:37:54,621
- All right. - Let's go.

2784
01:37:55,151 --> 01:37:56,151
- Let's be serious. - Let's be serious.

2785
01:37:56,152 --> 01:37:57,191
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2786
01:37:57,661 --> 01:38:00,291
"This" is originally a Chinese dish.

2787
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:03,531
The literal translation is "lamb soup."

2788
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:05,260
"This" moved into Japan...

2789
01:38:05,261 --> 01:38:08,831
and a different ingredient was used instead of lamb meat.

2790
01:38:09,071 --> 01:38:11,540
That new style of dish moved into Korea...

2791
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:14,300
and became a popular snack.

2792
01:38:14,301 --> 01:38:15,471
What is "this?"

2793
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:18,611
This is what I think.

2794
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:20,640
- You got it right away? - I'm reminded of one thing.

2795
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:21,950
- What is it? - Ramyeon.

2796
01:38:21,951 --> 01:38:23,081
I think it's ramyeon too.

2797
01:38:23,151 --> 01:38:26,450
It was originally made with lamb meat,

2798
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:29,521
but it became chicken-based in Japan.

2799
01:38:29,621 --> 01:38:31,620
But when we think about soups,

2800
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:33,121
we think of things like the fishcake soup.

2801
01:38:33,321 --> 01:38:34,391
That is what we think of first.

2802
01:38:35,261 --> 01:38:36,461
That sounds exactly right.

2803
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:38,230
Isn't the fishcake a well-known snack for us?

2804
01:38:38,231 --> 01:38:40,331
Right. It's a well-known snack for us.

2805
01:38:41,271 --> 01:38:42,771
- But... - You don't think it's right?

2806
01:38:42,901 --> 01:38:43,901
It's not that one.

2807
01:38:44,441 --> 01:38:45,940
What is lamb meat in Chinese?

2808
01:38:45,941 --> 01:38:47,100
(Let's try to get the literal translation in Chinese.)

2809
01:38:47,101 --> 01:38:48,841
Can't we ask about that? Ma'am.

2810
01:38:49,241 --> 01:38:51,781
What is lamb meat in Chinese?

2811
01:38:52,481 --> 01:38:54,080
- "Yang rou." - "Yang rou?"

2812
01:38:54,081 --> 01:38:55,511
"Yang rou."

2813
01:38:55,581 --> 01:38:56,711
What about soup?

2814
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:58,851
- "Tang." - "Tang?"

2815
01:38:59,081 --> 01:39:00,751
It's "yang rou tang."

2816
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:03,821
"Yang rou tang" literally means lamb meat soup.

2817
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:07,390
This moved into Japan,

2818
01:39:07,391 --> 01:39:08,461
and the lamb meat was replaced.

2819
01:39:08,931 --> 01:39:10,361
It still must've been a form of soup.

2820
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:14,101
It moved into Korea and became a popular snack.

2821
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,886
Tang!

2822
01:39:17,356 --> 01:39:19,785
- Tang, tang, hulu, hulu - Tang, tang, hulu, hulu

2823
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:21,955
- Tang, tang, hulu - Tang, tang, hulu

2824
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,056
(Laughing)

2825
01:39:23,626 --> 01:39:24,966
"Tang" is the only part left.

2826
01:39:26,196 --> 01:39:27,396
You're really funny today.

2827
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:28,936
"Tang" is the only part left.

2828
01:39:29,736 --> 01:39:31,066
Hold on.

2829
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:33,666
Something came into mind in a flash.

2830
01:39:33,866 --> 01:39:35,105
- What is it? - Let's make a beautiful scene...

2831
01:39:35,106 --> 01:39:36,335
as we promised.

2832
01:39:36,336 --> 01:39:37,435
- Let's make a beautiful scene. - But...

2833
01:39:37,436 --> 01:39:38,705
we have to pay if you get it right.

2834
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:39,845
He gave you the answer earlier.

2835
01:39:39,846 --> 01:39:40,945
It's okay.

2836
01:39:40,946 --> 01:39:43,675
But the answer you give us might not be right.

2837
01:39:43,676 --> 01:39:44,885
He gave you the answer earlier.

2838
01:39:44,886 --> 01:39:47,146
If the answer I give you is right,

2839
01:39:47,586 --> 01:39:51,455
then we have to pay. I'll be happy to pay for my junior.

2840
01:39:51,456 --> 01:39:52,585
Okay!

2841
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:54,055
- That makes a beautiful scene... - Right. What is it?

2842
01:39:54,056 --> 01:39:55,826
- if it's the right answer. - Tell us.

2843
01:39:56,526 --> 01:39:58,925
It has "yang" in the original word, and is a snack.

2844
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,765
You are usually right during these moments.

2845
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:01,766
Sweet red bean jelly.

2846
01:40:02,336 --> 01:40:04,665
I thought of that too.

2847
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,706
- But... - It's definitely a snack.

2848
01:40:07,406 --> 01:40:08,506
Because it has "yang" in the original word?

2849
01:40:08,876 --> 01:40:12,445
Lamb meat soup is a bit like...

2850
01:40:12,446 --> 01:40:13,975
- Like jelly? - It's like jelly.

2851
01:40:13,976 --> 01:40:15,745
Lamb meat has a lot of fat,

2852
01:40:15,746 --> 01:40:17,215
and it becomes solid when it dries up.

2853
01:40:17,216 --> 01:40:20,185
That was the original dish, but there was a change.

2854
01:40:20,186 --> 01:40:23,215
- It was done differently in Japan. - It wasn't made with lamb meat...

2855
01:40:23,216 --> 01:40:24,315
and made with red beans in Japan.

2856
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:25,425
"Yang" is in the original word.

2857
01:40:25,426 --> 01:40:26,986
I thought it might be from that.

2858
01:40:27,126 --> 01:40:28,356
It sounds like a better answer than ramyeon.

2859
01:40:28,626 --> 01:40:29,856
It sounds better than ramyeon.

2860
01:40:30,596 --> 01:40:31,665
It's better than ramyeon.

2861
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:33,796
(The three fall deep into thought.)

2862
01:40:34,196 --> 01:40:35,765
That's all I have to say.

2863
01:40:35,766 --> 01:40:36,935
(It's up to you guys to choose.)

2864
01:40:36,936 --> 01:40:38,735
That's all I have to say. If that is the right answer,

2865
01:40:38,736 --> 01:40:39,865
I'll pay.

2866
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:41,035
(Go for it.)

2867
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:42,036
All right.

2868
01:40:43,276 --> 01:40:45,375
Out of the deductions we made,

2869
01:40:45,376 --> 01:40:47,405
- But... - it sounds the most reasonable.

2870
01:40:47,406 --> 01:40:49,076
It's either ramyeon or sweet red bean jelly.

2871
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:50,776
Trust me and go with ramyeon.

2872
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,046
Ramyeon seems totally off.

2873
01:40:53,286 --> 01:40:55,415
- If it isn't ramyeon, - Will you pay?

2874
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:56,516
I will pay.

2875
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:00,925
- Let's not get swayed. - Right.

2876
01:41:00,926 --> 01:41:02,425
Do as you wish.

2877
01:41:02,426 --> 01:41:03,925
- Leave no regrets. - It's better than leaving regrets.

2878
01:41:03,926 --> 01:41:05,765
- I don't want to leave regrets. - Right.

2879
01:41:05,766 --> 01:41:07,595
- I'll pay if it isn't ramyeon. - Right.

2880
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:09,195
- Right. - Right.

2881
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:10,336
I think it's sweet red bean jelly.

2882
01:41:10,496 --> 01:41:12,036
- That is what I feel. - Just leave him.

2883
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,335
I think I'll feel relieved...

2884
01:41:13,336 --> 01:41:14,505
- after going with ramyeon. - Right.

2885
01:41:14,506 --> 01:41:16,535
Let me go with this answer before I go. Please.

2886
01:41:16,536 --> 01:41:17,875
Let him go with his answer!

2887
01:41:17,876 --> 01:41:19,675
- Please! - Tae Hyun's answer...

2888
01:41:19,676 --> 01:41:20,676
Shut it!

2889
01:41:21,046 --> 01:41:22,476
Everybody, shut it!

2890
01:41:22,946 --> 01:41:23,946
Ramyeon!

2891
01:41:23,947 --> 01:41:25,546
(He finally said the answer.)

2892
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:27,785
This snack is ramyeon?

2893
01:41:27,786 --> 01:41:29,185
(Ramyeon)

2894
01:41:29,186 --> 01:41:30,356
It's never ramyeon.

2895
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:34,256
That is incorrect.

2896
01:41:34,826 --> 01:41:36,855
- Could it be sweet red bean jelly? - That can't be it.

2897
01:41:36,856 --> 01:41:38,065
The answer is sweet red bean jelly.

2898
01:41:38,066 --> 01:41:41,196
I told you that was the answer!

2899
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:42,596
Gosh, you!

2900
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:44,705
(Solemn)

2901
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:46,135
- I told you. - Gosh.

2902
01:41:46,136 --> 01:41:48,205
Lamb meat has a lot of fat.

2903
01:41:48,206 --> 01:41:51,005
It isn't easy for someone to have a bad day like this.

2904
01:41:51,006 --> 01:41:52,245
(Lamb meat produces gelatin when it dries up.)

2905
01:41:52,246 --> 01:41:53,475
(Lamb meat was replaced with red beans added with...)

2906
01:41:53,476 --> 01:41:54,546
(agar and grains to become the sweet red bean jelly we know of.)

2907
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:57,845
So this is how things end. I'll pay for our meal.
