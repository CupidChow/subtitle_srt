1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,220
(Yeongam-gun, South Jeolla Province, 7:30am)

2
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:34,591
Gosh, it's cold.

3
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,790
(Coming to work in the early morning as usual)

4
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,660
- Be on my side.
- Come here.

5
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,446
- Sang Uk.
- Yes?

6
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,861
- Yes.
- Sorry.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,931
- I'm doing this again.
- Come on.

8
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,169
I can just be Sang Uk.

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,969
Seung Ho. I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,070
Why are you doing that again to Seung Ho?

11
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,710
- But Seung Ho.
- I'm ready.

12
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,939
- You're feeling well today.
- I feel like I can fly.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,309
- I slept very well.
- You look good.

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,811
- You should show us.
- What do you mean?

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,881
Show us your various aspects.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,520
- Didn't he show you last time?
- No, he did...

17
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,321
Tell me what you want.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,891
I can show you everything I got.

19
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:08,219
(I can show you anything you want.)

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,290
That happens a lot.

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,490
- When did you get here?
- I came here yesterday.

22
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:11,759
- Yesterday?
- I slept here.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,931
Why didn't you call me?

24
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,230
We got here yesterday.

25
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,600
- Really?
- You better memorize their names.

26
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,269
- I remember Sang Uk, but not him.
- Please.

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,001
I certainly remember Sang Uk.

28
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,001
- We have 2 Sang Uk.
- There are 2 Sang Uk.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,641
Thank you for coming all the way early in the morning.

30
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:30,109
You're in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

31
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,710
- Yeongam.
- I didn't see in when it was dark,

32
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,850
- but after the sun rises...
- It's amazing.

33
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,050
It has a grand view here after the sun rises.

34
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,520
- It's Mount Wolchul.
- Mount Wolchul?

35
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,550
Wolchul?

36
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:39,919
The sun shines only on that part, like a painting.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,060
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's unbelievable.

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,730
A legend says...

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,730
there were three rocks on the top of Mount Wolchul.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,529
When the rocks went rolling down from the mountain,

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,139
they went up to the mountain on their own.

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,169
It has a story.

43
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,139
The rock was called Yeongam,

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,411
and that's why this area was named Yeongam.

45
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,840
That's why it's Yeongam.

46
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,280
So, to live up to its name, we brought a huge figure.

47
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,821
- Who is it?
- Our guest, please come out!

48
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,191
Isn't it Byeon Woo Seok?

49
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,890
Someone from Yeongam.

50
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,991
Someone from Yeongam?

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,630
- Why?
- Gosh.

52
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,991
(He moves forward to look carefully.)

53
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,200
(Members buzz the moment they see the guest.)

54
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
He's an ascetic.

55
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,500
- He's coming to the secular world.
- He's coming down from the rock.

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,240
That's the rock.

57
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,500
Is that the rock?

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,740
The rock has come down.

59
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:35,710
It's the rock. The rock comes rolling.

60
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,680
- The rock has come down.
- That sure is a rock.

61
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,450
- It's Yeongam!
- Mr. Yeongam.

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,180
(He can't help laughing seeing the intense look.)

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,990
Mr. Yeongam!

64
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,920
Someone as hard as a rock has come down.

65
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,420
- Nice to meet you.
- Mr. Yeongam.

66
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:51,929
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

67
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,229
- Nice to meet you.
- Sung Hoon!

68
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,561
I don't need to shake hands with you.

69
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,699
(The rock is a bit sharp.)

70
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,000
From a distance,

71
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,169
it's as if a long-haired tiger was coming down.

72
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,170
Hello.

73
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,840
He looks like he's been in the mountain for about ten years.

74
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,010
That's what I'm saying.

75
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,140
- How did you get this far?
- I know.

76
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,410
Thanks to Dong Hyun, they cast me. That's why I'm here.

77
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,411
Sung Hoon.

78
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,881
Have you been to Yeongam before?

79
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
- Here?
- Yes.

80
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,419
I've never been here.

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,989
What's this neighborhood? I have no idea.

82
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,091
It's Yeongam.

83
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,419
- Did you get here yesterday?
- The day before yesterday.

84
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,230
- What?
- The day before yesterday?

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,860
The day before yesterday?

86
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,300
Right. He came from that mountain.

87
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,430
Did you come crossing the mountain?

88
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,571
The day before yesterday.

89
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:34,639
- Let's keep it chill.
- Yes.

90
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
(A cool guy)

91
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,501
Did you come here knowing what this show is about?

92
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,970
I have a rough idea.

93
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,280
Can you tell me what kind of show this is?

94
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:43,881
We'll be divided into teams and we'll do something.

95
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,750
And we're going to fight a bit. That's what I heard.

96
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,479
Don't tell him something like that.

97
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,679
We can get into big trouble.

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,620
I've known Sung Hoon for such a long time.

99
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,060
We're going to be 3 on 3.

100
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,561
With Sung Hoon in a team, it will just be 2 on 3.

101
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,759
I mean it. I guarantee.

102
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,631
He just eats.

103
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,270
I mean it. I guarantee.

104
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,570
You can ask me when you need physical strength.

105
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:10,440
- He doesn't show physical strength.
- He doesn't.

106
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,669
- I know.
- He doesn't do that either?

107
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,509
Don't you drive?

108
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,639
I can't drive.

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,679
(No, I can't.)

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,210
He came here without any idea.

111
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,410
- He came yesterday.
- Really?

112
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,750
He didn't know he had one more day to spare.

113
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,549
He just heard where he was going.

114
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,019
How should we team up today?

115
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,790
- It's giving me a headache.
- That's the key today.

116
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,260
Which of us do you want to be in your team?

117
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,160
- In the first place...
- If you organize with two others.

118
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,460
- Here's what I think.
- Yes.

119
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,859
We have three athletes...

120
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,630
and three actors.

121
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,100
So how about dividing us into each group of three?

122
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,101
No.

123
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:43,770
- Like this?
- In this way.

124
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:44,810
It's great.

125
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,239
- This is...
- Yes!

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,910
No, that won't be fun.

127
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,410
Since it has come to this, we'll do it specially.

128
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:51,711
The two oldest members,

129
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,451
Choo Sung Hoon and Cha Tae Hyun will play rock-paper-scissors...

130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,720
and the winner will...

131
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,490
- Do we pick one?
- Yes, you take a member.

132
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,420
Now, split into Team Handsome and Team Guys.

133
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,560
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,359
(Rock versus paper)

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,461
He won.

136
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,601
(Sorry)

137
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,629
(Tae Hyun, pick me.)

138
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,600
- He's not very helpful.
- Dong Hyun is fooled.

139
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,739
(So am I.)

140
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,809
I can't help it.

141
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,510
- Who's your pick?
- Yi Kyung.

142
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,669
- Okay.
- Why?

143
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,739
- Yi Kyung.
- Okay.

144
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,080
(Team Brain is formed.)

145
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,140
Okay!

146
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,351
(Jumping with joy)

147
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,609
Tae Hyun!

148
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,150
- Gosh.
- Why?

149
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,419
(The last team members feel very sorry.)

150
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,490
Why?

151
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,350
(Sad)

152
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,221
Tae Hyun, give me a chance, please.

153
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,091
- I was a good driver.
- Here we go.

154
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,531
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

155
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,601
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

156
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,701
(Scissors?)

157
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,901
- What's this?
- What's this?

158
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,970
(Sorry. It was a mistake.)

159
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:50,140
- It's wrong.
- What's this?

160
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,340
What's this?

161
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,770
(Blocking the complaint)

162
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,739
- What's this?
- What's this?

163
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,580
- Make it a team of actors.
- I'm sorry.

164
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,450
- This is really...
- I'm sorry.

165
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,679
Does he want to win that much? What's this?

166
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,179
- Wrap it up.
- I'm sorry.

167
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,281
Didn't I win it, in that case?

168
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,761
- You should play it again.
- Seriously.

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,290
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

170
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,760
(Sung Hoon wins.)

171
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:12,890
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

172
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,729
Okay.

173
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,761
(Which one shall I pick now?)

174
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,831
- Okay.
- Good.

175
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,700
(We're in big trouble.)

176
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:21,739
They're in big trouble.

177
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,939
(Please)

178
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,299
He never gives rock.

179
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,511
(I hope he doesn't pick me.)

180
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,341
- Okay.
- Come here, Dong Hyun.

181
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,041
Goodness.

182
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:32,880
(Sung Hoon picks Dong Hyun.)

183
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,781
Okay!

184
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,919
(Relieved)

185
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,391
You should help me out.

186
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,460
- "You should help me out." - You should help me.

187
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:43,190
(I shouldn't have been acquainted with him.)

188
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,790
(Very upset)

189
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,331
Then Sang Uk and Seung Ho are left.

190
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,530
- Which team do you want?
- I...

191
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:51,770
- Say it clearly.
- It's clear.

192
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,200
- What can you expect?
- I need to ask, though.

193
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,940
- Tell him what you think.
- Right.

194
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,500
I want to be with them.

195
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,870
(Hurt)

196
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,340
- No doubt.
- How about Seung Ho?

197
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,641
I'm already here.

198
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,010
(It's so natural.)

199
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,011
That's right.

200
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,979
He's happy.

201
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,120
Okay. I got it.

202
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,851
It will be fun if I win, right?

203
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,119
(Grinning)

204
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,689
I have a bad feeling about standing here.

205
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,391
(His smile makes two candidates nervous.)

206
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,220
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

207
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,660
Okay!

208
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,989
- Sung Hoon.
- He never gives rock.

209
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,059
I won.

210
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,229
(Worried)

211
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,169
It doesn't matter.

212
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,900
Sang Uk and Seung Ho, come to the center.

213
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,440
Move forward, and I'll hug you from behind.

214
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,841
He's an entertainer now.

215
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:37,109
You're picking the person you hug, Sung Hoon.

216
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,310
- That's right.
- Okay.

217
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,119
But I think it will be nice if we divide...

218
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,221
into the athletes' team and the actors' team.

219
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,050
You were an athlete too.

220
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,350
Was he?

221
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,060
- Sung Hoon, I was...
- What sports?

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,989
(Attracted)

223
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,630
- What sports did you play?
- I used to play soccer.

224
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,900
- But not anymore.
- Let me touch your thighs.

225
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,429
Sung Hoon, you should touch his thighs.

226
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,030
- Yes, here.
- Can you tell?

227
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,169
His are better.

228
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,601
He's in first place.

229
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,810
- All right.
- Think about it.

230
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't know.

231
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,739
(Sung Hoon stands behind two guys.)

232
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
All right.

233
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,610
I don't know.

234
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,080
(Who's the last member to overcome sufferings with him?)

235
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,281
(Please, don't pick me.)

236
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,490
You surprised me.

237
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,400
- Come with me.
- Are we a team now?

238
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,400
- Athletes, let's go with me.
- Let's do it.

239
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:31,630
(A trio of athletes was formed.)

240
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:33,771
(Shouting in joy)

241
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,440
(I'm saved, Yi Kyung.)

242
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,210
(Team Actors is formed.)

243
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,570
This is how it turned out.

244
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,609
(Thank you for not picking me.)

245
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,781
We ended up this way.

246
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,950
- Let's give it a try.
- Three of them are so competitive.

247
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,810
We athletes have a desire for winning.

248
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,521
We never know what will happen when the three of us are a team.

249
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,089
Please decide on your team's name.

250
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,428
We have Team Handsome and Team Guys.

251
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,599
Sung Hoon can decide it.

252
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,429
There are Team Handsome and Team Guys.

253
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,528
No way you think you're handsome.

254
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:01,969
(Speechless)

255
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,139
I'm asking.

256
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,269
- But he's handsome.
- I know.

257
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,409
He looks fine among martial artists.

258
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:11,679
He's fine,

259
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,308
and I'm fine among middle-aged men.

260
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,778
Then we're Team Handsome.

261
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:16,819
Okay.

262
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,448
We're set.

263
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,648
- We're Team Handsome.
- We're Team Guys.

264
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,119
- Do you agree?
- We agree.

265
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,558
- Sure.
- We're Team Guys.

266
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,788
Now let's check today's theme,

267
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,289
Handsome Heritage today.

268
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,058
It's traditional liquor of South Jeolla Province.

269
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,230
Traditional liquor?

270
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,599
Traditional liquor...

271
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,240
is liquor made by succeeding or preserving...

272
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,799
traditional brewing method.

273
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,609
South Jeolla Province has nine traditional liquors...

274
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,278
which are very famous or hidden.

275
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,809
Today, we'll go find them.

276
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,418
(They look, )

277
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,918
(smell, )

278
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,789
(and enjoy.)

279
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,659
(Fall for the charm of South Jeolla Province's traditional liquor.)

280
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,990
Traditional liquor? Are we allowed to drink it?

281
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,658
(Takju of Suncheon)

282
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,759
What is takju?

283
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,829
Dongdongju.

284
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,630
Isn't dongdongju what's on top of makgeolli?

285
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,500
Dongdongju. No one knows the difference.

286
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,109
I've never heard of hongju.

287
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,939
- Hongju?
- Hongcho?

288
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,679
There are many kinds of liquor.

289
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,079
Today, as you go around,

290
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,578
you'll learn about those.

291
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,448
And you can't drink on an empty stomach.

292
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,789
- That's right.
- So...

293
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,149
We're in Jeolla Province.

294
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,659
- Right.
- This is the region of tastes.

295
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,759
Take it off. I can see that you want to take it off.

296
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,460
You can take it off.

297
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,798
(Uncle-kase)

298
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,298
- Uncle-kase?
- Uncle-kase?

299
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,369
What's that?

300
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,199
(The name already appeals to their tastes.)

301
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,069
I guess it's omakase by an uncle.

302
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,370
- For makgeolli..
- What matches makgeolli is...

303
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,078
- Wild vegetables set menu.
- Wild vegetables set menu.

304
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,308
- I feel hungry all of a sudden.
- Same here.

305
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,980
In Jangheung, matching dongdongju...

306
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,149
(Korean beef combo)

307
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,549
- Korean beef!
- Korean beef, gosh.

308
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,889
What's happening? How come everything's so nice today?

309
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,219
You should have time...

310
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,260
to savor traditional liquor with the viewers.

311
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,788
Today, having meals is mandatory.

312
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,029
Okay.

313
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,829
If you get the answer for the quiz,

314
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,970
you can eat, no matter what.

315
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:16,369
The rules are the same. The time limit is by 8pm today.

316
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,808
If you complete the bingo, you get off right away.

317
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,140
- Okay.
- And the losing team...

318
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,678
goes to the traditional brewery...

319
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,210
that brews one of the traditional liquor you'll taste today.

320
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:29,350
They will brew traditional liquor...

321
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,020
(With the heat over 40°C, )

322
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,960
(makgeolli is brewed from patience and sincerity.)

323
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:44,929
(Who will go through the heat and patience for a penalty?)

324
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,500
(Especially determined today)

325
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,398
We actually brew...

326
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,068
- Yes.
- liquor?

327
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,408
- You brew liquor.
- That's great.

328
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,140
(Great?)

329
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,449
That's wonderful.

330
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,079
I've wanted to brew liquor.

331
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,519
- We...
- I've really wanted to brew...

332
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,679
- Have you?
- liquor.

333
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,519
Then... Well...

334
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,689
Then we'll eat and drink without worry.

335
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,189
We'll eat and drink without worry and sleep here tonight.

336
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,428
(Sung Hoon's confidence makes Dong Hyun speechless.)

337
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,459
Let's go. Eat and drink without worry.

338
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,898
Sung Hoon,

339
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,158
you can pick the region with the food you want and stay there.

340
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,059
We'll have beef.

341
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,500
We'll have beef and bulgogi.

342
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,640
We'll eat and drink without worry and sleep there tonight.

343
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,169
We're in big trouble.

344
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,069
We're in big trouble. I mean it.

345
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,839
You have me.

346
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,880
Right. We need to pick that one.

347
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,850
- Right.
- That's most important.

348
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,449
- Then...
- You pick first.

349
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:34,849
(Sung Hoon picks a card first.)

350
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,078
Tell me later.

351
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,719
You should show it to us.

352
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,990
No.

353
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,990
Stop it. He might hit you.

354
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,389
I know that, at least.

355
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,688
Sorry, but I know that.

356
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,198
You'll get hit the first day you meet him.

357
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,399
(Sobered)

358
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,929
- Okay.
- Is it a good one?

359
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,600
It's a reattempt card.

360
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,938
"When you got the wrong answer, reattempt with an extra hint."

361
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:55,939
Nice!

362
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,869
- Nice.
- It's a very good one.

363
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,870
Okay!

364
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,140
- What do we have?
- I hope they got a bad one.

365
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,510
Okay.

366
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,849
- Location identification card.
- It's a GPS.

367
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,110
- It's not bad.
- It's nice.

368
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,380
Here we go.

369
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,789
Why?

370
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,889
It's a reattempt card!

371
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,989
(2 reattempt cards)

372
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,090
We should have switched with them.

373
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,659
Then it's probable...

374
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:20,929
(What we picked must be a bad one.)

375
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,158
It's very likely that our card is a bad one.

376
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,230
I'm sure it's a bad one.

377
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,829
- No doubt it's bad.
- What's that?

378
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,769
It's a 30-minute nap card!

379
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,369
(30-minute nap card)

380
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,269
You know, last week,

381
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,969
Tae Hyun and I were attacked by this card.

382
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,479
This is really fatal.

383
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,639
We're going to sleep anyway without that card...

384
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,679
because of Sung Hoon.

385
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,879
- Sung Hoon will ask us to sleep.
- He'd sleep without the card?

386
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,149
Yes, he'll sleep anyway.

387
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,419
Sung Hoon.

388
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,119
I'll put you to sleep anytime you want.

389
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,220
Okay.

390
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,020
There's no reattempt card left.

391
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,688
- Pick something better.
- A better one.

392
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:50,890
Pick a better one.

393
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,828
I suddenly got something weird.

394
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:56,959
- Did you see it?
- Please.

395
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,999
- Did you see it?
- You saw it?

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,568
- Please reveal it.
- Do you want to switch with us?

397
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,730
No, it's okay.

398
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,100
Are you asking for an exchange after you checked it?

399
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,970
- We'll reveal it now.
- Okay. What is it?

400
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,538
It's Wishing Happy Birthday Card.

401
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,539
(Wishing Happy Birthday Card)

402
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,879
- It's all right.
- Our card is better.

403
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,948
- This is better.
- What's yours?

404
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,009
- This is better.
- Let's exchange.

405
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,379
- You picked a good one.
- What is it?

406
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,719
We're going to karaoke later.

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,289
- It's a karaoke card.
- Karaoke.

408
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:19,689
For 30 minutes?

409
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,058
It can be similar.

410
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,289
We might finish early.

411
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,059
It's okay if we find the birthday person.

412
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,688
- Shall we start now?
- Yes.

413
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,689
Let's get going.

414
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,499
(Traditional liquor bingo race starts.)

415
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,798
- See you in the evening.
- See you.

416
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,199
- See you.
- See you later.

417
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,470
- See you.
- Okay.

418
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,840
- See you later.
- Okay.

419
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,640
(Resolved to play fair)

420
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,209
All right.

421
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,709
We used to drive before.

422
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,879
I see. But not today.

423
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,009
(They'll use a van today.)

424
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,078
You can sit in the middle.

425
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,209
This is great.

426
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,480
(Comfortable)

427
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,219
Sung Hoon, they have briquette bulgogi here.

428
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,289
That's nice.

429
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,019
- Are you a meat lover?
- I'm a meat lover.

430
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Sung Hoon only eats meat.

431
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,590
He's like a lion.

432
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,490
He has the same appetite as a lion.

433
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,090
He only eats meat.

434
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,600
We can go on two routes.

435
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,600
- There are two places for meat.
- We can go there.

436
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,870
We'll go to Gangjin and Jangheung. And we're done.

437
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,039
Haenam is next, right?

438
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,039
Gangjin, Jangheung, and Haenam. Then we're done.

439
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,079
We're going to Gangjin quickly.

440
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,510
I'd appreciate it if we could go now.

441
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,809
Thank you.

442
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,750
I was afraid they'd leave before we do.

443
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,318
(Team Guys is calculating time...)

444
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,818
(and finds out the other team leaving now.)

445
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:29,819
What?

446
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,828
Quickly. We need to go too.

447
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:32,959
Gangjin, Tae Hyun?

448
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,989
- Shall we go to Gangjin?
- Okay.

449
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,359
Please drive us to Gangjin.

450
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,460
(Team Guys also goes to Gangjin.)

451
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,370
We should have said it quickly.

452
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,870
(Team Guys leaves for Gangjin.)

453
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,538
(Team Handsome)

454
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:49,539
All right.

455
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,678
Let's beat them today.

456
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,380
We have two reattempt cards.

457
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,220
Okay. We can't lose with reattempt cards.

458
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,678
They might ask unexpected questions.

459
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,949
- It's totally different.
- Right.

460
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:00,948
They're following us.

461
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,089
If they're following...

462
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,890
- They're following us.
- They're following us.

463
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,089
They're following us.

464
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,090
(Handsome Guys race to Gangjin.)

465
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,059
Please. We need to get there first.

466
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,029
It's the right-turn signal.

467
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,569
- Hello.
- Dong Hyun.

468
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:15,840
Yes.

469
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,438
Where are you heading so fast?

470
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,909
Where are you going so fast?

471
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,879
It's because we're going to Yeosu.

472
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,909
It's far.

473
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,010
(Lying automatically)

474
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,809
You're not going to Yeosu for sure.

475
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,279
(Laughing)

476
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,490
You're smart.

477
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,720
If you can at least tell me where you're going,

478
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,930
we won't go there.

479
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,829
Don't go to Yeosu and Suncheon.

480
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,059
- Yeosu and Suncheon?
- Yes.

481
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,269
All right. Then we'll...

482
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,270
Where are you going now?

483
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:49,739
We'll go to Gangjin, so don't go to Gangjin.

484
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,970
(We're going to Gangjin, so don't go there.)

485
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:55,538
- What?
- Are you going to Gangjin?

486
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:56,539
(They're going to Gangjin too.)

487
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,010
- Gangjin?
- Yes.

488
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,279
(Hesitant)

489
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,379
You're going to Gangjin?

490
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,849
Yes.

491
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,479
(I got you.)

492
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,579
- Yes.
- Yes.

493
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:05,889
I see.

494
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,859
Come here. just come.

495
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,388
Dong Hyun, when I said we were going to Gangjin,

496
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,929
you said "come" instead of "go."

497
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,329
Aren't you saying you're going to get there before us?

498
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
(He got me.)

499
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,298
I don't think I should talk more. Wait a second.

500
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,569
You should talk.

501
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,298
First, we're...

502
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,469
(Conversation method of Sung Hoon who has years of experience)

503
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,568
Please tell me frankly.

504
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,709
- First, we're going to Gangjin.
- I see.

505
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,839
(Why are you saying that?)

506
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,010
You should go somewhere else.

507
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,219
You're threatening me.

508
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,048
(You shouldn't threaten us.)

509
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:39,719
All right.

510
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,449
(It seems they got all the information they need.)

511
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,160
(Okay, that's enough.)

512
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,058
- All right.
- Okay.

513
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,128
(The call ends.)

514
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,558
They'll definitely put us to sleep.

515
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,200
- I guess so.
- They'll put us to sleep.

516
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,799
Gosh, the nap card.

517
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:53,199
That one has an impact.

518
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,000
I guess they'd put us to sleep after we get there.

519
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,499
This shouldn't be happening.

520
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,639
If they occupy Gangjin, we can't guarantee the win.

521
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,308
(Worried)

522
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:03,510
That has an impact.

523
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,039
But we can't tell yet...

524
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,349
because it's not guaranteed that they'd get the answer.

525
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,049
They might not get the answer.

526
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,989
(Is the car pulling over onto the shoulder?)

527
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,049
- Why?
- What is it?

528
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,990
(What's going on?)

529
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,659
- Why?
- What is it, sir?

530
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,500
(Team Handsome's car suddenly stops.)

531
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,828
- They're passing us.
- Why?

532
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,828
(They're passing us.)

533
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,900
They pulled over.

534
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,109
(We can't wait to pass.)

535
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,480
They pulled over.

536
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:39,410
(All right. Bye.)

537
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,318
(Feeling catharsis)

538
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,479
They pulled over.

539
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,649
Good night.

540
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,049
(Good night.)

541
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,319
(After ending the call with Team Handsome)

542
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,759
Wherever they go,

543
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,089
it's better to put them to sleep now.

544
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:54,529
- We need to occupy Gangjin.
- Right.

545
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,229
Please put the other team to sleep.

546
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,528
(Please put the other team to sleep.)

547
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,669
We'll discourage them in the beginning.

548
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,730
(They use the nap card.)

549
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:03,399
Team Guys used the nap card.

550
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,868
(30-minute nap card)

551
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,439
- Seriously.
- Here?

552
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,910
(On the road, just like this?)

553
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,378
- Really?
- This is mean.

554
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,180
We can expect to get sleepy now.

555
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,250
(Dispirited)

556
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,118
Why did they have to pick the nap card?

557
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,950
(We're going now.)

558
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,950
- I'll give you blankets.
- Okay.

559
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,389
Here's a diffuser.

560
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,629
The 30 minutes start now.

561
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,259
I'll close the door.

562
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,460
Take a rest.

563
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,058
A diffuser.

564
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,470
Let me check the time now.

565
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,598
They're playing this music.

566
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,599
(A traditional song)

567
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,799
Goodness. No.

568
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,470
(What's all this?)

569
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,608
I'm using the nap card twice.

570
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,809
(Napping for the second time)

571
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,240
- Do they play it for 30 minutes?
- Yes.

572
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,720
Back then, I felt so tired...

573
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,619
that I slept well even with this song played.

574
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,520
(Bye. Good night.)

575
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,490
(Suddenly, in a car, )

576
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,059
(taking a REM sleep)

577
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,469
(Getting a deep sleep unexpectedly)

578
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,699
(Team Guys)

579
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,199
Sir, you can go slowly now.

580
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,139
With this, they might...

581
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,839
think about changing the destination...

582
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,010
They'll change it.

583
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,439
They need to change the destination, as I see.

584
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,910
(Team Handsome starts to sleep at 8:45am.)

585
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,878
Witnessing them sleeping,

586
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,449
my dopamine level quickly increased.

587
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,450
(Laughing)

588
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,348
(They arrive at Gangjin with their dopamine on a high level.)

589
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:29,520
Here we are.

590
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,029
(Byeongyeong-myeon, Gangjin is located in the wide field.)

591
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,699
(There's soju with a long history here.)

592
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,439
(Brewery)

593
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,538
A traditional brewery in Gangjin.

594
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,410
(Soju)

595
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,210
(Handsome Heritage 1: Soju in a legend)

596
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,278
- Hello.
- Hello.

597
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,848
- Hello.
- Hello.

598
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:58,378
- Nice to meet you.
- I expected a master artisan.

599
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:01,650
- You're rather pretty young.
- It's nice to meet you.

600
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,388
I'm Kim Ji Yu, the director of this brewery.

601
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:07,629
Hello, Director Kim.

602
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,729
This is the brewery my father ran.

603
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,829
(This is the brewery my father ran.)

604
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,539
- You're his daughter.
- Yes.

605
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,970
My father passed away last year.

606
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,068
- I see.
- So now,

607
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:24,579
I'm operating this with my siblings.

608
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,679
This brewery was much larger in the past.

609
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
(I see.)

610
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:32,950
The brewery consists of the first factory over there,

611
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,759
- Look at that.
- It's written there.

612
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,618
Excuse me, but it looks like the chimney of a public bath.

613
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,429
Right, it's the public bath's chimney.

614
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,128
Actually, it's a chimney of the distillery.

615
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,459
They have something like that here?

616
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,699
(The distillery chimney symbolizes a high-class liquor.)

617
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,598
The brewery located over there in the past...

618
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,509
was pretty big, with 20 employees.

619
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,538
(The brewery boasted a larger size in the past.)

620
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,949
My father started working at the brewery in 1957.

621
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,950
(Her father entered the brewery in 1957.)

622
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:06,219
(This brewery was bloomed by barley soju.)

623
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,720
They brewed barley soju as well here back then.

624
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:11,588
Barley soju?

625
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:12,888
(He hasn't heard of it.)

626
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:16,899
This region has produced a lot of mixed grains.

627
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
As barley was massively produced,

628
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,098
every household brewed liquor...

629
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,098
for ancestral rites.

630
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,939
(Barely produced in this region...)

631
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,910
(was fermented at home, )

632
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:32,278
(and they distilled it using sojugori.)

633
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,079
They brewed liquor by distilling,

634
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,179
but in 1965,

635
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,089
Food Grains Management Act was implemented,

636
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,618
saying the rice for food wasn't enough...

637
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,358
and liquor shouldn't be produced using grains.

638
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,990
So the production of soju stopped.

639
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:49,329
Then in 2014, my father restored its production.

640
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,930
He knew how to brew the liquor.

641
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:56,499
So he was designated as a food master.

642
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,608
(Traditional liquor was revived.)

643
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,179
This is the Superior Taste Award.

644
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,739
Did you take the first place on that day?

645
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,808
(Yi Kyung spots the award from an international tasting show.)

646
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:05,809
This is...

647
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,349
It means it's globally recognized.

648
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,749
But actually, the soju production...

649
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,889
has stopped after my father passed away.

650
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,528
During the production process, there's a distillation part.

651
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,028
I'll explain it to you.

652
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,328
Then we'll be honored to listen to it.

653
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:30,239
Please get changed to a hygiene gown.

654
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,869
(Can they meet the legendary soju?)

655
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,509
(Team Handsome)

656
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,609
- Let's go.
- It's over, right?

657
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,079
I feel great.

658
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,650
Let's go.

659
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:47,389
We need to go quickly. We have a long way to go.

660
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,189
We have not heard from them yet.

661
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,190
(Where is Team Handsome going?)

662
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,930
We haven't heard anything from them yet.

663
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,899
- Is it a good sign?
- There's hope.

664
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,430
- Good.
- Nice.

665
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,339
We've arrived already.

666
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,969
- We're there?
- I guess they didn't get it.

667
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,409
- It's amazing.
- They shouldn't have.

668
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,538
I think they didn't get the answer.

669
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,039
(Team Handsome followed Team Guys to Gangjin.)

670
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,210
I guess their car is over there.

671
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,680
If their car is in the parking lot, we need to wait.

672
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,849
It's their car, right in the front.

673
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,520
There's no guarantee that they will get the answer.

674
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:22,519
We will get it, so let's wait in the parking lot.

675
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,619
(We'll get the answer, so let's wait!)

676
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,889
If they get the answer, we'll go to Jangheung right away.

677
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,529
That's not bad. They have Korean beef.

678
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,559
- We need to eat Korean beef.
- I know.

679
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,900
They're out.

680
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,569
- Yes.
- They're out.

681
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,268
- Yes.
- They're out.

682
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:41,098
- They're out.
- Now they'll answer the question.

683
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,638
I guess they saw us.

684
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,868
Sung Hoon, I guess they saw us now.

685
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:46,736
They're here.

686
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:47,808
(Hello.)

687
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,176
They're here.

688
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:50,247
(They're here!)

689
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:52,977
Why are you here?

690
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:54,746
- Excuse me?
- Why are you here?

691
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:56,347
You have no reattempt card.

692
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,348
Are you here expecting to get it wrong?

693
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,387
We believe that you'll get the wrong answer.

694
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,087
Why are you using this strategy?

695
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:03,926
It's because we have both reattempt cards.

696
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,358
We have to occupy Gangjin.

697
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:08,027
What if we succeed?

698
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:09,997
We have Plan B for that too.

699
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:12,868
What a reckless strategy is that?

700
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:14,936
I don't think this is a good strategy.

701
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,367
You should change the strategy now.

702
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:17,936
- You should change the strategy.
- Let them do it.

703
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,637
It's better for us.

704
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:21,677
Let them do it. It's the best for us.

705
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:24,647
But it's such a foolish strategy.

706
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,118
Definitely.

707
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,517
It's natural that we do this.

708
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:31,318
I guess they thought we'd go somewhere else after the nap.

709
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,756
Are they thinking less straight than me?

710
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:34,916
No.

711
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,788
- They know, but they're doing it?
- They're actors.

712
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:37,987
- Be careful.
- Okay.

713
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,196
(Meanwhile, 3 actors continue the tour.)

714
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:42,726
This is a quite old factory.

715
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:45,736
I guess it's about 60 to 70 years old.

716
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:47,037
(They enter the old distillery.)

717
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:48,937
- Look at that.
- Those are oak barrels.

718
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,037
These oak barrels are made in France.

719
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,277
- That's right.
- Really?

720
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:53,477
I can see that.

721
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,878
We mature the liquor in oak barrels too.

722
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,347
Are these all for soju?

723
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,377
Barley soju is being matured now.

724
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:04,446
I'm curious about distilled barley soju.

725
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:06,157
(Amazed)

726
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:08,456
You see here...

727
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,757
What's that?

728
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:14,397
A copper distillation machine for an atmospheric distillation process.

729
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:17,368
It looks like a total combination of science.

730
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:22,097
It works in the same principle with the Korean traditional sojugori.

731
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:24,707
(The same principle with sojugori, the traditional distillation method)

732
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,706
(The base liquor fermented in advance...)

733
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:34,717
(is put into the distillation pot.)

734
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:42,358
(It's heated to boil alcohol.)

735
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:47,727
(When the top of the liquor is cooled down, )

736
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:52,068
(alcohol gets condensed again and falls.)

737
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:57,507
(The distillation principle is the same now.)

738
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:02,206
I heard...

739
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,047
that we could taste it.

740
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,348
Yes, we don't have much liquor now,

741
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:09,118
but we prepared a little bit for tasting.

742
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:11,647
Can we taste it? It's so precious.

743
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,317
They're preparing to produce it again...

744
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,788
starting from next year.

745
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:20,226
Since you're here now before we start production,

746
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:22,967
- you will get the chance.
- It will be produced tomorrow.

747
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:30,308
(Kim Young Hee, bearer of Gangjin barley soju)

748
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:35,747
(He'll keep the precious heritage his father left.)

749
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:39,818
These are the only few left...

750
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,877
- Right.
- by your father when he was alive.

751
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:42,986
(Only a few bottles...)

752
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:45,716
(of barley soju made by her father are left now.)

753
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:48,186
This transparent liquor is barley soju.

754
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:49,756
(This transparent liquor is barley soju.)

755
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:52,357
The production date which is the bottling date is indicated.

756
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:55,426
Only the production date is here.

757
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:57,167
May 9, 2023...

758
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,598
means the liquor was made before my father passed away.

759
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:00,767
That's right.

760
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:03,138
In a way, I get goosebumps now.

761
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:06,338
His father can't make it now.

762
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,676
This is what he made when he was alive.

763
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,107
I wonder if we can drink it.

764
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:11,406
(It's the liquor with her father's touch.)

765
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,476
- Can we have it?
- Just a little bit, please.

766
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:15,117
- We cannot...
- The alcohol percentage is high.

767
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:16,447
Pour it on our own.

768
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,318
- I'll pour a bit for each of you.
- Thank you.

769
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:21,217
- This is so precious.
- You can give him some more.

770
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:24,088
- Just a bit, please.
- Yes, just a bit.

771
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:25,388
Thank you.

772
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:27,797
I'm not sure what question we'll get today, but cheers for our victory.

773
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:29,466
(A toast wishing their victory)

774
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,568
We're making a toast automatically.

775
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,267
(Tae Hyun drinks it right away.)

776
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:35,466
It shows he doesn't know how to drink.

777
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:37,067
He drinks it right away without smelling it.

778
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,007
(Look at him.)

779
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,706
(Trembling)

780
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:42,878
Do you like it?

781
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:45,578
(Pleased)

782
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:51,118
(Yi Kyung feels the aroma carefully.)

783
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:57,058
For common soju,

784
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:59,027
we say, "It tastes sweet today."

785
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,627
It has sweetener, in fact.

786
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,466
- Right. This...
- Does the sweet taste...

787
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,867
that I feel on my lips now come from barley?

788
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,967
That's right.

789
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,567
When liquor is distilled, alcohol also produces a sweet taste.

790
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:12,337
But rice and barley...

791
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,537
have different sweet tastes.

792
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:17,906
Compared to whiskey with a similar percentage of alcohol,

793
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,677
the taste feels softer.

794
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:21,216
We usually say...

795
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,017
- that liquor tastes bitter.
- Yes.

796
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:25,618
But this liquor tastes sweet.

797
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,388
That means you're a heavy drinker.

798
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,187
I love to drink.

799
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:34,756
I suddenly feel dizzy three seconds after I drank it.

800
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:35,767
(Wait a minute.)

801
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:37,926
By the way, how come this mushroom tastes so good?

802
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,237
What?

803
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:40,997
It surprised me.

804
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,666
You should sell this too.

805
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,906
As I see,

806
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,006
- this will hit the jackpot.
- It's a side dish for liquor.

807
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:47,577
How did you make this?

808
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,578
It tastes savory, right?

809
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,078
- This will hit the jackpot.
- Right.

810
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,578
- What's this?
- Did you make it yourself?

811
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:55,716
No, I didn't make it myself.

812
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:58,916
It actually contains a lot of sugar.

813
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,887
- That's why it tastes good.
- Yes, you're right.

814
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:02,058
Still, it's mushroom.

815
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:04,558
- All right.
- Okay.

816
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,298
- Let's wait.
- They're not calling.

817
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:09,298
- We should wait.
- Why aren't they calling?

818
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:14,338
Right. It's been about ten minutes since they left.

819
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,937
They should call us by now.

820
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,338
- It's about time they should come.
- Yes.

821
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,976
(This should not...)

822
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:25,146
(be happening.)

823
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:27,377
It's definitely about time they answer the question.

824
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:28,577
(The wait time gets much longer than they expected.)

825
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,618
Well...

826
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,557
Maybe we should have left for Jangheung?

827
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:33,558
(Wait. Should we have left for Jangheung?)

828
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,487
It's because... You're right.

829
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:38,057
If they don't get the answer while we're in Jangheung,

830
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,197
we can come to Gangjin again.

831
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,497
- If they don't get it?
- Yes.

832
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,598
- Right.
- That's why...

833
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:48,568
Tae Hyun asked us why we were waiting here.

834
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,206
- That's right.
- Right?

835
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:52,638
They can't come back anyway, if they get the wrong answer.

836
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:56,207
Why have we waited here? You're right.

837
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:57,548
No, Dong Hyun.

838
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:58,807
We should head to Jangheung now.

839
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,378
- Shall we go now?
- Yes. Let's go.

840
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:02,217
Let's go.

841
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:04,186
Seriously. It's the right choice.

842
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:06,557
- We'll go to Jangheung.
- We'll go there.

843
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,588
- Let's go quickly.
- We'll go to Jangheung.

844
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:11,656
- Let's get going.
- Okay. All right.

845
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:12,858
You never know.

846
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:16,097
But Dong Hyun, it was a good thing that we stayed there.

847
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:17,496
- What?
- Because of us,

848
00:31:17,497 --> 00:31:19,167
they're not getting out although they don't know the answer.

849
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:20,967
Is that possible?

850
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,967
- Are they putting off time?
- Not to give us a chance.

851
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:25,107
- Is that so?
- They would think we're there.

852
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:27,108
- Yes.
- That's right.

853
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,847
Please give thanks to the director for introducing...

854
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,646
- the precious liquor.
- Thank you.

855
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,447
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Welcome.

856
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:36,817
(Time for Quiz)

857
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:38,388
We need to put our soul into it.

858
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:41,017
(Waiting for the quiz being resolutely determined)

859
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:42,288
Here's the question.

860
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:46,457
During the Joseon Dynasty, Hamel lived in Joseon for 13 years,

861
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:50,427
and he spent seven years here in Gangjin.

862
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,497
- What did you say?
- Hamel.

863
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:53,897
Hamel?

864
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:55,436
- Hamel?
- Hamel?

865
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:56,838
- Hamel?
- Yes, Hamel.

866
00:31:57,868 --> 00:31:59,108
Is he a foreigner?

867
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:03,947
(Hamel is Dutch, and he wrote "The Journal of Hendrick Hamel.")

868
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:08,177
(Hamel landed on Joseon while heading to Japan.)

869
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:12,788
(He was detained in Joseon for about 13 years.)

870
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:15,256
(He recorded what he experienced...)

871
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:17,027
(in "The Journal of Hendrick Hamel.")

872
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:19,396
"The Journal of Hendrick Hamel..."

873
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,727
is considered the first literature to introduce Joseon to Europe.

874
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,528
Okay.

875
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:25,497
Hamel was an employee of the East India Company.

876
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:29,167
What's the true reason that he wrote "The Journal of Hendrick Hamel"?

877
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,537
- What was that?
- It's such a subjective question.

878
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,608
Is it a subjective question?

879
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,078
(At a loss)

880
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:36,977
The true reason he wrote "The Journal of Hendrick Hamel?"

881
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,647
- Yes.
- Is there something behind it?

882
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:41,277
Then can you tell us the spurious reason?

883
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:42,578
If the reason originally known...

884
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:44,518
was not true.

885
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:47,817
This is what I think.

886
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,388
He thought his death was close.

887
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:53,397
- I see.
- Wouldn't he?

888
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,196
He wrote his biography as if writing a will...

889
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,668
because he didn't know what would happen to him.

890
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:02,637
That sounds right, but is it the true reason or not?

891
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,106
- The true reason is...
- The true reason...

892
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,337
- that, I think.
- There should be a true reason.

893
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,537
What Tae Hyun said is right.

894
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:10,648
He tried to leave something behind.

895
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:12,147
(Sighing)

896
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:13,577
I seriously have no idea.

897
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:14,618
(His sigh shows he's so frustrated.)

898
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:17,587
Tae Hyun, it seems that we'd take some time for this.

899
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,587
- You should sit here.
- How come...

900
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,788
- Don't squat like that.
- I'm so ignorant?

901
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:26,498
- I think he was...
- I guess I got the idea.

902
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:27,757
What is it?

903
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,867
I listened to the question carefully,

904
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:30,898
and I think this is the reason.

905
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:32,567
- What he had been doing.
- To make money.

906
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,297
Did he write it to earn money?

907
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:36,867
(To make money?)

908
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:39,406
Then did he do it thinking he could sell the book?

909
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:41,276
Let's say one reason each and put them together.

910
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:44,307
If Hamel wrote it seriously to make money,

911
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,578
the reason should be to sell the book.

912
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,986
I have a feeling that he wrote...

913
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,217
and he kept showing it to someone.

914
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:57,888
From the company's perspective, he suddenly disappeared.

915
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,157
He was an employee of that company, right?

916
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:02,027
Was he a regular employee?

917
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:04,668
Then it's really...

918
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:07,237
In my opinion... I'll change the answer.

919
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,296
- Are you alone here?
- To show it.

920
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,538
- Where?
- To whom?

921
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:12,268
Do we have to provide that too?

922
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:15,708
Parents, his boss, the CEO,

923
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,606
and the king of his country at that time.

924
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,947
But when I listened to the question,

925
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,248
it wouldn't matter if it was "Hamel who was Dutch,"

926
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,216
but it was "he worked for the East India Company."

927
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:25,717
So I think the target was his company.

928
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:29,526
The reason I think we're fortunate...

929
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,228
is that Team Handsome is waiting for us.

930
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,897
If they're still waiting outside...

931
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:35,656
Even if we don't get the answer, they can never get it.

932
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,927
- They can use the reattempt card.
- They have hints from the cards.

933
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:39,768
They can get two.

934
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,966
- Then, let's say I'm Hamel.
- Okay.

935
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:45,437
- I'm confined for a dozen years.
- You're detained.

936
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:47,478
- But I feel it's wrong.
- You feel you're wronged.

937
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,377
I've been working this much,

938
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,276
so give me the money as much as I worked.

939
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:54,717
(In short, give me the money.)

940
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,247
- Say you got it.
- Seung Ho.

941
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:57,418
(Tossing it to Seung Ho)

942
00:34:58,087 --> 00:34:59,888
(What they said is too long to condense as an answer.)

943
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:01,388
Refine it nicely.

944
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,656
For this, we shouldn't be too specific.

945
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:05,756
- We should say it rough and broad.
- Make it a broad answer.

946
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:07,026
- Say, "We got it." - We got it.

947
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:08,626
Hamel felt he was wronged...

948
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:11,828
because he couldn't avoid landing on Korea.

949
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:13,537
But did Hamel loaf around there?

950
00:35:13,538 --> 00:35:15,367
- He didn't loaf around.
- I don't think so. He didn't.

951
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:18,037
For 13 years, although he was drifted,

952
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,478
he saw various things in Korea...

953
00:35:21,237 --> 00:35:22,307
- like culture...
- Here.

954
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:23,347
Say it broadly.

955
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:25,808
It can't be any broader.

956
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:27,377
- Okay.
- Yes.

957
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:29,888
He saw, listened to, and felt so many things.

958
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:31,486
And when he came back to the East India Company,

959
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,117
he told them, "I wasn't hanging out."

960
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:34,486
It could be his wage...

961
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,458
- or compensation.
- He should get compensation.

962
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:39,126
For those things, he recorded things every day...

963
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:41,098
to report it to the company.

964
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:42,598
That's it.

965
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:45,868
(They pour out everything they thought.)

966
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:48,997
(Not sure whether the answer was right...)

967
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,138
(or wrong)

968
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:52,907
(Please)

969
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,308
You're correct.

970
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:56,677
- We made it.
- Be quiet.

971
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,047
Come on.

972
00:35:58,777 --> 00:35:59,977
We forced it a bit, though.

973
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:01,046
(We forced it a bit, though.)

974
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,747
- What's the exact answer?
- What's the accurate one?

975
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,287
I'll say it accurately.

976
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:08,157
To get the wage he hadn't received for 13 years,

977
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,728
Hamel made a report to the company.

978
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:12,997
Thank you.

979
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:15,697
(Team Guys achieves Gangjin.)

980
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:17,728
- Hamel!
- Hamel!

981
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,397
We can do it! Thank you.

982
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:21,737
(Soju)

983
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,268
- Okay. We're here.
- Here we are.

984
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:26,106
My goodness.

985
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:27,707
(Arriving in Jangheung)

986
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,737
Let's go.

987
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:31,946
It's a brewery.

988
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,148
(What's the traditional liquor they'll see in Jangheung?)

989
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:35,348
Okay. Let's go.

990
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,018
Sounds good.

991
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,587
(Welcome)

992
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:41,787
Gosh, the smell.

993
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:43,356
- I can smell the alcohol.
- Even from here.

994
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:44,487
It reeks of makgeolli.

995
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:46,458
- The smell is potent.
- It's this way.

996
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:50,167
(Chae Chang Heon, Brewery CEO)

997
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,197
Here...

998
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,767
(The potent smell shoots up their noses from the entrance.)

999
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:54,938
Gosh. I can smell the alcohol.

1000
00:36:55,668 --> 00:36:58,268
This is where we manufacture our liquor.

1001
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,407
- Is this how it's made?
- Yes.

1002
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,947
The process has just begun.

1003
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:10,348
(Handsome Heritage 2: Traditional liquor in present time)

1004
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:13,657
This is the heart of our facility.

1005
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,057
Since you're wearing sanitary uniforms,

1006
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:17,087
you'll get a brief tour.

1007
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:19,998
Gosh, what's this smell?

1008
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:25,697
(Beginning the tour of the makgeolli factory)

1009
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,868
(Brewing traditional liquor: Step 1)

1010
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,466
This is glutinous rice that has been soaked.

1011
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,237
(Cleaned glutinous rice that was soaked in water for over 7 hours)

1012
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:36,947
(Steamed while covered with a cotton cloth)

1013
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:42,518
(It gives you soft rice that is on the dry side.)

1014
00:37:43,717 --> 00:37:48,087
(Malt is mixed with the cooled down rice.)

1015
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:54,958
(Everything is then placed in clean water.)

1016
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:00,737
(The hidden yeast ferments the rice.)

1017
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:02,438
(Next is the fermentation.)

1018
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,607
This is where the mixture is fermented.

1019
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,808
You can see it being fermented.

1020
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,537
(Temperature and humidity are strictly under control...)

1021
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:09,648
(at the fermentation chamber.)

1022
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:11,376
(Bubbling away)

1023
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:13,176
(Yeast within the malt is doing its job.)

1024
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:14,177
It's bubbling.

1025
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:15,617
The wine is being fermented in here.

1026
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:18,087
- I can hear it.
- Right.

1027
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:22,888
(The sound of liquor brewing is as clear as the sound of rain.)

1028
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,958
It's bubbling away on its own.

1029
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:26,288
Of course.

1030
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:28,257
- It's being fermented.
- Fermentation...

1031
00:38:28,627 --> 00:38:29,868
is a power struggle.

1032
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,127
It's the process...

1033
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:32,898
of fermentation organisms fighting off harmful bacteria.

1034
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,038
If there is enough of the former,

1035
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,836
they will kill the latter.

1036
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:38,237
(Thus, traditional liquor is made.)

1037
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:43,176
(This brewery specializes in makgeolli and dongdongju.)

1038
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,676
- Like that.
- I see.

1039
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:46,577
- I have a question.
- Sure.

1040
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:48,748
What's the difference between makgeolli and dongdongju?

1041
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:53,188
Makgeolli, cheongju, yakju, soju, and dongdongju.

1042
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:56,427
- They follow the same process.
- Right.

1043
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:58,086
(Our traditional liquor can be made with malt, rice, and water.)

1044
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,027
After we mix the ingredients,

1045
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,626
we separate the mixture...

1046
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:02,757
by fermenting it at a low temperature.

1047
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:04,426
- At a low temperature.
- Liquid rises to the top.

1048
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,967
(Liquor, Sediments)

1049
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:08,537
We use what is called a yongsu...

1050
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:09,836
to filter the clear liquid.

1051
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:11,208
(Yongsu: A long cylinder used to filter liquor or paste)

1052
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:13,977
Clear liquor rises to the top.

1053
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,507
(Filtering the liquor using a yongsu)

1054
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,046
(Clear filtered liquor)

1055
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:20,148
The clear liquor...

1056
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:23,617
is what you know as cheongju and yakju.

1057
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,987
(Cheongju or yakju)

1058
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:29,486
However, if you don't use a yongsu...

1059
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:32,656
Once the liquor is made and the liquid is separated,

1060
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:34,256
grains of rice rise to the top.

1061
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:35,297
(Floating)

1062
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:38,667
By ladling it out, it becomes dongdongju.

1063
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,967
(Dongdongju)

1064
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:45,207
Adding water to what's left gives you makgeolli.

1065
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,208
(Makgeolli)

1066
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:48,807
(They come from the same mixture...)

1067
00:39:48,808 --> 00:39:50,877
(but differs depending on how they are filtered.)

1068
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:54,947
(What about the taste?)

1069
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:59,587
These are the drinks we make here.

1070
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:02,387
The makgeolli and dongdongju.

1071
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:03,388
(Dongdongju, makgeolli)

1072
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,187
Only the malt is different.

1073
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:06,797
They're made with the same glutinous rice.

1074
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:08,957
This is made with a traditional malt...

1075
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,267
while this is made with a rice malt.

1076
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,328
(Dongdongju: traditional malt, makgeolli: rice malt)

1077
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:14,397
What should we drink first?

1078
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:16,668
You should try this first.

1079
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,507
Liquor made with rice malt tends to have cleaner flavors.

1080
00:40:20,677 --> 00:40:21,737
It's perfect for the MZ generation.

1081
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,078
Those who aren't familiar with makgeolli.

1082
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:27,216
Go ahead.

1083
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,577
(He smells it first.)

1084
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:31,086
- It smells sweet.
- It's liked by the MZ generation.

1085
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,486
- This is the smell I wanted.
- I gave you this first...

1086
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,356
since the flavors are cleaner...

1087
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:37,228
- compared to the other one.
- I get it.

1088
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,926
Go ahead and drink it.

1089
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:42,557
Hold on. It tastes like carbonated yogurt.

1090
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:43,768
- Exactly.
- It's delicious.

1091
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:45,728
It doesn't taste like liquor.

1092
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:48,296
It's more like a yogurt drink.

1093
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:50,967
- Women would love this.
- Yes, the ladies love it more.

1094
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:53,537
Okay, I want to try this too.

1095
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:57,107
This will give you more traditional flavors.

1096
00:40:57,578 --> 00:40:59,817
It was made with a lot of traditional malt.

1097
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:01,977
It's thicker than the other one.

1098
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:03,287
And weighty.

1099
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,046
(Dongdongju made with a traditional malt...)

1100
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,217
(that has a strong smell)

1101
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,887
(Nice)

1102
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,927
That's delicious.

1103
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:13,657
This was made in the most traditional way...

1104
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:17,228
(Being serious)

1105
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:19,197
Back when I served in the military,

1106
00:41:19,398 --> 00:41:20,398
I drank makgeolli...

1107
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,398
- from a huge pot.
- Right.

1108
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,038
This is my first time drinking some since then, and this is delicious.

1109
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:26,937
This is definitely for those who are new to makgeolli.

1110
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:28,276
You can then move on to this.

1111
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,477
- Lastly...
- This is for beginners.

1112
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:30,676
Those who love to drink...

1113
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:32,347
will end up drinking that.

1114
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:33,876
The younger generation prefers this.

1115
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,216
- Do you agree?
- That must be it.

1116
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:37,117
- Is this what you prefer?
- That's right.

1117
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:38,888
That's because you're still relatively young.

1118
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:44,857
(The recipe of this dongdongju has been in the family.)

1119
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:50,527
My mother was the daughter-in-law of a head family.

1120
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:53,167
They had 1 to 3 memorial services...

1121
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:54,268
every month.

1122
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,168
Liquor had to be made...

1123
00:41:57,268 --> 00:41:59,107
to serve at memorial services.

1124
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:00,477
She had me doing chores day and night.

1125
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,876
Get the bowl, bring me this, and light up the stove.

1126
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:05,347
In the end, I knew I could even make it myself.

1127
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,546
(Smirking)

1128
00:42:06,547 --> 00:42:09,677
Then, after I got married,

1129
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,617
we bought a brewery.

1130
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:12,687
We used flour to make the liquor,

1131
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:14,418
so you can imagine how poorly it did.

1132
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:16,987
That's when I figured I'd try making...

1133
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:21,197
the liquor my mother used to make for the memorial services.

1134
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:23,627
Just like that, I gave it a shot...

1135
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:25,967
and made dongdongju.

1136
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,737
That became the talk of the town.

1137
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:29,837
People said it was delicious.

1138
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:33,276
(The heritage of the head family...)

1139
00:42:33,277 --> 00:42:34,906
(is now being brewed at a cutting-edge factory.)

1140
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:36,578
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1141
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:38,506
Please give your love to our traditional liquor.

1142
00:42:38,507 --> 00:42:39,676
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1143
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:41,447
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1144
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:43,176
(Cuckoo)

1145
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:44,917
- What's that?
- Did they get it?

1146
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:47,987
(Gangjin!)

1147
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:51,057
They got it right in Gangjin.

1148
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,257
Did they get it right?

1149
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:54,998
What can we do?

1150
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:56,426
We could have been there until now.

1151
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:58,527
That puts a damper on our plan.

1152
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,566
We believed they wouldn't go there.

1153
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:02,597
Shall we hurry with your quiz?

1154
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:03,938
- Yes, we need to hurry.
- All right.

1155
00:43:04,308 --> 00:43:05,907
Let's do this.

1156
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:07,937
Right. This is Jangheung.

1157
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,007
(Time for Quiz)

1158
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:11,407
(In Jangheung, you tasted dongdongju.)

1159
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:13,578
King Yeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty...

1160
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:17,918
enforced the strictest prohibition in Korean history.

1161
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:20,657
Whoever violated this law was banished,

1162
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:23,187
and scholars who drank liquor...

1163
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:25,558
weren't eligible to take the state exam.

1164
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:28,157
King Yeongjo banned alcohol...

1165
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:30,367
to prevent the people...

1166
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:33,538
from getting into trouble while drunk.

1167
00:43:33,837 --> 00:43:36,438
However, there was another reason behind the prohibition.

1168
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:38,937
What was that reason?

1169
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:41,308
Is this reason written in history?

1170
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:42,478
- Yes.
- I see.

1171
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,808
- No one taught me.
- I bet it's something simple.

1172
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:46,347
- It could be a number of things.
- He banned people...

1173
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:48,147
- from drinking.
- Let's say you were drunk.

1174
00:43:48,148 --> 00:43:49,148
Like that.

1175
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:52,486
- I got it.
- What is it?

1176
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:55,058
- I got it.
- Do share.

1177
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:56,288
I think it's this.

1178
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:57,987
- What is it?
- My guess is that...

1179
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,696
- I think it's this.
- Is this the alcohol talking?

1180
00:44:00,697 --> 00:44:01,797
- Of course not.
- Dong Hyun,

1181
00:44:02,027 --> 00:44:03,296
- are you drunk?
- It's this.

1182
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:05,267
- I know it for sure.
- He's drunk.

1183
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,268
Hear me out.

1184
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:08,697
Brewing liquor must've been even trickier back in the day.

1185
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:11,467
There wasn't enough liquor to go around,

1186
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,837
and King Yeongjo wanted more to himself.

1187
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:15,106
(King Yeongjo wanted more to himself.)

1188
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:16,577
- Is that not it?
- That's...

1189
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:18,546
I think he's telling us that it's incorrect.

1190
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:19,807
I mean liquor...

1191
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:22,177
- of 30 years.
- That makes sense, but...

1192
00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:23,388
Isn't that the answer?

1193
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:24,717
That has to be right.

1194
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:27,487
Isn't that it? But it can be anything.

1195
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:29,656
- Dong Hyun, I know what it is.
- This is the one.

1196
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:31,657
- Yes, this is it.
- But I haven't said anything.

1197
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,398
It's because people drank and didn't work.

1198
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:34,796
- Because they didn't work?
- They didn't farm.

1199
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,797
Right, farming.

1200
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,267
They would've lacked rice.

1201
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:38,327
But you need rice...

1202
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:39,397
- to make this liquor.
- Rice.

1203
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:41,397
- I think I'm right.
- Go with that.

1204
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:43,168
- I think I'm right.
- Only that can be it.

1205
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:45,267
- Okay, say it.
- Right.

1206
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,906
What other choice do we have?

1207
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:49,107
Because the people became lazy after drinking...

1208
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:50,677
and didn't work during the day.

1209
00:44:51,177 --> 00:44:52,347
Because the people became lazy after drinking...

1210
00:44:52,348 --> 00:44:53,648
and didn't work during the day.

1211
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:55,077
It really can be anything.

1212
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:57,518
- So...
- That is incorrect.

1213
00:44:59,418 --> 00:45:01,387
It really can be anything.

1214
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,727
Just think about the number of people there were.

1215
00:45:03,728 --> 00:45:05,027
There would've been so many reasons.

1216
00:45:05,657 --> 00:45:08,227
Since we're here, we need to use this chance card.

1217
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:09,558
This is precious, you know.

1218
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:12,067
- Give us a hint.
- Give us a strong hint.

1219
00:45:12,598 --> 00:45:15,137
- You used the reattempt card.
- This is too difficult.

1220
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:17,038
Here's your hint.

1221
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:20,737
What do you make liquor with?

1222
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:21,836
- Rice.
- Right.

1223
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:23,907
- They didn't make enough rice.
- The main ingredient is rice.

1224
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:25,177
- That's right.
- Right.

1225
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:29,177
King Yeongjo was worried about the lack of rice.

1226
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:31,547
During which period was this?

1227
00:45:32,388 --> 00:45:35,217
I get it now!

1228
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,026
- This is the one.
- King Yeongjo was worried...

1229
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:38,087
about the lack of rice?

1230
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:40,527
It was the year of bad harvest.

1231
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:43,126
It was the year of bad harvest,

1232
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:44,727
so rather than brewing liquor with rice,

1233
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:46,067
he wanted the rice to be consumed as food.

1234
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:48,567
- You're right.
- The rice...

1235
00:45:48,668 --> 00:45:50,066
You make the liquor with rice.

1236
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:52,167
- Right.
- If they keep making liquor,

1237
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:53,267
there will be a lack of rice.

1238
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:56,177
- But they had to eat.
- People had to eat. That's it.

1239
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:58,647
Is that your answer?

1240
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:59,648
- Yes.
- Yes.

1241
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,677
Your answer is...

1242
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:04,287
(Is it...)

1243
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:06,418
(the correct answer?)

1244
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:09,717
(We must occupy the Jangheung square.)

1245
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:10,857
(He was worried about the lack of rice during a lean year.)

1246
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:11,987
That is correct.

1247
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,057
(It's correct.)

1248
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:15,527
- My gosh.
- What was it?

1249
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:16,927
What's the real reason?

1250
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,527
- No way.
- That was too tricky.

1251
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:20,196
(King Yeongjo issued a ban on liquor to prepare for lack of food.)

1252
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:21,567
- We got it.
- We managed to get it though.

1253
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:23,367
We still did a good job.

1254
00:46:23,368 --> 00:46:24,966
We only got it right thanks to the chance card.

1255
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:26,037
Exactly.

1256
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:27,038
(A victory obtained thanks to the reattempt card)

1257
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:29,478
(Jangheung: Dongdongju, Korean beef combo)

1258
00:46:30,177 --> 00:46:34,777
(Jangheung: Dongdongju, Korean beef combo)

1259
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:37,387
Unlike last time,

1260
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:38,888
I am happy that we're eating.

1261
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,418
In fact, you two didn't get to eat last time.

1262
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,656
Hello.

1263
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:45,227
- This must be a famous restaurant.
- Hello.

1264
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:46,558
Hello.

1265
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:47,897
(Gangjin: Briquette bulgogi)

1266
00:46:47,898 --> 00:46:49,458
A briquette bulgogi with rice.

1267
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:51,796
(Over a hot briquette, )

1268
00:46:51,797 --> 00:46:55,467
(the meat is cooked and served.)

1269
00:46:56,297 --> 00:47:01,006
(A smoky taste that will fill up the mouth)

1270
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:02,507
(And various side dishes)

1271
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:05,907
(Korean briquette bulgogi meal with rice, Gangjin)

1272
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:07,348
Is this the basic table setting?

1273
00:47:07,978 --> 00:47:09,446
Why are there so many side dishes?

1274
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:10,547
Are you serious?

1275
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:12,946
- To drink of Gangjin.
- Yes.

1276
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:15,188
- To Gangjin's traditional liquor.
- To Hamel.

1277
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:18,757
- Hamel.
- Why was he here?

1278
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:23,027
Thanks for the food. Enjoy.

1279
00:47:23,828 --> 00:47:26,767
(How will Gangjin's briquette bulgogi taste?)

1280
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:29,938
It comes with onions, which means this restaurant knows what's up.

1281
00:47:30,237 --> 00:47:32,437
You wrap it with the onion like this.

1282
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:34,877
(A piece of bulgogi with a piece of the onion)

1283
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,248
It has a strong smoky flavor.

1284
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:42,918
You're right.

1285
00:47:43,078 --> 00:47:44,148
I love it.

1286
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:47,486
To exaggerate it, it's like grilling my mouth with a blowtorch.

1287
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:49,018
It does have that smoky flavor from briquette.

1288
00:47:50,188 --> 00:47:52,586
- I see.
- I agree.

1289
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:53,657
(Let's focus on him.)

1290
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:03,197
(He is quite serious when it comes to eating.)

1291
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,808
(Staring)

1292
00:48:06,507 --> 00:48:08,478
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

1293
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,578
You didn't get to do this last time.

1294
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:12,877
Poor Seung Ho.

1295
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:16,347
(It's all right.)

1296
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:17,946
It has a strong smoky flavor.

1297
00:48:17,947 --> 00:48:20,118
(I can eat them all today.)

1298
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:24,887
(Resolving the sadness from last week's fasting)

1299
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:25,987
Keep eating.

1300
00:48:27,328 --> 00:48:29,757
I like experiencing new stuff.

1301
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:33,937
- Is it strong? Is it all right?
- It's tasty.

1302
00:48:33,938 --> 00:48:34,967
(I think this is happiness.)

1303
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:38,138
We're eating here, but I don't hear the cuckoo alarm.

1304
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:40,607
They didn't go to Yeongam-gun, then.

1305
00:48:41,277 --> 00:48:42,478
Did they go to Haenam?

1306
00:48:43,078 --> 00:48:44,877
It's either Haenam or Jangheung.

1307
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:46,808
Gosh. After eating,

1308
00:48:47,277 --> 00:48:50,176
- we should use that.
- The GPS card? Okay.

1309
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,917
- We don't need to spare it.
- Right.

1310
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:54,656
(Sure. Let me eat first.)

1311
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:55,756
That's the only explanation.

1312
00:48:55,757 --> 00:48:56,987
I told you. They did it.

1313
00:48:57,127 --> 00:48:58,227
Jangheung.

1314
00:48:58,228 --> 00:48:59,787
I knew it. They went to Jangheung.

1315
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:01,397
We should go to Yeongam-gun, then.

1316
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,797
Should we go to Yeongam-gun or go south?

1317
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:05,227
To Haenam?

1318
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:06,368
Give it to me.

1319
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:07,867
Let me see.

1320
00:49:07,868 --> 00:49:10,906
If we go to Yeongam-gun, they can't catch us up.

1321
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,467
- They have to go through Gangjin.
- Right.

1322
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:14,138
It's reasonable to go to Yeongam-gun.

1323
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:17,007
It will be the fastest to go to Yeongam-gun.

1324
00:49:17,177 --> 00:49:19,478
Because we don't have the reattempt card,

1325
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,277
we should go for the closer spots quickly.

1326
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,648
Here's to the team in Jangheung.

1327
00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:26,187
Congratulations on occupying Jangheung.

1328
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:27,356
(To. Team Handsome)

1329
00:49:27,357 --> 00:49:28,716
Work hard tomorrow.

1330
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:30,427
(Work hard tomorrow.)

1331
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,126
(Team Handsome)

1332
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:35,527
It's crazy.

1333
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,228
I'm certain this place serves tasty dishes.

1334
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,026
- Gosh. I'm hungry.
- The smell.

1335
00:49:39,027 --> 00:49:41,066
- It's crazy.
- It smells awesome.

1336
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,767
It's crazy. I'm sure they'll serve good food.

1337
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:44,308
(Jangheung: Dongdongju)

1338
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:48,138
(Jangheung: Korean beef combo)

1339
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,677
Gosh. This is amazing.

1340
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:54,348
(From marbled Korean beef, in charge of taste, )

1341
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:57,418
(and flavorful shiitake mushrooms...)

1342
00:49:57,518 --> 00:49:59,086
- What are these?
- Pen shell.

1343
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:00,087
Shellfish.

1344
00:50:00,088 --> 00:50:01,156
(to chewy pen shell, in charge of texture, )

1345
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,687
(you can taste the sea, the mountain, and the field...)

1346
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:04,986
I approve of this.

1347
00:50:04,987 --> 00:50:06,157
(in one bite with this delicacy.)

1348
00:50:06,328 --> 00:50:07,958
- Goodness.
- Look at the kimchi.

1349
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:09,828
This area has the best kimchi in Korea.

1350
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,727
Jeolla Province's kimchi is to die for.

1351
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:13,737
Really?

1352
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:16,637
- I'm so hungry.
- I'm drooling.

1353
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,006
(He couldn't help but take a bite of mustard greens kimchi.)

1354
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,168
- I'll try it.
- Gosh.

1355
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:21,807
(Sang Uk tries the aged kimchi first.)

1356
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:23,207
The seasoned cucumbers are crazy.

1357
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:24,777
(Sang Uk tries the aged kimchi first.)

1358
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:26,478
I think they put perilla oil.

1359
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:28,547
Goodness. This kimchi.

1360
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:31,317
- Gosh. It's tasty.
- It's strong.

1361
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:33,887
- It's awesome. Goodness.
- The seasoned cucumbers.

1362
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,316
(Sung Hoon starts lightly with the seasoned cucumbers.)

1363
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:36,887
The seasoned cucumbers are amazing.

1364
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:37,888
(Satisfied)

1365
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:39,688
This kimchi is really good.

1366
00:50:40,398 --> 00:50:41,728
I love these dishes.

1367
00:50:42,058 --> 00:50:43,498
You'll drink this one, right?

1368
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:46,067
- No. It's all right.
- Is it okay?

1369
00:50:46,328 --> 00:50:47,497
Okay.

1370
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:50,197
(They savor the taste again.)

1371
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:53,107
- It's good.
- It's okay to lose now.

1372
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:54,607
I'm happy.

1373
00:50:54,777 --> 00:50:55,777
I'm so happy.

1374
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,347
We'll stay here for one more day.

1375
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,577
That means we can have more good food.

1376
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,747
Of the nine spots on the board, this place has...

1377
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,518
- the most expensive food.
- Exactly.

1378
00:51:02,748 --> 00:51:03,847
- I know.
- Goodness.

1379
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:05,148
- Nice.
- It's crazy.

1380
00:51:05,947 --> 00:51:08,018
It's so pretty. This is awesome.

1381
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:11,086
- It's crazy.
- Okay. Let's hurry and eat.

1382
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:13,388
It's okay to lose now. We're having the most expensive food.

1383
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:14,697
I'm glad we came here.

1384
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:16,357
- I agree.
- We can just...

1385
00:51:16,627 --> 00:51:17,926
(They put the Korean beef on in strange nervousness.)

1386
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:19,898
- Okay. That's perfect.
- Good.

1387
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:22,938
- Gosh.
- That has to be tasty.

1388
00:51:23,168 --> 00:51:24,407
That must be tasty.

1389
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:26,667
- Should we place 3 pieces?
- Yes. Just 3 pieces.

1390
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,078
Otherwise, he'll eat them all.

1391
00:51:28,337 --> 00:51:30,337
- Come on.
- Just put three pieces on it.

1392
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:33,606
Don't you eat when it's cooked this much?

1393
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,677
- You should eat now.
- Now?

1394
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:37,748
Aren't you going to make the combo?

1395
00:51:37,817 --> 00:51:39,687
- Thank you for the food.
- I can't eat, then.

1396
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:40,817
Are you kidding?

1397
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,986
Hey. You should eat it now.

1398
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:46,457
I can't. It has to be cooked more.

1399
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,558
Don't touch mine.

1400
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:49,626
- It's good.
- How about this?

1401
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:50,867
- Gosh.
- This one?

1402
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:51,967
It has to be well-done.

1403
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,768
It has some fatty parts.

1404
00:51:54,138 --> 00:51:55,597
And it tastes light too.

1405
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:56,737
(He's satisfied with the fatty yet light flavor.)

1406
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,607
You have to have it now.

1407
00:51:58,638 --> 00:51:59,807
It's good.

1408
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:02,078
(Dong Hyun fails to resist and eats a strip of Korean beef.)

1409
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:08,277
(Electrifying)

1410
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:10,317
Gosh. It does taste good.

1411
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:12,486
Why are you not eating?

1412
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,687
- I want to make a wrap.
- I see.

1413
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:15,787
As a three-ingredient combo.

1414
00:52:15,788 --> 00:52:17,458
(The youngest is determined when it coming to eating.)

1415
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:19,426
- I'll just try it.
- It's a combo.

1416
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,228
(With a lettuce as a plate, he puts a piece of meat.)

1417
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:24,868
(Then he adds a well-cooked piece of shiitake mushroom...)

1418
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,037
- This is the combo.
- The combo.

1419
00:52:28,038 --> 00:52:29,268
(and scallop dipped in the oil sauce.)

1420
00:52:30,368 --> 00:52:35,177
(Then it goes straight into his mouth!)

1421
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,407
Gosh. The combo is crazy.

1422
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:41,018
Who came up with it?

1423
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:43,847
It's so good.

1424
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:44,848
(Dong Hyun tries the combo this time.)

1425
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:48,157
It's amazing.

1426
00:52:49,188 --> 00:52:50,787
(Sung Hoon is next to try the combo.)

1427
00:52:50,788 --> 00:52:51,958
Gosh. It's so good.

1428
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:55,757
- Nice.
- When will we ever come here again?

1429
00:52:56,027 --> 00:53:00,027
The pin shell has the flavor of the sea and umami...

1430
00:53:00,498 --> 00:53:02,667
- and shiitake mushrooms' scent...
- Shiitake mushroom's aroma.

1431
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,707
Mixed with the juicy protein is... Goodness.

1432
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:05,938
Who came up with the combo?

1433
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:10,607
The harmony of the three ingredients is mind-blowing.

1434
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,348
(Savoring)

1435
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:19,546
(Devouring the Korean beef combo frantically)

1436
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:20,617
Good.

1437
00:53:20,618 --> 00:53:21,657
(Devouring the Korean beef combo frantically)

1438
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:25,688
(Now that they shared enough of the food...)

1439
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:27,856
- It's good.
- It's seriously good.

1440
00:53:27,857 --> 00:53:29,127
- You can have this.
- Okay.

1441
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:30,296
We have to eat it quickly.

1442
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:32,228
(His carnivore mode is on.)

1443
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:33,526
(Staring with a strip of meat)

1444
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:34,868
It's okay to lose now.

1445
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:36,368
I'm so happy.

1446
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:41,138
(He takes two pieces of meat without a problem.)

1447
00:53:42,407 --> 00:53:44,077
Can we eat it now?

1448
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:45,078
(He takes another piece with the side dishes.)

1449
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:49,047
(He eats the meat nonstop.)

1450
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:50,417
We should put more meat on it.

1451
00:53:50,418 --> 00:53:51,946
(When Dong Hyun cuts the meat, )

1452
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:53,716
(Sang Uk places more.)

1453
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:54,986
The meat is cooked.

1454
00:53:54,987 --> 00:53:58,058
(The flow of the meat flows in a relaxed manner.)

1455
00:53:58,257 --> 00:53:59,487
They disappear quickly.

1456
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:02,356
I'm eating them undercooked because of Sung Hoon.

1457
00:54:02,357 --> 00:54:04,627
(The meal with the athletes is getting tense.)

1458
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,668
I didn't eat as much as you think.

1459
00:54:07,297 --> 00:54:09,397
- How much meat is this? 500g.
- It's 500g.

1460
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:10,668
Then we need two more.

1461
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:12,337
- You want 1kg?
- Yes.

1462
00:54:13,237 --> 00:54:14,708
Aren't you going to move to the next spot?

1463
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:16,376
I think we'll finish it in no time.

1464
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:17,676
It took 10 minutes to eat 500g.

1465
00:54:17,677 --> 00:54:19,177
- Then it'll take 30 minutes.
- I see.

1466
00:54:19,947 --> 00:54:21,918
- We've come here to eat.
- Right.

1467
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:23,946
- Thank you.
- Goodness. It's so good.

1468
00:54:23,947 --> 00:54:25,648
The sauce is really good too.

1469
00:54:26,188 --> 00:54:27,387
Look at the amazing thin skirt.

1470
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:28,888
(Looking tasty)

1471
00:54:29,257 --> 00:54:32,527
(Busy hands)

1472
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:33,787
They are so small.

1473
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:35,597
Hey. You cut them so small.

1474
00:54:35,598 --> 00:54:36,958
I was being smart about it.

1475
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:38,197
- Hold on.
- What?

1476
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:40,598
Let's eat together.

1477
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:44,038
Gosh. Look at this.

1478
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:50,808
(The proper combo with juicy Korean beef)

1479
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:54,618
It goes well with makgeolli.

1480
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:58,888
(When you clean your palate with makgeolli...)

1481
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:00,618
It's okay to lose now.

1482
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,717
Seriously. We can lose if we had food like this.

1483
00:55:02,788 --> 00:55:04,026
- Let's go to a spot we want to go.
- No.

1484
00:55:04,027 --> 00:55:05,027
It's not that it's okay to lose.

1485
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:06,087
We already lost.

1486
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:09,597
(For food-lovers, eating is as important as going home.)

1487
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,167
Gosh. With this food, I'm so happy.

1488
00:55:11,168 --> 00:55:12,268
(For food-lovers, eating is as important as going home.)

1489
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:14,998
We're having 1.5kg of meat.

1490
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:18,208
I think it's more than 1.5kg.

1491
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:19,837
We had about ten servings.

1492
00:55:20,168 --> 00:55:22,637
- Ten servings of Korean beef.
- Okay.

1493
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:23,907
Eight servings of pen shell.

1494
00:55:24,748 --> 00:55:26,507
And a lot of shiitake mushrooms.

1495
00:55:27,277 --> 00:55:28,847
I see. Really?

1496
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:30,447
(Not surprised)

1497
00:55:30,688 --> 00:55:32,288
I need to have jjigae and rice.

1498
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:34,188
It'll be great if we have soup now.

1499
00:55:34,518 --> 00:55:36,216
You'll regret it if you don't eat our tteokguk.

1500
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:37,317
We'll have it, then.

1501
00:55:37,857 --> 00:55:39,857
Gosh. It's crazy. What is this?

1502
00:55:40,228 --> 00:55:41,957
It's maesangi tteokguk.

1503
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,796
- It's awesome.
- You have to taste it.

1504
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:45,368
(They're having a mega meal with a great course.)

1505
00:55:45,797 --> 00:55:48,097
(The tteokguk looks amazing.)

1506
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:49,337
It's awesome.

1507
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:51,506
It'll taste awesome when we drink it.

1508
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:52,938
We're doing good for our body.

1509
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:57,077
(They taste maesangi tteokguk carefully, )

1510
00:55:57,078 --> 00:55:59,407
(so they won't scald themselves.)

1511
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:03,018
- It's good.
- Tteokguk tastes good.

1512
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,227
(When they cleared 18 servings of the beef combo and tteokguk...)

1513
00:56:11,228 --> 00:56:12,487
I ate too much.

1514
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:15,127
If you ate this much, will you be able to eat again?

1515
00:56:15,728 --> 00:56:17,926
(Right. The next spot is...)

1516
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:20,126
Should we go to Jindo or...

1517
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,337
Leader, you should decide it.

1518
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,467
What do you want to eat?

1519
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:27,367
- What do you want to have?
- Sung Hoon.

1520
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:28,506
What do you want to eat?

1521
00:56:28,507 --> 00:56:29,978
That's not a menu.

1522
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:32,106
- What do you want?
- Honestly,

1523
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:33,747
I like the skate combo.

1524
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:34,816
The skate combo sounds good.

1525
00:56:34,817 --> 00:56:36,648
- I'd like Uncle-kase too.
- Right?

1526
00:56:36,918 --> 00:56:38,486
I'd like a cockle set menu too.

1527
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:40,856
Exactly. The bingo doesn't matter.

1528
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:41,986
- Tell me what you want to have.
- I'd like this more...

1529
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:43,117
than the wild vegetables set menu.

1530
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:44,626
The cockle set menu sounds good too,

1531
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:46,058
but I'm curious about Uncle-kase.

1532
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:47,626
Should we go there, then?

1533
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:49,126
- Uncle-kase. That's the vibe.
- Okay.

1534
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:50,196
Let's go for the food.

1535
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:53,026
The other team might be heading to Yeongam-gun.

1536
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:55,867
That's possible. But we can't do anything about it.

1537
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:57,708
We have to have Uncle-kase.

1538
00:56:58,808 --> 00:57:00,638
Naju has the skate combo.

1539
00:57:01,177 --> 00:57:02,938
- The skate combo?
- The skate combo is good too.

1540
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:05,046
You have to try the skate combo...

1541
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,077
- from Naju, Jeolla Province.
- Really?

1542
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:08,877
- I agree.
- It's really good.

1543
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:10,987
- Should we go to Naju, then?
- Should we?

1544
00:57:12,788 --> 00:57:15,457
(Team Guys)

1545
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,118
Guys.

1546
00:57:18,627 --> 00:57:21,797
- I think I sorted it out.
- What is it?

1547
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:23,458
What?

1548
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:25,697
If we go to Yeongam-gun right now,

1549
00:57:26,197 --> 00:57:28,066
we'll win after occupying Jindo.

1550
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:29,067
Yes.

1551
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:31,208
But if the other team went to Jindo,

1552
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,106
we can go up to Naju from Yeongam-gun right away.

1553
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:36,537
It's because we are ahead of them in time.

1554
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,978
I know. But we might get the quiz wrong.

1555
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:41,618
We might fail the mission.

1556
00:57:42,677 --> 00:57:44,287
The questions aren't easy.

1557
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:46,518
They are difficult. We have to guess them well.

1558
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,888
If we get the question right in Yeongam-gun,

1559
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,986
we have an 80 percent chance of winning.

1560
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:54,728
If we get the question wrong in Yeongam-gun,

1561
00:57:55,657 --> 00:57:57,696
we have to keep going to other spots like Naju.

1562
00:57:57,697 --> 00:57:58,828
(Then it'll be unfortunate.)

1563
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:01,197
That's... Now, we...

1564
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:04,037
The karaoke... Gosh. I'm so sleepy.

1565
00:58:04,038 --> 00:58:05,707
(And we didn't have the nap time.)

1566
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,336
You can take a nap now.

1567
00:58:07,337 --> 00:58:08,977
Aren't you sleepy?

1568
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:10,477
- I am.
- I am.

1569
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:12,606
- I have a crazy food comma.
- Look.

1570
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,376
(And Team Guys fell asleep.)

1571
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:17,788
(Or so it seemed.)

1572
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:23,217
(Crazy Gamer cannot sleep.)

1573
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:25,187
(Yeongam-gun, Haenam, Naju, )

1574
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:27,288
(Suncheon, Jindo, or karaoke?)

1575
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:32,026
(Handsome Heritage 3)

1576
00:58:32,027 --> 00:58:34,268
(A bar in town that has something beyond sentimentality.)

1577
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:40,506
(Team Guys has arrived in Yeongam-gun.)

1578
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:43,006
Gosh. It's right over here.

1579
00:58:43,007 --> 00:58:46,877
(What they face after getting off the van...)

1580
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:49,147
(is a signage that smells like liquor.)

1581
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:51,018
It's a tavern. We're going there again.

1582
00:58:52,418 --> 00:58:53,486
It's right next to it.

1583
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:57,627
(And a mysterious man is in there.)

1584
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:00,058
- Let's go.
- Hello.

1585
00:59:00,757 --> 00:59:01,796
This is it.

1586
00:59:01,797 --> 00:59:02,797
Hello.

1587
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:06,267
- Hello. Yes.
- Hello.

1588
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:07,297
Please take a seat.

1589
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:13,208
- What is...
- What is this place?

1590
00:59:13,768 --> 00:59:16,438
This is a brewery where we make a small amount...

1591
00:59:16,777 --> 00:59:19,847
of liquor in a traditional way.

1592
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,418
Is this a brewery, then?

1593
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:25,986
When we think of a traditional brewery,

1594
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:28,618
we think of a tile-roofed house.

1595
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:33,058
(A small town on the foot of Mount Wolchul, )

1596
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:38,626
(there's a tiny and cozy place.)

1597
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:40,767
(Relaxing time with Korean liquor)

1598
00:59:40,768 --> 00:59:42,767
(The owner's passion for traditional liquor...)

1599
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:44,767
(can be found everywhere.)

1600
00:59:44,768 --> 00:59:46,606
(Make traditional liquor yourself.)

1601
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:47,808
Sir,

1602
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,578
you like to have fun.

1603
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:54,176
You go horseback riding.

1604
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:56,347
- You took those photos in Jeju.
- Yes.

1605
00:59:56,348 --> 01:00:00,047
You do mountain climbing and driving too.

1606
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:02,756
- It's off-roading.
- Off-roading.

1607
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:04,857
(His past is filled with romance.)

1608
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:08,696
What made you start making traditional liquor?

1609
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:11,126
I went to Cheongdo by chance.

1610
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:12,467
- In Gyeongsang Province?
- Yes.

1611
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:14,668
I liked the taste of the liquor I tried at first.

1612
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:16,998
Since then, I've been interested in traditional liquor.

1613
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,237
I'm doing this to distribute and teach about it widely.

1614
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:23,836
Can you show us how to make it?

1615
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:26,748
Yes. We follow this order to make it.

1616
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:29,216
First,

1617
01:00:29,217 --> 01:00:31,086
we have to wash the rice for a long time.

1618
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:32,387
- For a long time.
- Yes.

1619
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:34,247
- It takes one hour to wash it.
- Gosh.

1620
01:00:34,248 --> 01:00:35,557
For the next step,

1621
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:37,958
we soak the rice in water for ten hours.

1622
01:00:38,228 --> 01:00:39,288
Goodness.

1623
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:42,756
And, it takes an hour and a half to cook hard rice.

1624
01:00:42,757 --> 01:00:44,627
Why do we have to cool down the hard rice?

1625
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:46,296
It's because the more we cool it down,

1626
01:00:46,297 --> 01:00:47,368
the better liquor it becomes.

1627
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:49,768
- That cooler.
- That's how fermentation works.

1628
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:51,966
We mix it with malt and put it in a container.

1629
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:53,937
The 1st fermentation takes 2 to 3 days.

1630
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:56,607
Then we ferment it again until it becomes liquor.

1631
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:59,506
Then, we age it in the storage for at least four months.

1632
01:00:59,507 --> 01:01:00,946
(The traditional liquor comes out to the world after a long aging.)

1633
01:01:00,947 --> 01:01:02,317
For me, I age it for 150 days.

1634
01:01:02,978 --> 01:01:05,117
They should be called masters for a reason.

1635
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:07,287
- This is crazy.
- Why do we cool down the rice?

1636
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,656
The liquor you'll taste...

1637
01:01:09,657 --> 01:01:12,857
is right here. If we look at it...

1638
01:01:13,288 --> 01:01:15,828
I made it on May 23.

1639
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:17,227
May 23? Gosh.

1640
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,197
Yes. June, July, August, September, October, and November.

1641
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:21,637
It's been six months.

1642
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:23,196
- Yes.
- We're tasting it after six months?

1643
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:25,566
Luckily, you're tasting the last liquor of the year.

1644
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:26,638
The last liquor of the year.

1645
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:30,237
- Can one of you help me?
- Yes.

1646
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:33,946
While you're at it, you should inherit the business.

1647
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:35,177
(While you're at it, carry it on.)

1648
01:01:37,788 --> 01:01:40,047
- Tae Hyun, it's purple.
- This is...

1649
01:01:40,188 --> 01:01:41,216
What?

1650
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:43,058
(Is it purple?)

1651
01:01:46,857 --> 01:01:49,426
(What is this mysterious purple liquor?)

1652
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:50,558
What is this?

1653
01:01:53,697 --> 01:01:56,067
How can it be purple?

1654
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,168
My clients are young people.

1655
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:00,736
So, I add the color to it on purpose.

1656
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:02,377
- You added something.
- The color is...

1657
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:05,906
from the purple sweet potatoes from Yeongam-gun.

1658
01:02:05,907 --> 01:02:07,277
The purple sweet potatoes.

1659
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,876
Those little pieces are sweet potatoes.

1660
01:02:09,877 --> 01:02:11,188
- Yes.
- These pieces.

1661
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:13,648
This is crazy.

1662
01:02:15,788 --> 01:02:18,288
After washing it for hours and all,

1663
01:02:19,127 --> 01:02:21,728
you get the muscles. It's called MDFAW.

1664
01:02:22,228 --> 01:02:24,057
The muscles developed from actual work.

1665
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:25,067
MDFAW.

1666
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,796
- Gosh. This is...
- Where else can we see this?

1667
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:29,768
This requires hard work.

1668
01:02:30,598 --> 01:02:32,907
I don't know how it will taste.

1669
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:35,977
- It should be very different.
- Yes.

1670
01:02:35,978 --> 01:02:39,208
Do you taste it and say, "Darn it. I can't sell this."

1671
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:40,546
Do you throw it away, then?

1672
01:02:40,547 --> 01:02:42,518
- Break the jar and say, "Dispose!" - Of course.

1673
01:02:44,947 --> 01:02:46,687
- I'll taste it first.
- Okay.

1674
01:02:46,688 --> 01:02:48,117
You'll taste it first,

1675
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:50,957
and then, you'll give it to us if it's all right, right?

1676
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:51,986
You can't have it if it's not tasty.

1677
01:02:51,987 --> 01:02:53,058
That's true.

1678
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:55,127
Gosh. This is interesting.

1679
01:02:57,197 --> 01:02:58,566
Sir, you have to be honest.

1680
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,667
You can't lie and say it's good because you're on TV.

1681
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:03,537
The ABV is about 18 percent.

1682
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:04,638
- I see.
- Goodness.

1683
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:06,368
It has a great acidity to it.

1684
01:03:06,737 --> 01:03:07,768
That means it's good.

1685
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:13,208
(Tasting the takju)

1686
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:14,577
- Goodness.
- What is it?

1687
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:18,618
Why do they always pair it with food in Jeolla Province?

1688
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:20,847
- That's radish.
- That's radish.

1689
01:03:20,848 --> 01:03:22,256
Is this pyeonyuk, the boiled meat slices?

1690
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,188
These are radish greens.

1691
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,788
That pyeonyuk...

1692
01:03:27,427 --> 01:03:29,296
is made of the skins.

1693
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:30,727
- It's pyeonyuk made of pork skins.
- Right.

1694
01:03:30,728 --> 01:03:32,197
That's dongchimi.

1695
01:03:33,127 --> 01:03:34,498
Wait. The Uncle-kase.

1696
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:36,938
- Are you Uncle of Uncle-kase?
- Yes.

1697
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:40,667
(Bright)

1698
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:42,376
- Uncle-kase. Cheers.
- I knew it.

1699
01:03:42,377 --> 01:03:45,478
It's so obvious that he's Uncle.

1700
01:03:45,777 --> 01:03:48,716
- Look how he gave us side dishes.
- It's because of these.

1701
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:49,848
Thank you for the drink.

1702
01:04:03,728 --> 01:04:05,027
This must be popular.

1703
01:04:05,898 --> 01:04:09,498
It hits the top of the uvula.

1704
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:12,967
And it's followed by the scent and refreshness.

1705
01:04:13,237 --> 01:04:14,638
Gosh. This is...

1706
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:16,736
This is really interesting.

1707
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:18,376
(The takju is as mysterious as its color.)

1708
01:04:18,377 --> 01:04:19,978
I could see why it's Uncle-kase.

1709
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:22,376
Thank you.

1710
01:04:22,377 --> 01:04:24,986
(They also have snacks that go well with the drink!)

1711
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,648
I love the smell of the dongchimi.

1712
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,986
It's perfectly aged to make dongchimi noodles.

1713
01:04:29,987 --> 01:04:31,987
(Crunchy)

1714
01:04:33,058 --> 01:04:36,856
It tastes just like the dongchimi my mother makes.

1715
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:38,427
Your mother must be a master too.

1716
01:04:38,868 --> 01:04:41,126
My mother is from Goheung.

1717
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,466
(Seung Ho's mother is from Goheung, South Jeolla Province.)

1718
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,337
- She's from Goheung.
- I see.

1719
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:49,176
- It can taste similar, then.
- Yes.

1720
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,137
They must make it in a similar way.

1721
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,578
(Its harmony with the snack doubles the refreshness.)

1722
01:04:58,418 --> 01:04:59,546
(Uncle is the best.)

1723
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:00,618
It's good.

1724
01:05:01,518 --> 01:05:03,587
After that, try yakju.

1725
01:05:04,058 --> 01:05:05,457
Now, the real yakju will be served.

1726
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,458
(It's yakju-tasting time.)

1727
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,058
It's yakju.

1728
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:10,256
It's widely known as cheongju.

1729
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:11,668
It's called yakju.

1730
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:14,066
Did you pour four glasses so that you can taste it again?

1731
01:05:14,067 --> 01:05:15,097
When this...

1732
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:16,668
(No way.)

1733
01:05:16,898 --> 01:05:18,607
When this sinks...

1734
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:20,768
When it sinks,

1735
01:05:23,107 --> 01:05:25,046
- There's the upper part.
- Yes.

1736
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,446
- The upper part.
- In makgeolli,

1737
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,647
there's sediment at the bottom and clear wine on top.

1738
01:05:28,648 --> 01:05:30,276
- Yes.
- Is this that clear wine?

1739
01:05:30,277 --> 01:05:32,317
- That's right.
- I see.

1740
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:38,127
Is this how it tastes?

1741
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:45,026
- Tae Hyun, it's like...
- It's sweet.

1742
01:05:45,027 --> 01:05:47,296
Have you tried Port wine?

1743
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:49,167
- Yes.
- It tastes like Port wine.

1744
01:05:49,168 --> 01:05:52,067
Yes. Port wine has stronger scent and taste.

1745
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:54,336
What are we drinking this time?

1746
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:55,676
It's freshly distilled soju.

1747
01:05:55,677 --> 01:05:56,876
- This is called soju.
- Is that soju?

1748
01:05:56,877 --> 01:05:57,937
You shouldn't have a lot.

1749
01:05:57,938 --> 01:05:58,946
(Soju tasting)

1750
01:05:58,947 --> 01:05:59,947
Take a small sip.

1751
01:06:04,578 --> 01:06:07,617
These different drinks come from the same liquor.

1752
01:06:07,618 --> 01:06:08,817
That's so interesting.

1753
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:11,688
- It smells different already.
- Do you want to guess the ABV?

1754
01:06:11,888 --> 01:06:13,586
I can already tell it's strong by its smell.

1755
01:06:13,587 --> 01:06:14,796
It smells so nice.

1756
01:06:14,797 --> 01:06:16,227
- Gosh.
- If you keep sniffing it,

1757
01:06:16,228 --> 01:06:17,626
- you'll get a headache.
- Right.

1758
01:06:17,627 --> 01:06:19,197
I thought it'd be like the previous drinks.

1759
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:20,467
- Did you swallow it at once?
- Yes.

1760
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:23,667
Its ABV is about 65 percent.

1761
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:25,438
(Soju's ABV is about 65 percent.)

1762
01:06:28,308 --> 01:06:31,578
- Goodness.
- This is so much fun.

1763
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:34,406
It's because Uncle is so...

1764
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,477
(Is it thanks to the uncle?)

1765
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:36,617
He's so entertaining.

1766
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,777
The next liquor...

1767
01:06:38,288 --> 01:06:39,388
Is there another one?

1768
01:06:39,618 --> 01:06:41,046
It's a welcome drink.

1769
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:42,517
- A welcome drink?
- Originally...

1770
01:06:42,518 --> 01:06:44,687
You gave us four glasses.

1771
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,787
Is it normal to have the fourth welcome drink?

1772
01:06:46,888 --> 01:06:49,157
Seriously. Isn't it a goodbye drink?

1773
01:06:49,158 --> 01:06:51,697
- You know...
- I thought we only got one.

1774
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:53,496
Is it a welcome to the netherworld?

1775
01:06:53,497 --> 01:06:55,567
(Is it a welcome to the netherworld?)

1776
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:56,967
You had soju, so...

1777
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,608
It's the fourth welcome drink.

1778
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:02,537
He has so many glasses.

1779
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:06,047
(What? Why is one upside down?)

1780
01:07:08,247 --> 01:07:10,018
Why is one upside down?

1781
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:11,647
He's drunk.

1782
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:14,757
(I was nervous.)

1783
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:18,457
- I thought it was intentional.
- Same here.

1784
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:21,327
He's so lovely.

1785
01:07:21,757 --> 01:07:24,496
- He's so cute when he smiles.
- I know.

1786
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:27,768
- When he smiles...
- Yeongam-gun is famous for figs.

1787
01:07:28,138 --> 01:07:29,297
- Seriously.
- This is...

1788
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:31,268
a syrup that has been made with figs.

1789
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,667
- Is that what you add?
- A syrup?

1790
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:36,007
Stop putting the leftover in here.

1791
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:42,076
It's a proper cocktail.

1792
01:07:42,077 --> 01:07:43,277
(Sparkling water gives the fig highball a fresh twist.)

1793
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:44,747
He's adding sparkling water.

1794
01:07:45,087 --> 01:07:46,947
- Sir, let's drink together.
- I'll drink soju.

1795
01:07:46,948 --> 01:07:49,687
(With the belated welcome drinks)

1796
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:50,757
It's 65-percent alcohol.

1797
01:07:53,957 --> 01:07:56,658
You're good at bringing out the aromas.

1798
01:07:57,827 --> 01:07:59,167
It isn't my doing.

1799
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:01,326
It isn't what the yeast does.

1800
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,397
(He gives the honor to the yeast.)

1801
01:08:02,398 --> 01:08:04,137
It isn't my doing.

1802
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:06,067
I don't make the liquors.

1803
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:07,867
I'm simply an assistant.

1804
01:08:08,507 --> 01:08:11,477
I just need to take good care of the liquor jars.

1805
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:13,848
(The assistant takes good care of the liquor jars.)

1806
01:08:14,148 --> 01:08:15,877
- Thank you for the taste.
- Thank you.

1807
01:08:16,377 --> 01:08:17,677
- We enjoyed the drinks.
- Thank you.

1808
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:19,116
Thank you.

1809
01:08:19,117 --> 01:08:20,216
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1810
01:08:20,217 --> 01:08:22,887
(Yeongam: Liquor)

1811
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:23,888
(Time for Quiz)

1812
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:27,188
You've listened to the explanation on the liquor of Yeongam.

1813
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:28,858
Here comes the quiz.

1814
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:32,926
"Jajak" means pouring yourself...

1815
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:34,167
a drink.

1816
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:36,068
"Jak" means...

1817
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:39,268
"To pour liquor."

1818
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:42,337
Among the words we use often,

1819
01:08:42,677 --> 01:08:45,047
many contain "Jak."

1820
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,746
This word comes from the image of pouring the liquor adequately...

1821
01:08:48,747 --> 01:08:50,747
so that there isn't too much or too little.

1822
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:54,746
What's the word that means,

1823
01:08:54,747 --> 01:08:57,518
"Considering the situation or background?"

1824
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:00,388
I think "Jak" will be the last syllable.

1825
01:09:00,488 --> 01:09:01,997
"Jak" will be the last syllable.

1826
01:09:02,257 --> 01:09:04,456
After "Jajak..."

1827
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:07,198
It means pouring yourself a drink.

1828
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:09,737
(There isn't an answer that comes to mind.)

1829
01:09:09,738 --> 01:09:11,366
Background.

1830
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,207
The situation or background.

1831
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:18,448
(Seung Ho had the winning strategy.)

1832
01:09:18,778 --> 01:09:22,877
(Yeongam was the key part of that strategy.)

1833
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:25,116
The situation or background.

1834
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,187
(They must get it right.)

1835
01:09:26,188 --> 01:09:27,217
The situation or background.

1836
01:09:27,348 --> 01:09:28,456
"Considering the situation or background."

1837
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,417
(He racks his brain!)

1838
01:09:34,358 --> 01:09:36,956
It means pouring yourself a drink.

1839
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:39,897
It must end with "Jak" since it's about pouring the liquor adequately.

1840
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,228
Here's what I think.

1841
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:49,278
- Hey.
- Right?

1842
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,576
- Hey.
- No.

1843
01:09:51,577 --> 01:09:53,746
- First place.
- We'll take first place.

1844
01:09:53,747 --> 01:09:55,046
- You're good.
- I'm smart.

1845
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:56,546
- You're good.
- You're incredible.

1846
01:09:56,547 --> 01:09:58,417
(Are they certain that it's the correct answer?)

1847
01:09:58,818 --> 01:09:59,848
(They celebrate the youngest member's success.)

1848
01:09:59,948 --> 01:10:00,988
Seung Ho did it.

1849
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:03,388
- Seung Ho still has it.
- Seriously.

1850
01:10:03,818 --> 01:10:05,028
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

1851
01:10:05,188 --> 01:10:06,358
As soon as I heard it...

1852
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:08,797
But let's stay calm.

1853
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:11,198
- It has to be correct.
- Okay. Let's answer then.

1854
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,996
- Say it with confidence.
- Say it loudly.

1855
01:10:12,997 --> 01:10:14,496
It has to be correct. It's a two-syllable word.

1856
01:10:14,497 --> 01:10:15,537
That's right.

1857
01:10:18,867 --> 01:10:20,037
Chamjak.

1858
01:10:20,268 --> 01:10:22,477
- Chamjak.
- Like extenuation.

1859
01:10:22,478 --> 01:10:23,507
- Chamjak.
- Yes.

1860
01:10:23,978 --> 01:10:25,947
You're incredible.

1861
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:27,206
You saved us.

1862
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,216
(Chamjak)

1863
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:30,278
Chamjak.

1864
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:33,247
Incorrect.

1865
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:35,787
Is it incorrect?

1866
01:10:35,957 --> 01:10:38,087
I said that we should think about it some more.

1867
01:10:38,388 --> 01:10:40,427
I should've insisted.

1868
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,397
I should've written more words.

1869
01:10:42,398 --> 01:10:44,558
I was writing, "Jeongjak, jangjak, ojak..."

1870
01:10:44,898 --> 01:10:46,926
- We're in trouble.
- Unfortunately, you failed.

1871
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:49,437
Please select the next location.

1872
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:51,137
Hold on. Now...

1873
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:53,068
- Then...
- It has to be 1 of these 2 options.

1874
01:10:53,408 --> 01:10:54,637
We can go to Naju and then Yeosu.

1875
01:10:54,638 --> 01:10:55,737
(Yeosu, Gangjin, Naju)

1876
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:57,707
We can go to Haenam and then Suncheon.

1877
01:10:58,377 --> 01:10:59,947
- Let's use the GPS.
- Shall we use it now?

1878
01:10:59,948 --> 01:11:01,576
We need to use it now to figure out where to go.

1879
01:11:01,577 --> 01:11:03,416
Then we'll use the identification card...

1880
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:04,988
and decide where to go.

1881
01:11:06,287 --> 01:11:07,448
Do we have it?

1882
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:09,657
Where are they? Yeongam.

1883
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:10,956
(Yeongam, Team Handsome)

1884
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:12,257
They're coming now.

1885
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,657
If I look at it like this...

1886
01:11:14,658 --> 01:11:16,456
- I'll turn on the map.
- Okay.

1887
01:11:16,457 --> 01:11:18,426
- All right. Let's turn on the map.
- Figure out where they are.

1888
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:22,797
(They're passing through this area.)

1889
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,408
They're 10 minutes from here. They're 8km away.

1890
01:11:26,537 --> 01:11:28,638
- Then they'll go to Naju.
- I'm sure they'll go to Naju.

1891
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:30,207
We need to go to Naju now then.

1892
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:31,807
- Hey.
- That's right.

1893
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:33,076
Can't we get there first?

1894
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:35,318
- That's right.
- We could get there first.

1895
01:11:35,478 --> 01:11:36,977
But here's what I think.

1896
01:11:36,978 --> 01:11:38,887
Then we can wait here.

1897
01:11:38,888 --> 01:11:40,717
If they don't come in here after ten minutes...

1898
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:42,517
If they go to Naju,

1899
01:11:42,518 --> 01:11:44,087
we can go to Jindo.

1900
01:11:44,757 --> 01:11:46,488
What are you talking about? Why should we wait for ten minutes?

1901
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:49,027
If they come to Yeongam,

1902
01:11:49,028 --> 01:11:50,427
we need to go to Haenam.

1903
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,627
- No.
- They aren't going to Yeongam.

1904
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:54,366
- It's Naju.
- It's Naju.

1905
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,768
Shall we go to Naju or Jindo?

1906
01:11:56,537 --> 01:11:58,036
We need to calm down.

1907
01:11:58,037 --> 01:11:59,107
- Do you want us to wait?
- Yes.

1908
01:11:59,108 --> 01:12:00,167
Shall we go to the karaoke then?

1909
01:12:00,768 --> 01:12:02,777
If we go to the karaoke, it'll be the same as surrendering.

1910
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,807
(That's the way of surrendering.)

1911
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:04,808
I don't care about anything else.

1912
01:12:04,809 --> 01:12:06,778
- I don't want to give them victory.
- Exactly.

1913
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:09,347
Exactly, Yi Kyung. Please trust me this once.

1914
01:12:09,348 --> 01:12:10,818
I'll take responsibility since I got it wrong.

1915
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:13,046
- This is hard. This is confusing.
- Yes.

1916
01:12:13,047 --> 01:12:14,086
(After thinking for a short while, )

1917
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:16,487
Even if they come to Yeongam, it can't be helped.

1918
01:12:16,488 --> 01:12:17,586
(they get in the car to leave.)

1919
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:18,658
All right.

1920
01:12:22,757 --> 01:12:23,956
This is bad.

1921
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:25,068
(I think they'll come.)

1922
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:27,966
(They set out to leave.)

1923
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:29,837
- Hold on. Yi Kyung.
- Yes?

1924
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:33,137
We'll know if we wait for 5 to 10 minutes.

1925
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:35,037
Let's wait then.

1926
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:37,376
- Okay.
- Let's wait for five minutes.

1927
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:39,376
- All right.
- Are you okay with that?

1928
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:40,507
It doesn't matter.

1929
01:12:41,348 --> 01:12:42,447
Where are you going?

1930
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:43,778
- All right.
- I'm serious about the game.

1931
01:12:44,518 --> 01:12:46,388
Look at that.

1932
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,787
All right. Sang Uk came. Sang Uk arrived.

1933
01:12:51,018 --> 01:12:52,027
(Seung Ho's imagination came true.)

1934
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:53,227
- Okay.
- They arrived.

1935
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:54,357
- Okay.
- Shall we open the door?

1936
01:12:54,358 --> 01:12:56,496
Hold on. I don't think they saw us.

1937
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,698
Let's go inside.

1938
01:12:57,997 --> 01:13:00,297
He's right. We saw them, so come back inside.

1939
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:01,967
Hold on. Where are they going?

1940
01:13:02,638 --> 01:13:05,568
See? This is why I wanted to see. They're going back.

1941
01:13:06,308 --> 01:13:07,568
They're racking their brains.

1942
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,978
Are they following us?

1943
01:13:10,337 --> 01:13:12,207
Why are they crossing the road?

1944
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:14,677
They're crossing the road.

1945
01:13:14,877 --> 01:13:17,116
They're going to a bakery.

1946
01:13:17,117 --> 01:13:18,278
Where's my phone?

1947
01:13:18,488 --> 01:13:20,747
- They entered another place.
- It's for a birthday party.

1948
01:13:21,988 --> 01:13:23,387
This is why I wanted to see. Hold on.

1949
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:25,256
It means that they're going to Yeongam. Hold on.

1950
01:13:25,257 --> 01:13:26,557
(Extremely excited)

1951
01:13:26,558 --> 01:13:29,127
- That's right.
- You're like Conan by yourself.

1952
01:13:29,728 --> 01:13:30,796
Seriously.

1953
01:13:30,797 --> 01:13:32,397
No one else is that excited.

1954
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,528
- Let's go to Haenam.
- Let's go to Haenam.

1955
01:13:35,138 --> 01:13:36,238
That was so funny.

1956
01:13:36,497 --> 01:13:39,807
There's a chance they didn't see us.

1957
01:13:39,808 --> 01:13:42,207
Then they might think that we're in Naju.

1958
01:13:42,507 --> 01:13:44,506
It's fortunate.

1959
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,176
We figured out...

1960
01:13:46,177 --> 01:13:48,376
that they came to Yeongam, not Naju.

1961
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:49,617
(Crazy Gamer is very proud.)

1962
01:13:50,978 --> 01:13:53,688
(Where do we go next?)

1963
01:13:53,747 --> 01:13:56,658
(5 minutes ago, Team Handsome)

1964
01:13:56,787 --> 01:13:58,257
We're in Yeongam, right?

1965
01:13:58,417 --> 01:13:59,688
We're in Yeongam.

1966
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,627
We're in Yeongam, but...

1967
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:03,627
They didn't come to Yeongam.

1968
01:14:03,827 --> 01:14:06,427
- No.
- They didn't come to Yeongam.

1969
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,697
They used their brains and went to Jindo.

1970
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:10,037
- That's right.
- I think they went to Jindo.

1971
01:14:11,297 --> 01:14:13,638
Perhaps I should get a haircut here.

1972
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,608
It's a barbershop.

1973
01:14:15,978 --> 01:14:17,507
Sa Rang's dad, you came all the way here.

1974
01:14:17,738 --> 01:14:18,877
- Yes.
- Seriously.

1975
01:14:18,978 --> 01:14:20,907
- Sir, when is your birthday?
- When is your birthday?

1976
01:14:20,908 --> 01:14:22,246
- When is your birthday?
- Your birthday.

1977
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:23,916
- My birthday?
- Your birthday.

1978
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,046
- Is your birthday this week?
- It isn't, is it?

1979
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:27,348
- It's August 19.
- I see.

1980
01:14:28,018 --> 01:14:29,317
Ma'am, when is your birthday?

1981
01:14:29,318 --> 01:14:30,557
- When is your birthday?
- This Saturday.

1982
01:14:30,558 --> 01:14:31,956
- What?
- This Saturday.

1983
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:33,687
- This Saturday?
- This Saturday?

1984
01:14:33,688 --> 01:14:35,397
- This Saturday?
- Really?

1985
01:14:35,398 --> 01:14:36,528
Hold on.

1986
01:14:37,028 --> 01:14:38,197
- We found her.
- No way.

1987
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:39,927
We found someone whose birthday is this Saturday.

1988
01:14:40,098 --> 01:14:41,727
- No way. Hold on.
- Ma'am.

1989
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,836
It isn't like that.

1990
01:14:42,837 --> 01:14:44,238
Is your birthday this week?

1991
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,407
- What's the date?
- What's the date?

1992
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:48,206
- It's November 30.
- That's right.

1993
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:49,336
- This week.
- This Saturday, November 30.

1994
01:14:49,337 --> 01:14:51,376
- This is incredible.
- Let's...

1995
01:14:51,377 --> 01:14:52,707
Let's go and get a cake.

1996
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:55,347
Please wait. This is incredible.

1997
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:56,417
Okay.

1998
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:58,177
This is unbelievable.

1999
01:14:58,988 --> 01:15:00,786
I think we're lucky.

2000
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:01,817
(The birthday person even said hello to them first.)

2001
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:02,818
I mean...

2002
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:04,616
It feels strange today.

2003
01:15:04,617 --> 01:15:05,858
- It's so...
- Seriously.

2004
01:15:06,757 --> 01:15:08,827
Do you sell cakes?

2005
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:11,426
- We can use this, right?
- Yes. It doesn't matter.

2006
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:14,598
- Right? We want to buy one.
- Okay.

2007
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:16,137
- Candles too.
- It'll take about ten minutes.

2008
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:18,037
Ten minutes? That's good.

2009
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,706
- Do you have candles?
- Candles.

2010
01:15:19,707 --> 01:15:20,836
- We have candles.
- They have candles.

2011
01:15:20,837 --> 01:15:22,107
- They have candles.
- They have everything.

2012
01:15:22,108 --> 01:15:24,438
I think we'll win this time.

2013
01:15:24,778 --> 01:15:25,978
I think we'll win.

2014
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:28,477
Since we're here, shall we drink coffee?

2015
01:15:28,478 --> 01:15:30,017
- Let's drink coffee.
- Let's drink coffee.

2016
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:32,688
Three cups of coffee. Yes.

2017
01:15:33,117 --> 01:15:34,948
- This is unbelievable.
- I can't believe it.

2018
01:15:35,188 --> 01:15:37,858
Eating tasty food is the best.

2019
01:15:38,888 --> 01:15:40,326
(Looking around)

2020
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,427
Shall we have a waffle as well?

2021
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:43,657
I'm craving it a bit too.

2022
01:15:43,658 --> 01:15:44,956
- Right? Something sweet.
- Yes.

2023
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,467
I'm craving something sweet a bit too.

2024
01:15:46,827 --> 01:15:48,497
Waffles in South Jeolla Province must be different.

2025
01:15:49,037 --> 01:15:50,137
Waffles are tasty here.

2026
01:15:50,138 --> 01:15:51,398
- Really?
- Really?

2027
01:15:51,738 --> 01:15:53,267
In that case...

2028
01:15:53,268 --> 01:15:54,408
Let's eat a waffle.

2029
01:15:54,537 --> 01:15:57,137
Why don't we turn that baguette into a cake?

2030
01:15:57,138 --> 01:15:59,278
Shall we have a baguette ball to go?

2031
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,177
- We'll eat that one.
- We'll eat it.

2032
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:04,348
We'll turn that baguette ball into a cake.

2033
01:16:04,778 --> 01:16:05,948
(Laughing)

2034
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:09,116
- All right. We have time.
- How nice.

2035
01:16:09,117 --> 01:16:10,586
- We have time.
- It's hot.

2036
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:11,786
(Hot)

2037
01:16:11,787 --> 01:16:13,926
This is incredible. Hold on.

2038
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:15,087
I'll eat it with hands.

2039
01:16:16,957 --> 01:16:18,228
(Happy)

2040
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:21,268
We'll win after eating and sleeping.

2041
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:25,308
It's so tasty.

2042
01:16:26,867 --> 01:16:28,507
It isn't too sweet.

2043
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:31,206
It's really tasty since it's freshly-made.

2044
01:16:31,207 --> 01:16:32,207
(Satisfied)

2045
01:16:32,648 --> 01:16:34,006
It's like cotton candy. It's so tasty.

2046
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,978
(South Jeolla Province's waffle melts in their mouths.)

2047
01:16:37,518 --> 01:16:40,147
(Happy)

2048
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:43,818
If the other team watches this, they'll be so annoyed.

2049
01:16:45,488 --> 01:16:47,528
You know, that's how it is.

2050
01:16:49,358 --> 01:16:51,397
They relax in the important situation.

2051
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,967
(He wets his throat with cool coffee.)

2052
01:16:53,768 --> 01:16:54,997
Coffee is tasty too.

2053
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,536
(Gulping)

2054
01:16:56,537 --> 01:16:57,937
- This is like...
- My goodness.

2055
01:16:57,938 --> 01:16:59,367
A travel show.

2056
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,138
Is this okay?

2057
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:03,676
This is our style.

2058
01:17:03,677 --> 01:17:05,647
This is the athletes' style.

2059
01:17:05,648 --> 01:17:07,278
The team is perfect.

2060
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:09,677
It's so cool that we found someone whose birthday is this week.

2061
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:10,978
I'm almost too scared to ask.

2062
01:17:11,177 --> 01:17:12,848
I feel like everyone's birthday will be this week.

2063
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,616
Everyone's birthday will be this week.

2064
01:17:15,617 --> 01:17:17,357
I bet there'll be someone like that among these four.

2065
01:17:17,358 --> 01:17:18,627
I don't even need to ask.

2066
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:20,256
The owner's birthday is the day after tomorrow.

2067
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:21,456
- See?
- What?

2068
01:17:21,457 --> 01:17:22,927
- No way!
- See?

2069
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:24,197
I knew it.

2070
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:25,727
- This is strange.
- The owner of the cafe?

2071
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:27,098
When's her birthday?

2072
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,427
- The day after tomorrow. The 27th.
- Is she upstairs?

2073
01:17:29,068 --> 01:17:30,397
I'm almost too scared to ask.

2074
01:17:30,398 --> 01:17:31,496
This is unbelievable.

2075
01:17:31,497 --> 01:17:34,068
- This is a good day.
- Yes.

2076
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:36,377
- You should compete on such days.
- Yes.

2077
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:37,876
Then you can win without doing anything.

2078
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:39,847
Even if you stretch your fist this way,

2079
01:17:39,848 --> 01:17:41,277
your opponent will stick his head.

2080
01:17:41,278 --> 01:17:43,677
- Will he do this?
- He'll get punched that way.

2081
01:17:44,348 --> 01:17:46,047
This is fun.

2082
01:17:46,818 --> 01:17:48,217
We're done with coffee.

2083
01:17:48,787 --> 01:17:49,988
- Thank you.
- It's perfect.

2084
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:51,956
- Thank you.
- All right.

2085
01:17:51,957 --> 01:17:53,257
One candle? Okay.

2086
01:17:53,287 --> 01:17:54,627
- The next customer...
- Thank you.

2087
01:17:54,988 --> 01:17:56,698
- Bye.
- Bye.

2088
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:57,926
How scary.

2089
01:17:57,927 --> 01:17:59,927
How are things going so well?

2090
01:18:00,398 --> 01:18:02,397
We met all the birthday girls.

2091
01:18:02,398 --> 01:18:04,268
- My goodness.
- Ma'am.

2092
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:05,867
- All right.
- All right.

2093
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:06,967
You can light up the candle.

2094
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,407
Let's go inside.

2095
01:18:08,408 --> 01:18:09,807
- Can we go inside?
- Can we go inside?

2096
01:18:09,808 --> 01:18:10,977
My goodness.

2097
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,506
- Please take a seat.
- Hello.

2098
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:13,778
- Please take a seat.
- Yes.

2099
01:18:13,808 --> 01:18:15,416
What's your name?

2100
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:16,847
- Lee Seong Sim.
- Lee...

2101
01:18:16,848 --> 01:18:17,876
Seong Sim.

2102
01:18:17,877 --> 01:18:19,246
- Lee Seong Sim.
- Lee Seong Sim.

2103
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:20,286
- Let's begin.
- Let's begin.

2104
01:18:20,287 --> 01:18:23,317
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2105
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:25,988
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2106
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:29,756
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Lee - Happy birthday, dear Ms. Lee

2107
01:18:29,757 --> 01:18:32,698
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2108
01:18:32,797 --> 01:18:34,728
Please make a wish.

2109
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:36,496
Congratulations.

2110
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:37,996
Happy birthday.

2111
01:18:37,997 --> 01:18:39,036
(They take a selfie together!)

2112
01:18:39,037 --> 01:18:40,037
Okay.

2113
01:18:40,038 --> 01:18:41,137
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

2114
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,376
- Ma'am, - Happy birthday.

2115
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:44,278
Do you happen to have...

2116
01:18:44,577 --> 01:18:46,207
an ID card with your birth date?

2117
01:18:46,348 --> 01:18:48,407
- If you have it...
- We need to check.

2118
01:18:48,408 --> 01:18:49,947
- That's right.
- We ask...

2119
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:52,786
because the mission requires us to check the birth date.

2120
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:54,716
- Yes. It's written here.
- Here.

2121
01:18:54,717 --> 01:18:56,658
All right. Let's show it.

2122
01:18:57,087 --> 01:18:58,287
Let's show it.

2123
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:00,028
(What?)

2124
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:03,728
(Halting)

2125
01:19:04,457 --> 01:19:06,068
Ma'am, hold on.

2126
01:19:06,098 --> 01:19:07,528
Your birthday is October 30.

2127
01:19:08,297 --> 01:19:09,536
- October...
- It's the Lunar Calendar.

2128
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:10,568
The Lunar Calendar.

2129
01:19:11,337 --> 01:19:13,206
- It's the Lunar Calendar.
- The Lunar Calendar.

2130
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,367
- It's the Lunar Calendar.
- We need to check.

2131
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:17,577
- It's right.
- It's right.

2132
01:19:18,308 --> 01:19:20,147
- You need to film it.
- You need to film it.

2133
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:23,376
If you look over here, her birthday is October 30.

2134
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:26,148
This Saturday is October 30 by Lunar Calendar.

2135
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:27,647
Happy birthday.

2136
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:29,717
- Thank goodness.
- I was so surprised.

2137
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:31,586
- Seriously.
- We had the same reaction.

2138
01:19:31,587 --> 01:19:33,287
- Both of us became quiet.
- I mean...

2139
01:19:33,358 --> 01:19:34,728
Both of us became quiet.

2140
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,327
Still...

2141
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:38,496
We became quiet for ten seconds.

2142
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:40,228
(There was a moment of silence.)

2143
01:19:40,797 --> 01:19:42,866
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2144
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:44,238
Please enjoy it.

2145
01:19:44,297 --> 01:19:45,398
All right.

2146
01:19:46,037 --> 01:19:47,437
(After the celebrations)

2147
01:19:47,438 --> 01:19:48,707
Thank you.

2148
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:51,837
(They enter the Yeongam Brewery.)

2149
01:19:51,978 --> 01:19:53,677
- Hello.
- Hello.

2150
01:19:54,507 --> 01:19:55,577
Hello.

2151
01:19:55,818 --> 01:19:57,347
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2152
01:19:57,348 --> 01:19:58,676
- Hello.
- Sir.

2153
01:19:58,677 --> 01:20:02,087
By any chance, did three men come here...

2154
01:20:02,188 --> 01:20:03,616
to study about liquor like us?

2155
01:20:03,617 --> 01:20:04,858
Yes, they did.

2156
01:20:05,528 --> 01:20:06,887
- Really?
- They came here...

2157
01:20:06,888 --> 01:20:08,997
and failed. They were here.

2158
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,627
- They gave it a go.
- They were here.

2159
01:20:11,997 --> 01:20:13,497
Our guess was right.

2160
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:15,197
They failed to answer correctly.

2161
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:17,536
- So they aren't very smart.
- No.

2162
01:20:17,537 --> 01:20:19,308
- They failed.
- That means...

2163
01:20:19,408 --> 01:20:20,866
the quiz is difficult.

2164
01:20:20,867 --> 01:20:23,308
We have the reattempt card.

2165
01:20:23,478 --> 01:20:24,837
- That's right.
- This liquor...

2166
01:20:24,877 --> 01:20:26,447
was made in Yeongam.

2167
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:28,576
There's a difference between soju and yakju.

2168
01:20:28,577 --> 01:20:29,746
(They begin to study up on the traditional liquor.)

2169
01:20:29,747 --> 01:20:30,778
It's the yeast.

2170
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:33,416
The yeast content needs to be one percent or less...

2171
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,688
for a liquor to be called cheongju.

2172
01:20:35,818 --> 01:20:37,616
(After the explanation)

2173
01:20:37,617 --> 01:20:39,057
Cheongju and yakju are different.

2174
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:40,487
I'll give you takju first.

2175
01:20:40,488 --> 01:20:41,926
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2176
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:43,197
Thank you.

2177
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:45,127
The pink color is unique.

2178
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:48,098
After drinking a small bit...

2179
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:54,466
It goes down smoothly.

2180
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:55,937
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2181
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:59,047
This time, you'll try yakju.

2182
01:20:59,077 --> 01:21:01,847
- Don't spill it.
- The owner always drinks with us.

2183
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:03,977
- I need to check the taste.
- That's right.

2184
01:21:03,978 --> 01:21:05,217
Drink it in two sips.

2185
01:21:05,547 --> 01:21:08,286
- It's tasty. It's incredible.
- What an aroma.

2186
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:10,018
- Gosh, this is...
- My goodness.

2187
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:12,586
- Gosh, this is...
- Gosh.

2188
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:13,626
It's like...

2189
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:15,227
It's my first time seeing something like it.

2190
01:21:15,228 --> 01:21:16,296
(He checks it with his eyes.)

2191
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:17,996
It smells a bit like puffed rice.

2192
01:21:17,997 --> 01:21:19,697
(The traditional liquor experience is intense.)

2193
01:21:19,698 --> 01:21:20,768
Seriously.

2194
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:23,138
- It's over 40 percent.
- This is incredible.

2195
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:25,138
That's what it feels like.

2196
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:27,068
It's nice.

2197
01:21:27,837 --> 01:21:29,808
We had meat, cake,

2198
01:21:29,938 --> 01:21:31,877
coffee, and liquor.

2199
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:33,376
Today is incredible.

2200
01:21:33,377 --> 01:21:34,777
(Today is incredible!)

2201
01:21:34,778 --> 01:21:37,518
- Isn't it nice?
- It's so nice.

2202
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:39,416
Thank you so much.

2203
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:41,188
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

2204
01:21:41,587 --> 01:21:42,857
Thank you.

2205
01:21:42,858 --> 01:21:44,456
- Thank you.
- It's time for the quiz.

2206
01:21:44,457 --> 01:21:45,787
As you know,

2207
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:49,057
the other team was here.

2208
01:21:49,058 --> 01:21:50,327
They answered incorrectly.

2209
01:21:50,398 --> 01:21:52,297
- Will we get the same question?
- You'll get the same question.

2210
01:21:53,268 --> 01:21:54,626
I think it'll be hard.

2211
01:21:54,627 --> 01:21:55,996
It's bound to be hard.

2212
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:57,297
Please.

2213
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:00,637
This word comes from the image of pouring the liquor adequately...

2214
01:22:00,638 --> 01:22:02,807
so that there isn't too much or too little.

2215
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:06,206
What's the word that means,

2216
01:22:06,207 --> 01:22:09,648
"Considering the situation or background?"

2217
01:22:09,978 --> 01:22:12,076
- Hold on.
- Please repeat it.

2218
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:13,847
- I don't understand the question.
- What was that?

2219
01:22:13,848 --> 01:22:15,246
- What was that?
- I don't understand the question.

2220
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:17,617
- A word that contains "Jak." - A word that contains "Jak."

2221
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:19,786
And it means, "Considering..."

2222
01:22:19,787 --> 01:22:21,727
- "the situation or background." - That's right.

2223
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,357
- That's the meaning, right?
- That's the meaning.

2224
01:22:24,358 --> 01:22:25,598
I have an idea.

2225
01:22:26,467 --> 01:22:27,667
I have an idea.

2226
01:22:27,867 --> 01:22:28,926
Really?

2227
01:22:28,927 --> 01:22:30,068
The thing is,

2228
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:32,707
not many words contain "Jak."

2229
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:34,237
So...

2230
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:35,777
you don't say "Jakdang" for "Dial it down."

2231
01:22:35,778 --> 01:22:37,107
- It's "Jeokdang." - It's "Jeokdang."

2232
01:22:37,108 --> 01:22:38,376
So I thought of this.

2233
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:39,677
- "Jakjak?" - Jakjak.

2234
01:22:40,108 --> 01:22:41,347
- Jakjak.
- "Jakjak?"

2235
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:42,676
"Jakjak" is used...

2236
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:44,317
for "Dial it down."

2237
01:22:44,318 --> 01:22:45,447
- "Jakjak?" - "Dial it down."

2238
01:22:45,448 --> 01:22:46,817
- It's plausible.
- Right?

2239
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:49,018
- It's a candidate.
- Candidate number one.

2240
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:51,787
What other words contain "Jak?"

2241
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:52,927
"Chamjak?"

2242
01:22:53,587 --> 01:22:55,898
It's like extenuation, right?

2243
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:59,068
- I think it's "Chamjak." - Chamjak.

2244
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:00,796
Sang Uk's answer is "Chamjak" and my answer is "Jakjak."

2245
01:23:00,797 --> 01:23:01,927
You decide.

2246
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:04,437
- Chamjak.
- Chamjak.

2247
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:05,497
(Thinking)

2248
01:23:05,638 --> 01:23:07,506
Sung Hoon, please say the answer.

2249
01:23:07,507 --> 01:23:09,507
I think both answers are wrong.

2250
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:12,407
- We need to receive a hint.
- We need to receive a hint.

2251
01:23:12,408 --> 01:23:13,477
That's right.

2252
01:23:13,478 --> 01:23:14,807
Go ahead.

2253
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:15,848
Please.

2254
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:17,278
The answer is...

2255
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:20,716
(Dong Hyun's "Jakjak?")

2256
01:23:20,717 --> 01:23:23,688
(Team Guys' "Chamjak?")

2257
01:23:23,858 --> 01:23:24,858
The answer is...

2258
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:26,256
(Will they continue to get lucky?)

2259
01:23:26,257 --> 01:23:28,057
- "Jakjak." - Jakjak.

2260
01:23:28,058 --> 01:23:29,157
(Answer: Jakjak)

2261
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:30,257
Jakjak.

2262
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,098
- Seriously.
- If it's correct,

2263
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,497
that means we're incredibly lucky.

2264
01:23:35,627 --> 01:23:36,767
"Jakjak" is...

2265
01:23:36,768 --> 01:23:37,796
incorrect.

2266
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:39,137
(Incorrect!)

2267
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:40,466
We should use it, right?

2268
01:23:40,467 --> 01:23:41,536
We should use it.

2269
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:42,938
- We'll use it.
- We should use it.

2270
01:23:43,177 --> 01:23:44,937
(They use the second reattempt card.)

2271
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:45,978
Here you go.

2272
01:23:46,077 --> 01:23:47,877
We have to use it. It can't be helped.

2273
01:23:49,047 --> 01:23:50,277
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

2274
01:23:50,278 --> 01:23:51,547
(They receive a hint that comes with the reattempt card.)

2275
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:53,247
Jire "Blank."

2276
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:55,546
"Jire?" What is it?

2277
01:23:55,547 --> 01:23:56,587
Jirejimjak.

2278
01:23:56,688 --> 01:23:59,057
- Jimjak.
- It's "Jirejimjak."

2279
01:23:59,058 --> 01:24:00,126
Think about it.

2280
01:24:00,127 --> 01:24:02,456
It suits the meaning of considering the other's situation.

2281
01:24:02,457 --> 01:24:04,296
- That's right.
- It's "Jimjak."

2282
01:24:04,297 --> 01:24:05,658
It has to be correct.

2283
01:24:05,967 --> 01:24:07,527
- That's right. We're certain.
- "Jimjak?"

2284
01:24:07,528 --> 01:24:08,567
- "Jimjak?" - Okay.

2285
01:24:08,568 --> 01:24:09,666
Sang Uk, say it.

2286
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:10,667
(Sang Uk announces the answer.)

2287
01:24:10,668 --> 01:24:11,697
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2288
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:13,308
Go ahead. It has to be correct.

2289
01:24:13,568 --> 01:24:15,737
- Let me answer.
- Please go ahead.

2290
01:24:15,738 --> 01:24:16,938
Jimjak.

2291
01:24:18,537 --> 01:24:19,676
Jimjak.

2292
01:24:19,677 --> 01:24:21,407
(Answer: Jimjak)

2293
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:22,477
Jimjak.

2294
01:24:22,478 --> 01:24:23,977
(Please.)

2295
01:24:23,978 --> 01:24:25,147
Correct.

2296
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:26,488
(Team Handsome is correct!)

2297
01:24:26,988 --> 01:24:28,917
- Well done.
- My goodness.

2298
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:30,658
- Well done.
- It was...

2299
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,426
- Jimjak.
- It was...

2300
01:24:32,427 --> 01:24:33,988
impossible to answer.

2301
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:36,527
- I bet they said, "Chamjak." - You know,

2302
01:24:36,528 --> 01:24:39,626
we keep answering the questions with our reattempt cards.

2303
01:24:39,627 --> 01:24:41,166
- What will we do next?
- I don't know.

2304
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:42,897
Let's please get one question correct.

2305
01:24:42,898 --> 01:24:44,268
The quizzes are so hard.

2306
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:45,768
Shall we talk as we eat?

2307
01:24:48,108 --> 01:24:49,237
Let's go.

2308
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:50,608
(Yeongam: Liquor, Uncle-kase)

2309
01:24:51,207 --> 01:24:53,807
(Yeongam: Liquor, Uncle-kase)

2310
01:24:53,808 --> 01:24:56,046
They're similar to us in terms of intelligence.

2311
01:24:56,047 --> 01:24:57,676
They're the same as us.

2312
01:24:57,677 --> 01:24:58,977
(Yeongam: Liquor)

2313
01:24:58,978 --> 01:25:00,287
It isn't him, is it?

2314
01:25:00,348 --> 01:25:02,046
What? He looks similar.

2315
01:25:02,047 --> 01:25:03,286
(Yeongam: Uncle-kase)

2316
01:25:03,287 --> 01:25:04,857
- It's him.
- It's him, right?

2317
01:25:04,858 --> 01:25:07,357
- It's me.
- It's you, right?

2318
01:25:07,358 --> 01:25:08,988
- Is this Uncle-kase?
- Yes.

2319
01:25:09,627 --> 01:25:12,497
(Uncle-kase)

2320
01:25:12,568 --> 01:25:16,037
(Uncle will cook a special dish right away!)

2321
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:18,797
(He cooks before their eyes!)

2322
01:25:19,707 --> 01:25:20,867
What's that?

2323
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:22,307
It's seasoned soy sauce.

2324
01:25:22,308 --> 01:25:23,308
(He cooks vegetables with seasoned soy sauce.)

2325
01:25:23,408 --> 01:25:25,308
(He adds a small octopus!)

2326
01:25:26,547 --> 01:25:27,778
(My goodness)

2327
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:30,478
It looks tasty.

2328
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:32,787
(Two pieces of butter)

2329
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:36,717
- Are those live octopuses?
- Yes.

2330
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:39,058
(His mouth waters.)

2331
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,627
They got stir-fried lightly.

2332
01:25:43,257 --> 01:25:45,426
This is incredible. It's a healthy dish.

2333
01:25:45,427 --> 01:25:46,427
(Fresh vegetables and octopuses stir-fried in butter)

2334
01:25:46,428 --> 01:25:47,866
Here.

2335
01:25:47,867 --> 01:25:49,997
We're eating beef and octopus today.

2336
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:52,138
- It's insane.
- My goodness.

2337
01:25:52,908 --> 01:25:55,037
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2338
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:56,938
- Thank you for the food.
- Gosh.

2339
01:25:58,377 --> 01:25:59,677
(Impressed)

2340
01:26:00,148 --> 01:26:01,447
(It goes straight to the mouth.)

2341
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,047
- It's healthy.
- The texture is important.

2342
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:07,287
It has been seasoned perfectly.

2343
01:26:07,388 --> 01:26:08,517
(They enjoy yakju with the tasty dish.)

2344
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:09,717
Thank you.

2345
01:26:09,818 --> 01:26:11,318
You should take the one with the most amount of liquor.

2346
01:26:15,827 --> 01:26:16,957
It's just right.

2347
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:20,198
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2348
01:26:24,398 --> 01:26:26,536
(They can't stop eating.)

2349
01:26:26,537 --> 01:26:27,938
Why are the onions so tasty?

2350
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:30,176
We're eating diligently.

2351
01:26:30,177 --> 01:26:31,336
We're almost done.

2352
01:26:31,337 --> 01:26:33,377
(Eating and eating)

2353
01:26:33,608 --> 01:26:35,207
Around 30 minutes ago,

2354
01:26:35,747 --> 01:26:38,177
we had 1.5kg of meat.

2355
01:26:39,077 --> 01:26:40,188
Sung Hoon,

2356
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:42,518
that was just the small octopus. It's fine.

2357
01:26:43,587 --> 01:26:44,756
This is perfect to have after feeling full.

2358
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:45,927
I see something else.

2359
01:26:46,087 --> 01:26:49,728
The second dish is the smoked pork neck suyuk.

2360
01:26:50,528 --> 01:26:51,927
A charcoal fire...

2361
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:54,697
was lit inside a crock to cook the meat.

2362
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:56,337
(Burning)

2363
01:26:56,938 --> 01:26:58,666
The meat was smoked.

2364
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:00,207
(The smoked meat slowly gets cooked.)

2365
01:27:02,037 --> 01:27:03,877
(Sizzling)

2366
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:07,007
(Crunchy on the outside and moist in the inside)

2367
01:27:08,108 --> 01:27:11,616
(Smoked pork neck suyuk full of juice)

2368
01:27:11,617 --> 01:27:13,417
That was the plan,

2369
01:27:14,087 --> 01:27:18,217
but as I was waiting for you, the meat got too crispy.

2370
01:27:18,688 --> 01:27:20,058
How long has it been?

2371
01:27:20,457 --> 01:27:22,756
- I think it has been 3 hours.
- It has been 3 hours?

2372
01:27:22,757 --> 01:27:24,157
It became more like a snack,

2373
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:25,528
so it might be hard to eat.

2374
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:27,228
I'll try to cut it as thinly as possible.

2375
01:27:27,698 --> 01:27:29,598
- Just give them a little.
- Okay.

2376
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:33,206
(Crunchy)

2377
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:34,207
(Snapping)

2378
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,637
- I'm curious.
- Think of it as a snack.

2379
01:27:38,638 --> 01:27:40,978
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thank you.

2380
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:43,917
(They all take a piece.)

2381
01:27:44,648 --> 01:27:46,286
It looks like a pork cutlet.

2382
01:27:46,287 --> 01:27:47,547
(Sniffing)

2383
01:27:48,087 --> 01:27:49,517
- Try it.
- Really?

2384
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:50,518
How is it?

2385
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:52,858
(Is this okay?)

2386
01:27:53,488 --> 01:27:55,188
(They try a bite.)

2387
01:27:56,627 --> 01:27:58,257
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

2388
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:01,127
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

2389
01:28:01,967 --> 01:28:04,897
This will be awesome with a bit of salt.

2390
01:28:04,898 --> 01:28:05,937
Would you like some?

2391
01:28:05,938 --> 01:28:07,337
It's amazing.

2392
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:09,608
- Really?
- It's amazing.

2393
01:28:09,778 --> 01:28:11,307
This is a great dish for a drink.

2394
01:28:11,308 --> 01:28:12,507
- Thank you.
- Sung Hoon.

2395
01:28:13,077 --> 01:28:17,277
You know how a slice of bread tastes good drenched in oil, right?

2396
01:28:17,278 --> 01:28:18,916
- This is what it tastes like.
- This is amazing.

2397
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:19,987
It tastes so good.

2398
01:28:19,988 --> 01:28:21,347
(They even have positive appetites.)

2399
01:28:21,348 --> 01:28:23,587
- Gosh.
- It's really savory.

2400
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:26,626
This is amazing.

2401
01:28:26,627 --> 01:28:28,456
We haven't tried the dish that takes an hour,

2402
01:28:28,457 --> 01:28:30,227
but the one that took three hours seems to be much better.

2403
01:28:30,228 --> 01:28:31,326
It will be perfect with a drink.

2404
01:28:31,327 --> 01:28:32,557
- Right.
- It's amazing.

2405
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,597
- It's a delicacy.
- It's so good.

2406
01:28:34,598 --> 01:28:36,837
We had everything healthy as athletes.

2407
01:28:36,997 --> 01:28:38,036
Right.

2408
01:28:38,037 --> 01:28:39,967
Where are we going next?

2409
01:28:40,467 --> 01:28:43,037
We'll go to Naju after going to the sauna, right?

2410
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:44,638
- We can go to Haenam too.
- Right.

2411
01:28:44,877 --> 01:28:46,007
Let's go to the sauna first.

2412
01:28:47,377 --> 01:28:48,576
- Sir.
- Yes?

2413
01:28:48,577 --> 01:28:50,417
Is there a bathhouse around here?

2414
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:51,917
There's one nearby.

2415
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:55,388
(That's great.)

2416
01:28:55,948 --> 01:28:57,188
I'll have one more then.

2417
01:28:57,488 --> 01:28:58,888
- That was great.
- I'm full.

2418
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:01,257
That was wonderful, sir. The food was amazing.

2419
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:03,797
Can we really move around like this?

2420
01:29:04,558 --> 01:29:05,627
Thank you.

2421
01:29:05,997 --> 01:29:07,927
We really enjoyed the precious drink.

2422
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:10,466
It was an honor. It was amazing.

2423
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:12,336
Let's go to the sauna as we're full!

2424
01:29:12,337 --> 01:29:13,666
(We ate and we'll go to the sauna too!)

2425
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:15,107
It's perfect, Sung Hoon.

2426
01:29:15,108 --> 01:29:17,006
This is the perfect course for athletes.

2427
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:18,737
- We worked out.
- We ate.

2428
01:29:18,738 --> 01:29:20,648
- We'll head to the sauna now.
- Right.

2429
01:29:20,948 --> 01:29:23,247
How is there a bathhouse right there as well?

2430
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:25,647
- This makes no sense.
- Gosh.

2431
01:29:25,648 --> 01:29:27,518
- It's right here.
- It's right here.

2432
01:29:28,117 --> 01:29:29,187
"Sauna." It's right here.

2433
01:29:29,188 --> 01:29:30,416
(How will things end for the lucky ones?)

2434
01:29:30,417 --> 01:29:31,417
Gosh.

2435
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,206
(What is the next plan for Team Guys?)

2436
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:35,976
(Go for the bingo...)

2437
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:38,545
(or take up a lot of spots)

2438
01:29:38,546 --> 01:29:39,846
(Take up a lot of spots)

2439
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:42,045
(The race strategy...)

2440
01:29:42,046 --> 01:29:43,186
(is to fill all the spots.)

2441
01:29:43,187 --> 01:29:44,486
(Then it'll end up to see who gets more.)

2442
01:29:44,487 --> 01:29:45,517
(We'll still win.)

2443
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:46,987
(Let's have a race then.)

2444
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:50,426
(They must earn more spots before 8pm!)

2445
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,857
(If we get it wrong here...)

2446
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:53,255
(We can have good food.)

2447
01:29:53,256 --> 01:29:54,296
(What?)

2448
01:29:55,597 --> 01:29:56,597
This is amazing.

2449
01:29:56,598 --> 01:29:58,196
(Eating..)

2450
01:29:58,197 --> 01:30:00,665
(and earning a spot)

2451
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:02,566
(The Handsome Race that kills 2 birds with 1 stone)

2452
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:04,806
(Satisfied)

2453
01:30:04,807 --> 01:30:06,136
(I feel full...)

2454
01:30:06,137 --> 01:30:07,137
(and dizzy.)

2455
01:30:07,138 --> 01:30:08,936
(The back blast brought by being full?)

2456
01:30:08,937 --> 01:30:10,176
(The meaning of dong quai?)

2457
01:30:10,177 --> 01:30:12,647
(You are cute.)

2458
01:30:13,006 --> 01:30:14,347
(I can't see any answers.)

2459
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,847
- What?
- It's here.

2460
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:17,347
(The race becomes more intense toward the end!)

2461
01:30:17,647 --> 01:30:21,016
(There's no time to waste.)

2462
01:30:21,017 --> 01:30:22,155
Get it right!

2463
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:23,857
(Super desperate)

2464
01:30:25,187 --> 01:30:26,256
Hey!

2465
01:30:26,897 --> 01:30:30,097
(Who will become the winner of the second race?)
