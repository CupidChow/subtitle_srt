1
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,632
(Today's Handsome Heritage)

2
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:18,827
(Bakery tour in North Jeolla Province)

3
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,471
(He came in place of his best friend, Tae Hyun.)

4
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,602
(With Jang Hyuk as a member)

5
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,912
(Romantic ballad singer, John Park)

6
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,572
(Sang Uk contacted me.)

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,141
(Sang Uk is Park's huge fan.)

8
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:29,412
(He's recruited by Team Handsome.)

9
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,481
(Team Guys only picked unlucky cards.)

10
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,021
(Team Handsome only picked lucky cards.)

11
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,622
(Tracking card, reattempt cards)

12
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:38,951
(Things are really working out for us today.)

13
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,432
(The day when things are working out)

14
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,261
(Led by Brainiac John Park)

15
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,732
(Answering the quiz is also easy.)

16
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:46,062
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

17
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:49,202
(They win the quizzes in a row.)

18
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:50,571
(We have 2 reattempt cards, )

19
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:51,932
(but we haven't used them yet.)

20
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:53,541
(Successful Team Handsome...)

21
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,942
(in high spirit)

22
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:58,042
(On the other hand)

23
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:00,242
(Things aren't going well for Team Guys.)

24
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,122
(They answered the quiz during the opening segment.)

25
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:06,322
(They failed in Gunsan.)

26
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:10,422
(Next, they're after Gimje.)

27
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,392
Already?

28
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,222
(Gimje)

29
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:16,392
(Nothing is working out for us today.)

30
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,832
(We're just going with the flow.)

31
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:20,631
(Clearing the missions quickly)

32
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:21,901
(Rhythm game card, wishing happy birthday card)

33
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:25,602
(Hoping to turn the tables, they head to Buan B.)

34
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,241
(Buan B)

35
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,302
(Getting up)

36
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:30,212
(I learned about this.)

37
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,111
(Dong Hyun's outstanding performance...)

38
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:35,641
(ties the score to 2 to 2.)

39
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,382
(Team Handsome at that moment)

40
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,912
(Yes, they came by.)

41
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:43,052
(They came to Gunsan where Team Guys failed.)

42
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,352
(Current score, 2 to 2)

43
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,992
(Where is the competition headed?)

44
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,192
So far...

45
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:52,192
(Team Handsome)

46
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:55,732
We found out that Team Guys came by here.

47
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,031
They failed to answer the quiz...

48
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,402
- and left bitterly. - Right.

49
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,271
It means that the quiz is difficult.

50
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,441
It won't be easy this time.

51
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:03,871
Let's write down our plan.

52
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:04,872
(Cuckoo)

53
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,682
- Where is it? - Buan B.

54
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,742
- What? - They went to Buan B.

55
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,181
- Buan? - They went here.

56
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,081
- Buan B? - They'll probably go to Buan A.

57
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,582
They want to conquer Buan.

58
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:17,221
They're traveling Gunsan, Buan A, and Buan B.

59
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,352
- In this direction? - Yes.

60
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,992
The other team used the 30-minute nap card.

61
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:22,162
- Goodness. - Right now?

62
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,082
We have to sleep before answering the quiz.

63
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:27,761
(Team Guys answered the quiz instantly in Buan B.)

64
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:30,131
Guys, we have an unexpected variable.

65
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:31,132
Yes?

66
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,001
It's salted seafood set menu.

67
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,201
(Food at Buan B)

68
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:36,241
Let's put them to sleep before we eat.

69
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,841
- We'll hurry. - Okay.

70
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:39,271
We have to finish eating in 30 minutes...

71
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,712
- and head to Buan. - Right.

72
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,681
Please put them to sleep right now.

73
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:44,182
(30-minute nap card)

74
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,381
They even got us blankets.

75
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,182
What's this? There's incense this time.

76
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:49,382
Gosh.

77
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:51,591
(His eyes widened.)

78
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:52,622
What's going on?

79
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,161
It's a lullaby.

80
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:55,522
(It's obviously a lullaby.)

81
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,731
This is your first time. It's a lullaby.

82
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,261
(Listening to the melody of the south that puts you to sleep)

83
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,332
Sleep well.

84
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,402
Sleep well.

85
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:05,472
(While Team Handsome is taking a nap)

86
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,041
(Team Guys)

87
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,202
We're eating all day long.

88
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:11,112
I'm so full.

89
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,311
(Since 1:30pm, this is their fourth meal.)

90
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:15,642
I'm very full today.

91
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,181
We had a lot of food before coming here.

92
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:20,221
Could we order for two people?

93
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:21,782
- Sure. - Thank you.

94
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:26,392
(The food is served right away.)

95
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,762
Six types of salted seafood are served right away.

96
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,362
How many types of salted seafood...

97
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,732
- They aren't the same, are they? - No.

98
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,732
Suddenly, I feel hungry.

99
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,171
(The hunger returns in a hurry.)

100
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,502
It looks amazing with rice.

101
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,541
Are they all different?

102
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,501
All 12 are different types of salted seafood.

103
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,822
(Salted seafood fills the table.)

104
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,841
They're all different.

105
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,141
(Salted hairtail innards, salted squid, salted pollack roe, )

106
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,718
(salted oyster with hot pepper, salted pollack tripe...)

107
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,652
(With 12 types of Gomso salted seafood)

108
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,481
(Salted seafood set menu)

109
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,881
Then we need three bowls of rice.

110
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:56,251
- Ma'am, could we... - Ma'am.

111
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,521
Can we get three orders instead?

112
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:59,862
Can we get one more bowl of rice?

113
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:02,362
- Salted seafood is... - Even if we have leftovers...

114
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,262
Let's be quick and precise.

115
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,131
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

116
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,202
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

117
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,162
Jeolla Province...

118
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,272
It's hard to find in cities.

119
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,171
(He puts some on the rice.)

120
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,511
(Directly into his mouth)

121
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,912
(Licking)

122
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:22,342
(It makes him smile automatically.)

123
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:26,282
(Seung Ho eats some salted pollack tripe.)

124
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,552
(In awe)

125
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,691
It's delicious.

126
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,421
(Mr. Barley takes a bite of salted oyster with hot pepper.)

127
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,462
Salted seafood...

128
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:41,501
(Right after, he takes a bite of white rice.)

129
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:42,532
(Eyes widening)

130
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:45,301
Eating this after eating a lot of bread...

131
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,822
- The taste is much stronger. - Right?

132
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,772
After eating bread,

133
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,812
we got to eat something spicy.

134
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,141
After eating more bread,

135
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:53,582
we got to eat something spicy again.

136
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,081
With some of this...

137
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:57,781
(This time, he adds salted hairtail innards to the cabbage ssam.)

138
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,481
This is very tasty. It's amazing with rice.

139
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,522
Yes.

140
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:03,652
(Taking a bite of the good combination with rice)

141
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,921
- The salted pollack roe is genuine. - Yes.

142
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,092
Usually, it's not red.

143
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:11,491
I come to Buan often...

144
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,992
for historical drama shoots.

145
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,152
Whenever I come here, I only buy salted seafood.

146
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:16,771
It's so good that I should buy some.

147
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,532
There are so many types.

148
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,402
Strangely, all of them taste different.

149
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,311
(The three guys are in love with salted seafood.)

150
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,081
Gosh, this is so good.

151
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,412
(The three guys are in love with salted seafood.)

152
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,252
You know what's happening?

153
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:34,652
We're eating after putting them to sleep.

154
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,421
(Salted seafood)

155
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,422
I didn't imagine...

156
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,592
that it would include 12 different types.

157
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:43,162
I was very full.

158
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:44,862
Me too.

159
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,561
Here's some barley tea.

160
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,232
- Barley tea? - Yes.

161
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,802
Barley contains some gluten.

162
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,272
It's okay. Gluten.

163
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:01,182
(Spouting out barley tea)

164
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,412
It's boiling water.

165
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,121
You aren't getting along with barley today.

166
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,452
Were you surprised by so much gluten?

167
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:12,792
It's all right.

168
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,791
Thinking of leaving so much food...

169
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,922
We must hurry.

170
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,052
- The food was amazing. - Thank you for the food.

171
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,201
We're leaving.

172
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:21,202
(Buan A)

173
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,301
(Their next destination is Buan A.)

174
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:24,231
I would have regretted it if we didn't come here.

175
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,232
Right.

176
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,402
It was delicious.

177
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:29,802
I'm so full.

178
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,312
Let's say that we got to Buan A.

179
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:36,381
If they aren't there, it'd be the best.

180
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,952
(It'd be the best!)

181
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:40,082
If we answer the quiz...

182
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,052
We'd definitely have a chance to win.

183
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,922
We would have a much higher chance.

184
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,292
It makes me happy to imagine it.

185
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:50,962
It's beautiful.

186
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,792
It seems beautiful...

187
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,672
- because it's going well for us. - Right.

188
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:57,331
The sea looks beautiful. The weather is nice too.

189
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,372
Yes.

190
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:01,371
(Team Handsome)

191
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,412
(Their nap time is over.)

192
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:07,581
All right, please wake up.

193
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:08,611
Already?

194
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,182
Please wake up.

195
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:13,821
Park didn't even sleep.

196
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:14,852
(Getting up on the dot)

197
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,922
We should get off work early and sleep at home.

198
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,721
You know how to put your daughter to sleep,

199
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:22,882
but you don't sleep yourself.

200
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,191
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

201
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,361
Okay, let's get going.

202
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,731
(Time for Quiz)

203
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:30,171
Let's see what kind of question Team Guys got wrong.

204
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,232
Give us the question.

205
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,302
Wake up already!

206
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,971
He must practice fencing in his sleep.

207
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:38,211
He was grunting in his sleep.

208
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,642
(Half asleep)

209
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:40,941
Wake up.

210
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:41,942
(Wake up, Sang Uk!)

211
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:43,512
All right.

212
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,612
Wake up, everyone.

213
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:48,452
Gunsan is known for its rice.

214
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:51,151
Rice is a typical gluten-free product...

215
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:53,262
that can substitute flour.

216
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:55,161
Among the choices,

217
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:58,262
which product includes gluten?

218
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,031
- It includes gluten? - It includes gluten.

219
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,602
Okay. For now,

220
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:03,401
- we should guess. - Number one.

221
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:04,532
Potatoes.

222
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,531
Okay.

223
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:07,972
- Number two, buckwheat. - Okay.

224
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:09,642
Number three, barley.

225
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,412
Number four, almonds.

226
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:13,742
Okay.

227
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:16,382
All right.

228
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,112
Shall I say the answer now?

229
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:19,252
You know the answer?

230
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,282
(A bright smile of certainty)

231
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,382
You really know?

232
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:24,722
(Park, why you...)

233
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,721
Tell us.

234
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,022
Here's what I know.

235
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:31,562
Gluten creates stickiness.

236
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,862
Is there stickiness in potatoes?

237
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,032
I don't think so.

238
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:37,702
We can make jeon with potatoes.

239
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:40,201
- They can be sticky, right? - Yes.

240
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,541
When you make jeon with buckwheat only,

241
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,111
- it breaks. It doesn't mix well. - Right.

242
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,272
It breaks.

243
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,041
How about barley? What do we make with barley?

244
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,211
Barley bread.

245
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,912
- Is there barley bread? - Yes.

246
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,052
Really? Isn't barley a type of rice?

247
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,228
- Is it different? - It's different.

248
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:57,352
Then what's barley?

249
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,322
Barley is barley.

250
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,362
- Name some examples. - Barley rice.

251
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:03,962
(Am I wrong?)

252
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,131
Am I wrong?

253
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:06,961
When it comes to gluten-free...

254
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,531
(It's different from what he thought.)

255
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:11,372
I know that almonds are gluten-free.

256
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,142
Many people drink almond milk.

257
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:16,872
Should we take out almond as a possible answer?

258
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,672
I got confused while talking.

259
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,952
(He's getting confused with what he knows.)

260
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:26,951
- I really can't tell. - What was your answer at first?

261
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,551
At first, I thought it was potatoes.

262
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:29,582
Potatoes?

263
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,651
In the past, I got a lesson on gluten...

264
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,321
from Paik Jong Won.

265
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,062
(I told you everything.)

266
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,862
What kind of dish is made with almonds?

267
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,431
Buckwheat.

268
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:45,502
Wheat is wheat in English.

269
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,202
Maemil in Korean is buckwheat in English.

270
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,041
Wheat has gluten.

271
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,672
(Wheat contains gluten.)

272
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:53,841
Could it be buckwheat?

273
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,382
(Is there also gluten in buckwheat?)

274
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,911
Does it include gluten because wheat has it?

275
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,192
(The reasoning sounds familiar.)

276
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:01,651
- Don't almonds stand out? - Yes.

277
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,991
Why is there almonds as an answer?

278
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:05,432
(The reasoning sounds familiar too.)

279
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,392
It's difficult.

280
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,391
Almonds.

281
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:12,591
(Looking at the ingredient indication)

282
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:16,332
(The scene looks familiar.)

283
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,101
- If we think... - It's very confusing.

284
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,422
It's because we got up from a nap. We can figure this out.

285
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,411
If it can substitute flour,

286
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,542
that would be the answer.

287
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,512
Based on that reasoning, isn't potatoes the only answer?

288
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,412
Potatoes have starch, so let's go with it.

289
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:31,911
One, two, three.

290
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,312
- Potatoes. - Potatoes.

291
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:35,252
Incorrect.

292
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,128
The other team must have said potatoes too.

293
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:38,952
(This is correct.)

294
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,691
Without hesitating,

295
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:41,892
- we'll use this. - Of course.

296
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,161
They must have said potatoes.

297
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,061
The other team failed because they didn't have...

298
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,331
- the reattempt card. - I have no idea.

299
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:48,362
We must get a hint.

300
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,732
As a hint, I'll get rid of one of the choices.

301
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:53,601
(1. Potatoes, 2. Buckwheat, 3. Barley, 4. Almonds)

302
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,401
Buckwheat isn't the answer.

303
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,471
(1. Potatoes, 2. Buckwheat, 3. Barley, 4. Almonds)

304
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,641
- This is very difficult. - It's very hard.

305
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:00,841
It's very difficult.

306
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,082
We have a 50-percent chance.

307
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,351
I'd be angry if we guess almonds, but the answer is barley.

308
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,082
I'd be angry if it's the other way around.

309
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,522
We shouldn't struggle already.

310
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,022
Among things that are made with barley,

311
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,122
is there anything that's chewy?

312
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:16,361
When you eat barley hardtack...

313
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,861
Is there anything made with almonds that's chewy?

314
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:18,868
(Almonds aren't chewy either.)

315
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,901
- I drink protein shakes. - Okay.

316
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,871
Those shakes are very thick.

317
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,942
I think they have almonds in them.

318
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,371
I think the answer is almonds.

319
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,142
- Then the answer is barley. - What?

320
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:33,252
- What? - Then the answer is barley.

321
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:34,582
You think it's almonds?

322
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,212
I really think it's almonds.

323
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:39,242
- I really think it's almonds. - The answer must be barley.

324
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,781
(Following Walnut Sang Uk)

325
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,382
The shakes I drink are very thick.

326
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,951
Isn't it because of almonds?

327
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:46,021
(Almond Sang Uk appears.)

328
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:48,022
We have to get this right. This is important.

329
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:49,522
What do you think it is?

330
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,631
- Almonds. - What do you think it is?

331
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:52,932
Wait.

332
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:54,632
It's barley.

333
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,561
- I just thought of something. - What?

334
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,932
What's made with barley?

335
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,301
- Beer. - Yes.

336
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,502
Beer has gluten.

337
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,772
- It does? - Yes.

338
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:04,041
- Really? - I'm sure of it.

339
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,411
- I'm sure that it's barley. - Does barley contain gluten?

340
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,611
Why did I just think of it now?

341
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,281
Let's go with it. One, two, three.

342
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,381
- Barley. - Correct.

343
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:11,182
(Answer: Barley)

344
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,782
Hey, you punk.

345
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,082
Get lost!

346
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,781
Bad spirit, get lost.

347
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:17,991
(Go away, bad spirit.)

348
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,452
We almost got in trouble.

349
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:20,821
What a relief.

350
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,321
- The shakes I drink are... - You said that almonds were sticky.

351
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,632
- very thick. - Right.

352
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,961
- What do we do with Sang Uk? - I just thought of it.

353
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,842
We'll go with the opposite of Sang Uk's answer.

354
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:30,331
I asked the right question.

355
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,431
- You used your knowledge. - I just thought of it.

356
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,702
Despite the bad spirit, we turned away from it.

357
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,341
We defeated the bad spirit.

358
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,342
(Sang Uk is possessed by the bad spirit of dried nuts.)

359
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,541
I know someone...

360
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,641
who has a bad spirit like you.

361
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:41,681
He keeps looking for...

362
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,881
Thanks to my support of the other side,

363
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:45,682
you could be certain of yourself.

364
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:47,782
- Gluten. - Gluten.

365
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:49,782
Okay.

366
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,591
(Gunsan: Rice castella)

367
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:52,691
(What's the food in Gunsan?)

368
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:53,692
(Jjamppong)

369
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:54,722
Jjamppong?

370
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,961
I was right. It's jjamppong in Gunsan.

371
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:58,962
I like jjamppong.

372
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:00,191
We can think while eating this.

373
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,361
- Sure. - Let's eat this.

374
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,401
- In that case, - That sounds good.

375
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,701
We'll hurry to save time.

376
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:04,801
- Good job. - Sang Uk.

377
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,001
(Will Sang Uk's bad spirit go away at the next location?)

378
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,071
What do we do with you?

379
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,971
(Team Guys)

380
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,492
Every place including the signboard has a nice vibe these days.

381
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,341
It's a Korean dessert cafe.

382
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,241
(Kaesong Juak)

383
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:17,312
It's been remodeled.

384
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:19,811
Hello.

385
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,452
(A traditional snack that MZers love)

386
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:24,551
- Hello. - Hello.

387
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:25,692
- Hello. - Hello.

388
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:28,491
- What is this place famous for? - It's called Kaesong juak.

389
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,992
People come here to buy round-shaped rice cakes.

390
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,601
What is Kaesong juak?

391
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:37,902
Kaesong juak is rice cakes made with glutinous rice.

392
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,972
It was eaten in Kaesong, so it's called Kaesong juak.

393
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:45,312
(Glutinous rice is strained until it becomes fine.)

394
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:50,952
(It's mixed with salt, sugar, makgeolli, and water.)

395
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:56,121
(After shaping it round, )

396
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,652
(a hole is pierced in the center.)

397
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:05,732
(Once deep-fried in oil, it's coated with grain syrup.)

398
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:12,102
(Kaesong juak is made when various toppings are added.)

399
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,741
Doesn't it taste similar to yakgwa?

400
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:16,972
It's similar to yakgwa.

401
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:19,441
There are so many types.

402
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,281
Which one is the most popular?

403
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,852
The most popular flavor is golden tangerine.

404
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,612
Or bellflower root.

405
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,321
- Would you like one each? - Can I get golden tangerine?

406
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,321
- One golden tangerine? - I'd like one injeolmi.

407
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:32,392
Injeolmi?

408
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,521
- Is this kumquat? - Yes, kumquat.

409
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:36,562
(Cuckoo)

410
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,162
Golden tangerine.

411
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:39,692
Gunsan.

412
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,702
- Where? - Did they win Gunsan?

413
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,652
- They already went to Gunsan? - It's okay.

414
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:46,001
- I'd like 1 bellflower root. - Just 1?

415
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,272
Let's sit down and discuss.

416
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:51,172
(It's time to come up with a plan.)

417
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:53,111
Let's go with the number.

418
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,412
In this direction.

419
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,511
If we lose Buan A, they'll come here.

420
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:57,711
(If they fail the quiz, Team Handsome has a chance to win.)

421
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,351
Then let's eat this and spend time...

422
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,421
- We must hurry. - thinking about the answer.

423
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,652
Yes, that's wise.

424
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,152
It's useless to keep talking.

425
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,422
(They finally taste Kaesong juak.)

426
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:13,531
Is your tongue okay?

427
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,562
It's okay.

428
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,078
(Even if he burnt his tongue, he can't give up on juak.)

429
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:20,842
The bottom is lighter than I thought.

430
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:24,842
I expected it to be heavy because of the filling.

431
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:26,742
- The inside is empty. - Yes.

432
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:29,782
It's nice and clean.

433
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,212
- It really is. - It tastes like...

434
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:35,221
- healthy glutinous rice doughnuts. - I agree.

435
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,851
- There has been... - I like it.

436
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,592
A Kaesong juak craze.

437
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:42,061
It's called "yakketing."

438
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,862
- What's that? - Yakgwa ticketing.

439
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,091
Yakgwa ticketing?

440
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,662
In other words, it was very popular.

441
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,971
You can't buy it even if you line up to wait.

442
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,448
(Kaesong juak is hard to buy even if you wait.)

443
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:54,872
I only heard of Kaesong juak. It's my first time tasting it.

444
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,372
It's nice.

445
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,072
(Dusting off his hands)

446
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,212
(Nodding)

447
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,412
All right.

448
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,212
(Director, give us the quiz.)

449
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:04,952
He's very competitive.

450
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:06,751
You told us to empty our mind and let go of greed...

451
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:07,882
to win the game.

452
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:10,281
Doing it quickly is different from being greedy.

453
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,391
Quickly.

454
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:12,692
Let's do it.

455
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,132
We must get it right to block their bingo.

456
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:16,392
Stay calm.

457
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,392
Here's the quiz.

458
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,731
In Joseon dynasty, it was considered...

459
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,632
an expensive gift or a bribe.

460
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:30,171
As products like wild ginseng and deer antlers became available,

461
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,172
it become more and more of a common gift.

462
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:35,811
Today, to mean "nothing big..."

463
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:36,842
I got it.

464
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,052
We use this to say that it's nothing.

465
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:41,781
It's over.

466
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,581
(Team Guys members are sure of their guess.)

467
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:44,622
This is amazing.

468
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:47,721
- For now... - Okay.

469
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:48,791
Okay.

470
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,668
- Let's stay calm. - Please finish the question.

471
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,491
What is this?

472
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,861
- When you know, it's so easy. - I know.

473
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,301
Are you thinking the same?

474
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:57,931
- Yes. - Three syllables?

475
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,071
Okay. What?

476
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,231
How about syllables?

477
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,601
- It's two syllables. - Oh, that?

478
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:02,602
I see.

479
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,841
What's the three-syllable word?

480
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:05,472
- No, that's wrong. - Hold on.

481
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,212
Why did you get excited with us?

482
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,641
You got excited without knowing the answer.

483
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,782
I had two guesses in mind.

484
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,351
- It's either this or that. - Is that what you thought?

485
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,482
Yes, but you're right.

486
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:18,091
- It's what you think. - Right.

487
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:19,952
- It's something we learned here. - Right.

488
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,491
- Let's hurry. We have no time. - We must hurry.

489
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,132
I played a character who loves this.

490
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:29,331
The character was in a drama called "Alchemy of Souls..."

491
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,772
on tvN.

492
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,442
(This is it.)

493
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,042
(This is delicious.)

494
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,712
(A crown prince in Joseon dynasty fell in love with it.)

495
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,382
(Keeping it in his heart because it's delicious)

496
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:44,151
I mentioned it a moment ago.

497
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,481
Yes, and I also brought it up with ticketing.

498
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,651
- Exactly. - Searching for another route.

499
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,881
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

500
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,292
- Two syllables. - Yes.

501
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,452
H.

502
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:53,652
- What? - What?

503
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:55,491
Doesn't it start with H?

504
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,921
What do you think the answer is?

505
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,138
(The answer that Mr. Barley thought)

506
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:00,181
Searching for another route.

507
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:01,451
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

508
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:03,021
- Two syllables. - Yes.

509
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:04,051
H.

510
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:05,252
- What? - What?

511
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,051
Doesn't it start with H?

512
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,592
What do you think the answer is?

513
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,122
Red ginseng.

514
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,332
- He really has no idea. - What is it?

515
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,701
I'm glad that we didn't say it at the same time.

516
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,732
We would have mumbled.

517
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:19,531
Right.

518
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,102
One has to be eliminated.

519
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,071
Hyuk, what was the three-syllable answer?

520
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,941
- Bellflower root. - Bellflower root?

521
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:28,211
(That's bellflower root.)

522
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,011
I'll say the answer right away.

523
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,082
Go ahead.

524
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:32,252
The answer is...

525
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:35,282
- yakgwa. - Yakgwa?

526
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,522
Gosh, this is yakgwa.

527
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:40,021
- This is the answer. - I see.

528
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,022
A long time ago,

529
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,261
yakgwa was very expensive and fancy.

530
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:44,331
Only in the royal court.

531
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,391
No one else could eat it because it was hard to make.

532
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,601
- Let's get up. - Shall we?

533
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,101
- I'm 20,000 percent sure. - Yakgwa?

534
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:51,102
Yes.

535
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,701
You agree, right?

536
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:54,948
We'll leave after taking a look at that.

537
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,742
- That's correct. - Okay.

538
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,712
It's so easy when you know.

539
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,711
It's yakgwa.

540
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:04,652
(It's yakgwa.)

541
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:07,551
(Seung Ho accepted and ate the answer.)

542
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:08,951
One, two, three.

543
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,852
- Yakgwa. - Yakgwa.

544
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:14,392
(Buan A: Kaesong Juak)

545
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,792
The answer was yakgwa.

546
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,332
- Don't give us more food. - Please.

547
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,731
(Braised monkfish, castella, )

548
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:23,102
(steamed buns, salted seafood set menu, juak...)

549
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,131
Yes, it's food.

550
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,502
(What's the next dish?)

551
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:28,902
Isn't it Kaesong juak?

552
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,912
What is it?

553
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,272
Blue crab stew?

554
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,641
(After braised monkfish and salted seafood set menu)

555
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,912
Hyuk, let's decide where to go.

556
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,111
(Throwing up)

557
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,112
Do we have to find it?

558
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,622
(Team Guys is very blessed with food today.)

559
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,192
- Let's go and eat jjamppong. - Shall we go?

560
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:48,621
Eat a lot, Sang Uk.

561
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,661
- Eat a lot and stay strong. - I'll handle this.

562
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:51,891
(Reliable)

563
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:52,991
Get some rest.

564
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,732
This is good.

565
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:56,932
You know exactly what you should do.

566
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,571
- Everyone has his own role. - My pick is almonds.

567
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:03,042
A restaurant of 5 generations with 43 years of history.

568
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,841
Jjamppong...

569
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,082
Should we watch Sang Uk eat a bowl?

570
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:12,551
Let's get one double portion of jjamppong and share it.

571
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,252
- Okay. - Excuse me.

572
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:17,152
Can we get one double portion of seafood jjamppong?

573
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,322
(Cuckoo)

574
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,561
- Buan A. - Buan A?

575
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:24,062
- They're fast. - We should eat quickly.

576
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,532
If they went to Buan A...

577
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,132
They'd go to Jeongeup next.

578
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,902
- Yes, they're going for the number. - Right.

579
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,302
We must go to Jeonju.

580
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,641
Once they win Jeongeup and Jeonju,

581
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:36,741
they'll get a bingo.

582
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:38,582
(They win the bingo with Jeongeup and Jeonju.)

583
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,441
We might meet in Imsil.

584
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:41,581
(The final destination is getting clearer.)

585
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,681
- By moving fast... - We'll go to Jeonju and Imsil.

586
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,781
- The question is who wins Imsil. - Okay.

587
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,622
They have to eat something heavy...

588
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,622
in Buan.

589
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,892
If they get a takeout, it'll be dangerous for us.

590
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,591
We must eat quickly.

591
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,592
(It's a fight against time.)

592
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:58,062
We can't lose.

593
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:00,632
- We must win no matter what. - We won't lose.

594
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,131
We definitely won't lose.

595
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,602
Jjamppong is served.

596
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,032
Thank you.

597
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,341
It's huge.

598
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:09,342
(Gunsan jjamppong is finally served.)

599
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:10,541
Thank you for the food.

600
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,642
Look at that.

601
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:15,081
It's definitely seafood jjamppong.

602
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:17,081
- It's 1 of the top 5... - Jjamppong.

603
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:19,511
(Chewy noodles...)

604
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,952
(and spicy broth)

605
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,321
(The irresistible spicy flavor)

606
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,122
I can't wait to taste the broth.

607
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,591
(Gunsan jjamppong)

608
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:32,832
This is 1 of the top 5 jjamppong in North Jeolla Province.

609
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,132
Should we have ordered more?

610
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,032
Since it's 1 of the top 5,

611
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,632
it piques my curiosity.

612
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:40,631
Let's see.

613
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,971
(Impressed)

614
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,202
I'll try it.

615
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,412
(Exhaling)

616
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,411
- Is it good? - It's good.

617
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,612
That's good.

618
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:53,052
Jjamppong...

619
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,081
We have to give it a try.

620
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,152
(Exclaiming)

621
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,092
(Grunting)

622
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,822
The jjamppong is amazing.

623
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:04,092
It's 2:55pm. We'll leave at 3:10pm.

624
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,432
Okay, Sang Uk?

625
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,362
- Sang Uk. - Yes?

626
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:11,731
We expect a lot from you.

627
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,972
(He can't hear anything.)

628
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:22,941
(Foodie Sang Uk is devoted to his role more than anyone.)

629
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,582
Isn't the jjamppong nice and spicy?

630
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:31,322
(They're about to speed up eating.)

631
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,192
- This is on us. - Gosh.

632
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:34,491
No.

633
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,091
- Here you go. - No.

634
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:37,121
Really?

635
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,362
(His honest feeling came out.)

636
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:39,561
(Flustered)

637
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:40,661
Thank you.

638
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,201
- You're being kind to us. - Thank you very much.

639
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,202
Eat it with sliced green onions.

640
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,801
- Thank you. - She's being kind to us.

641
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:45,871
Sang Uk, it's for you.

642
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,971
It looks delicious.

643
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,532
(With tangsuyuk, a big meal is served.)

644
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:51,972
It's fried food.

645
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,882
Tangsuyuk is good.

646
00:22:58,182 --> 00:22:59,612
The green onions are amazing.

647
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:02,721
(An unexpected free tangsuyuk and its class)

648
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:05,122
- It's really good. - The tangsuyuk is delicious.

649
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:07,321
We'll be 20 minutes late because of tangsuyuk.

650
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:09,622
(We'll be 20 minutes late because of tangsuyuk.)

651
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,021
It's so good.

652
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,632
(He suggested watching Sang Uk eat a moment ago.)

653
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:16,031
It reminds me of chicken with green onions.

654
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,432
(A combination of sliced green onions and crunchy tangsuyuk)

655
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,271
It's so good.

656
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:23,902
(He's in love with tangsuyuk.)

657
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,711
(Exclaiming)

658
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,682
This is the best tangsuyuk I ever had.

659
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,352
- Shall we get one jjajangmyeon? - What?

660
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,981
After eating tangsuyuk...

661
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,021
(Tangsuyuk with sliced green onions calls for jjajangmyeon.)

662
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,092
No way.

663
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,662
We're doing this to eat and live.

664
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:43,192
Let's enjoy it.

665
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,831
If we lose because we're 5 to 10 minutes late...

666
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:47,232
(Thinking)

667
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,461
No way.

668
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:49,462
(Hypnotizing himself)

669
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:54,942
(Noodle Park is already enjoying the food.)

670
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:56,341
- It's really delicious. - Yes.

671
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:57,502
(It's really delicious.)

672
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:58,672
I should take this off.

673
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,311
(Getting heated from the spiciness)

674
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,381
I knew that Gunsan was famous for jjamppong.

675
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:04,551
(Everyone starts to take off his jacket.)

676
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,052
It's insanely good here.

677
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:12,191
- I splashed on myself already. - Oh, no.

678
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:14,122
(Wiping off)

679
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,462
Time is more important than this.

680
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:20,062
(Eating quickly is the answer.)

681
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:22,002
(Checking the time)

682
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,132
We have ten minutes.

683
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:29,901
We have ten minutes.

684
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,142
(He doesn't seem to be listening.)

685
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,212
We finished it all.

686
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,642
Sang Uk.

687
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,722
You just proved your real worth.

688
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,651
This jjamppong is delicious.

689
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:44,892
Yes, it's very good.

690
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:47,722
I give them credit for it. Tangsuyuk...

691
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:49,822
I give them credit for their tangsuyuk.

692
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,062
Ma'am, we'll pay for the tangsuyuk.

693
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,191
- We have to. - Of course.

694
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,362
(It tastes so good that you want to pay for it.)

695
00:24:57,302 --> 00:25:00,132
(They fully enjoyed their meal.)

696
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:01,972
Eating jjamppong...

697
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:03,542
after eating bread...

698
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,472
It's nice. My stomach got reset.

699
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,672
Thank you for the food.

700
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,711
Your jjamppong was amazing.

701
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:11,012
I'm pleasantly full.

702
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:12,711
Let's go to Jeonju.

703
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,452
(Team Handsome heads to Jeonju.)

704
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:16,981
We must win Jeonju...

705
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,491
to block the other team's bingo and get ahead with the quantity.

706
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:20,522
That's correct.

707
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,161
Our best scenario is...

708
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,221
without using our reattempt card in Jeonju...

709
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,092
- I agree. - If we get the right answer,

710
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,232
we'll only need to win Imsil.

711
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:30,101
The game is over.

712
00:25:30,102 --> 00:25:31,162
That sounds good.

713
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:34,102
Aren't we going to a baguette burger place?

714
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,872
- I'll do some research on it. - That's good.

715
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:39,812
Will the question be about Jeonju...

716
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,542
or will it be about baguettes?

717
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,682
In which season do baguettes taste the best?

718
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,382
The season when baguettes taste the best?

719
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,721
Your choices are spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

720
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:51,922
I'd say autumn.

721
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:53,491
It's asking for when they taste the best,

722
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:55,821
- so it's either cold or hot. - Right.

723
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,122
I'd say winter.

724
00:25:57,992 --> 00:25:59,091
Why?

725
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,191
(Why did Yi Kyung pick winter?)

726
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,332
When it's cold, you hold a warm baguette in your arm.

727
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:04,972
Both of you are wrong.

728
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,501
The approach was nice though.

729
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:08,942
- Was it? - Yes, it was a good approach.

730
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,201
- Then what's the answer? - It must be summer.

731
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,541
- It's the summer. - Right.

732
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,842
In the summer, it's easier to make baguettes crunchy and fragrant.

733
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:17,212
As the moisture in the dough evaporates quickly,

734
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,611
- the texture becomes crunchier. - It makes it hard.

735
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,722
Why didn't you ask me for my reasoning?

736
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:23,182
My answer was autumn.

737
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:24,382
Why?

738
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,592
I'm sorry.

739
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,391
I wasn't particularly interested,

740
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,821
but tell me.

741
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,668
- Why did you guess autumn? - What's the reason?

742
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:32,791
What's your reasoning?

743
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:36,232
Baguettes are made with flour.

744
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:39,372
Grains are harvested in autumn.

745
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,602
- That's why. - That's understandable.

746
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,901
- Right. - That's reasonable.

747
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,072
I feel refreshed.

748
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:47,572
Neither of us got the right answer.

749
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,882
My brain got activated for quizzes.

750
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,881
We'll be able to answer anything.

751
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:53,412
We'll spill out answers.

752
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:54,851
I can't believe that I'm studying.

753
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:55,921
(I can't believe that I'm studying.)

754
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:57,182
It's unbelievable.

755
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,861
Let's win.

756
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:04,092
That's cute. He's determined to win.

757
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:05,231
He's resolute.

758
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,531
(Will Sang Uk be able to win for the first time?)

759
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:07,831
For teamwork and applause.

760
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:09,638
(Will Sang Uk be able to win for the first time?)

761
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,702
How many restaurants are we visiting?

762
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:13,671
- Did we eat six times? - Yes.

763
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:15,241
I had breakfast, so I ate seven times.

764
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,378
(Team Guys came to a nearby blue crab stew restaurant.)

765
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,311
- Blue crab stew. - Let's simply order blue crab stew.

766
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:20,441
Yes, blue crab stew.

767
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:21,581
Thank you.

768
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:22,941
- Would you like some rice? - No.

769
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:23,982
It's okay.

770
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:25,852
- We had six meals. - Thank you.

771
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,882
(1. Braised monkfish)

772
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:29,682
(2. Rice castella)

773
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:31,492
(3.3 types of steamed buns)

774
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:33,292
(4. Salted seafood set menu)

775
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:35,062
(5. Kaesong juak)

776
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,391
(And their sixth meal, blue crab stew)

777
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:38,392
Goodness.

778
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:41,062
I feel bad about this.

779
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:43,732
- Hyuk first. - It's okay.

780
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:45,802
Give me just a little.

781
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,472
- We should have a chunk each. - Of course.

782
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,342
I can eat this because it's protein.

783
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:55,012
The lower leg has the most protein.

784
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,702
- The lower leg? - Like the thigh.

785
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:58,052
That's it.

786
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:01,181
Then I gave such a small piece to Hyuk.

787
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,582
- It's okay. - I can eat this fast.

788
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:04,351
It's blue crab caught in the Yellow Sea.

789
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:05,422
(Slurping the broth first)

790
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:06,992
The broth is nice.

791
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:09,021
This is... Goodness.

792
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,692
(I can still eat.)

793
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,302
- It's sweet and spicy. - Yes.

794
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,232
It's sweet and spicy.

795
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,401
(Seung Ho tastes the crab meat first.)

796
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,102
I should've eaten it with my hand.

797
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,301
Gosh, the meat is really sweet.

798
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,312
Yes.

799
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:27,342
It's really sweet.

800
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,412
The meat is very sweet.

801
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:32,752
- It's really sweet. - Yes.

802
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:34,781
They make good stew.

803
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,281
It's not easy to make good blue crab stew.

804
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,522
(I'm full, but why is the blue crab stew so good?)

805
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:41,422
How is the meat so sweet?

806
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,461
Dong Hyun told me...

807
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:44,622
that he can't taste anything.

808
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:47,961
(The reason why his sense of taste is gone)

809
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:50,732
I think he's just enjoying the act of eating.

810
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:55,442
(The performance artist is eating endlessly.)

811
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,402
There's roe too.

812
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:01,011
I can't eat anymore. Seriously.

813
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,011
(However, the performance can't go on.)

814
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,142
I can't eat anymore.

815
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,182
This is so delicious.

816
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:11,692
There can't be another meal after winning the next one, right?

817
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,291
(Don't even joke about that.)

818
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:15,322
I don't know.

819
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,792
If we lose today...

820
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,291
With four meals we had...

821
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,331
Right.

822
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:23,332
We got here two minutes after eating Kaesong juak.

823
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,372
- Our traveling time is short. - Yes.

824
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:28,641
- We're heading to Jeongeup. - Okay.

825
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,672
Going with the flow.

826
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:31,302
Let's go.

827
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,312
I couldn't eat much because I'm so full.

828
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:36,312
I'm so full.

829
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:39,212
I'm so full.

830
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,652
My goodness.

831
00:29:44,222 --> 00:29:45,321
I'm full.

832
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:47,552
(It's obvious that they're full.)

833
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:49,791
(The threshold for carbohydrates)

834
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,752
(They're starting to feel the blood sugar spike.)

835
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:55,962
(Even the food fighter is feeling groggy from eating.)

836
00:29:57,102 --> 00:29:59,072
By the way...

837
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:01,232
By the way...

838
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,542
I'm wondering if I overlooked.

839
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:09,512
The other team no longer has a chance of getting bingo, right?

840
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,382
They have no chance, right?

841
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:15,052
(Checking the situation of the game)

842
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,621
(Team Handsome: Iksan, Gimje, and Gunsan)

843
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:18,121
We have two left.

844
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:20,021
The other team has to win Imsil and Jeongeup,

845
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:21,152
but we're going to Jeongeup.

846
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:23,922
We'll get bingo if we win Jeongeup and Jeonju.

847
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:25,391
What?

848
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:26,491
(You're right.)

849
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,592
That's true.

850
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,432
What if we win Jeongeup?

851
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:31,672
How long will it take?

852
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:33,702
It's 3:30pm right now.

853
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:34,941
We'll arrive around 4:10pm?

854
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,382
(He's no longer drowsy from eating.)

855
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:39,312
(Feeling competitive, they keep advancing.)

856
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,882
(Entering downtown Jeongeup)

857
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:44,981
All right.

859
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,952
The victory is in front of us.

860
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,522
Please.

861
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:54,222
(Handsome bakery tour 6, garlic chill bread)

862
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,462
They don't use any sugar?

863
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,161
- "Kamut?" - "Malt enzyme?"

864
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:00,331
What's Kamut?

865
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:03,661
Let's find things that he might question us.

866
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,871
What's Kamut?

867
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:06,932
- This place is very... - Kamut?

868
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:09,072
- Shall we go inside? - Let's go inside now.

869
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:11,442
- We can't waste any time. - Right.

870
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:14,171
- Hello. - Hello.

871
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,841
- Hello. - Welcome.

872
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:17,841
Is this where people visit...

873
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,612
on their bakery tour?

874
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,552
- That's correct. - Garlic bread.

875
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:23,782
Which bread is popular?

876
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,952
(Curious)

(What many customers look for)

878
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,621
Many customers buy this.

879
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,662
- This one? - Yes.

880

(The bakery's signature bread, garlic bread)

881
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,231
Garlic bread.

882
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:39,632
How is it different from other garlic bread?

883
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:43,101
Garlic bread is usually crunchy.

884
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,141
Yes.

885
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:46,542
(Unlike garlic bread with a crunchy texture)

886
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,812
This is soft.

887
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:53,611
It has garlic sauce inside and on the outside.

888
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,022
(The texture is soft.)

889
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:58,522
(Full of garlic sauce both inside and out)

890
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,251
(This is how soft it is.)

891
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,491
It looks very delicious.

892
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:03,991
- Usually, it's sliced. - Right.

893
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:05,492
Other garlic bread has garlic on top.

894
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:07,862
I've never seen an entire garlic bread.

895
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,862
It's made with Muan garlic.

896
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:11,562
- Garlic that's grown in Muan? - I see.

897
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,601
We'll try some garlic bread.

898
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:14,672
All right.

899
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,601

- It's our seventh meal. - Yes.

902
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:22,881
It's my first time spacing out...

903
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:24,582
while eating.

904
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,381
- I feel spaced out. - Seriously.

905
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:28,382
(Spaced out)

906
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,721
Did you know that the brain uses carbohydrates the most?

907
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:31,791
- Yes. - More than the muscles.

908
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,151
We ate carbs all day long.

909
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,591
It may be why we've been good at quizzes.

910
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:35,961
- That's right. - Our brains are working fast.

911
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,122
That must be why.

912
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:38,761
All right, let's try some.

913
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:40,291
Let's try it.

914
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,831
(Eating their seventh carbohydrate to win Jeongeup)

915
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:42,861
All right.

916
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:44,262
- Let's try some. - Let's try it.

917
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,672
Okay.

918
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,932
It looks very appetizing.

919
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,072
It's so soft.

920
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,842
- It's really soft. - And it's very delicious.

921
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,172
I mean...

922
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:55,441
(Entering deeply)

923
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:56,612
Is it this soft?

924
00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:59,581
(Surprised by the softness)

925
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:02,722
- Garlic bread is usually crunchy. - Goodness.

926
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:04,382
When I press it, it's like toast bread.

927
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,651
It's so soft. There's cream inside.

928
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,822
(It's filled with cream inside.)

929
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,331
(The garlic flavor spreads on the palate.)

930
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,262
- It's delicious. - It's very good.

931
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,461
(Exclaiming)

932
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,601
It's very good.

933
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,832
(It's very good.)

934
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,242
Have they tried it?

935
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,501
- It's very good. - As soon as you eat it...

936
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,671
(This is a new type of garlic bread.)

937
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,912
It's excellent.

938
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:31,541
Ma'am, is the cream inside made of cream cheese?

939
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,651
What is it?

940
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:33,951
- It's very good. - It's garlic sauce.

941
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,151
- Garlic sauce? - Garlic sauce.

942
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:36,682
(It's garlic sauce.)

943
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,452
(The secret to this bakery's garlic bread)

944
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:44,592
(After shaping the kneaded dough)

945
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:49,302
(It's coated with garlic sauce and baked in the oven.)

946
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:53,102
(Between the slices, the bread is filled with cream.)

947
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:57,442
(Lastly, the whole bread is dipped in the garlic sauce.)

948
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,312
(After sprinkling cheese to add more flavor)

949
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:05,882
(When baked until it turns golden)

950
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,482
(The bread is ready.)

951
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,052
(Garlic bread with a strong smell of garlic is ready.)

952
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,822
There's cream on it.

953
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,222
This is what I think.

954
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:19,831
When you buy pizza,

955
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:22,102
it's served with white garlic sauce.

956
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,862
- A dip? - Is it what it's called?

957
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,872
- This is very tasty. - It tastes like...

958
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,441
garlic clam chowder.

959
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,472
Yes.

960
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:33,471
It's so good.

961
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,011
(They're full, but they can't stop eating it.)

962
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,981
It's like something a master made.

963
00:34:36,982 --> 00:34:38,382
This is amazing.

964
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:39,782
(Impressed)

965
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:43,182
How did they make this?

966
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:49,162
(The temptation of the garlic bread is unstoppable.)

967
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:51,062
I was very full.

968
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:52,762
As soon as I ate it,

969
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:54,961
my stomach became...

970
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,032
- Like magic. - Yes.

971
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,942
I need to buy some to take home.

972
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:00,001
If I don't,

973
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:01,672
I'd think about it a lot at home.

974
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:04,672
- This is really... - I'd think about it a lot at home.

975
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,612
- This garlic bread is... - It's very delicious.

976
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:11,612
(Team Handsome)

977
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:16,482
(Jeonju Hanok Village)

978
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,363
- I haven't been here in a while. - Jeonju Hanok Village.

979
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:21,191
It's beautiful here.

980
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,761
(A short, quiet moment during the race)

981
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:23,892
It's my first time.

982
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,892
It's your first time here?

983
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:27,292
- Yes. - Really?

984
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:29,161
Foreigners would love it here.

985
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:31,362
The place is impressive. Everything is made with hanok.

986
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:33,771
- Is it on the street? - Yes.

987
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:34,802
On the street.

988
00:35:35,442 --> 00:35:37,302
- I tried it a long time ago. - Really?

989
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:39,372
It's been around for a while.

990
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:41,472
It's food in Jeonju.

991
00:35:42,312 --> 00:35:43,482
- Here it is. - Where?

992
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,042
- There it is. - It's here.

993
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:47,451
(Located in Jeonju Hanok Village)

994
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:48,982
(A place to stop on the bakery tour)

995
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,992
(Jeonju: Baguette Burger)

996
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,122
It's this place.

997
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,563
It looks like a foreign supermarket.

998
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:57,662
Poongja has been here.

999
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,432
Is this the place?

1000
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:01,761
(A small and neat takeout place)

1001
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,401
- Welcome. - Hello.

1002
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:04,802
- Hello. - Welcome.

1003
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:06,732
Hello. This is what it looks like.

1004
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:07,932
Baguette burger.

1005
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:09,441
What's the most famous here?

1006
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:10,541
- Baguette burger. - Is it baguette burger?

1007
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:11,601
We only have one kind.

1008
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,772
- Only one? - I see.

1009
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,512
- There's only one. - One burger with beverage.

1010
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:19,412
Two Coke Zero and baguette burger sets.

1011
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:20,881
- Okay. - One baguette burger,

1012
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:22,052
please.

1013
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:23,922
- Are you the owner of this place? - Yes.

1014
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:25,552
- Are you? - Yes.

1015
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,091
Did you create this menu?

1016
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:28,221
No, I'm his son.

1017
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:29,892
- You're his son? - I see.

1018
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:32,231
I ate it often a long time ago.

1019
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,731
- At this place? - It wasn't here before.

1020
00:36:34,732 --> 00:36:35,802
Aren't I right?

1021
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:38,208
Right, our first place was in front of Jeonju University.

1022
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,571
It was during the Jeonju Film Festival.

1023
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:42,272
Wasn't it ten years ago?

1024
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,242
That was over 20 years ago.

1025
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,442
Back then, it was already...

1026
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,541
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1027
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,612
Is it ready so fast?

1028
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,511
(Shall we taste the baguette burger in Jeonju?)

1029
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,621
Let's have one each.

1030
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:57,021
(They're seated at a table on one side.)

1031
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:59,752
I'm curious as to see if it's how I remember it.

1032
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,252
I can't wait.

1033
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:03,422
It's warm.

1034
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,921
- Nice. - Yes, before.

1035
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,462
(Nice!)

1036
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,861
- The inside of the baguette... - It's been removed.

1037
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,261
He made it hollow and stuffed it.

1038
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,201
(After removing the inside of the baguette, )

1039
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:14,731
(it was filled with something special...)

1040
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,271
(to make it a burger.)

1041
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:17,502
- Please enjoy. - I'll enjoy.

1042
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:18,811
I'll enjoy.

1043
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:19,872
Look how hard it is.

1044
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:22,442
(Crunchy)

1045
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,212
(Crunchy)

1046
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,652
(Crunchy)

1047
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:33,052
(The crunchiness warrants an immediate thumbs-up.)

1048
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,391
- It's not what I expected. - Right?

1049
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:37,821
I told you it'd be unexpected.

1050
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,262
(It's not the texture you'd expect.)

1051
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:40,762
It tastes exactly the same.

1052
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,831
It's a pizza baguette.

1053
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:45,001
The baguette is super crunchy.

1054
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,201
It melts though, right?

1055
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:47,572
- I thought it'd be hard. - Right.

1056
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,671
It collapses in your mouth...

1057
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:51,552
- leaving you only with the texture. - Exactly.

1058
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,672
It's like a potato chip in a way.

1059
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,042
You can have one clean bite as you intended.

1060
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,552
- It's crunchy. - Check out the filling.

1061
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,511
It's crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside.

1062
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,851
(The basic standard...)

1063
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:04,852
(of crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside)

1064
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,991
(No way)

1065
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:09,921
Let me show you how Sang Uk expresses the taste.

1066
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:10,922
Sang Uk, how is it?

1067
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:13,761
He always says it's good.

1068
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:14,762
(Whispering)

1069
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:16,431
Why do you look like you want me to be poor at this?

1070
00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:18,001
Hardly. I just want to know what you think.

1071
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:19,332
- Really? - How is it?

1072
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,442
It's good.

1073
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,172
What did I tell you?

1074
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:27,042
I knew it.

1075
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:29,041
You wanted me to say "It's good."

1076
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,112
Every time I ask you, that's what you say.

1077
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:32,212
Right.

1078
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:35,151
He's like that when we get together to eat.

1079
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:36,251
- It's good. - I ask how the food is...

1080
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,732
- and he says it's good. - It's good.

1081
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:38,852
(Inhaling sharply)

1082
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,551
It's on the spicier side.

1083
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,221
- You're right. - Cheongyang chili is in it.

1084
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:43,291
Right here.

1085
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:44,892
I think there's a spicy sauce.

1086
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:47,632
The baguette keeps the texture consistent...

1087
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:50,301
while the Cheongyang chili keeps the spice...

1088
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:51,432
at a certain level.

1089
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,032
- It doesn't seem greasy or heavy. - It's not heavy at all.

1090
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,641
This is better than pizza.

1091
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:57,672
(Baguette burger for the people who love spice)

1092
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,871
Did your father come up with this?

1093
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:00,942
That's right.

1094
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,841
The family first started off running a tent bar.

1095
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,051
- Really? - My dad sold toasties...

1096
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,351
and then changed the bread to baguette to achieve this.

1097
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,552
He made the switch.

1098
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:11,552
This was the filling for a toastie.

1099
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,121
- It's so good. - During the main season,

1100
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,452
how many do you sell a day?

1101
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:16,521
During the main season,

1102
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,161
we sell about 3,000.

1103
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:19,431
- Did you say 3,000? - Did you say 3,000?

1104
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:20,561
- A day? - Yes, 3,000.

1105
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:22,601
- It's 3,000 a day. - All the branches together?

1106
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:23,701
- No, just here. - Just here?

1107
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,132
- Yes. - Just here?

1108
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,871
So you sell 15,000 dollars' worth a day?

1109
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:32,242
- That's right. - During the main season, yes.

1110
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:34,112
(It really is the sacred place for bread.)

1111
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,511
A day?

1112
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:37,711
Making 3,000 a day must be a lot of work too.

1113
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,352
- Of course. - It's a lot of work.

1114
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:41,912
He must make them all day.

1115
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:44,152
(Glancing)

1116
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,292
What do you do with the inside of the baguette?

1117
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:49,421
They're usually sent to be used as animal feed.

1118
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,692
Gosh, animal feed?

1119
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,461
They don't waste anything.

1120
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:54,531
I'm amazed to know you throw nothing out.

1121
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:56,431
(The sacred place in Jeonju even looks out for the environment.)

1122
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:58,662
Because I had jjamppong and tangsuyuk earlier,

1123
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:01,932
I was only going to have a few bites of this.

1124
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,142
- Because I'm full. - Same here.

1125
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:04,442
I'll probably finish this.

1126
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,541
- It's good. - It's good.

1127
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,041
Even though we're all full, this...

1128
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,612
- It's good. - I like that it's spicy.

1129
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:14,682
(I had bread for all three meals)

1130
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:15,981
This is insane.

1131
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:17,381
(I even had a snack)

1132
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,592
(But here I am eating more)

1133
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:23,992
This is amazing.

1134
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,708
- It needed the Cheongyang chili. - This is so good.

1135
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:27,052
Good job on the Cheongyang chili.

1136
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,301
(Baguette burger...)

1137
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,602
(is love.)

1138
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,032
It was so good in a way that startled me.

1139
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,592
We had our share of carbs, and our brains have been fueled.

1140
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,452
This is the time that worries me the most.

1141
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,882
If we get this right, we'll...

1142
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,882
- Things will be looking up. - Right.

1143
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:46,988
There's a good chance we'll be tied at the end.

1144
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,212
We need to get this right.

1145
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:50,981
- I have a feeling... - Yes?

1146
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,552
It's about time Hyuk's hunch is back.

1147
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:56,291
Right? It came, it went, and now it'll be back.

1148
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,562
- I want that too. - I agree.

1149
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,162
All right.

1150
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:01,762
Garlic? Is there anything associated with garlic?

1151
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:04,432
Let's cram again.

1152
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,101
(You never know what will be asked...)

1153
00:41:07,102 --> 00:41:08,462
You never know what will be asked.

1154
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:12,342
How about the origin of the word garlic?

1155
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:15,141
(The last cram session before taking the test)

1156
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,181
Okay.

1157
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,441
Please put your books down.

1158
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,982
- All right. - Okay.

1159
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:20,951
(The garlic-related cram session is over.)

1160
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:22,222
- We're good. - Here we go.

1161
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,652
(Time for Quiz)

1162
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,552
In ancient Egypt...

1163
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,062
- This is crazy. - That's what I just read.

1164
00:41:29,262 --> 00:41:32,092
(What?)

1165
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:34,031
- I just read about ancient Egypt. - Okay.

1166
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:35,532
Okay, good.

1167
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:36,801
Let's calm down.

1168
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:38,431
Garlic has something to do with ancient Egypt.

1169
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:39,532
Really?

1170
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:41,932
- I knew your hunch would be back. - Let's calm down.

1171
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:44,202
In ancient Egypt,

1172
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:46,871
for the workers who worked on the pyramids,

1173
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,911
bread was provided as meals.

1174
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:52,042
"This" was also given to keep them energized.

1175
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:54,412
What would that be?

1176
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:57,751
- Hold on. - But we just had garlic.

1177
00:41:57,752 --> 00:41:59,691
If we say that it's garlic...

1178
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:02,462
and that doesn't turn out to be the answer...

1179
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,961
That'd be wrong on so many levels.

1180
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,562
It's a trap.

1181
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,031
From what I read, garlic is the answer.

1182
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:10,101
What did it say?

1183
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,331
What did you read?

1184
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,371
It was about the history of garlic.

1185
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:15,401
- Garlic was given out in Egypt. - Right.

1186
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:16,541
That's how we came to eat it.

1187
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,941
- Then... - Was it given out to the workers?

1188
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,111
That I don't know,

1189
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:23,382
but I read that it's where garlic became known.

1190
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:25,281
I'm confident about this.

1191
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:27,511
If we say it's garlic, and that's not the answer,

1192
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:30,421
then the workers in Egypt...

1193
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,302
At least one of them would've eaten the garlic.

1194
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:34,421
- At least one would've. - Right.

1195
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:35,861
I'll insist.

1196
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:36,961
(He'll confidently insist.)

1197
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:38,021
It's garlic.

1198
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,191
It said that garlic is a tonic.

1199
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:41,861
- That's what I read. - In Egypt?

1200
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,031
- The answer is garlic. - Right.

1201
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,761
- We have to say it's garlic. - Why?

1202
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,201
We ate garlic bread, and that was our question.

1203
00:42:47,202 --> 00:42:48,301
If garlic isn't the answer,

1204
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:50,201
we can complain about it and leave.

1205
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:51,401
Exactly.

1206
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,202
- What else can we say? Green onion? - Right.

1207
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:54,511
It can't be green onion.

1208
00:42:54,512 --> 00:42:55,512
What other than garlic...

1209
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,881
It was Egypt, so I doubt they had ginseng.

1210
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:59,711
- It's garlic for sure. - Garlic...

1211
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:00,852
Could it be maca?

1212
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:03,721
(Garlic!)

1213
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:06,521
- Maca? - It's the ginseng of Peru.

1214
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:07,691
We don't have the time for this.

1215
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:08,721
We should get moving.

1216
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:10,922
- Garlic. - It can't be rakkyo, right?

1217
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,161
If that's not the right answer,

1218
00:43:13,162 --> 00:43:14,482
- it means you set us up. - Sure.

1219
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:16,431
The answer is garlic.

1220
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:17,901
You never know, so say it vaguely.

1221
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:19,131
(Answer: Garlic)

1222
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:21,571
- Garlic. If that's wrong... - The answer.

1223
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:22,932
- You said it was garlic. - Right.

1224
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,272
If not...

1225
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,311
- Shoot. - Don't be nervous.

1226
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,711
We'll get it wrong proudly.

1227
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:29,842
Tae Hyun will be receiving the penalty if we lose.

1228
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:32,511
- Okay. - Garlic.

1229
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:33,512
We're good.

1230
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,652
Garlic?

1231
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,351
(Answer: Garlic)

1232
00:43:37,352 --> 00:43:38,382
That is correct.

1233
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,551
- I knew it. - Nice.

1234
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:42,051
Let me tell you what happened.

1235
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,461
- Take a look at this. - Show us.

1236
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:45,392
I was shocked just now.

1237
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:48,861
No way. Hyuk typed garlic into the encyclopedia page.

1238
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,931
It started with the myth of Dangun...

1239
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,401
and went on to explain that it was a tonic.

1240
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:54,971
- "It origins from ancient Egypt." - Ancient Egypt.

1241
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:56,342
That's what I read.

1242
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:58,041
- That... - My hunch.

1243
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,971
I told you my hunch was back.

1244
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:03,182
You're the best. Cram sessions work.

1245
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:05,282
I can't believe that's exactly what I read.

1246
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,652
All right.

1247
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:09,581
- We got a square. - Hold on.

1248
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,152
What could be on the back scares me.

1249
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,221
Please let it be...

1250
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:16,062
Let it be coffee or some kind of beverage.

1251
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:18,061
Please don't let it be red.

1252
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:19,041
(Well?)

1253
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:22,458
Let it be coffee or some kind of beverage.

1254
00:44:22,598 --> 00:44:24,097
Please don't let it be red.

1255
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:25,257
(Well?)

1256
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:26,598
- No way. - Please.

1257
00:44:28,768 --> 00:44:30,168
Are you kidding me?

1258
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,168
(Retching)

1259
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:37,437
(They win leaf wraps and rice with freshwater snail!)

1260
00:44:37,438 --> 00:44:38,537
Please don't.

1261
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,307
(How come they didn't get any snacks?)

1262
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,148
Is this some kind of food show?

1263
00:44:42,818 --> 00:44:44,017
Leaf wraps and rice with freshwater snail.

1264
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:46,687
We're eating something for the eighth time in a row.

1265
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:47,994
(They got lucky with food yet again.)

1266
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,618
- Garlic. - Garlic.

1267
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:51,688
(Jeongeup: Garlic bread)

1268
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:55,027
(What's fortunate though...)

1269
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:58,597
At least we're ahead.

1270
00:44:58,598 --> 00:44:59,697
- Of course. - Absolutely.

1271
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:00,897
We could even score a bingo.

1272
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,797
We're suddenly in a great position.

1273
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,697
There's more of a chance to win or tie...

1274
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,638
- compared to us losing. - Right.

1275
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,618
I can't believe we're in the lead without any reattempt cards.

1276
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:10,978
This...

1277
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,877
The snowflakes...

1278
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,348
With the sunset bouncing off them, they look like garlic.

1279
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:16,678
Of course.

1280
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,118
(They look like garlic.)

1281
00:45:18,378 --> 00:45:19,517
I love garlic.

1282
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:20,787
(While being hit by garlic, )

1283
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,164
(they head out to have their eighth meal.)

1284
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:23,287
This is amazing.

1285
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:26,128
(Team Handsome)

1286
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,387
(Fourth meal eating bread)

1287
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:29,398
I finished mine.

1288
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:31,457
We'll be given bibimbap for sure.

1289
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:32,468
I should stop right here.

1290
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:34,027
(Leaving enough space for their last meal)

1291
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:35,368
I'll have this on my way back.

1292
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,137
Give us our question.

1293
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:38,467
(We need to get it right in order to eat.)

1294
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:39,607
- Shall we? - Yes.

1295
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:40,837
(Jeonju: Baguette burger)

1296
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,107
We enjoyed the bread in Jeonju.

1297
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:44,108
Give us our question.

1298
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:48,678
Korea's first burger franchise...

1299
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:53,248
- was Lotteria that opened in 1979. - What year?

1300
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:55,288
It ends with nine.

1301
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:57,318
Those who visited the restaurant...

1302
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,827
were flustered by this...

1303
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,327
that hadn't existed before.

1304
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:02,697
What was this?

1305
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:03,897
It's so hard.

1306
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:05,928
(Flustered)

1307
00:46:06,468 --> 00:46:08,227
- They were flustered. - It was in 1979.

1308
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:10,198
It was when my mom was nine.

1309
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:14,667
It said, "those who visited the restaurant,"

1310
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,538
so it wasn't because of the food.

1311
00:46:16,778 --> 00:46:19,278
It might have to do with its system.

1312
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:21,488
What did I find interesting when I visited it?

1313
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:23,177
The wet napkin dispenser?

1314
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:24,454
(Automatic wet napkin dispenser)

1315
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:26,647
It was the only restaurant that had it.

1316
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:27,924
(The cutting-edge system that shocked Sang Uk)

1317
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:30,058
Would it be the call bell?

1318
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:32,888
I heard that a lot when I go to Lotteria.

1319
00:46:33,388 --> 00:46:35,757
(Humming)

1320
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:37,158
That means the fries are ready.

1321
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,358
Is that so?

1322
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:39,897
They were flustered.

1323
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,628
- This must be a hint. - "Flustered."

1324
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:45,337
I don't think it made customers uncomfortable.

1325
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:46,637
- No. - It was just...

1326
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,208
a new technology,

1327
00:46:48,508 --> 00:46:49,508
so they went,

1328
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,307
- "How do we use this?" - "How do we use it?"

1329
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,848
It's something surprising like today's kiosks.

1330
00:46:54,748 --> 00:46:57,517
What flustered you when you went to a burger place in the US?

1331
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:58,777
(Hey, you're from the US.)

1332
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:01,048
Lotteria was my first burger place too.

1333
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,488
I went there when I was in elementary school.

1334
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,787
- I had my birthday parties there. - Me too.

1335
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:07,227
- I had bulgogi burgers. - In fact,

1336
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:08,748
- that was the only one we had. - Yes.

1337
00:47:09,698 --> 00:47:11,798
When I first went inside back then,

1338
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:13,628
there were clerks...

1339
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,097
in uniform, taking orders.

1340
00:47:17,098 --> 00:47:18,098
Right.

1341
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,467
Would that have been something new back in 1979?

1342
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:22,307
Yes. Something like lining up.

1343
00:47:22,308 --> 00:47:24,254
(They lined up and made an order to a clerk in uniform back then.)

1344
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:25,577
They wouldn't have been flustered...

1345
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:26,877
by the kindness that hadn't existed before.

1346
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:28,047
(Did unprecedented kindness make them flustered?)

1347
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:29,518
- "Welcome." - For example,

1348
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:30,847
- there used to be swearing ladies. - "Why are they so kind?"

1349
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,948
"Eat this!"

1350
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:34,918
"Welcome to Lotteria."

1351
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:36,887
(A kind customer service learned by a manual)

1352
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:37,888
(One order of the pizza.)

1353
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,228
(It's 7 dollars and 15 cents.)

1354
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:41,458
(Smiling)

1355
00:47:41,828 --> 00:47:43,998
Was there a soda fountain machine?

1356
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,198
A self-serving soda must have been confusing too.

1357
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,268
They probably gave them an empty cup.

1358
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,137
The soda fountain?

1359
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,938
- You got an unlimited refill. - Yes.

1360
00:47:53,568 --> 00:47:54,708
The soda fountain.

1361
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:57,308
The restaurant buzzer.

1362
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,108
Were there restaurant buzzers back then?

1363
00:47:59,278 --> 00:48:01,477
How did we pick up our orders?

1364
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,778
Our burgers.

1365
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:05,018
They didn't bring them to our table, did they?

1366
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,387
"Bulgogi burger is ready."

1367
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:08,087
- "Customer number something." - Number?

1368
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,288
- The number tickets? - Something like that. A buzzer.

1369
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:13,328
Gosh. It was in 1979. I...

1370
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,558
have no idea what the environment was like back then.

1371
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:20,197
So far, I think the menu board is a plausible answer.

1372
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,627
(Cuckoo)

1373
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:22,697
Jeongeup.

1374
00:48:22,698 --> 00:48:24,438
It's crazy. They've reversed the game.

1375
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,507
(Current score: 4:3)

1376
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:28,307
- We have to hurry and go to Imsil. - Yes.

1377
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:30,008
It's a matter of time now.

1378
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,368
We have to win this. Let's use the card if we have to.

1379
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,677
We have to hurry. We got the menu board,

1380
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,807
the buzzers,

1381
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:37,477
- I like the soda fountain idea. - and the soda fountain.

1382
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:38,747
Should we go with the self-service soda fountain?

1383
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:39,917
Let's do that.

1384
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,018
- Should we? - Yes.

1385
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:42,117
- Let's go for it. - The soda fountain.

1386
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:43,217
One, two, three.

1387
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:44,687
- Soda fountain. - Soda fountain.

1388
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,717
Gosh. I don't think it's right.

1389
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,857
- The soda fountain. - Yes.

1390
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:51,557
(Answer: Soda fountain)

1391
00:48:51,558 --> 00:48:52,667
It's not correct.

1392
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:53,767
For goodness' sake.

1393
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:55,467
(It's incorrect.)

1394
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,398
For goodness' sake. I was surprised.

1395
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,044
- Okay. We'll use the card. - Okay. The reattempt card.

1396
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:02,878
- Okay. You used the reattempt card. - Yes. Give us a hint.

1397
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:04,837
Here's the hint.

1398
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:05,907
(Hint)

1399
00:49:05,908 --> 00:49:06,948
"Water is..."

1400
00:49:07,148 --> 00:49:09,348
- Self-service. - Gosh. Self-service.

1401
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,747
The self-service system.

1402
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,287
Should we say the self-service system?

1403
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:15,118
(Should we say the self-service system?)

1404
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:16,857
Gosh. This is hard. The question asked about "this,"

1405
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:19,488
so I thought it was an object.

1406
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,358
Let's go for it right away.

1407
00:49:21,888 --> 00:49:23,497
- One, two, three. The self-service. - The self-service system.

1408
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:25,157
- It's correct. - Okay.

1409
00:49:25,158 --> 00:49:26,367
(Answer: Self-service system)

1410
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:28,527
- Gosh. We were caught up... - We wouldn't have guessed it.

1411
00:49:28,528 --> 00:49:29,697
By the objects.

1412
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:31,244
We were obsessed with things we can see.

1413
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,967
- Sang Uk said the exact answer. - The self-service system.

1414
00:49:33,968 --> 00:49:35,837
- The self-service system... - Yes.

1415
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,008
- was the exact answer. - The self-service system.

1416
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,807
- Jeonju. - Jeonju.

1417
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:46,587
(Jeonju: Baguette burger)

1418
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:47,688
(Jeonju: Baguette burger)

1419
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,087
Chicken skewers?

1420
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:50,887
- Let's eat them quickly on the way. - We can eat it fast.

1421
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:52,288
- We'll get going. - Let's go.

1422
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,338
Does anyone know a chicken skewer place nearby?

1423
00:49:54,488 --> 00:49:55,627
- Me. - Where is it?

1424
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:57,197
A chicken skewer place. It should be near here.

1425
00:49:57,198 --> 00:49:58,357
- It's around the corner. - Is it right there?

1426
00:49:58,358 --> 00:49:59,397
- Where? - Is it close?

1427
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:01,267
Let's go. Take a photo while you're walking.

1428
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:02,797
Sorry. It's because we don't have much time.

1429
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:04,638
- It's here. - Here it is.

1430
00:50:04,698 --> 00:50:06,767
- Chicken skewers. - Okay.

1431
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:08,237
Please give us one quickly.

1432
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,267
Yes.

1433
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:10,877
(Cheese chicken skewers)

1434
00:50:10,878 --> 00:50:12,637
- It's a time attack now. - Right.

1435
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,198
We'll use the tracking card on our way.

1436
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,177
- How is this possible? The last... - How?

1437
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,017
The center square is the last empty spot.

1438
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,548
That's it. We have to go there.

1439
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,008
- We don't have the reattempt card. - We don't have a hint.

1440
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:24,617
(The order for the customer before them is ready.)

1441
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:26,358
Who ordered two skewers?

1442
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,557
- It's actually three skewers. - Gosh.

1443
00:50:29,558 --> 00:50:30,698
Which sauce do you want?

1444
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:32,427
Anything. Whatever is popular.

1445
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:33,597
You don't even have to put the sauce.

1446
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,158
(You don't even have to put the sauce.)

1447
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:37,167
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1448
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,267
We have to take a bite before we move on. That's the rule.

1449
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:40,807
- Take a bite. - Take a bite.

1450
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:41,968
- I'll take a bite. - Yes.

1451
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:45,037
- Good. - Nice.

1452
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:46,407
Let's go.

1453
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:47,808
You're doing a great job.

1454
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:51,508
- Is it a spicy one? - We're good.

1455
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:52,958
You can eat the rest in the car.

1456
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,117
Gosh. It's super spicy.

1457
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,358
(Gosh. It's super spicy.)

1458
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,688
We have water in the car.

1459
00:50:58,758 --> 00:50:59,788
(Panting)

1460
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:01,488
(Groaning)

1461
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,428
It's so spicy.

1462
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:05,827
(His tongue is on fire.)

1463
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:06,998
I'm in trouble.

1464
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,567
I can't believe the center square is the last one.

1465
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:12,398
- Seriously. - It's the center square.

1466
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:14,207
Let's go.

1467
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,407
(Imsil: Cheesecake)

1468
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,177
(The last battleground for Team Handsome)

1469
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:18,637
- It's crazy. - Okay.

1470
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:19,977
(They are off to the last battleground.)

1471
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:21,948
- We have to use the card. - Right.

1472
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,078
The chicken skewer is so spicy.

1473
00:51:25,278 --> 00:51:26,287
(Sang Uk, in charge of eating, is doing his best eating.)

1474
00:51:26,288 --> 00:51:27,418
You did a great job.

1475
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:29,788
We'll have enough time now.

1476
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:33,458
It will take about 30 minutes from here.

1477
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,887
We're moving.

1478
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:37,397
(Yi Kyung is in charge of driving safely.)

1479
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:39,098
If we lose because we arrive late,

1480
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:40,968
I'll never let it go.

1481
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,567
(Will they arrive Imsil before the other team does?)

1482
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,838
(Team Guys)

1483
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,308
Okay. Now... Here we go again.

1484
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,737
Again.

1485
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:53,708
(They have to eat again.)

1486
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,447
Gosh. It's a bit tough now.

1487
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:56,517
(Both teams are battling against food.)

1488
00:51:56,518 --> 00:51:57,617
Gosh.

1489
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,178
(Both teams are battling against food.)

1490
00:52:00,048 --> 00:52:01,747
(They have to place an order now.)

1491
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:02,987
Gosh.

1492
00:52:02,988 --> 00:52:04,587
(They have to place an order now.)

1493
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,657
(Cuckoo)

1494
00:52:06,658 --> 00:52:07,787
- Where? - Jeonju.

1495
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:09,528
- Gosh. - They occupied Jeonju.

1496
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,498
They're getting all quizzes right too.

1497
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:14,528
- They occupied Jeonju. - They're getting all quizzes right.

1498
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:17,368
- If they were in Jeonju... - We're faster than them.

1499
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,267
- They're moving from here. - To here.

1500
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:22,068
We have to arrive in Imsil before them.

1501
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:23,638
That's the game now.

1502
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,638
They'll go and eat now, right?

1503
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,548
(The only remaining spot is Imsil.)

1504
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:32,578
(The final match to win the center square)

1505
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:35,018
They shouldn't arrive before us.

1506
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:36,458
Suddenly...

1507
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,788
- Gosh. Dong Hyun. - Why?

1508
00:52:39,118 --> 00:52:40,288
Are they closer?

1509
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:42,957
It takes 35 minutes for them but 55 minutes for us.

1510
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,334
(The estimated travel time: 35 minutes versus 55 minutes)

1511
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:45,557
(Team Guys is suddenly pressed for time.)

1512
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:47,628
But this might happen.

1513
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,967
They arrive before us,

1514
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,397
- They might get the question wrong. - but they get it wrong.

1515
00:52:51,398 --> 00:52:52,867
If we win like that, it would feel nice.

1516
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:55,168
- That would be incredible. - That's really...

1517
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,207
That's like turning the table again and again...

1518
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,678
repetitively.

1519
00:52:59,178 --> 00:53:00,408
Imsil.

1520
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,148
We'll go there.

1521
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:03,618
They'll get the quiz wrong.

1522
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:05,477
- We don't have much time. - Seriously.

1523
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:07,387
- Please. - You can serve us quickly.

1524
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:10,287
We have to get going after taking a bite.

1525
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:11,457
- Is that so? - Yes.

1526
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:12,757
- Yes. - Really?

1527
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:13,857
Gosh.

1528
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,127
This is the freshwater snail.

1529
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:16,128
(The leaf wraps and rice with freshwater snail are here.)

1530
00:53:16,129 --> 00:53:17,227
It looks good.

1531
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,668
Gosh. I love having something like this with rice.

1532
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:21,067
We have to restrain ourselves...

1533
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:22,497
- and have only one bite. - Yes.

1534
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:24,497
- We don't have a choice. - We don't.

1535
00:53:24,498 --> 00:53:25,738
You don't have a choice?

1536
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:27,968
(We're sorry.)

1537
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,398
(A generous amount of leaf wraps and rice with freshwater snail)

1538
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:34,747
(The rice attracting seasoned doenjang...)

1539
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:37,778
(with freshwater snail is the kick!)

1540
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:42,587
(And the stomach-warming...)

1541
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:48,028
(flavorful cheonggukjang with freshwater snail)

1542
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,858
(9 side dishes)

1543
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,968
- Let's eat. - Let's eat them.

1544
00:53:56,168 --> 00:53:59,298
(They can't move their spoons easily.)

1545
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:01,807
Okay. Let's hurry.

1546
00:54:01,808 --> 00:54:03,578
- Enjoy your food. - Okay.

1547
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,908
(They can eat them if they were hungry.)

1548
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:10,278
(Going for a small piece of the freshwater snail)

1549
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,517
(I will just...)

1550
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:16,048
(taste it.)

1551
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,787
(He also tries the seasoned doenjang with freshwater snails, )

1552
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,588
(not to be rude.)

1553
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,057
It's not salty.

1554
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,658
(Taking a quick bite)

1555
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:29,268
(Is he done with the mandatory eating part?)

1556
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,467
Gosh. Seriously.

1557
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:33,768
(They do taste good.)

1558
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:35,938
(Just one more bite)

1559
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:40,408
(The oldest one also takes a small piece of the freshwater snails.)

1560
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:47,848
(Finishing up with a small amount of rice)

1561
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:51,618
I'll put a lot of it.

1562
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:07,007
(He said he'd only have a bite.)

1563
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,937
You can put a lot of it because it's not that salty.

1564
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,237
(One bite is getting bigger.)

1565
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:12,708
- I'll put a lot of it. - Gosh.

1566
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:17,278
(Dong Hyun eats a big bite of the wrap.)

1567
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:21,947
(Savoring)

1568
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:23,088
It's good.

1569
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:24,557
It gives me an appetite.

1570
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,557
(Their hands are getting busier.)

1571
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:27,758
The food does go in.

1572
00:55:28,388 --> 00:55:29,857
I think we can keep eating this.

1573
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:31,198
They put them in cheonggukjang.

1574
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:33,997
If they put freshwater snails in it, it's a really tasty cheonggukjang.

1575
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,558
(They lay their hands on the soup too.)

1576
00:55:39,138 --> 00:55:40,207
I love it.

1577
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,268
(The soup is something too.)

1578
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,038
(Amazed)

1579
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,177
(The food is so good.)

1580
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,848
This is amazing.

1581
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:53,887
(The site of miracle...)

1582
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:54,947
(where the closed stomachs open up again)

1583
00:55:54,948 --> 00:55:56,518
It's clean, and it's not salty.

1584
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,727
Dong Hyun, the team in Jeonju...

1585
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:02,187
- will get there first. - We're going to be late.

1586
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:03,728
Yes. We'll be late anyway.

1587
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:06,228
Hey. We can't get to Imsil first.

1588
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:09,498
Because if it's a ten-minute difference...

1589
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:10,868
It won't work.

1590
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:13,507
If we leave now, we'll have to wait outside for 30 minutes.

1591
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:15,207
If we enjoy this meal, we only have to wait 15 minutes.

1592
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,378
What do you think, Hyuk?

1593
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:19,407
(It's up to the oldest brother now.)

1594
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:20,408
My brain...

1595
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:23,278
is telling me to hurry and leave.

1596
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:27,348
(And?)

1597
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,388
But my heart tells me to sit.

1598
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:32,257
It's really good, isn't it?

1599
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,328
This is...

1600
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,387
If we have them rashly,

1601
00:56:35,388 --> 00:56:37,074
we'll regret it because they are that good.

1602
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:38,098
(The food-eating show is on again.)

1603
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,158
We'll regret it.

1604
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:43,568
(Their hands are busy again.)

1605
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,608
Wait. It's hot.

1606
00:56:47,868 --> 00:56:48,968
Let me have these properly.

1607
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:52,438
(Laughing)

1608
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:54,908
Tae Hyun, sorry.

1609
00:56:55,608 --> 00:56:56,778
I did all I could do.

1610
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,277
- You're right. - Seriously.

1611
00:56:59,278 --> 00:57:00,587
- What can you do when it's so good? - Yes.

1612
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:02,028
(I'm useless in front of good food.)

1613
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,988
Ma'am, we'll enjoy the meal slowly.

1614
00:57:04,218 --> 00:57:05,257
Thank you.

1615
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:06,927
- It's so good. - We've changed our minds.

1616
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:08,828
- Really? - It's all thanks to you.

1617
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,298
These freshwater snails are so fresh.

1618
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:13,667
It's crazy.

1619
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:14,898
(Amazed)

1620
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,938
For the first time in my life, I'm having seven meals.

1621
00:57:19,808 --> 00:57:21,367
- This is the 8th meal. - It's the 8th meal.

1622
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:22,807
(You had 8 meals, including this.)

1623
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:23,878
This is the eighth meal.

1624
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:27,707
Even if we face the penalty game,

1625
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,877
let's not be offended.

1626
00:57:29,878 --> 00:57:31,598
We'll congratulate and support one another.

1627
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:33,387
We won't face the penalty.

1628
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:35,448
I told you before.

1629
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:36,857
The Cha Tae Hyun card.

1630
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:38,618
(That's right.)

1631
00:57:38,918 --> 00:57:40,278
We can order more. It's all right.

1632
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,327
(Thanks to the oldest one who makes sure they eat, )

1633
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:43,397
Eat more.

1634
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:45,557
(the younger ones are happy.)

1635
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:47,727
- Tae Hyun will be happy about this. - Yes.

1636
00:57:47,728 --> 00:57:49,297
(Tae Hyun will be happy about this.)

1637
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,138
- That we've fought so hard. - Seriously.

1638
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:54,268
(We've fought so hard.)

1639
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:55,567
If Rocky...

1640
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:58,477
(If Rocky...)

1641
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,677
If Rocky wins, it's no fun.

1642
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:01,807
You're talking about Rocky?

1643
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:04,317
If Rocky beats Apollo, there's no fun to it.

1644
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:05,318
Right.

1645
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:08,048
He endures everything but loses.

1646
00:58:08,148 --> 00:58:10,657
That's why people still consider the movie...

1647
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:12,887
a good and inspiring one.

1648
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,057
Then, Hyuk. if we lose today,

1649
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,627
are you going to come back to have your revenge?

1650
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:18,198
That's "Rocky 2."

1651
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,628
- When Tae Hyun goes overseas, - Yes.

1652
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,268
I'll come back again.

1653
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:25,198
But I have a strange feeling...

1654
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,667
- that they'll get the quiz wrong. - Me too.

1655
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:30,238
- I just told you. - Yes.

1656
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:33,307
Instead of getting there early and having an unclear win...

1657
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:34,748
- We'll win today. - Yes.

1658
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,407
- But we'll make a grand entrance... - Yes.

1659
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:38,077
- like triumphal generals. - Yes.

1660
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:39,147
We'll say comfortably,

1661
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,648
"Did you do all you could?"

1662
00:58:40,848 --> 00:58:42,287
"May we do it now?"

1663
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,558
It's like asking them "May we do it?"

1664
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,458
(Electrified)

1665
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:50,228
- Should we get coffee on the way? - I'd love that too.

1666
00:58:50,428 --> 00:58:51,727
- Good. Yes. - They want coffee now.

1667
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,497
- Should we get going slowly? - Okay.

1668
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:55,898
- Let's leave slowly. - Yes. Slowly.

1669
00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:58,337
- Let's go on a drive. - Yes. A drive.

1670
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:00,207
Also, it's not that late.

1671
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,437
- We have time until it finishes. - We have an hour and a half.

1672
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:02,508
Let's go.

1673
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:05,777
It's crazy.

1674
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:08,178
We always occupied the center square first.

1675
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,917
But now, we're all heading...

1676
00:59:09,918 --> 00:59:11,618
to the center square.

1677
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,788
When the other team leaves Jeongeup,

1678
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:16,858
it'll take more than an hour.

1679
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:18,688
So, we will...

1680
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:20,557
(We'll arrive there first.)

1681
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,628
- be all right. - But we never know.

1682
00:59:23,088 --> 00:59:24,327
We should use the card on our way.

1683
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,297
Should we use the tracking card now?

1684
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:27,368
Should we go for it?

1685
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,097
We'll use the tracking card on the other team's location.

1686
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:31,598
We'll use the tracking card.

1687
00:59:34,468 --> 00:59:35,567
It's here.

1688
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:36,768
(Team Guys' location is here.)

1689
00:59:36,878 --> 00:59:38,738
- Okay. - Please check it.

1690
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,208
I checked their location.

1691
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,407
When they leave from there,

1692
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:44,247
(Checking the travel time from Jeongeup to Imsil)

1693
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,248
(Team Handsome will take 30 minutes.)

1694
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,347
it'll take 1 hour and 3 minutes.

1695
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:47,487
- From now? - Yes.

1696
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:49,224
(Team Handsome is more than 30 minutes ahead of them.)

1697
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:50,588
Let's take our time.

1698
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:52,118
Let's get there safely.

1699
00:59:52,658 --> 00:59:53,887
We'll get there first even in reverse mode.

1700
00:59:53,888 --> 00:59:56,188
(We'll get there first even in reverse mode.)

1701
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:58,857
- Gosh. - We're winning the speed game.

1702
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:00,167
- Good. - If we get the question right,

1703
01:00:00,168 --> 01:00:01,227
- it'll be over. - We just need to get it.

1704
01:00:01,228 --> 01:00:02,427
If we get it right, it's over.

1705
01:00:02,428 --> 01:00:03,698
We have to get it right.

1706
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:07,507
We'll have to use all our brains.

1707
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,807
Gosh. I have to study for it.

1708
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:11,238
Sang Uk, stop talking. You should study for it.

1709
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,108
It's Imsil's cheesecake, right?

1710
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,347
Imsil's cheesecake.

1711
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:17,547
(Studying all kinds of cheese)

1712
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:19,717
They are divided into natural cheese and processed cheese.

1713
01:00:19,718 --> 01:00:20,718
Okay.

1714
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:23,017
We know that Imsil is famous for its cheese,

1715
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:25,117
- but we don't know why. - That's right.

1716
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:26,887
It's because of Imsil's cheese pizza.

1717
01:00:26,888 --> 01:00:28,227
- You're right. - That's what I know.

1718
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:29,687
Imsil's cheese was the first cheese...

1719
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:31,898
that was made in Korea.

1720
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:34,367
It was Korea's first cheese.

1721
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:36,144
- Was it the first one? - That's why it's famous.

1722
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:37,597
- Korea's first cheese? - Yes.

1723
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:40,468
- The place we're visiting is... - Isn't it Didier?

1724
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,468
Didier is a person...

1725
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:45,508
who was a Father from Belgium.

1726
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:48,277
When he was in Imsil,

1727
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,218
he made cheese for the first time.

1728
01:00:50,878 --> 01:00:52,078
- Really? - Yes.

1729
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,148
The environment of Imsil is similar to that of Switzerland.

1730
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:57,918
So, he thought it'd be good to make cheese there.

1731
01:00:58,118 --> 01:01:00,457
Imsil's environment is similar to Switzerland's?

1732
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,458
I know.

1733
01:01:02,488 --> 01:01:04,428
I'm reading quickly...

1734
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,557
everything about cheesecake.

1735
01:01:06,558 --> 01:01:08,478
You never know. Sang Uk might get it in the end.

1736
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:10,867
For the last moment.

1737
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,368
(Studying hard for it)

1738
01:01:12,738 --> 01:01:15,068
I'll get this one right.

1739
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:18,308
- We trust you. - I'm dead serious.

1740
01:01:20,278 --> 01:01:22,247
We're entering Imsil-gun.

1741
01:01:22,248 --> 01:01:23,968
(They enter the final battleground, Imsil.)

1742
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,777
Now that we're in the last battleground,

1743
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:27,618
it feels like time is flying.

1744
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,518
We should win it because John is here.

1745
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:31,018
We should go for it.

1746
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,118
I hope we win when John is here.

1747
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:36,427
Of all Johns, I love John Park the most.

1748
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:38,627
(John Park is the best.)

1749
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,388
- Thank you. - I'll always go for John Park.

1750
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,437
(And Imsil has the best view.)

1751
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:44,537
From here, it's the Switzerland...

1752
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:46,098
- of Korea. - The Switzerland of Korea.

1753
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,237
Gosh. It does look like Switzerland.

1754
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,878
Over there. Gosh. There are mountains too.

1755
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:55,177
It's a good driving course.

1756
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,547
(Beautiful mountains are hiding in North Jeolla Province.)

1757
01:01:56,548 --> 01:01:57,947
It's my first time in Imsil.

1758
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,717
I had no idea it was like this.

1759
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:00,748
Right.

1760
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,517
This place is really pretty.

1761
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,287
(Even with the pretty view before their eyes, )

1762
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:05,757
(they look concerned.)

1763
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:07,858
We won't feel this way if we had the reattempt card.

1764
01:02:08,828 --> 01:02:10,028
Why am I so nervous?

1765
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:13,528
My heart is beating faster than before going up on stage.

1766
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:15,467
Do you still feel nervous before going up on stage?

1767
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:16,528
I don't.

1768
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:18,438
- You don't get nervous. - Not really.

1769
01:02:18,698 --> 01:02:20,808
- You're nervous after a while. - I'm nervous now.

1770
01:02:20,868 --> 01:02:23,638
Is it more nervous than the time with "away push?"

1771
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:25,937
I was really nervous at that time.

1772
01:02:25,938 --> 01:02:27,207
(John's legendary moment...)

1773
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,447
(where he got the words of the song wrong)

1774
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:30,278
- "Away push." - "Away push."

1775
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:32,877
(It's as nervous as the performance of a lifetime.)

1776
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:36,618
(The final battleground)

1777
01:02:37,388 --> 01:02:39,117
We're here.

1778
01:02:39,118 --> 01:02:40,127
(Imsil: Cheesecake)

1779
01:02:40,128 --> 01:02:41,988
- Didier. - It's pretty.

1780
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:46,427
(Handsome Bakery Tour 8)

1781
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:50,697
(Who moved the cheese to Imsil?)

1782
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:52,137
This is the last battleground.

1783
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:53,768
(The final battleground)

1784
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:55,368
Imsil.

1785
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:57,407
Let's go home.

1786
01:02:57,408 --> 01:02:59,514
(Everyone's wish at the moment is to go home quickly.)

1787
01:02:59,538 --> 01:03:02,478
Gosh. So, was this where Father Ji Jeong Hwan lived?

1788
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,148
What is that? There's a mural.

1789
01:03:07,648 --> 01:03:10,788
The history of Imsil cheese is painted on the wall.

1790
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,388
Gosh. He must have been serious about cheese.

1791
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:14,988
It must be him.

1792
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,797
He must be Father Didier.

1793
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:19,197
(A mural of Father Didier from Belgium they studied in the car)

1794
01:03:19,198 --> 01:03:21,168
Leaving empty-handed in 1981.

1795
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:25,198
He left in 1981.

1796
01:03:26,198 --> 01:03:28,118
Did Father Ji Jeong Hwan continue after he left?

1797
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:31,477
Did Father Ji Jeong Hwan continue making cheese?

1798
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:32,677
(What's the relationship between Father Didier and Father Ji?)

1799
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:35,147
It does feel like we're in Switzerland.

1800
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:36,178
Yes.

1801
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:37,517
(Amazed)

1802
01:03:37,518 --> 01:03:38,618
It's pretty.

1803
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:42,918
(A garden cafe)

1804
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:44,387
There it is.

1805
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,458
- I've seen that cheese before. - It's crazy.

1806
01:03:46,718 --> 01:03:48,558
There are many kinds of cheesecake.

1807
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:49,887
Camembert, mozzarella,

1808
01:03:49,888 --> 01:03:51,048
- and cheddar. - And cheddar.

1809
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,048
They have cheddar cheesecake too?

1810
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,798
Gosh. I'm curious how they will taste.

1811
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,037
- There. - It's the cheese of victory.

1812
01:03:58,038 --> 01:03:59,537
(The cheesecake filled with the energy of victory)

1813
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:02,407
- Hello. - Hello.

1814
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:04,308
We've selected some cakes.

1815
01:04:04,778 --> 01:04:07,077
Did the owner change from Father Didier...

1816
01:04:07,078 --> 01:04:08,648
to Father Ji Jeong Hwan?

1817
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:12,548
Father Ji Jeong Hwan's Belgium name was Didier.

1818
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:14,047
- Were they the same person? - Yes.

1819
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:16,788
- His Korean name was Ji Jeong Hwan. - Yes.

1820
01:04:17,488 --> 01:04:18,488
(Father Didier)

1821
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:21,188
(Korean name: Ji Jeong Hwan)

1822
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:24,997
(A young father from Belgium who was appointed to Korea...)

1823
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,668
(in 1959 when he was 29 years old)

1824
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:33,268
(There were only mountains and grass in Imsil after the war.)

1825
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,478
(He brought in the hope of dairy farming.)

1826
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:45,578
(He was a missionary who built Korea's first cheese factory.)

1827
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:49,818
(He devoted his whole life to help the neighbors in need.)

1828
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:54,088
(In the end, he developed Imsil as the producer of cheese.)

1829
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:56,557
(Shall we taste the cheesecake from Imsil, the home of cheese?)

1830
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:57,597
I'll bring them.

1831
01:04:57,598 --> 01:04:58,757
(Shall we taste the cheesecake from Imsil, the home of cheese?)

1832
01:04:58,758 --> 01:04:59,828
I'm excited.

1833
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,827
Shall we try it?

1834
01:05:02,828 --> 01:05:04,228
(They start eating the sweet cake.)

1835
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:07,538
Mozzarella, camembert, and cheddar.

1836
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:10,037
(Yi Kyung takes a bite.)

1837
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:12,838
(Sang Uk takes a bite.)

1838
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:15,877
- Is it good? - Try it first.

1839
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,617
- I don't really... - Describe it.

1840
01:05:17,618 --> 01:05:18,918
Like cheese that much.

1841
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,618
I'm not a fan of cheese, but it's really good.

1842
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:23,917
(The upgraded description includes "really.")

1843
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:24,987
Really.

1844
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:26,588
There's no way to describe it.

1845
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:28,527
(He's cute.)

1846
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:30,397
- Please try it. - "It's good."

1847
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:31,497
- And "It's really good." - Yes.

1848
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:32,498
(Bocconcini)

1849
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:33,967
(Including cherry tomatoes, )

1850
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:36,074
(blueberries, and basil, the toppings are really tasty.)

1851
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,097
(Tasting 1. Mozzarella cheesecake)

1852
01:05:39,098 --> 01:05:41,908
This is the real mozzarella cheese.

1853
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,584
- This? Should I try it like this? - Yes.

1854
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:45,478
(Putting in their mouths)

1855
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:49,808
(An American reaction)

1856
01:05:50,578 --> 01:05:51,648
It's chewy.

1857
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:55,818
Cheese has a unique smell to it, right?

1858
01:05:56,788 --> 01:05:58,658
It's chewy without being smelly.

1859
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,458
- It's so tasty. - It's refreshing.

1860
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:02,088
The taste of milk is strong.

1861
01:06:02,888 --> 01:06:04,397
- Mozzarella is made of milk. - Hey.

1862
01:06:04,398 --> 01:06:06,227
He described a taste for the very first time.

1863
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,698
The taste of milk.

1864
01:06:08,228 --> 01:06:09,528
Among cheese varieties,

1865
01:06:09,828 --> 01:06:11,697
mozzarella is the closest...

1866
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:13,567
- to the taste of pure milk. Right? - Really?

1867
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:15,088
- It tastes like milk. - That's right.

1868
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:17,478
- It's fresh cheese. - It's really tasty.

1869
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:20,207
(Cheddar cheesecake has chocolate coating...)

1870
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,178
(on top of cheese mousse.)

1871
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:23,977
This is incredible.

1872
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:26,878
(Tasting 2. Cheddar cheesecake)

1873
01:06:30,288 --> 01:06:31,388
It's so sweet.

1874
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:33,388
- How do I eat it? - It's tasty.

1875
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:35,127
How do I eat it?

1876
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,357
(Inside hard chocolate, )

1877
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,427
(soft cake sheet is hidden.)

1878
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:38,428
What's this?

1879
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:41,928
Cheddar cheese. I like this one.

1880
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:45,597
(Sang Uk takes a bite.)

1881
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:48,468
If I may describe the taste, it's clean.

1882
01:06:49,008 --> 01:06:51,077
- The savory taste... - One hundred percent.

1883
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,278
Hits you hard.

1884
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,048
It smells strongly of cheese.

1885
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:56,147
It's very tasty. Seriously.

1886
01:06:56,148 --> 01:06:57,428
(He struggles with expressions.)

1887
01:06:57,878 --> 01:06:59,238
- I mean... - Everything is tasty.

1888
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:03,548
(Tasting 3. Camembert cheesecake)

1889
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:04,758
(Poking)

1890
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:06,588
(Eating)

1891
01:07:07,788 --> 01:07:09,058
It's like ice cream.

1892
01:07:09,788 --> 01:07:11,197
It's salty.

1893
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,498
(It's salty and sweet.)

1894
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:14,198
Is it salty and tasty?

1895
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,698
It's tasty.

1896
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:19,267
It's surely tasty.

1897
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,468
It's surely tasty.

1898
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,438
(He has improved a lot.)

1899
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:26,538
Really tasty. Very tasty. Surely tasty.

1900
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:30,648
You can say that something is tasty in a variety of ways.

1901
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,817
I think this one is the tastiest.

1902
01:07:33,818 --> 01:07:34,887
Really?

1903
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:35,947
- You know, - It's really tasty.

1904
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:37,318
Most cheesecakes...

1905
01:07:37,658 --> 01:07:39,418
are made of cream cheese.

1906
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:43,798
So they just have that taste of cream cheese.

1907
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:45,257
(American reaction)

1908
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:47,297
It's an ordinary taste.

1909
01:07:47,298 --> 01:07:49,397
But these cheesecakes...

1910
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,037
have the unique taste...

1911
01:07:52,038 --> 01:07:54,508
of mozzarella, camembert, and cheddar.

1912
01:07:56,008 --> 01:07:58,808
I can really taste that they're...

1913
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,107
specialized cheesecakes.

1914
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:03,178
(They're cheesecakes of the most special taste.)

1915
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,848
Let's go.

1916
01:08:05,678 --> 01:08:07,148
Stay still. I'll get it right.

1917
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:09,717
All right. This is the last one.

1918
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,457
(It's the last quiz of the bakery tour episode.)

1919
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,018
Only this square is empty.

1920
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:16,258
It's the last quiz in Imsil.

1921
01:08:16,558 --> 01:08:18,804
It's the first time the center one became the last square.

1922
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:19,858
Let's hear it.

1923
01:08:20,468 --> 01:08:21,567
Here comes the question.

1924
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:23,844
(What's the last quiz that'll determine the teams' fate?)

1925
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:25,398
When Father Ji Jeong Hwan...

1926
01:08:26,298 --> 01:08:28,468
made cheese for the first time,

1927
01:08:29,268 --> 01:08:32,408
he distributed it to the locals for a taste.

1928
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:36,198
Since the locals were unfamiliar with the shape and taste of cheese,

1929
01:08:36,648 --> 01:08:38,048
they said...

1930
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:40,178
that it resembled "Blank..."

1931
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:42,918
and called it "'Blank' rice cake."

1932
01:08:43,588 --> 01:08:44,657
What goes in the blank?

1933
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:45,757
(Laughing)

1934
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:47,188
(Chuckling)

1935
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:50,258
When he distributed the cheese...

1936
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,297
We don't know which shape it was in.

1937
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:54,768
Cheese is usually cut...

1938
01:08:55,828 --> 01:08:57,968
- into cubes. - Cubes.

1939
01:08:57,998 --> 01:09:01,738
Otherwise, it can be sliced thin...

1940
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,408
with a slicer.

1941
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:05,077
What resembles sliced cheese?

1942
01:09:05,078 --> 01:09:06,278
What resembles it?

1943
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:11,977
(Yi Kyung writes "Jeolpyeon" as a possible answer.)

1944
01:09:11,978 --> 01:09:13,077
What's that?

1945
01:09:13,078 --> 01:09:15,488
It's like garaetteok that's rectangular in shape.

1946
01:09:15,848 --> 01:09:18,088
- It's like garaetteok. - Is it diamond-shaped?

1947
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:20,118
Close. It's rectangular.

1948
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:21,527
That's one possibility.

1949
01:09:21,528 --> 01:09:22,557
(Sang Uk keeps quiet since he's a layman in terms of cheese.)

1950
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,658
A cube.

1951
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:24,928
A pie?

1952
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:27,328
You told us to rest.

1953
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:28,728
What?

1954
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:31,268
Does anything come to mind?

1955
01:09:32,538 --> 01:09:33,538
Nothing.

1956
01:09:33,538 --> 01:09:34,538
(I don't know anything?)

1957
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:35,837
Please give us...

1958
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,807
the question once more.

1959
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:39,008
- Okay. - Okay.

1960
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,928
Since the locals were unfamiliar with the shape and taste of cheese,

1961
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:45,218
they said that it resembled "Blank..."

1962
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:47,818
and called it "'Blank' rice cake." What goes in the blank?

1963
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:50,348
- Then... - Taste.

1964
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,718
- It might not be rice cake. - That's right.

1965
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,287
It isn't rice cake.

1966
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:55,627
- I see. - it isn't a rice cake variety...

1967
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:58,127
such as sirutteok, injeolmi, or garaetteok.

1968
01:09:58,128 --> 01:09:59,897
If it's rectangular, it might be dice rice cake.

1969
01:09:59,898 --> 01:10:00,998
Sugar cube?

1970
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:03,697
Sugar cube is rectangular.

1971
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:05,698
(Sugar cube rice cake is a possibility.)

1972
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:06,968
There's another one.

1973
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:10,138
Let's say the shape wasn't a cube.

1974
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:13,638
If we only think about the color and texture,

1975
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:15,607
a rectangular cheese would resemble an eraser.

1976
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:16,747
An eraser.

1977
01:10:16,748 --> 01:10:18,077
(An eraser resembles the cheese you get at a market.)

1978
01:10:18,078 --> 01:10:19,177
(Sang Uk agrees.)

1979
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:20,347
- Eraser rice cake. - An eraser.

1980
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:22,617
It's a good answer you can get from the white color.

1981
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,618
I wrote it down earlier.

1982
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,057
(It was one of the answers he wrote down!)

1983
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:27,938
I wondered if they had erasers back in the day.

1984
01:10:28,788 --> 01:10:31,057
- Soap is a possible answer. - Totally.

1985
01:10:31,058 --> 01:10:32,528
- Yes. - It's totally possible.

1986
01:10:32,758 --> 01:10:33,967
(He's full of ideas.)

1987
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,328
I'm thinking of some ideas.

1988
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:38,568
- Soap is more plausible. - Right. It's back in the day.

1989
01:10:38,998 --> 01:10:40,667
Back in the day,

1990
01:10:40,668 --> 01:10:43,207
soap was rectangular like the laundry soap.

1991
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,337
It was white.

1992
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:45,907
Soap was something...

1993
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,048
- every household had. - That's right.

1994
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,807
- Soap. Eraser. - Soap.

1995
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:52,078
Soap is my first choice. I think it's a good one.

1996
01:10:53,078 --> 01:10:55,158
Had we had a hint, we would've answered immediately.

1997
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:01,528
(Yi Kyung spots something at a corner of the cafe.)

1998
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,457
Tell me what comes to your mind right away.

1999
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,527
What? Okay.

2000
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:05,798
Here. Have a taste.

2001
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:07,197
I'm Didier.

2002
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:09,238
(They have a skit using a plastic model of cheese.)

2003
01:11:09,328 --> 01:11:10,467
(Is he rubbing it?)

2004
01:11:10,468 --> 01:11:11,468
I'm Didier.

2005
01:11:11,538 --> 01:11:13,068
(He rubs soap on his hands.)

2006
01:11:14,138 --> 01:11:15,237
(Sang Uk thinks the plastic model looks like soap.)

2007
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:16,338
It's soap.

2008
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:19,408
(His reaction makes me nervous.)

2009
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,507
The laundry soap at my grandma's place...

2010
01:11:21,508 --> 01:11:23,878
looks exactly like this.

2011
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:25,877
(My goodness)

2012
01:11:25,878 --> 01:11:27,787
If he thinks it's soap, it must be incorrect.

2013
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:30,117
(Bad intuition warning!)

2014
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:31,317
We're a team, right?

2015
01:11:31,318 --> 01:11:32,457
- Of course. - We're a team.

2016
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,558
- Of course. - Okay.

2017
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:36,588
(But the curse of 0 wins is already in effect.)

2018
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,697
Father made the cheese and shaped it.

2019
01:11:39,698 --> 01:11:40,968
He shaped it...

2020
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:43,128
and gave people a piece.

2021
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,437
"What's this? Soap?"

2022
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:45,438
(Summoning the spirit of incorrect answers)

2023
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,568
That was why people called it soap rice cake.

2024
01:11:48,568 --> 01:11:49,767
It's milk-colored.

2025
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:51,008
(Are you listening?)

2026
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:52,977
Isn't it soap?

2027
01:11:52,978 --> 01:11:56,008
(They don't fall for the bad spirit.)

2028
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,217
I don't have any other ideas.

2029
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:00,447
(Due to stubbornness and distrust, time drags on.)

2030
01:12:00,448 --> 01:12:01,687
(Team Guys)

2031
01:12:01,688 --> 01:12:02,888
It's like a drama.

2032
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,057
It'll be a drama...

2033
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:06,318
if they get the quiz wrong.

2034
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:08,127
Five minutes remain.

2035
01:12:08,128 --> 01:12:09,227
(5 minutes before arriving at Imsil)

2036
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:12,598
We haven't gotten the alarm until now.

2037
01:12:14,628 --> 01:12:17,028
I bet they failed.

2038
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:18,797
- You think they got it wrong. - Yes.

2039
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,737
(Hyuk guesses that Team Handsome will get the quiz wrong!)

2040
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:21,808
That's my hunch.

2041
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:23,367
They'll get it wrong.

2042
01:12:23,368 --> 01:12:27,007
When we arrive there, Hyuk's hunch will shine...

2043
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:28,348
in the end.

2044
01:12:28,548 --> 01:12:30,277
We'll either know the answer or rely on his hunch.

2045
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:31,318
That's right.

2046
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:34,388
If we have a chance to answer the question,

2047
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:37,287
we should go with Hyuk's hunch.

2048
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:38,288
Okay.

2049
01:12:38,318 --> 01:12:40,118
I hope the question isn't too easy.

2050
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:42,958
We're here.

2051
01:12:43,428 --> 01:12:44,698
We haven't heard the alarm yet.

2052
01:12:45,098 --> 01:12:47,498
(They're at the entrance of the Mural Village.)

2053
01:12:47,628 --> 01:12:48,927
The road is so narrow.

2054
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:50,267
(Team Guys is right behind!)

2055
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:51,268
What will happen?

2056
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:54,507
(What will happen with the last quiz?)

2057
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:55,567
(Team Handsome)

2058
01:12:55,568 --> 01:12:57,877
Instead of the shape, focus on the color...

2059
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,607
and smooth texture.

2060
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,889
It's exactly like the laundry soap at my grandma's place.

2061
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:06,017
The texture is the same.

2062
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:08,247
(The soap salesman hasn't left yet.)

2063
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:10,087
- Come on. - It's fake.

2064
01:13:10,088 --> 01:13:12,257
- It isn't mozzarella. - Listen.

2065
01:13:12,258 --> 01:13:13,717
- Cheese is white. - Yes.

2066
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:15,388
The texture must've been rougher.

2067
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,157
When you rub on it, something like dead skin cell falls off.

2068
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:20,597
(Averting his eyes)

2069
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:21,628
I'm serious.

2070
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:24,638
(Very disappointed)

2071
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:26,937
Soap is the only option.

2072
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:28,038
Let's go with soap then.

2073
01:13:28,108 --> 01:13:31,777
Not many items are pure white.

2074
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:32,837
- That's right. - Yes.

2075
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:33,907
(John gives strength to Sang Uk's thought.)

2076
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:34,908
(Thank goodness)

2077
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:37,377
- Listen. I washed my face... - There's no other choice.

2078
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,124
- with that soap. - There's no other choice.

2079
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,847
This is our limitation.

2080
01:13:40,848 --> 01:13:42,264
Why am I not getting an eureka moment?

2081
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:45,988
If we fail, it's our limitation.

2082
01:13:46,418 --> 01:13:47,818
We've thought about it hard enough.

2083
01:13:48,088 --> 01:13:49,357
- Soap rice cake. - Go ahead.

2084
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:50,387
(Soap is the conclusion they reached.)

2085
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:51,658
Please announce the answer.

2086
01:13:51,858 --> 01:13:53,157
(Go ahead and say it.)

2087
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:54,768
- Okay. - Suddenly, I find it hard.

2088
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:57,537
Let me answer.

2089
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:58,568
(Please)

2090
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,698
This is pressuring. Soap.

2091
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:04,377
- Our answer is soap. - Your answer is soup.

2092
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:10,177
(Answer: Soap)

2093
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,218
Correct.

2094
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:16,587
(Soap is correct.)

2095
01:14:16,588 --> 01:14:17,687
(His soul leaves his body.)

2096
01:14:17,688 --> 01:14:18,918
It's my first win.

2097
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,427
(Sang Uk is moved by his first win!)

2098
01:14:21,428 --> 01:14:22,658
No way!

2099
01:14:24,028 --> 01:14:25,158
I won.

2100
01:14:25,698 --> 01:14:28,067
We won, Sang Uk!

2101
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:30,308
(Team Handsome did it in the end despite the struggles.)

2102
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:31,967
- Unbelievable. - It looks so similar.

2103
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,067
Yi Kyung.

2104
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,867
(The first cheese of Korea looked exactly like soap.)

2105
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:35,908
We won, right?

2106
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:37,907
That was insane.

2107
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:38,908
(They're still absorbed in the electrifying victory.)

2108
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,669
We won by filling up the entire bingo board.

2109
01:14:41,308 --> 01:14:42,308
Yi Kyung.

2110
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:43,477
(Today's bingo board looks fancy with the stickers.)

2111
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:45,917
The current time is 6:45pm.

2112
01:14:45,918 --> 01:14:48,018
There are no more places to visit,

2113
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:49,887
so Team Handsome won.

2114
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:51,217
- All right! - Yes!

2115
01:14:51,218 --> 01:14:52,487
(Team Handsome won!)

2116
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,718
We did it!

2117
01:14:54,928 --> 01:14:57,898
It ended after all the squares got taken.

2118
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:01,228
- Cheese! - Cheese!

2119
01:15:01,328 --> 01:15:04,598
(Imsil: Cheesecake)

2120
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,567
(Cuckoo)

2121
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:08,738
Imsil!

2122
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:12,937
(Disappointed)

2123
01:15:12,938 --> 01:15:15,477
(They came so close to getting the square for Imsil.)

2124
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:19,218
Still, it was a proper match.

2125
01:15:20,018 --> 01:15:21,018
Yes.

2126
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:22,764
(Although it was a nice match, they feel disappointed.)

2127
01:15:22,788 --> 01:15:23,988
They got it right.

2128
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:25,987
- It was insane. - After three consecutive penalties,

2129
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,308
- I broke the cycle. - Well done.

2130
01:15:28,328 --> 01:15:29,828
Congratulations, Sang Uk.

2131
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:33,127
It was an honor to give you the first win.

2132
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,704
(Sang Uk's first win was meaningful since he avoided the penalty!)

2133
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:36,098
I can't believe we did it.

2134
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:40,698
(Sang Uk's first penalty: Mental training at the temple stay)

2135
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:44,377
(Second penalty: Hiking a mountain before sunrise)

2136
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,578
(Cold wind accompanied him.)

2137
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:52,278
(Third penalty: Catching insects by axing)

2138
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:57,917
(Sang Uk promised that there'd be no more penalties.)

2139
01:15:57,918 --> 01:15:59,457
It has been a while since I slept at home after a shoot.

2140
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,488
(He'll get to go back home on the same day.)

2141
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,757
It has been...

2142
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:05,227
It has been two months.

2143
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,258
(Real sorrow comes out.)

2144
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:09,498
You'll get to rest comfortably today.

2145
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:12,337
Gosh, hello.

2146
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,307
- Thank you for your hard work. - Congratulations.

2147
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:15,667
- Congratulations. - Welcome.

2148
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:16,838
Thank you for your hard work.

2149
01:16:17,138 --> 01:16:18,437
Thank you for your hard work.

2150
01:16:18,438 --> 01:16:19,577
(Thank you for your hard work on the race.)

2151
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:21,247
I guess the question was easy.

2152
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:23,508
- We faced a crisis each time. - Really?

2153
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:24,877
But we managed to get all the questions right.

2154
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:26,648
The thing is,

2155
01:16:26,678 --> 01:16:28,987
it would've been dramatic had we gotten it right...

2156
01:16:28,988 --> 01:16:30,687
after your failure. But you ruined the chance.

2157
01:16:30,688 --> 01:16:31,918
Don't be ridiculous.

2158
01:16:32,558 --> 01:16:34,788
- I have a favor to ask of you. - Okay.

2159
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:36,388
Please win in the individual match.

2160
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,527
- Why? - Please win.

2161
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:39,897
We'll take care of it.

2162
01:16:39,898 --> 01:16:41,827
We have a Cha Tae Hyun card,

2163
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:43,328
okay?

2164
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:46,738
Now, Team Guys will have a quiz for the penalty.

2165
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:49,067
We'll play it fair and square.

2166
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:50,307
Okay. Here comes the question.

2167
01:16:50,308 --> 01:16:51,408
- Okay. - Okay.

2168
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:52,748
The following is a song...

2169
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:55,808
that represents a Gimje-born singer who's known to be a good daughter,

2170
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:58,778
"Really" by Hyun Sook.

2171
01:16:59,278 --> 01:17:02,747
(Will my heart really flutter?)

2172
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:05,787
(Will tears really well up in my eyes?)

2173
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,287
(I still don't know what love is)

2174
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:12,497
(But you're the only one I trust)

2175
01:17:12,498 --> 01:17:16,028
(You told me)

2176
01:17:16,868 --> 01:17:18,068
It's so easy.

2177
01:17:18,438 --> 01:17:19,538
It's easy.

2178
01:17:20,398 --> 01:17:21,567
It's easy.

2179
01:17:21,568 --> 01:17:22,938
- Let me answer. - Time out.

2180
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:25,878
- Let me answer. - Time out.

2181
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,177
Isn't it too advantageous for the old one?

2182
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,647
Why am I the old one?

2183
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,948
Aren't you from that era?

2184
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:35,264
Didn't this song place first when you were in university?

2185
01:17:35,288 --> 01:17:37,117
It isn't from my university days.

2186
01:17:37,118 --> 01:17:38,958
Please give us the lyrics.

2187
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,317
- Are these the lyrics? - Yes.

2188
01:17:40,318 --> 01:17:42,327
"Will my heart really flutter?"

2189
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:43,457
"Will tears really well up..."

2190
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,957
I still don't know what love is

2191
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,497
But you're the only one I trust

2192
01:17:48,498 --> 01:17:50,597
You told me

2193
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:51,897
(You told me "Blank")

2194
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:53,068
Do you know the answer?

2195
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:55,937
- Do you know the answer? - This song...

2196
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,738
- I can't say it. - Do you know the answer?

2197
01:17:58,008 --> 01:17:59,608
Go ahead and say it.

2198
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:00,807
- No. - If you know it, say it.

2199
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:01,877
He knows because he's an old man.

2200
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,277
Please give us more time.

2201
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,477
- I'll give you more time. - Okay. "You told me..."

2202
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:06,977
- Let me answer. - Dong Hyun.

2203
01:18:06,978 --> 01:18:10,117
But you're the only one I trust

2204
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,718
- You told me - The notes are completely off.

2205
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:15,627
That you trusted me

2206
01:18:15,628 --> 01:18:17,027
"That you trusted me."

2207
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:18,757
(You told me that you trusted me)

2208
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:19,928
Incorrect.

2209
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:22,927
- It was close. - Really?

2210
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:24,267
It was close.

2211
01:18:24,268 --> 01:18:26,138
- I'll give it a go. - Seung Ho.

2212
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:28,908
"That you'd catch me."

2213
01:18:29,408 --> 01:18:30,668
"That you'd catch me?"

2214
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:33,107
- Incorrect. - Seriously.

2215
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,477
- Go ahead. - I'll give you two more chances.

2216
01:18:34,478 --> 01:18:35,677
Okay.

2217
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:37,077
Hyuk, you should try it.

2218
01:18:37,078 --> 01:18:39,717
- I told them that I'd do that. - Really?

2219
01:18:39,718 --> 01:18:40,994
(I told them that I'd do that throughout the day.)

2220
01:18:41,018 --> 01:18:43,288
- "You told me..." - He's relaxed.

2221
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:45,858
Think about the meaning.

2222
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,457
"Will my heart really flutter?"

2223
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,628
Her heart is fluttering.

2224
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,658
"Will tears really well up in my eyes?"

2225
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,128
Tears are welling up in her eyes.

2226
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:54,568
She doesn't know what love is.

2227
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:56,667
"The only one I trust."

2228
01:18:56,668 --> 01:18:58,368
- Think about it. - Is it similar?

2229
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,368
I know. It's similar.

2230
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:03,008
I think the answer is similar to "Trust."

2231
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:04,538
"That you believed in me."

2232
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:06,177
"You told me that you believed in me."

2233
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:07,178
- Incorrect. - For goodness' sake.

2234
01:19:07,179 --> 01:19:09,447
- Let me answer. - I gave you two chances.

2235
01:19:09,448 --> 01:19:10,448
"That you didn't know me."

2236
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:11,747
"That you didn't know me."

2237
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,318
- It's similar to "Trust." - Incorrect.

2238
01:19:13,818 --> 01:19:17,017
Tae Hyun will have it easy tomorrow.

2239
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,087
My goodness.

2240
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:20,457
- It's your turn next. - He has an advantage.

2241
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:22,327
I practically gave you the answer...

2242
01:19:22,328 --> 01:19:23,757
because I had promised to do that.

2243
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:25,827
"That I should trust you?" Did I try that?

2244
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:26,997
- No. - No?

2245
01:19:26,998 --> 01:19:28,167
- "That I should trust you." - Incorrect.

2246
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:29,298
All right.

2247
01:19:29,328 --> 01:19:30,827
(Let's see.)

2248
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:35,007
Isn't it "That I should trust you?"

2249
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:36,737
(What are you talking about?)

2250
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:37,777
Don't you know?

2251
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:39,077
Isn't it "That I should trust you?"

2252
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:40,177
Gosh, Hyuk!

2253
01:19:40,178 --> 01:19:41,607
(Flustered)

2254
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:43,047
(Was his answer incorrect?)

2255
01:19:43,048 --> 01:19:45,018
- Hold on. - It's a foul.

2256
01:19:45,278 --> 01:19:47,347
- He gave us a wrong hint. - You should answer diligently.

2257
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:48,948
Just say it.

2258
01:19:48,988 --> 01:19:50,388
Just say your answer.

2259
01:19:51,088 --> 01:19:52,888
Hold on. Shall we give Hyuk a chance?

2260
01:19:54,018 --> 01:19:55,288
Let me see the lyrics.

2261
01:19:55,728 --> 01:19:56,987
Gosh, Hyuk.

2262
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:59,157
Try "That I should trust you."

2263
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:00,427
I tried it.

2264
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,867
Give us a hint.

2265
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:02,927
(At this point, they decide to get a hint!)

2266
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,198
As a hint,

2267
01:20:04,368 --> 01:20:05,537
you'll get the initials.

2268
01:20:05,538 --> 01:20:06,538
- Really? - It's a strong hint.

2269
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:07,967
- Use it. - It's a strong hint.

2270
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:09,107
- Use it. - It's a very strong hint.

2271
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:11,507
To be honest, I have another answer in mind.

2272
01:20:11,508 --> 01:20:12,838
Then please wait.

2273
01:20:13,178 --> 01:20:14,507
I just need to check the initials.

2274
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:15,708
- Really? - Yes.

2275
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:17,008
Here are the initials.

2276
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,477
- I. - I.

2277
01:20:18,478 --> 01:20:19,547
- I? - I.

2278
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,747
- I? - Is your answer wrong?

2279
01:20:21,748 --> 01:20:22,887
- I? - I.

2280
01:20:22,888 --> 01:20:24,317
- Is the first one I? - Yes.

2281
01:20:24,318 --> 01:20:25,418
I.

2282
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:28,128
- He doesn't know. I? - I.

2283
01:20:28,288 --> 01:20:29,887
- The next one is W. - W?

2284
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:31,327
- W as in woman. - Next.

2285
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:32,658
- C. - C.

2286
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:34,258
I, W, C?

2287
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,928
"You told me..."

2288
01:20:36,328 --> 01:20:39,167
(Team Handsome looks up the answer.)

2289
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,307
(You told me I was cheeky)

2290
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:43,367
(But you gently held my hand)

2291
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:45,737
I never thought that the initials would be...

2292
01:20:45,738 --> 01:20:47,338
I, W, C.

2293
01:20:48,308 --> 01:20:50,047
- Do you want a hint? - "You told me..."

2294
01:20:50,048 --> 01:20:52,348
(Yi Kyung gives them another hint.)

2295
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:54,277
(Gosh!)

2296
01:20:54,278 --> 01:20:55,388
That's a hint.

2297
01:20:55,488 --> 01:20:56,588
"Gosh?"

2298
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:57,918
"Gosh?"

2299
01:20:58,118 --> 01:20:59,758
- "Gosh?" - Right.

2300
01:21:01,758 --> 01:21:05,858
I have a hunch, but I'll let them have it.

2301
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,467
- Just do it. - You don't have a hunch.

2302
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:10,497
- You don't want the next question. - You don't have a hunch.

2303
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,937
- You don't have a hunch. - I have a hunch.

2304
01:21:11,938 --> 01:21:13,368
I know what the answer is.

2305
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:14,937
"Gosh" makes sense.

2306
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:16,107
Okay.

2307
01:21:16,108 --> 01:21:17,507
- All right. - That's it.

2308
01:21:17,508 --> 01:21:19,337
- I have a hunch now. - Another hint?

2309
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:20,978
It's so much fun to watch them from here.

2310
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,747
She didn't expect him to hold her hand, but he did it.

2311
01:21:24,748 --> 01:21:26,117
He hadn't done it before.

2312
01:21:26,118 --> 01:21:28,448
"He said we were friends, but held my hand."

2313
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,218
Don't go too much into that direction.

2314
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:33,117
They have another hint for us.

2315
01:21:33,118 --> 01:21:34,557
Dong Hyun, shall we receive it?

2316
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,657
- It'll be nice to receive it. - Come here then.

2317
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:38,258
Let's see it at the same time.

2318
01:21:38,328 --> 01:21:39,497
- A hint? - Sounds good.

2319
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:40,828
This one is too telling.

2320
01:21:41,128 --> 01:21:42,868
- Here it comes. - I think it makes sense.

2321
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,698
The hint is...

2322
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:46,137
Kim Dong Hyun.

2323
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:47,737
(Hint: Kim Dong Hyun)

2324
01:21:47,738 --> 01:21:49,267
(Why is Kim Dong Hyun a hint for "Cheeky?")

2325
01:21:49,268 --> 01:21:51,408
- What does that mean? - Kim Dong Hyun?

2326
01:21:56,148 --> 01:22:00,018
(He has a habit of teasing the losers.)

2327
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:04,348
(It's a good hint since he's the epitome of cheekiness.)

2328
01:22:04,888 --> 01:22:06,187
This Kim Dong Hyun?

2329
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:07,487
Is a syllable of my name in the lyrics?

2330
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,987
That's right.

2331
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:10,427
(He understands the hint belatedly!)

2332
01:22:10,428 --> 01:22:11,958
I know what you mean.

2333
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,397
It could've been Choo Sung Hoon,

2334
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:14,727
not Kim Dong Hyun.

2335
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:18,068
- Sure. - The meaning is about the same.

2336
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:21,137
I'll provide...

2337
01:22:21,138 --> 01:22:23,367
the perfect hint.

2338
01:22:23,368 --> 01:22:25,407
- Let's watch it together. - It's the perfect hint.

2339
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,978
- Really? - It's the perfect hint.

2340
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:28,878
- It's the perfect hint. - Okay.

2341
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:30,207
Shall we step back a little?

2342
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:31,377
Ducking and weaving.

2343
01:22:31,378 --> 01:22:32,547
- What? - Ducking and weaving.

2344
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:33,577
Ducking and weaving?

2345
01:22:33,578 --> 01:22:35,087
- Ducking and weaving. - Weaving?

2346
01:22:35,088 --> 01:22:36,248
Ducking and weaving.

2347
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:38,188
It might be incorrect.

2348
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:39,358
Let me answer.

2349
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:41,088
Let me answer.

2350
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:42,827
- Kim Dong Hyun. - May I go ahead?

2351
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:43,988
I think it's correct.

2352
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:46,927
"But you're the only one I trust."

2353
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,968
"You told me I was cheeky."

2354
01:22:49,668 --> 01:22:51,128
"You told me I was cheeky."

2355
01:22:51,768 --> 01:22:52,797
Is it correct?

2356
01:22:52,798 --> 01:22:54,297
Go ahead and tell him.

2357
01:22:54,298 --> 01:22:55,837
"I was cheeky" is incorrect.

2358
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:57,567
- Really? - Yes.

2359
01:22:57,568 --> 01:22:58,877
("I was cheeky" is incorrect?)

2360
01:22:58,878 --> 01:22:59,938
The answer is...

2361
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:01,747
"I was cheeky."

2362
01:23:01,748 --> 01:23:03,978
Really?

2363
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:05,777
(The unexpected result leaves Hyuk incredulous.)

2364
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:07,017
Hyuk.

2365
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:08,817
- Hyuk, stop it. It isn't funny. - Seriously.

2366
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:10,948
You fooled me repeatedly.

2367
01:23:10,988 --> 01:23:12,357
As soon as he said it...

2368
01:23:12,358 --> 01:23:13,557
What was the answer you had in mind?

2369
01:23:13,558 --> 01:23:14,627
(What was the answer Hyuk had in mind?)

2370
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:15,687
"I was cold."

2371
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:17,287
"I was cold."

2372
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:18,297
"I was cold."

2373
01:23:18,298 --> 01:23:19,797
"I was cold."

2374
01:23:19,798 --> 01:23:22,428
I think you should just answer the question.

2375
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:25,038
I can't believe Hyuk.

2376
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:26,898
It's Cha Tae Hyun versus Shin Seung Ho.

2377
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:29,838
- Neither has taken a penalty. - Seriously.

2378
01:23:30,608 --> 01:23:32,237
It'll be the first time for either one of them.

2379
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:34,747
(1 of the 2 will receive his 1st penalty!)

2380
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:35,908
The last question of the day.

2381
01:23:36,548 --> 01:23:40,578
- Okay. - A traditional French baguette...

2382
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:44,688
must only contain four ingredients...

2383
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:47,858
as per the Bread Decree that was passed in 1993.

2384
01:23:48,088 --> 01:23:49,328
Flour,

2385
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:50,788
water,

2386
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:52,358
and yeast.

2387
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:55,198
What's the one last ingredient?

2388
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,827
Let me answer. Salt.

2389
01:23:57,828 --> 01:23:59,038
Correct.

2390
01:23:59,538 --> 01:24:01,298
(My goodness)

2391
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:03,667
Salt?

2392
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:04,938
(He got the answer right away.)

2393
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:06,638
He survived.

2394
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,777
- Finally. - Seriously.

2395
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:10,478
(The individual match is finally over.)

2396
01:24:11,148 --> 01:24:12,618
(Feeling unsure)

2397
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,388
I lost for real.

2398
01:24:15,448 --> 01:24:16,517
You did that.

2399
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:17,987
I lost for real.

2400
01:24:17,988 --> 01:24:19,658
I didn't do it on purpose.

2401
01:24:19,718 --> 01:24:20,918
It was fair play.

2402
01:24:21,018 --> 01:24:23,227
- Thank you for your hard work. - May I say...

2403
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,897
- a few words to Tae Hyun? - Okay.

2404
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,058
That sounds good.

2405
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:28,528
Tae Hyun,

2406
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,998
I did my absolute best.

2407
01:24:31,398 --> 01:24:33,538
Upon coming here,

2408
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:36,307
I told the members that you were behind me...

2409
01:24:36,308 --> 01:24:37,937
in order to cheer up the team.

2410
01:24:37,938 --> 01:24:39,807
But I didn't even have...

2411
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,477
an inkling of desire...

2412
01:24:41,478 --> 01:24:43,478
to give you the penalty.

2413
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:45,178
Until the end...

2414
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:47,318
Until the very end, I did my best.

2415
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,148
Tae Hyun, please remember that.

2416
01:24:49,748 --> 01:24:50,987
I love you, my friend.

2417
01:24:50,988 --> 01:24:52,188
(A heartwarming ending)

2418
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:54,318
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2419
01:24:55,928 --> 01:24:57,928
(The next day)

2420
01:24:58,328 --> 01:24:59,657
(H Bakery in Gunsan)

2421
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:01,897
My goodness. Hello.

2422
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:03,697
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

2423
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,337
(Tae Hyun appears at the location of the penalty.)

2424
01:25:05,338 --> 01:25:06,997
- It's nice to meet you. - Yes.

2425
01:25:06,998 --> 01:25:10,137
- I came instead of Jang Hyuk. - Okay.

2426
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:13,108
I knew that someone would come for the penalty.

2427
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:14,577
But you weren't here.

2428
01:25:14,578 --> 01:25:15,907
It happened that way.

2429
01:25:15,908 --> 01:25:17,407
What should I do to help?

2430
01:25:17,408 --> 01:25:20,347
We'll make castella with rice.

2431
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:23,648
The rice flour is the most important.

2432
01:25:23,688 --> 01:25:25,157
Please add the eggs.

2433
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:26,557
- All of them? - Yes.

2434
01:25:26,558 --> 01:25:28,427
Add about 2-3rd of them.

2435
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:29,888
I'm a bit nervous.

2436
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:32,127
Do it slowly.

2437
01:25:32,128 --> 01:25:33,257
(He moves cautiously since it's his first time baking.)

2438
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:34,457
Add them.

2439
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:36,597
Mix them gently in the middle...

2440
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:37,928
so that it doesn't come out.

2441
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:39,468
Yes. Do it gently.

2442
01:25:39,498 --> 01:25:41,807
- It's stiff, right? - It's pretty hard.

2443
01:25:41,808 --> 01:25:42,838
Yes.

2444
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:45,008
- I need to break them. - Yes.

2445
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,877
Doing this makes your arms strong.

2446
01:25:48,878 --> 01:25:50,047
That might be true,

2447
01:25:50,048 --> 01:25:52,329
but you'd need strong arms to do this in the first place.

2448
01:25:53,048 --> 01:25:56,448
(Unlike its graceful image, baking needs a lot of stamina!)

2449
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,657
You must work here for 16 hours.

2450
01:26:00,658 --> 01:26:02,158
You'll get just four hours of sleep.

2451
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:06,357
But I still manage to get 6 to 7 hours of sleep.

2452
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:08,058
How is that possible?

2453
01:26:08,268 --> 01:26:10,028
(You can sleep early.)

2454
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:13,038
(Next is the kneading machine.)

2455
01:26:13,138 --> 01:26:15,408
It would be too hard for people to do this.

2456
01:26:15,908 --> 01:26:18,307
Right. You can feel more strength than earlier, right?

2457
01:26:18,308 --> 01:26:20,538
- Yes. - It becomes much softer.

2458
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:22,047
Right.

2459
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:25,177
(The next process is...)

2460
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:27,177
- I'll put it in now. - Right.

2461
01:26:27,178 --> 01:26:28,387
(It's time to put the batter into the piping bag.)

2462
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:29,418
Right.

2463
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:32,117
(Spilling)

2464
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:33,157
Oh, gosh!

2465
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:34,887
(We were wondering why he wasn't making any mistakes.)

2466
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:36,528
- All of it is spilling! - Gosh!

2467
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:38,628
Push it with your right hand.

2468
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,527
It comes out when you press it.

2469
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,528
That's when you grab it with your left hand.

2470
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,567
Right.

2471
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:44,667
You have to fill 80 to 90 percent of it.

2472
01:26:44,668 --> 01:26:46,768
I'll do it separately.

2473
01:26:46,898 --> 01:26:47,968
Okay.

2474
01:26:48,408 --> 01:26:50,237
- To the customers, - Yes?

2475
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:52,037
You should sell it at least 10 cents cheaper.

2476
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:53,708
It will look terrible.

2477
01:26:53,938 --> 01:26:55,608
- Right. - Gosh.

2478
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:57,607
(Squeezing a small amount)

2479
01:26:57,608 --> 01:26:58,678
Why is it...

2480
01:26:58,818 --> 01:27:00,277
You have to use a lot of strength with your right hand.

2481
01:27:00,278 --> 01:27:02,018
- I have to press it? - Yes.

2482
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:03,218
Stop!

2483
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,419
- Then hold it with your left hand. - Around this much?

2484
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:07,088
Yes.

2485
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:13,198
(His teacher is making a lot of progress.)

2486
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,768
I've only been at the counter when running a business.

2487
01:27:17,628 --> 01:27:18,797
This requires skill.

2488
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:21,037
I can't squeeze it at once like you.

2489
01:27:21,038 --> 01:27:22,444
Gosh, too much has gone in for this one.

2490
01:27:22,468 --> 01:27:24,007
They have to be equal.

2491
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:26,237
I don't think we can sell these at the same price.

2492
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:27,907
I don't think I can squeeze them equally.

2493
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:29,477
They're all different.

2494
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,507
(Too little or too much)

2495
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:31,847
I was going to sell them at a more expensive price...

2496
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:33,517
as you were making them.

2497
01:27:33,518 --> 01:27:35,564
But I think I should sell them with a 30-percent discount.

2498
01:27:35,588 --> 01:27:39,158
I added more earlier. Why does it look like so little?

2499
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:42,327
(It's time to bake them in the oven next!)

2500
01:27:42,328 --> 01:27:44,128
- Just two trays go in? - Right.

2501
01:27:44,358 --> 01:27:45,857
- Push them until the end. - Until the end.

2502
01:27:45,858 --> 01:27:47,228
- There you go. - Okay.

2503
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:48,997
You can press "start."

2504
01:27:48,998 --> 01:27:50,368
- For 15 minutes. - Right.

2505
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:54,138
They will be done after being baked for 15 minutes.

2506
01:27:54,338 --> 01:27:56,268
They will get baked.

2507
01:27:58,578 --> 01:28:00,307
(The baked castella cakes are taken out of the mold to be sold.)

2508
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,588
You can take them out like this.

2509
01:28:02,308 --> 01:28:04,508
These are the ones you made.

2510
01:28:05,318 --> 01:28:06,318
- Right? - What?

2511
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:07,818
- These are the ones I made. - Right.

2512
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,587
- They look quite equal. - Right.

2513
01:28:10,588 --> 01:28:11,588
Yes.

2514
01:28:11,888 --> 01:28:14,158
- They look equal after being baked. - Right.

2515
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,457
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2516
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,457
(There are early customers at 7:30am!)

2517
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,598
They're already here?

2518
01:28:20,558 --> 01:28:22,318
They are asking about when it will come out.

2519
01:28:22,368 --> 01:28:23,698
What are they looking for?

2520
01:28:24,028 --> 01:28:25,238
Which one?

2521
01:28:25,468 --> 01:28:26,797
The brown rice castella.

2522
01:28:26,798 --> 01:28:27,798
Right.

2523
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:29,438
We have customers?

2524
01:28:30,468 --> 01:28:32,707
(The first batch is all packed.)

2525
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:35,248
- I made these in the morning. - Right.

2526
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,508
- I'll have one. - I didn't do much though.

2527
01:28:38,148 --> 01:28:40,317
- I'm enjoying Handsome Guys. - Thank you.

2528
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,517
- Gosh. - I'm a fan.

2529
01:28:41,518 --> 01:28:43,318
I made all of these.

2530
01:28:44,448 --> 01:28:46,717
- The castella. - Ten pieces of castella.

2531
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:48,018
- Right. - Right.

2532
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:49,757
Done.

2533
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:50,827
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2534
01:28:50,828 --> 01:28:51,828
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

2535
01:28:51,829 --> 01:28:53,958
- Thank you. - Enjoy the castella.

2536
01:28:54,728 --> 01:28:56,328
I'm going to get you, Hyuk.

2537
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,297
I don't know what show you're in,

2538
01:28:58,298 --> 01:29:00,638
but I'll go there and ruin everything.

2539
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:04,568
I'm going to get you.

2540
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:07,334
(A middle-aged man...)

2541
01:29:07,335 --> 01:29:09,005
(has appeared for Handsome Guys?)

2542
01:29:09,205 --> 01:29:11,234
(Dong Hyun's 1-day replacement)

2543
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:12,821
(The return of the hot middle-aged man, Choo Sung Hoon)

2544
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:14,544
(Disappointed)

2545
01:29:14,545 --> 01:29:16,374
(Firm)

2546
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,714
- Hello. - Hello.

2547
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:20,415
(Today's real guest)

2548
01:29:20,615 --> 01:29:22,314
(The man from "My Dearest Nemesis," Kwak Si Yang)

2549
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:23,685
(How much do you eat, Si Yang?)

2550
01:29:23,915 --> 01:29:26,585
(Perfect for the big eater guest!)

2551
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:29,195
(The theme of this race)

2552
01:29:29,455 --> 01:29:30,494
What?

2553
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:32,095
(Gangwon Province, Noodle Road)

2554
01:29:32,725 --> 01:29:34,695
(Slurping)

2555
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,194
(Various noodle dishes...)

2556
01:29:37,195 --> 01:29:39,534
(are going to be eaten!)

2557
01:29:39,535 --> 01:29:40,965
(This isn't the menu.)

2558
01:29:41,165 --> 01:29:43,105
(The bingo board becomes a menu again?)

2559
01:29:43,435 --> 01:29:46,205
(Handsome Guys is great.)

2560
01:29:46,405 --> 01:29:47,805
(Today's weather is amazing!)

2561
01:29:49,315 --> 01:29:51,945
(We'll learn once we get kicked out after getting it wrong.)

2562
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,715
(Those who have eaten, exercise!)

2563
01:29:53,845 --> 01:29:54,845
(That's an eyesore.)

2564
01:29:55,085 --> 01:29:56,515
(Feeling upset)

2565
01:29:57,385 --> 01:30:00,985
(The missions aren't easy again.)

2566
01:30:01,255 --> 01:30:02,255
(Tired)

2567
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:03,624
(To win, )

2568
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,824
(all ways and means are used!)

2569
01:30:05,825 --> 01:30:08,894
(Next week will be a mixture...)

2570
01:30:08,895 --> 01:30:10,795
(of paradise and the underworld.)

2571
01:30:11,565 --> 01:30:13,011
(Please come and watch.)
