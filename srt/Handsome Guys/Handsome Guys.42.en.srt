00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,859
(The guys look quite handsome in suits.)

3
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,498
(Nothing seems to be in shortage.)

4
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,368

9
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,779
(to dress up like this.)

10
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,749
(That's way too intense.)

11
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,519
(Their sense of fashion is completely taken away.)

12
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,549
(The more the shortage, the more embarrassing it gets.)

13
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,348

14
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:01,859

(We have to go to the broadcasting station while looking like this?)

18
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,699
(It's bad manners.)

19
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,728
(And so, we prepared this.)

20
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,409
(A chance to buy a top or a pair of pants)

21
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,609

(Followed by the main event)

31
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:44,729
(A meeting with the chief director)

32
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:47,329
(A very embarrassing first meeting)

33
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:48,968
(Dong Hyun's low kicks)

34
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,039

(Viewership, go up!)

36
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,539
(Thanks to the chief director who sacrificed himself,)

37
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,209
(the meeting ends with an abundance of viewership.)

38
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,149

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,658

42
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,158
(nothing would...)

43
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,458
(stop...)

44
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,759
(Handsome Guys.)

45
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,099

(The last chance to make a goal and determine the winner)

54
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,659
(It's blocked.)

55
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,129
(Sang Uk and Tae Hyun win.)

56
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,359
(To decide the final ranking, they must build a cookie tower.)

57
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:53,268

58
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,469

(He easily succeeds consecutively.)

61
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,709
(I can't let him win.)

62
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,539
(I'll do it with my left hand.)

63
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,779
(Tricking the low frequency)

64
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,449
(However)

65
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,219
(Sang Uk loses despite his cheating.)

66
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,418
(Tae Hyun places 1st.)

67
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,419

(Shall we move on to the next item on the schedule?)

72
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,728
(They go shopping for the game prize...)

73
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,439
(before their club activity.)

74
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,698
(The streets in Hongdae get crowded in the evening.)

75
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,909
It's so crowded here.

76
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:35,778
- I mean...
- Is it here? It's huge.

77
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,208
Go in as quickly as possible.

78
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,079
Run.

79
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,818
Tae Hyun, you said that you weren't embarrassed.

80
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,918
You said that you got used to it. What's wrong?

81
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,249
- Where is it?
- You said that you got used to it.

82
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,288
Good for you.

83
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,719
(Whining)

84
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,128
This is nice.

85
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,628
(Tae Hyun: 1 set of top and bottom each)

86
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,129
(Sang Uk: Either 1 set of top or bottom)

87
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:57,628
I really need a pair of pants.

88
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,399
- I can't go around like this.
- Gosh.

89
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,239
I should buy these pants. These are nice.

90
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,539
It must be so nice to shop here.

91
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,079
- The length...
- I should stay in the car instead.

92
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,439
Why am I even here?

93
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,508
These are the best for pajamas.

94
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:12,509
(Sighing)

95
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:16,219
I don't have time to look at pants.

96
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,519
I don't have time for this.

97
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,289
I need to pick something fast.

98
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,859
It's so crowded.

99
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,718
I know. We have to leave soon.

100
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,129
These are huge.

101
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,058
This one looks good.

102
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,129
(Contrary to his words, his hands move cautiously.)

103
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,928
(Thinking)

104
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:32,969
I need something...

105
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,699
that I can wear later.

106
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,039
(Surprised)

107
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,769
This one looks good.

108
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,979
(Trying it on hastily)

109
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,249
I need to hurry and put on some pants.

110
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,678
What I'm wearing at the bottom stands out even more.

111
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,878
(With the new top, his shorts stand out more.)

112
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,488
I need to change the bottom.

113
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,148
It stands out too much.

114
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,519
- It looks good on you.
- Tae Hyun.

115
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,888
I'm not used to wearing these colors.

116
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,589
When would I wear a color like this?

117
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,989
- This color is the best.
- Which one?

118
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,098
This color.

119
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,928
It matches you perfectly right now.

120
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,169
(Recommending tone-on-tone for his outfit)

121
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,068
This color reminds me...

122
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,669
It's over there.

123
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,609
- Follow me.
- I have to pick out mine.

124
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,369
What do you think about this?

125
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:15,978
I saw this a moment ago.

126
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,109
This looks much better.

127
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,579
- Good.
- A baseball jacket.

128
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,249
It looks good on you.

129
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,818
- With this jacket...
- And those pants?

130
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,748
- Those pants with a similar color?
- Good.

131
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,749
Yes, that's good.

132
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,819
- Tae Hyun, you look good.
- I picked these two.

133
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,889
- Is it good? Do they match?
- It looks great.

134
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,958
Do they match?

135
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,959
(Jealous)

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,229
It's too close to the Hongdae style.

137
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:37,228
- You look great, Tae Hyun.
- Right.

138
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,829
(Tae Hyun makes his final decision.)

139
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,269
Yes, I'll go with this look.

140
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,638
(Sang Uk, on the other hand)

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,509
I don't have time to look at tops.

142
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:48,779
Come to your senses.

143
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,879
The waist is too small.

144
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,909
No.

145
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,318
(Tall Sang Uk has a hard time finding pants that fit him.)

146
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,248
I have to look at the length before buying.

147
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,819
Do you see the longest pants?

148
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,558
Grab it. Is this it?

149
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,719
(1. Pick the pants with the longest bottom.)

150
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,089
Then look at the design.

151
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:07,829
I just picked them out a moment ago.

152
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,699
Just buy a top instead.

153
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,898
- These are nice.
- I don't usually wear shorts.

154
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,899
(Hesitant)

155
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,729
You should be happy to wear pants with pockets.

156
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:16,639
It's a luxury.

157
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,109
(Looking around)

158
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,369
Sang Uk, take a look at some hats.

159
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,108
(Hats?)

160
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,309
Take a look at some hats.

161
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,808
Should I cover my face with a hat instead?

162
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:28,818
Get a hat.

163
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:30,079
- Instead of pants?
- Yes.

164
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,089
- Get a hat.
- That's not a bad idea.

165
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,489
I should get a hat instead.

166
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,319
Getting a hat is better.

167
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:38,989
That looks nice.

168
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,659
- You look nice.
- It looks good.

169
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,858
(If I can't buy anything,)

170
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,129
(I'll ruin you.)

171
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,528
The denim ones are nice too.

172
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,569
It looks good on you.

173
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,938
- Are you looking at hats?
- That one is nice.

174
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,838
- Are you giving up on pants?
- It's better to cover your face.

175
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,768
- I take a long time to shop.
- Get a hat.

176
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,509
Something like this?

177
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,709
Anything works.

178
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,208
- It looks good on you.
- Does it?

179
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,748
If I like it, I'll get this one.

180
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,779
(He fell for it.)

181
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,879
(Do I look okay?)

182
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,048
(That's awesome, Sang Uk.)

183
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,089
It looks awesome.

184
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,088
I'll get this one.

185
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,659
(A mint-colored hat)

186
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,388
He actually picked out a hat.

187
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,889
I can't believe it.

188
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,058
(Beaming)

189
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,059
- Okay.
- Okay, he picked one out.

190
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,528
Did you end up choosing a hat?

191
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:21,939
- A hat.
- Goodness.

192
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,068
A bag is ten cents. Would you like one?

193
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,569
- We don't need a bag.
- We'll put them on right away.

194
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,108
Please take off all the tags.

195
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:27,339
(Snap)

196
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:29,178
Thank you.

197
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,079
(He finishes paying.)

198
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,808
(Let's learn how to put on a mint hat.)

199
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:35,619
After turning, when I lower my head 45°...

200
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:38,518
That's a good idea.

201
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,949
(It's possible to camouflage the face completely.)

202
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,459
See that? No one is looking at me.

203
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,118
I don't stand out in Hongdae.

204
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,229
(His confidence shoots up with a hat.)

205
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,189
Thank you so much.

206
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,758
- He's brilliant.
- He really chose a hat.

207
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,899
He's very brilliant.

208
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,338
It's amazing to have pockets.

209
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,269
- Without pockets, I keep it here.
- With pockets...

210
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,939
I keep it in here.

211
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,278
- Gosh.
- That's an idea.

212
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,709
- I never thought of that.
- It's comfortable.

213
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:05,478
This is great.

214
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,208
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

215
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,549
(The satisfying shopping for everyone is over.)

216
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,718
(Sang Uk, a white short-sleeved t-shirt and pajama bottoms)

217
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,919
(Hat as a new accessory)

218
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,188
(Tae Hyun, a white short-sleeved t-shirt and pajama bottoms)

219
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,489
(Brown jacket on top and beige pants at the bottom)

220
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,229
Okay, let's go.

221
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:20,928
I'm so embarrassed.

222
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,899
(Team Bowling Alley, on the other hand)

223
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,599
We're entering straight into the bowling alley.

224
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,029
We just got out of the elevator.

225
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,998
(A huge bowling alley)

226
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,498
(From families...)

227
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,669
(to students)

228
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,039
(The large bowling alley is filled with customers.)

229
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,479
Gosh.

230
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,179
(Chuckling)

231
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,519
Why is it so crowded here?

232
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,289
Where should we go?

233
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,218
(The club is at the end of the other side.)

234
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,818
Hello, everyone.

235
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,428
(They cross the bowling alley.)

236
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,028
- Hello.
- You look handsome.

237
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,099
Thank you.

238
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,728
(Giggling)

239
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:57,729
While saying that we're handsome,

240
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,129
she was looking at your shorts.

241
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,999
(Funny)

242
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,339
Hello.

243
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,439
(At the end of the intense bowling alley runway)

244
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,438
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,908
If it's all men,

246
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,149
it won't be embarrassing.

247
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,849
- I apologize for my outfit.
- His outfit is...

248
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,848
I had no choice.

249
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,449
These are all I had.

250
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,919
I got these jeans somehow.

251
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,658
(That's a relief.)

252
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,759
How long have you been bowling?

253
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,629
I've been bowling for ten years.

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,089
Ten years?

255
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,958
How long has it been?

256
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,629
- It's been twenty years.
- Twenty years?

257
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:33,868
I've been bowling since I was 14.

258
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,138
(A match against these people?)

259
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,369
How long have you been bowling?

260
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,138
It's close to being zero.

261
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,839
I only know how to roll the ball.

262
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,079
Once my ball rolled over to the next lane.

263
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:44,809
It's my first time this year.

264
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,749
Would it be possible for us to join you?

265
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,319
Of course.

266
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,088
We'll play against two of you...

267
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,588
as the main match.

268
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:54,648
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

269
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,489
What do you usually wager when bowling?

270
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,989
What about a pair of pants that you don't wear anymore?

271
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,629
Do you have anything I can put on?

272
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,869
(Are you thinking of wagering me?)

273
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:08,398
- How about some beverage?
- A beverage as an easy bet?

274
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,738
- Beverage?
- Yes.

275
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,638
Since we're likely to lose, we'll buy them beverages.

276
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,738
That sounds good.

277
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,638
When there's a big difference in experience,

278
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,908
is there any advantage for the underdog?

279
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,078
About 50 points per person.

280
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,179
- Fifty points per person?
- Hundred points?

281
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,178
- Let's do it.
- Shall we? We'll try it.

282
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,578
Let's do it. We look forward to playing with you.

283
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:27,319
(Handsome Guys versus the club members' game starts.)

284
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,918
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- We can do it.

285
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,419
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

286
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,729
- I'll play first.
- Okay.

287
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,698
- That's his personal ball.
- Yes.

288
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:36,798
(He starts with his personal ball.)

289
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,729
(How will his first throw go?)

290
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,769
He didn't throw it straight.

291
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,338
(How could this happen in the first frame?)

292
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:47,968
Excuse me, but are you on the national team?

293
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,139
No, I'm not.

294
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,438
Is this possible?

295
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,178
(Speechless)

296
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,448
Go easy and show them.

297
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:56,249
(Next up is Seung Ho with 0 years of experience.)

298
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,949
Look at the ball first.

299
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,319
(Shocked)

300
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,459
Did you look? Okay.

301
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,388
(He picks the ball chosen by Utan.)

302
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,159
- Seriously...
- Look. Where will you throw?

303
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,558
(Navigation is starting.)

304
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,559
Okay.

305
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:12,799
You can do it.

306
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:14,868
(Seung Ho's throw under pressure)

307
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,169
That looks good.

308
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,639
(It's definitely straight.)

309
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,409
(Strike)

310
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,639
What?

311
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,808
(Utan picked the perfect route.)

312
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:26,909
What?

313
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,578
(Stunned)

314
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,779
- What was that?
- Gosh.

315
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:31,989
Thank you.

316
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,348
- Hey.
- What?

317
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,389
What just happened?

318
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:35,919
What was that about?

319
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,828
It's not easy for a beginner to throw it like that, right?

320
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,428
He seems quite athletic.

321
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,599
- He kept it in the middle.
- Yes.

322
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,298
Is this possible?

323
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,298
(The member with 1-year experience)

324
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,199
(He knocks them down neatly with a spare.)

325
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:49,868
That was nice and clean.

326
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:50,938
(Impressed)

327
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:54,009
I'll show you how an ordinary person does it. Seung Ho did too well.

328
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,909
I used all my luck on it.

329
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,608
Keep it in the middle.

330
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,409
(Yi Kyung throws the ball with energy from Utan.)

331
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,758
(Strike)

332
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,788
What?

333
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,758
(This is unbelievable.)

334
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,859
- What was that?
- What?

335
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,289
Something strange is happening.

336
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,159
Is this a prank or something?

337
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,829
Is someone controlling them?

338
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,098
- Are they being controlled?
- They're easy to knock down.

339
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,829
The score is tied.

340
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,568
What's going on here?

341
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:24,669
How is this possible?

342
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,808
Yi Kyung, let's try to remember this score.

343
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,838
It's over now.

344
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,638
(It's our first and last time.)

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,738
What...

346
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,209
(However...)

347
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:34,509
You got it.

348
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:38,379
What?

349
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,119
Isn't this a prank?

350
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,518
(Seung Ho with 0 years of experience)

351
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,218
(He also gets a spare.)

352
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,258
(Yes!)

353
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,899
- You're good at it.
- Yi Kyung.

354
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,229
(Followed by a throw with 10 years of experience)

355
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,699
(What?)

356
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,669
(Disappointed)

357
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:01,908
(The other club member)

358
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:03,238
This one too? Seriously?

359
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,879
(He fails to get a spare.)

360
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:06,708
(Crying)

361
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,979
- It's okay.
- That was good.

362
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,349
- Yi Kyung, we have a chance.
- It's not bad.

363
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,919
It's worth trying.

364
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,058
Because we're playing so well,

365
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,159
they got nervous.

366
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:20,958
Since I'm playing while looking at the orangutan...

367
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,499
Don't ever make eye contact with him.

368
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,059
There's depth in his gaze.

369
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,069
(Difficult eye contact with Utan)

370
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,369
Let's go, Utan.

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,869
(Making sounds)

372
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,409
We got it.

373
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,879
- We got it.
- What's happening here?

374
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,779
Isn't this a camera prank?

375
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,549
Is someone controlling them?

376
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,319
(Followed by Yi Kyung's throw)

377
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,549
- It went too far. What?
- Gosh.

378
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:49,158
- It went too far. What?
- Gosh.

379
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,918
(A miraculous play where a lost ball is saved)

380
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,589
- What is it?
- It popped up.

381
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,658
It fell and came back up.

382
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,958
(A master of petty tricks, Lee Yi Kyung)

383
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,129
(The club members become careful under pressure.)

384
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,399
(The striker of 10 years returns.)

385
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:04,568
(Followed by a spare)

386
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,938
(A perfect finish)

387
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:09,439
(With momentum of the members who got their poses back)

388
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,938
It's as good as winning.

389
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:13,309
(The last frame with a difference of 41 points)

390
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,118
(The last ball of a member with 10 years of experience)

391
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,119
It's going in.

392
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,719
(9 points)

393
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,588
(The other member earns...)

394
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:24,658
(8 points.)

395
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,659
All right.

396
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,688
(Finishing the frame with uncertainty)

397
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,189
- Let's go.
- Good job.

398
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,699
Yi Kyung, if you do well, you could win first place.

399
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,869
I could win first place.

400
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,398
You can win 1st place with 9 points.

401
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,468
(If Yi Kyung earns 9 points, he'll tie with 1st place.)

402
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:40,039
(Feeling pressured)

403
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:41,738
I'll give it a try.

404
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:42,779
(Anxious)

405
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,948
(What will be the result of Yi Kyung's last ball?)

406
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,079
He got it.

407
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,449
(He earns exactly 9 points.)

408
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,689
(Yi Kyung and the one with 10 years of experience tied in 1st place.)

409
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,618
(Dispirited)

410
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:01,158
(Seung Ho's ball)

411
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,298
Yes.

412
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,029
(It also carries out its role.)

413
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:05,258
(A perfect finish)

414
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,599
- You're good at it.
- Yi Kyung.

415
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,928
You're good at it.

416
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,438
(The game is over.)

417
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:13,039
We got 265 points. They got 298 points.

418
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,509
As they gave us more advantage than expected,

419
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,149
- with the score of 365 points...
- We lost.

420
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,049
(Giving them credit)

421
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,948
We can't have them buy us drinks.

422
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,149
We'll treat them instead.

423
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,818
- Come with us.
- You can also pick what you want.

424
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:28,889
(Yi Kyung and Seung Ho decide to treat them to beverages.)

425
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:30,758
(While they leave to buy beverages)

426
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,859
All right.

427
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,159
It's different...

428
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,958
when you bowl while looking at the orangutan.

429
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,228
I couldn't help but make eye contact with it.

430
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,559
(They clearly lost because of Utan.)

431
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,429
(Blowing)

432
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,569
- I look forward to playing.
- Thank you for the drink.

433
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,299
You gave us 100 points again, but we lost.

434
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,108
- Well done.
- Thank you.

435
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,368
We learned a lot from you.

436
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:49,378
(Their club activity is over as they pay for the game.)

437
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,809
This is the place. "Flower."

438
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,349
Is this it?

439
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,108
(Filled with flowers of every shape and color)

440
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,718
(Handling the flowers)

441
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,988
It's okay.

442
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,118
(It's crowded with club members.)

443
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,188
It's okay.

444
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,318
(They enter right away.)

445
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,029
Hello.

446
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,588
- Hello.
- Hello.

447
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:09,799
(The reason why they're so surprised)

448
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:13,399
- It's so bright in here.
- Goodness.

449
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,199
It doesn't matter to me.

450
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,768
(He's the problem.)

451
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,338
His outfit...

452
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,739
(His outfit is flustering for their first meeting.)

453
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:22,038
(Stiff)

454
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,109
Goodness.

455
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,478
- Hello.
- Today, we are...

456
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,508
(My goodness)

457
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:28,679
All of our clothes were...

458
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,318
taken away.

459
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,418
(All of our clothes were taken away.)

460
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,419
- I...
- But you look nice.

461
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,448
I just got some clothes a moment ago.

462
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:35,588
I see.

463
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,659
Between me and Sang Uk,

464
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,198
- whose style is more unique?
- Which is better?

465
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,528
Which one is more unique?

466
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,299
- Including our shoes and his hat.
- Including my hat.

467
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,798
Don't judge our faces.

468
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,799
(Anxious)

469
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,008
Judge our outfits only.

470
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,508
They're looking at my hat.

471
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,738
Just his hat and our clothes.

472
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:58,638
- His is unique.
- Is it unique?

473
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,778
What do you mean by "unique?"

474
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,449
He asked us to pick the unique outfit.

475
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:02,948
(His uniqueness makes him lower his face.)

476
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,219
Do you not like it?

477
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,689
Where should we sit?

478
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,919
Take the empty seats.

479
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,919
By the way...

480
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:12,559
- You should sit together.
- Really?

481
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,128
I'll sit here.

482
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,858
(The unique outfit brothers sit next to each other.)

483
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,728
Are you all friends?

484
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:20,098
- We're coworkers.
- You work at the same company?

485
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,338
- It's a club at work.
- I see.

486
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,038
What kind of company do you work for?

487
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,638
- It's a fashion company.
- A fashion company?

488
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,869
Fashion design?

489
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,538
You work in fashion, and you say that his outfit is unique.

490
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,709
It's a positive comment.

491
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:32,948
They work at a fashion company.

492
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,309
(The mint hermit crab lowers his head.)

493
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,418
Ma'am, what should we start with?

494
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,289
I can tell that it's a centerpiece.

495
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,289
You're making a centerpiece, right?

496
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,759
I've done it before.

497
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,719
- Flower arrangement?
- I've done flower arrangements.

498
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:48,158
To start with, please pick up the hydrangea.

499
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,499
Hydrangea? This is a hydrangea.

500
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,728
Stick it...

501
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,568
so that it's at the same level or lower than the frill.

502
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:56,569
Okay.

503
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:00,508
(Experienced Dong Hyun does it quite well.)

504
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,739
I got it.

505
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:03,479
Did I cut too much of it?

506
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,039
No, you did well.

507
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,509
(Best Pupil Tae Hyun catches on quickly.)

508
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,148
Be careful of your hand.

509
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,248
(Glancing)

510
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,078
Yours is too long.

511
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,418
(Beginner Sang Uk is proceeding under the instructor's care.)

512
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:15,989
(Glancing)

513
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,759
It's too long.

514
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,688
It's not your first time today, is it?

515
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,629
- What?
- You said that this was a club.

516
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,028
How many times have you done it?

517
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,298
Is this all a lie?

518
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,928
I've done it only once a month.

519
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,498
You're a beginner just like us.

520
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,599
I thought that you were experienced.

521
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,099
Give it a try.

522
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:34,468
It's hard to follow the instructor's details.

523
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,479
(Instructor...)

524
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,048
Is it your first time today?

525
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,049
(She has to be a beginner.)

526
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,148
Be honest.

527
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,049
I'm not very artistic.

528
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,288
Are you cutting these to make wraps later?

529
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:48,648
Are these for your bibimbap?

530
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,718
(She's sitting next to the wrong person today.)

531
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,419
- I'm sorry.
- "Bibimbap?"

532
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,359
You cut so many of them. Okay.

533
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,299
(Approaching quietly)

534
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:58,859
You did well.

535
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,468
- What's your name?
- It's Soo Yeon.

536
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:03,169
Soo Yeon started being cautious around me.

537
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:04,768
That's not good.

538
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,038
I only looked at her, but it made her cautious.

539
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,709
(The experienced one is preying on beginners.)

540
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,779
(At that time, someone is quiet.)

541
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:21,519
(The hermit crab hides more and more inside his hat quietly.)

542
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,859
Sang Uk, can you raise your hat a little?

543
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,128
We can't see your face.

544
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,529
That's why I bought it.

545
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,859
- I bought it to cover my face.
- That's why he bought it.

546
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,269
You don't mind when it's just us, do you?

547
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,769
Just us? We're with other people now.

548
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,939
- They're part of us now.
- I see.

549
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,609
We're acquainted with each other.

550
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,708
Have you watched...

551
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:45,039
Handsome Guys?

552
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,308
- Yes.
- Have you?

553
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,178
- I saw many of your YouTube clips.
- Clips?

554
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:51,519
Like a clip that we made with the marketing team.

555
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:53,918
Is there any member that you watched carefully?

556
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,389
- Yes, you.
- What?

557
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:58,889
What about him do you remember the most?

558
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:02,629
I like how honest you are all the time.

559
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,429
What about other people?

560
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,228
Is there a member you like?

561
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:07,499
I'm your fan.

562
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:09,738
My mother is a huge fan.

563
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,598
I'm also a big fan.

564
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,068
- Of mine?
- Seriously.

565
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,108
(Instantly, Tae Hyun earned 3 votes.)

566
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,679
When I was wearing underwear,

567
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,849
no one voted for me.

568
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:23,548
When I was wearing a pair of briefs.

569
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:24,848
Goodness.

570
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,319
I must look different because I'm dressed.

571
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,918
How you dress is important.

572
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,318
Without his clothes,

573
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,129
he looks totally shabby.

574
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,758
Someone like Sang Uk without clothes...

575
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,929
must look completely shabby.

576
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,928
What about the rest of you?

577
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,028
(Whom will the remaining two pick?)

578
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:42,128
That's right.

579
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,139
Really? Thank you.

580
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:47,269
(Only one person remains.)

581
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,209
Can you just say that you're my fan?

582
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,338
No, be honest.

583
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:55,148
- I'm losing a lot of confidence...
- No.

584
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,848
in the hat I bought.

585
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,579
You have to be honest.

586
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,148
To be really honest...

587
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:01,218
Yes, be honest.

588
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,248
(Where is the last vote pointing at?)

589
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:03,419
Yes, be honest.

590
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,358
- Gosh, this is...
- Thank you.

591
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,429
It's all about clothes.

592
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,259
(Darn it)

593
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,728
Since she works in fashion,

594
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,069
clothes stand out to her.

595
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,799
Usually, Sang Uk is very popular.

596
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,739
- Isn't it because of his outfit?
- Right.

597
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,508
What should he do?

598
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:22,068
- Could you give him advice?
- To be honest...

599
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,778
Take off your hat and compete...

600
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,408
- His face looks better.
- with your face.

601
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,608
- Right.
- That's better.

602
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:27,978
- Take off your hat now.
- If you were...

603
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,618
wearing this outfit,

604
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,918
would you be able to take off your hat?

605
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,518
(Shaking her head)

606
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,848
That's my answer.

607
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,019
That's also true.

608
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,658
That's also true, isn't it?

609
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:37,718
(In that case, I can understand.)

610
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,329
When we got to the shoot today,

611
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,759
we were wearing suits.

612
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,629
We walked on the red carpet.

613
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,228
It was during the opening segment.

614
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:49,168
After that, they took off all our clothes.

615
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,999
They took away all of our clothes.

616
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,808
Do you know what's shocking?

617
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,669
We have a fan sign meeting tomorrow at 12pm.

618
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,379
- In these outfits.
- In those outfits?

619
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,709
They have to go there while looking like this.

620
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,648
Going there tomorrow in these outfits...

621
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:02,979
will kill them.

622
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,049
Is it in progress?

623
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,478
- It's continuing.
- We don't know what will happen.

624
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,548
To earn clothes,

625
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,889
- we keep playing games.
- They haven't told us.

626
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,659
Once you're done,

627
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,828
shape the wrinkled frills...

628
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,798
and the flowers so that they match each other.

629
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,898
- You may carry them in the bag.
- Okay.

630
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:21,599
Then you're done.

631
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:24,169
It looks beautiful. I can take it home.

632
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,268
(A beautiful bouquet of flowers)

633
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:26,568
- It looks pretty.
- Isn't it nice?

634
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,839
- You can give it as a present.
- It looks very pretty.

635
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,679
- We can take a photo together.
- Okay.

636
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,509
Are we taking a photo?

637
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,779
- We all have to be in it.
- There's a group photo?

638
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,148
- That completes the lesson.
- Really?

639
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,148
We have to take a group photo.

640
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:43,959
All right, let's take a photo.

641
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:45,959
I'll stand in the back.

642
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:47,658
As a group?

643
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,029
(He gets the place in the back to save his face.)

644
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,199
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

645
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,568
(Despite the shortage in fashion, the emotions were overflowing.)

646
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:54,799
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thank you.

647
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,669
Goodness.

648
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,238
Tae Hyun.

649
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,569
What's with your outfit?

650
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:01,768
Until now...

651
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:02,879
What?

652
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:04,479
It's also of good quality.

653
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,609
The fabric looks nice too.

654
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:08,479
Yes, it's nice.

655
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:10,648
(Two good-looking men who lost sight of the original intention)

656
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,649
- Didn't I pick it out well?
- I've seen it before.

657
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:15,288
- It's very...
- That's amazing.

658
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:17,219
After seeing them...

659
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,188
Hold on, Dong Hyun.

660
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,189
(Sticking to their original intention)

661
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,558
I got tricked by Dong Hyun and bought a hat.

662
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,399
(I got tricked by Dong Hyun and bought a hat.)

663
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,128
I thought that I could avoid...

664
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:28,068
the embarrassment by lowering my head.

665
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,369
That's why you bought this?

666
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,608
I took off the tag, so I can't get it exchanged.

667
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,808
I arranged flowers in this hat.

668
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,269
In that hat?

669
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,609
I arranged flowers.

670
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,209
Dong Hyun.

671
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,378
(The hat seller appears.)

672
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,878
Sang Uk listened to me.

673
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,648
Your hat is mint while your shorts are red.

674
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,119
You look nice and perverted.

675
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:49,859
The color didn't match, but he still chose it.

676
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,458
Suddenly, he said that he liked it.

677
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,859
- I was really surprised.
- It's nice.

678
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,658
What are we doing now?

679
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,128
Playing two games resulted...

680
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:58,928
in a gap in fashion.

681
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,368
- It's a huge gap.
- It's huge.

682
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,798
Tae Hyun has a full outfit.

683
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,069
I look worse with this. It's ridiculous.

684
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:06,109
- Will they take away my clothes?
- Please do.

685
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,279
You'll get a chance to turn the tables.

686
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,239
- Turning the tables is necessary.
- Definitely.

687
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,208
Someone will get to wear this hat.

688
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,018
I don't have anything.

689
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,048
(As he doesn't have anything)

690
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,679
- So I have nothing to lose.
- Me too.

691
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,148
It's called...

692
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:21,348
The Struggle for Fashion,

693
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,788
Handsome Guys' Challenge.

694
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:23,888
This is good.

695
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,588
There is a total of three categories.

696
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:29,758
If you're confident, wager one of your clothing items...

697
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,899
and take on the challenge.

698
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:32,968
(Attempting the category that you feel confident about...)

699
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,898
(by wagering one of your items)

700
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,368
If you succeed,

701
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:39,099
you can take away a clothing item from another member.

702
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:40,908
If you fail,

703
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:43,909
you must return the item that you wagered.

704
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,309
Let's check the number of items that you have.

705
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,248
Tae Hyun with the most number of items has...

706
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,048
a top and a bottom.

707
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,158
He has one short-sleeved t-shirt that we gave in the beginning.

708
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,988
Including pajamas and slippers,

709
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,119
he has a total of five.

710
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:00,988
I have one pair of pants.

711
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:02,628
(A total of 4 items, 1 obtained and 3 given)

712
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,228
Are the socks counted separately?

713
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:05,298
- They aren't separate.
- Of course not.

714
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:06,869
You earned one set of clothing.

715
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:09,538
He looks like a sad hermit crab.

716
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,638
(A total of 4 items, 1 obtained and 3 given)

717
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,808
Seung Ho hasn't obtained any items.

718
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,968
- He has a total of three.
- Yes.

719
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:18,108
Let's say that I won after wagering this hat.

720
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,578
Do I get to trade with someone?

721
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,648
- You'll win an item.
- You'll win.

722
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:23,048
- You obtain it.
- You can try again with this.

723
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:25,049
In other words, they're like chips.

724
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,588
- You get to win it.
- With this?

725
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:27,748
- Is it like a chip?
- You win the item.

726
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,089
I should wager my hat.

727
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,158
That's good. Aren't you glad that you bought it?

728
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:32,858
- I earned a bullet.
- Me too.

729
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:35,229
I could easily become naked.

730
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,628
What if you don't have any?

731
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:39,098
If you play after wagering the short-sleeved t-shirt...

732
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:40,128
and you lose,

733
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,169
you'll have to walk around without clothes.

734
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,668
- There must be something.
- You'll have to put this on.

735
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,839
Open it up.

736
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:48,908
- Is it a tank top?
- What's that?

737
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,039
Is it a tank top?

738
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,578
- It's sleeveless.
- It has no sleeves.

739
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:53,979
Oh, my.

740
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:58,979
(It makes them groan automatically.)

741
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,819
It's okay with me. I like it.

742
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:04,089
Don't you wear it when you work out?

743
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:05,588
- Yes, I like it.
- So they can take...

744
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,758
clothes away from me?

745
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,229
You can put this on instead.

746
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,058
When you lose the tank top after wagering it,

747
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,258
is there an option?

748
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:14,468
- We haven't thought of it that far.
- No?

749
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:16,839
- Is it the same with slippers?
- That's right.

750
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,199
Is it possible to attend the fan signing event barefoot?

751
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,808
If you wager your shoes and lose them.

752
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,238
(It's possible to attend the fan signing event barefoot.)

753
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,308
I'm okay with it.

754
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,879
I have two bullets. Okay.

755
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,149
The problem isn't the slippers. It's my pants.

756
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,219
If I go to the fan signing event in underwear...

757
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:31,748
Exactly.

758
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:34,188
Right after the fan signing event without pants,

759
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:35,989
we might get arrested.

760
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,488
Instead of being a fan signing event, it'd be...

761
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,358
- an underwear signing event.
- An underwear signing event.

762
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,489
It could be the last event on our schedule this year.

763
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,398
I'm so jealous of your jeans.

764
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,728
- What's your size?
- It's medium.

765
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,798
They won't fit you. They fit only me and Tae Hyun.

766
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,068
My pants won't fit any of you anyway.

767
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:51,439
- Mine are the same.
- Tae Hyun.

768
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,568
And so,

769
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,168
in case you lose them,

770
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:55,808
we prepared bigger sizes for others.

771
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,109
(The same product of different sizes are ready.)

772
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,709
- That's great.
- Unbelievable.

773
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,948
We got the same pair of jeans in bigger sizes.

774
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:03,619
There will be a lot of struggle to get his pants.

775
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,749
With jeans and my shoes.

776
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,218
That would be perfect.

777
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:08,789
- That's amazing.
- That would be lovely.

778
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,459
That sounds really amazing.

779
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,228
It could be better to lose this and put on the tank top instead.

780
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,529
The tank top, jeans, and these shoes.

781
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:16,629
(Extremely motivated)

782
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,658
- Instead?
- Yes.

783
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:19,359
- Okay.
- I'd be happy with that outfit.

784
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:20,969
I'll definitely win those jeans.

785
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,939
- I'll definitely win those jeans.
- That's a relief.

786
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,798
- Okay.
- What's important is...

787
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,609
- the game categories.
- Yes.

788
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:29,938
- I'll reveal the categories.
- Please.

789
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,009
Let it be something like jiu-jitsu.

790
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:32,738
The first game is...

791
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:35,279
catching falling cellophane with chopsticks.

792
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,778
What's cellophane?

793
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,118
(What's cellophane?)

794
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,649
- Could you show them cellophane?
- It's like confetti.

795
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:46,458
(They plan to drop cellophane from the attic.)

796
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:47,529
A long time ago...

797
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,289
A long time ago,

798
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,459
we made glasses with it.

799
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,929
Can you drop it? I'll try to catch it.

800
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,268
Let it go.

801
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:56,299
- Drop it.
- Let it go.

802
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:00,338
It could be possible.

803
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:01,368
My goodness.

804
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:02,438
(Testing it with his fingers instead of chopsticks)

805
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,308
It's impossible to catch it even with the hand.

806
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,509
This won't be possible.

807
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,608
The next game is blowing out candles with your nose.

808
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:09,778
How many candles?

809
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:10,878
Ten candles.

810
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:12,818
- In one go?
- Ten candles are easy.

811
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,119
- We can do it.
- Here it is.

812
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:15,689
This is definitely possible.

813
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,989
Try to feel the blow. There won't be any snot.

814
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:19,529
(Blowing with his nose)

815
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:21,889
Something got on me.

816
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,858
- Don't lie.
- I can feel the blow.

817
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:25,999
The third game is...

818
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,529
using the spoon to throw the snacks.

819
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:30,538
- By hitting it hard?
- Yes.

820
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,539
(Catch the snack with your mouth to succeed)

821
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,599
Like this?

822
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:33,969
What kind of snack is it?

823
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:36,578
- It's Kancho.
- That sounds okay.

824
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:37,679
That's not bad.

825
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:38,939
Let's get started.

826
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,749
Let's start the first game.

827
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,949
- I'll go.
- What will you wager?

828
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:45,778
I can catch the cellophane.

829
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,248
- Cellophane?
- Really?

830
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,018
I can try it multiple times.

831
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,158
What will you wager?

832
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,658
Will you wager your top?

833
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,358
I only have these to wager.

834
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,429
These shoes.

835
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,398
Wait a minute.

836
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,128
- You like the tank top.
- With my top?

837
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:00,068
If you lose your t-shirt, you'll get a tank top.

838
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,328
You should wager that instead.

839
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:02,698
It's better to wager your t-shirt.

840
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,298
- You like tank tops.
- You like tank tops.

841
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,238
It's not that I like tank tops.

842
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,908
I just don't have any choice.

843
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,709
Let me take a look at this.

844
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,078
- That looks better on you.
- I agree.

845
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,778
- It looks okay on you.
- Dong Hyun, when you work out...

846
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:16,178
- Right now...
- Okay.

847
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,179
- I'll go for this.
- That looks better on you.

848
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,848
I'll wager my t-shirt.

849
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:20,788
- Your t-shirt?
- My plan is...

850
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,459
winning this tank top, his jeans, and sneakers.

851
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,889
Why is the future so predictable?

852
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,059
What are you going to take away?

853
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,358
- Definitely his jeans.
- His jeans?

854
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,958
They need pants. You're right.

855
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,599
- It's definitely possible.
- You must win no matter what.

856
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,069
I have five chances.

857
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,398
One after jumping, two, three, four,

858
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,369
five, six, seven times.

859
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,008
- Start right away.
- There's no practice.

860
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:44,009
You have to start right away.

861
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,408
There's no practice. I'm starting right away.

862
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,508
- All right.
- Here I go.

863
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,008
Could you let me talk?

864
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,308
One, two, three, four...

865
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:50,748
When you catch the falling cellophane...

866
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,449
with chopsticks, you succeed.

867
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,789
One, two, three, four, five, six.

868
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:56,818
(Jeans, come to me.)

869
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:57,888
Six times.

870
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,088
(Trembling)

871
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,528
- All right.
- One, two, three, four...

872
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:02,788
Hurry up and start. It's hard for him.

873
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,258
I'm ready. Here I go.

874
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,428
With his t-shirt at stake,

875
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,168
he'll try to catch the cellophane.

876
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,528
I'll win the jeans. Here I go.

877
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,639
One, two, three, four, five, six.

878
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,939
One, two, three, four...

879
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,439
One, two, three, four, five, six.

880
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,738
(Struggling)

881
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:18,879
Five, six.

882
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,319
(Failed)

883
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,188
(Thanks to the fluttering cellophane,)

884
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:30,089
(he lost his short-sleeved t-shirt forever.)

885
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,889
(The t-shirt is gone.)

886
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,359
This is way too difficult.

887
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:42,168
Since you're eliminated, take it off right away.

888
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:43,499
It's meaningless now.

889
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,098
- You have nothing to win.
- You failed.

890
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,509
(Full of regrets)

891
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,038
- This is difficult.
- It is.

892
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,178
- Don't act rashly.
- This is difficult.

893
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:51,338
Don't play this game.

894
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:52,379
This game...

895
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,108
- Who came up with this game?
- It's impossible.

896
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:56,448
- This is...
- In my opinion, it's difficult.

897
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:57,978
It's impossible even with tongs.

898
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,618
All right, is there anyone who wants to do it?

899
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,619
No.

900
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,488
We certify that it's the most difficult game.

901
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,558
One, two, three.

902
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,559
- Pass.
- Pass.

903
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,528
I shouldn't have played it.

904
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:07,558
- Dong Hyun only has...
- I shouldn't have.

905
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,728
a chance with his shoes.

906
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,798
Someone else should have started first.

907
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,659
It's okay because I wanted the tank top.

908
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:13,999
I wanted to wear the tank top, so it turned out for the better.

909
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:15,799
I lost one of my chances.

910
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,068
The second game is...

911
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:18,638
blowing out candles with your nose.

912
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:20,609
- Okay.
- Hey, that's powerful.

913
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,069
(Blowing)

914
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,379
Tae Hyun, you'll be able to blow them out with the liquid.

915
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,179
Instead of blowing them out in one go,

916
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:29,949
you have to keep blowing.

917
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:31,679
Is that it?

918
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:33,018
- This is hard.
- That's hard.

919
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,548
- This is hard.
- What is it?

920
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,118
The higher ones are easy to blow out,

921
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,319
but these are more difficult.

922
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,859
That's why you have to blow out ten of them.

923
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,828
I'd like to try the candles.

924
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:43,829
Yes.

925
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,299
- I'll wager my hat.
- Okay.

926
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:47,669
- Right away?
- He's starting right away.

927
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,369
I bought a useless bullet by mistake.

928
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:52,239
- I'm glad that you bought a hat.
- I know.

929
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:54,469
I can use it without pressure.

930
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,479
Sang Uk, what would you like to take?

931
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,139
If I win the pair of jeans,

932
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,278
someone else might take it away from me.

933
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,379
You'll get it taken away.

934
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,879
Would you go for something safe?

935
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,118
Like what?

936
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,719
Like his jacket.

937
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,719
Shouldn't you try to get the jeans first?

938
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,858
- They mention other people's stuff.
- They mention other people's stuff.

939
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,689
- We want to keep our own things.
- Anyway,

940
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,088
I'll choose between the two.

941
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,288
- What you take away is the target.
- Is this it?

942
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,028
You can take anything, so I wish you success.

943
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:19,258
- Say "here I go" before you start.
- Here you go.

944
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,529
- Here you go.
- Here I go.

945
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:22,229
- Are you starting?
- Yes, I am.

946
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:25,139
One, two, three.

947
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,809
Three.

948
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:30,639
Three.

949
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,308
- Okay.
- He got it so easily.

950
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,808
Wax from the candles spread everywhere.

951
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,679
That was really strong.

952
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,948
- This is great.
- His attempt was successful.

953
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:43,219
Sang Uk, which clothing item would you take away?

954
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,958
I should focus on winning the game.

955
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,588
Gosh, this is...

956
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,658
(The owners of the pants)

957
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:49,229
Even if you take them, I'll try to get them back right away.

958
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,329
- Whose item will you take?
- I'll take these pants.

959
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:52,798
- His pants?
- Tae Hyun's pants?

960
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,069
- Tae Hyun's pants?
- Tae Hyun's pants.

961
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:56,298
Then what should I wager?

962
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,938
- You should wager your jacket.
- My shoes got taken away.

963
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:58,968
I can't wager my jacket.

964
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:01,138
I'll wager my t-shirt instead.

965
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,908
- You can wear the jacket over it.
- Exactly.

966
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,209
What if someone takes away your jacket?

967
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:05,638
I'll think about it then.

968
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:06,808
Then you'll be left with a tank top.

969
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,749
I'll wager everything I have.

970
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:11,149
Okay.

971
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,348
In which direction did you blow?

972
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:14,518
- This way.
- Your left nostril?

973
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,618
I did it with my right nostril.

974
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,259
I blew it at 45°.

975
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,689
Like this?

976
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,829
- Go ahead and practice.
- Try it.

977
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:22,559
- It's practice.
- It's practice.

978
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:23,898
He's trying to keep his clothes.

979
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,329
(Blowing)

980
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:31,598
(The candles don't even flicker.)

981
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,769
How did he do it?

982
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,709
Do it exactly as you did.

983
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,079
Hey, how did he pull it off?

984
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,438
Why am I tearing up?

985
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,009
Tae Hyun doesn't want to do it, but he has to keep his clothes.

986
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,049
This is heartbreaking. He's like my dad.

987
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:45,019
He forced himself to come out.

988
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,249
- You'll make your nose bleed.
- Don't blow it so hard.

989
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:51,888
- I don't know anymore.
- Goodness.

990
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,288
- Start.
- This is heartbreaking.

991
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,128
He came out because he had no choice.

992
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,129
- Start.
- Start.

993
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,399
- He's starting right away.
- Here he goes.

994
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:00,198
One, two, three.

995
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,929
(What will be the result of his willpower and determination?)

996
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:21,489
(Peekaboo)

997
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:28,429
(Unfortunately, the flame survived.)

998
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,899
- Three candles.
- Three candles.

999
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,358
As three remained, he failed.

1000
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:34,298
All right, his t-shirt is replaced by a tank top.

1001
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:35,998
It's replaced by a tank top.

1002
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,239
(Tae Hyun's t-shirt is also replaced by a tank top.)

1003
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:39,838
- Go.
- He has no choice.

1004
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,539
- Definitely not.
- He has no choice.

1005
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:43,409
Who's next?

1006
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,179
This is so annoying.

1007
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,049
He became penniless.

1008
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,209
He became penniless.

1009
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,579
(Penniless)

1010
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,319
You know what?

1011
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,058
Can I keep my jacket at least?

1012
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,288
- I'm cold.
- All right.

1013
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:02,258
I might lose mine, so I can't promise anything.

1014
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:03,429
Darn it.

1015
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:04,898
Rock-paper-scissors.

1016
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:08,398
Currently, Sang Uk is the richest.

1017
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,499
Right?

1018
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:10,798
It's important.

1019
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,399
- Are you starting right away?
- He's starting.

1020
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,569
Here I go.

1021
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,719
(Will it work?)

1022
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:30,059
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

1023
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:32,658
- He almost missed the last one.
- Really?

1024
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:35,789
Why didn't you try to survive?

1025
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:37,899
- Try to survive. Okay.
- Okay.

1026
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,268
- It makes me annoyed.
- What would you like to take?

1027
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,029
I'd like...

1028
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:44,868
the pair of jeans.

1029
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:47,068
I just realized that the tank top goes well with the jeans.

1030
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:48,509
- Right.
- The jeans.

1031
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:51,008
- I'd like to wager this t-shirt.
- Okay.

1032
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:53,279
This is the only thing I can wager.

1033
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,909
- Here I go.
- Go.

1034
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,549
It's over once you blow out one.

1035
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,149
(Will Yi Kyung get his jeans back?)

1036
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:05,458
- It didn't work for me last time.
- He got it.

1037
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,659
Jeans, come on.

1038
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,958
I told you not to take mine away.

1039
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,798
What can I do? I got everything taken away.

1040
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,058
(He returned the jeans without even putting them on.)

1041
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,099
That's good.

1042
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:16,068
- I made it.
- His clothes?

1043
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,969
(Seung Ho gives a try with his t-shirt at stake.)

1044
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:23,738
(A strong wind)

1045
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:25,208
- This is too easy.
- It's a success.

1046
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,948
- Will you take Sang Uk's pants?
- Yes, Sang Uk's pants.

1047
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,148
Sang Uk's pants?

1048
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:29,279
Wait a minute.

1049
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,319
This is...

1050
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:33,178
(Trying them on carefully before buying)

1051
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,318
- They look nice.
- They're perfect.

1052
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,349
These are a little...

1053
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:37,718
All pants are like that.

1054
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,819
We can't be picky about pants right now.

1055
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:42,029
Would you like to try on the jacket too?

1056
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:44,398
- On top?
- I'd like to try on the jacket.

1057
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,729
(Can I just try it on?)

1058
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,068
I have to take off the microphone. That's annoying.

1059
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,599
(It's the only item that Tae Hyun has.)

1060
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:51,899
It's so heartbreaking...

1061
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,768
to see Tae Hyun take off his jacket...

1062
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:55,368
so I can try it on.

1063
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,609
(Heartbreaking)

1064
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,478
It fits you perfectly.

1065
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,578
My goodness.

1066
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,348
(Everyone explodes with reaction when he tries on the jacket.)

1067
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,849
Hey, it looks nice on you.

1068
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:05,849
Seung Ho, that's your size.

1069
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,818
If he takes the jacket instead,

1070
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,418
he'll be wearing the orangutan shorts, right?

1071
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:12,489
(That's right.)

1072
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:14,458
- Seung Ho, you look good.
- The outfit is quite nice.

1073
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,188
- You look good.
- He actually looks good.

1074
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:18,328
- You look nice.
- The outfit is hip.

1075
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:19,398
- It's nice.
- It's good.

1076
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,528
- I look hip.
- It looks nice.

1077
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,429
It's hilarious how good it looks.

1078
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:26,868
(A perfect match that the one who recommended it didn't expect)

1079
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,869
It looks nice.

1080
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,908
Wait a minute.

1081
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,408
Excuse me. I'll take a look at myself.

1082
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:31,508
They make a great match.

1083
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:34,049
(He checks out his new outfit in the mirror.)

1084
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,209
What's this?

1085
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,679
They make a good match. That's fascinating.

1086
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,089
I'd be happy if he picks the jacket.

1087
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:45,019
Those orangutan shorts are like a cheat code.

1088
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,289
This is...

1089
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:47,858
Wait a minute.

1090
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:49,589
(Seung Ho's worry grows deeper.)

1091
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,029
And sneakers with that outfit?

1092
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,528
I recommend the jacket.

1093
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:54,999
Don't I look hip with the jacket?

1094
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,498
- By the way, - It's not bad.

1095
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:58,199
the t-shirt also looks good with the pants.

1096
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,739
You'll be sitting down at the fan signing event.

1097
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,038
All right, I'll pick this.

1098
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,339
(He picks the jacket.)

1099
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,879
(Seung Ho snatches away Tae Hyun's jacket.)

1100
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,579
Now I have no chance, do I?

1101
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:12,418
- You can wager your shoes.
- Which ones?

1102
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:14,748
- You can wager your slippers.
- Then I'll be barefoot.

1103
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:15,988
- How can I be barefoot?
- Only if you fail.

1104
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,188
Yes, but I could fail.

1105
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:18,358
Then we'll carry you on our backs.

1106
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,489
- We'll give you a foot massage.
- We'll carry you on our backs.

1107
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,659
Then I'll look so poor.

1108
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,428
We'll carry you and put you in your seat.

1109
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,598
Tae Hyun, your happy moment was so brief.

1110
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,368
(Feeling sympathy)

1111
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,498
Everything depends on...

1112
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:31,638
the snack game, right?

1113
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,639
That's correct.

1114
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,909
Shall I go first?

1115
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:35,168
- I'll go first.
- With your hat at stake?

1116
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:36,169
- I'll wager this.
- His hat.

1117
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,408
- It's better to do it early.
- You have a lot.

1118
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:38,738
Your hat, your top.

1119
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,408
No one will want his hat.

1120
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,248
His hat is useful at times like this.

1121
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,449
- No one wants to take it.
- You have a high chance of winning.

1122
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,049
What will you take away?

1123
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,848
I just need a pair of sneakers.

1124
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,988
Don't you need pants?

1125
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:50,289
- I have pants.
- He has pants.

1126
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,588
- You didn't get them taken away?
- No.

1127
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,629
I took Tae Hyun's jacket instead.

1128
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,588
The sneakers would be amazing.

1129
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:57,028
- The youngest.
- I should've taken those pants.

1130
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,228
- He's the youngest.
- Those pants.

1131
00:38:58,229 --> 00:38:59,698
I should've taken those pants...

1132
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,868
instead of Yi Kyung's.

1133
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,268
(Dong Hyun's feet depend on Sang Uk's hands.)

1134
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:03,898
- It's better to do things quickly.
- Seung Ho wanted these pants,

1135
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:05,638
so I didn't take them.

1136
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,509
- You might as well succeed.
- Okay.

1137
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,068
Here he goes.

1138
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,308
(His competitive mode is on.)

1139
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,609
You only get one chance.

1140
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,678
- I got it.
- He isn't an ordinary athlete.

1141
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,909
He's ranked internationally.

1142
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,479
It'll be harder than the final match at the Summer Games.

1143
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,219
You only get one chance.

1144
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,118
It must be more nerve-racking than the final match.

1145
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,059
- Let's see.
- This won't be easy.

1146
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,928
There's only a 0.1 percent chance.

1147
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,059
Here I go.

1148
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,029
The odds are the same as winning the lottery.

1149
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,729
I got it, okay? Here I go.

1150
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:34,328
Go, Shin Sang Uk.

1151
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,468
(Starting the game is harder than actually winning.)

1152
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:36,499
Who's Shin Sang Uk?

1153
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,369
Go on. This won't be easy.

1154
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:41,508
- Here I go.
- That's bigger than your fist.

1155
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:42,638
(Once again, he's just focused on the game!)

1156
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,709
The snack is bigger than your mouth.

1157
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:47,709
He did it.

1158
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,019
He did it.

1159
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,088
(Did you see that?)

1160
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,128
(That's the focus of a world champion!)

1161
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:06,798
- Shoes! Nice!
- You took his shoes.

1162
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:07,828
You won his shoes.

1163
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:10,069
- You completed your look.
- Nicely done.

1164
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:13,369
- There's a reason he won gold.
- Dong Hyun, you have to try.

1165
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:14,909
That was incredible.

1166
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:17,379
What will you play for?

1167
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,209
- What will it be?
- Someone will likely take my pants.

1168
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:21,708
- The jeans.
- Maybe I should have...

1169
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:22,908
an additional pair.

1170
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:24,149
- You should take the jeans.
- One more?

1171
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,448
- Take the jeans and wear one.
- You'll take both pairs?

1172
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,618
You can win the pants back if they're taken from you.

1173
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,749
Take the jeans.

1174
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:30,819
Try them on.

1175
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,689
(Though a little snug)

1176
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,158
- Looking good.
- There you go.

1177
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,729
(His long legs make them look good.)

1178
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,528
- It's better than having none.
- You're being greedy.

1179
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:41,328
- Say you took that.
- It's better than having none.

1180
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:42,828
I'll take your pants right away,

1181
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:43,898
but that will make me want the jeans.

1182
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,839
You can play for them again if you lose your pants.

1183
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,438
- Having extra is better.
- Exactly.

1184
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:49,439
I'll take the sneakers!

1185
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,638
- Darn.
- Nice!

1186
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,708
(Sang Uk takes Dong Hyun's sneakers.)

1187
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,948
Bring it on. I'll play right away.

1188
00:40:55,949 --> 00:41:00,288
You... You'll be wearing sneakers with those boxers.

1189
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,888
There's nothing to bet in your case.

1190
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:03,348
Don't I? Have I lost everything?

1191
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:05,088
- Your slippers.
- Right?

1192
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,589
I can't do without shoes.

1193
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:08,628
(He sits it out because he's low on items.)

1194
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:10,658
I can't play since I have nothing to bet.

1195
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:12,429
Okay, then. Who's next?

1196
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,468
Seung Ho?

1197
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:15,568
This is what I think.

1198
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:17,368
If I end up with that jacket,

1199
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:18,868
I can do with just a sleeveless shirt.

1200
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:19,998
(Seung Ho will bet his basic white T-shirt.)

1201
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,438
- Exactly.
- I'm willing to take this off...

1202
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,468
since I'll look sexier that way.

1203
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,479
Is that so?

1204
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,209
You want the jacket?

1205
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,479
Seung Ho, do you want the jacket?

1206
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,018
- Bring it.
- Right away?

1207
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,249
Are you dragging me into a do-or-die battle?

1208
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,688
The jacket belongs to Tae Hyun,

1209
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:38,619
so they're playing for what's not even theirs.

1210
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,958
No way. You have a lot to spare.

1211
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,228
Are you betting your hat like before?

1212
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:45,098
Yes, my hat. You're right about this being useless.

1213
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:46,198
This should be done.

1214
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,428
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1215
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:48,698
- Go ahead.
- I'm betting my hat.

1216
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:49,769
Okay.

1217
00:41:55,939 --> 00:41:57,908
(He does it too easily.)

1218
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:59,878
- What will you take?
- He's taking everything.

1219
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,008
Your slippers!

1220
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,649
Why would you take my slippers?

1221
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,119
Now,

1222
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,518
Dong Hyun can't play because he has nothing to bet.

1223
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,819
What am I supposed to do?

1224
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,218
It's over for you.

1225
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:12,259
It's over for Dong Hyun.

1226
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,329
- What the...
- It's over for Dong Hyun.

1227
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:15,488
How is this fair?

1228
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,798
- Seriously?
- How can he take my slippers?

1229
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:18,998
- You see, - It's over for Dong Hyun.

1230
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,528
I knew he'd come after my pants.

1231
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:21,628
- But...
- So you ended him.

1232
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,799
Can I still play when I don't have slippers?

1233
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:25,899
Is it okay to take them?

1234
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,338
Then that's it for Dong Hyun.

1235
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,408
- Tae Hyun, what do you have left?
- Slippers.

1236
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:30,479
Slippers? Got it.

1237
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,078
Okay, hold on.

1238
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,008
- Are you going to end Tae Hyun?
- What am I supposed to do?

1239
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,278
After we end their chances,

1240
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,448
- the three of us can...
- We can come to an agreement.

1241
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:40,219
I'm suggesting that the three of us look good for the event.

1242
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,388
- We'll come to an agreement.
- I second that.

1243
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,958
- This is quite problematic.
- Tae Hyun.

1244
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,258
You know what?

1245
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:48,858
- Take a stand!
- This...

1246
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,828
- This can be problematic.
- Take a stand!

1247
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:52,058
- This is insane.
- Dong Hyun's done for.

1248
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,729
This is so unfair!

1249
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:56,429
You know what? Hold on.

1250
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,568
This can't be.

1251
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:01,108
- How is this allowed?
- A few moments later.

1252
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:02,338
Look, okay?

1253
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,079
This is the state we're in.

1254
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:06,278
The two of us...

1255
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,278
Can you see how cruel you've been?

1256
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:10,049
This is the state we're in,

1257
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:12,379
but you're trying to take more from us!

1258
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,149
Come on.

1259
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:16,889
They're a bunch of muggers.

1260
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,418
How can you call this a game?

1261
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:20,928
Up until a second ago, he had the most items.

1262
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:22,559
Do you know what's even worse?

1263
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:25,058
I haven't played a single game!

1264
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,559
(This is so unfair.)

1265
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:28,528
Look at me!

1266
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:31,969
(Upset)

1267
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:35,769
What happened to that stylish guy from earlier?

1268
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,278
What happened to that stylish guy?

1269
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:41,208
See? Look at us.

1270
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,479
Take this too!

1271
00:43:42,649 --> 00:43:45,578
And the worst part? We didn't gamble anything away.

1272
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,419
This is unfair!

1273
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:49,119
I was stripped while sitting on the couch.

1274
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:52,018
We didn't do anything to hurt the others.

1275
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,888
All we did was try to blow out some candles.

1276
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:57,159
- But we lost everything.
- Those wealthy took from us.

1277
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:00,028
You should take from those who have more to spare.

1278
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,169
But instead, you took my slippers, which were all I had.

1279
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,298
But still you want to take more from us.

1280
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:07,239
- Ensure our basic rights!
- How is this allowed?

1281
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,669
You want us to go from Mapo to Yeongdeungpo barefoot?

1282
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,878
We'll carry you on our backs.

1283
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,108
(The tear-jerking...)

1284
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,078
Take it all, okay? What else do you need?

1285
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,518
- It's over for Dong Hyun.
- Take everything.

1286
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,378
He's done for, but you still have your slippers.

1287
00:44:19,379 --> 00:44:21,048
That's why we're trying to take your slippers.

1288
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,249
Exactly. That's how cruel you are.

1289
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:25,558
You should know just how cruel you are.

1290
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,058
Actually, those slippers could alter our lives.

1291
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:30,388
They could be robbed of everything. Give it a shot.

1292
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:32,598
Go ahead and play for something and bet your slippers.

1293
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:33,829
- Exactly.
- Give it a shot.

1294
00:44:34,229 --> 00:44:35,669
Can you give me a chance as well?

1295
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:37,128
- Sorry.
- Come on.

1296
00:44:37,129 --> 00:44:38,968
Let me try with one of his slippers.

1297
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:40,839
- Come on.
- Sorry about that.

1298
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:43,738
You have to win this round.

1299
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,138
That's how you can turn the tables.

1300
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:46,978
(Tae Hyun will try one last time and bet his slippers.)

1301
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,079
Don't tap it too hard.

1302
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:52,448
- Go for it.
- Here I go!

1303
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:53,548
Get more than just your slippers!

1304
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:56,689
When we're backed into a corner, we always find a way to survive.

1305
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,752
You have to win this round.

1306
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:00,082
That's how you can turn the tables.

1307
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,922
(Tae Hyun will try one last time and bet his slippers.)

1308
00:45:01,923 --> 00:45:03,053
Don't tap it too hard.

1309
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:07,492
- Go for it.
- Here I go!

1310
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:08,592
Get more than just your slippers!

1311
00:45:08,593 --> 00:45:11,633
When we're backed into a corner, we always find a way to survive.

1312
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:14,632
Tae Hyun, are you playing to get my slippers back?

1313
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:15,832
Okay, got it.

1314
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:18,032
- We'll make a comeback.
- Nice.

1315
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:19,332
With that, I'll win us more clothes.

1316
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,333
Okay.

1317
00:45:21,873 --> 00:45:23,173
I mean it. Please win this round.

1318
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:24,412
(Extremely nervous)

1319
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:25,413
You're betting your slippers.

1320
00:45:25,414 --> 00:45:26,942
If you fail, this will be your final outfit.

1321
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,943
You'll win a pair of slippers when you already own a pair?

1322
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:30,812
(He's risking everything he's got.)

1323
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:32,112
- Here I go.
- Go for it.

1324
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:33,113
This is it.

1325
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:36,753
(The snack has been tossed into the air.)

1326
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,043
You poor old man!

1327
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:58,112
You lost everything.

1328
00:45:58,113 --> 00:46:01,342
(Barefoot Tae Hyun)

1329
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:02,383
Tae Hyun!

1330
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:04,912
We didn't have to do anything.

1331
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:06,113
They self-destructed.

1332
00:46:07,823 --> 00:46:09,982
They lost everything in the most devastating way.

1333
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:11,192
It's over for them.

1334
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:12,522
(Gambling leads to destruction.)

1335
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:14,222
We'll be meeting fans in decent clothes.

1336
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:15,392
We'll be looking decent.

1337
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:16,922
(The hopeless duo attending the signing event)

1338
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:17,993
Sit up here.

1339
00:46:21,303 --> 00:46:23,463
I was quite the hotshot back in the day.

1340
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:25,433
We were doing well for ourselves.

1341
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:29,443
- I at least had shoes.
- Of course.

1342
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:32,112
Sneakers from a known brand.

1343
00:46:32,113 --> 00:46:34,243
I used to have a jacket and pants.

1344
00:46:36,283 --> 00:46:39,112
Dong Hyun used to have sneakers!

1345
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:40,113
I had a jacket.

1346
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:42,022
I briefly owned a pair of jeans too.

1347
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:44,692
- I didn't get to wear them though.
- I had a full outfit.

1348
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:46,553
Someone took it while it was being delivered.

1349
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:48,993
Someone took it while it was on the way.

1350
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:50,793
The world is messed up.

1351
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:53,033
This is hilarious.

1352
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,003
Who can we unload this disappointment on?

1353
00:46:55,763 --> 00:46:56,962
Come on.

1354
00:46:56,963 --> 00:46:58,272
Don't we get another chance?

1355
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,332
- Of course not.
- There aren't any more chances.

1356
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,372
Darn.

1357
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:04,043
- I'll finish it off, then.
- Right.

1358
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:05,473
Hold on.

1359
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:07,813
Can't we head off to bed now?

1360
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:11,153
Exactly. Let us sleep at least!

1361
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,812
- I'm tired.
- Tell me about it.

1362
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:15,022
- Why do we have to watch this?
- Why?

1363
00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:16,322
Let us sleep.

1364
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,653
Why do we care what you guys have going on?

1365
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:21,462
Do what you need to do. We couldn't care less.

1366
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,523
Exactly. Whatever.

1367
00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:25,992
- They're hilarious.
- What are you aiming for?

1368
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:27,863
I want the sneakers.

1369
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,502
- Okay.
- What are you betting?

1370
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:32,632
- The T-shirt.
- You don't mind going sleeveless.

1371
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:33,903
- Are you ready?
- Is this it?

1372
00:47:34,703 --> 00:47:36,572
- He got it.
- Okay!

1373
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:37,573
(Easily done)

1374
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:38,872
What are you taking?

1375
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:40,613
- The sneakers.
- Sang Uk's shoes.

1376
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,182
Sang Uk, are you satisfied?

1377
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,413
I am. I'm totally fine with what I've got.

1378
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:45,983
- What about you?
- I'm happy too.

1379
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:48,083
I'm satisfied.

1380
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,753
Can you get them in one frame?

1381
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:52,623
We're happy too.

1382
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:54,822
Money doesn't matter as long as...

1383
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:56,163
- we're happy as we are.
- He's right.

1384
00:47:56,563 --> 00:47:59,233
- Seriously.
- I gained a friend.

1385
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:02,362
(The final result of the Struggle for Fashion)

1386
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:03,603
- Thanks, Tae Hyun.
- No problem.

1387
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:27,393
(The long and tiring day is over, and it's time to sleep.)

1388
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,422
- Good night.
- Good night.

1389
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:31,193
(Good night.)

1390
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,633
Good night.

1391
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:33,693
Good night.

1392
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,703
(Everyone is ready to fall asleep.)

1393
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,802
(Lights out)

1394
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:38,872
(Crash!)

1395
00:48:38,873 --> 00:48:40,843
(Or so we thought.)

1396
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:42,403
You fool.

1397
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:44,212
I left it in the car.

1398
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,343
(Crying)

1399
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:46,772
What should we do?

1400
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:47,943
What's your battery level?

1401
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,443
It's 35 percent.

1402
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:51,953
Are yours low on battery too?

1403
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:53,812
Less than ten percent.

1404
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:54,823
(What should I do?)

1405
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,782
You don't have the charger?

1406
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:59,292
(They just realized that they don't have a charger.)

1407
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:01,122
(The phone battery is running low.)

1408
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:02,263
It's four percent now.

1409
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:05,733
(Sang Uk keeps fidgeting.)

1410
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:08,263
Can I go and take it?

1411
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:12,172
(He goes on a journey alone.)

1412
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:13,502
(Looking around)

1413
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:14,943
Which of you...

1414
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:16,673
looks the tastiest?

1415
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:18,512
(Rushing)

1416
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:22,342
(He is aiming for the camera's portable charger.)

1417
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:24,883
(It isn't as easy as he thought.)

1418
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:28,823
(He tries his best to remove it.)

1419
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,223
I'm sorry.

1420
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:33,553
I'll borrow your portable charger.

1421
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,063
(Thank you.)

1422
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,493
My phone is running out of battery.

1423
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:38,362
It's a perfect crime.

1424
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:39,663
(A perfect crime!)

1425
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:44,472
(Yes, a perfectly revealed crime.)

1426
00:49:44,473 --> 00:49:46,972
(He takes one first.)

1427
00:49:46,973 --> 00:49:50,103
(He targets the next charger for Seung Ho.)

1428
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:51,543
Come here, you.

1429
00:49:52,513 --> 00:49:55,982
(Snap)

1430
00:49:55,983 --> 00:49:58,252
(He checks it thoroughly.)

1431
00:49:58,253 --> 00:50:00,053
It has too much battery.

1432
00:50:00,753 --> 00:50:01,882
It's way too much.

1433
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,322
(This isn't good.)

1434
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,252
I'll plug it back in tomorrow. Sorry.

1435
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,892
(I'll plug it back in tomorrow.)

1436
00:50:06,893 --> 00:50:08,023
Good night.

1437
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:12,063
(He returns with his spoils.)

1438
00:50:12,193 --> 00:50:14,962
(You're unstoppable.)

1439
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:15,963
(Proud of himself)

1440
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:17,062
Thank you.

1441
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:18,373
We need to return them tomorrow.

1442
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:21,543
I took one from the camera in front of the mirror.

1443
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:23,743
The other one was from the stairs.

1444
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:29,143
(But before they could return them)

1445
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:33,683
(The 1st floor camera is turned off too.)

1446
00:50:34,883 --> 00:50:36,852
I'll watch some YouTube videos.

1447
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:38,623
(I can finally watch YouTube.)

1448
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:44,563
(The camera battery died, but Sang Uk had a fun night.)

1449
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:50,063
(The 2nd day of Shortage in Fashion, the morning came quickly.)

1450
00:50:54,943 --> 00:50:57,273
(Seung Ho wakes up.)

1451
00:50:58,173 --> 00:51:01,082
(Half-asleep,)

1452
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:05,083
(they wake up one by one.)

1453
00:51:05,153 --> 00:51:06,683
Did you sleep well?

1454
00:51:07,183 --> 00:51:09,883
I'm a bit tired. I went to sleep late.

1455
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:12,052
- Now...
- No pressure.

1456
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:13,222
Hold on, now...

1457
00:51:13,223 --> 00:51:15,163
- You need to take everything off.
- Right.

1458
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,562
Is this yours?

1459
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:17,732
- Yes.
- Darn it.

1460
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,033
- It was a bit cold at night.
- It was cold... My goodness.

1461
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,833
The jacket is mine.

1462
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,232
- What?
- Give your jacket to him.

1463
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:24,333
Darn it.

1464
00:51:25,203 --> 00:51:26,373
Hold on.

1465
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,603
- Here, yes.
- Do it over there.

1466
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:31,212
- And later...
- I'm sorry, Tae Hyun.

1467
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,842
- They're indoor slippers, but...
- They're indoor slippers.

1468
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:33,913
But you can't have slippers.

1469
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:35,442
Goodness.

1470
00:51:35,443 --> 00:51:36,913
- Really?
- This is you.

1471
00:51:37,413 --> 00:51:38,512
Mine too?

1472
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:39,653
(Grabbing)

1473
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:42,183
(He confiscates Dong Hyun's slippers too.)

1474
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:43,382
You can't have them too.

1475
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,392
This is all I have.

1476
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,022
- There's nothing left to take.
- Me too.

1477
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:47,253
I'm exactly how I was yesterday.

1478
00:51:47,763 --> 00:51:49,693
We, the disadvantaged, will not forget this.

1479
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:53,793
Isn't the fan signing event at 12pm or 12:30pm?

1480
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,033
Yes.

1481
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:57,333
I have to go like this?

1482
00:51:57,803 --> 00:51:59,802
If you go to a fan signing event like this,

1483
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:01,943
people will think something's up with you two.

1484
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:05,843
Did you make an announcement about the event?

1485
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,882
You told the department store about this, right?

1486
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:09,113
- You did?
- They should've told them.

1487
00:52:09,143 --> 00:52:10,182
- They should.
- They should.

1488
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,982
What if we're having it on a street in front of...

1489
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:13,753
Yeongdeungpo Times Square?

1490
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:16,153
- Like a guerrilla event.
- They should inform them.

1491
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,753
It's time for breakfast.

1492
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,652
- Yes, we should eat.
- I'm hungry.

1493
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:21,922
- It's time to eat.
- No wonder.

1494
00:52:21,923 --> 00:52:24,022
- Do we need to go out again?
- I don't have the energy.

1495
00:52:24,023 --> 00:52:25,462
- We won't go out.
- We won't?

1496
00:52:25,463 --> 00:52:26,633
We ordered delivery.

1497
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,832
- Nice.
- You ordered delivery?

1498
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,562
- We'll eat indoors.
- I'm hungry.

1499
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:32,202
- What got into you?
- Yes.

1500
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:33,832
I guess he thought we couldn't go out...

1501
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,873
when he saw you two.

1502
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,912
Cops will come if they go out dressed like that.

1503
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,173
Although they made you wear this,

1504
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:41,642
they felt bad

1505
00:52:41,643 --> 00:52:43,413
- and sorry for you.
- Exactly.

1506
00:52:45,113 --> 00:52:46,182
It's here.

1507
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:47,252
(Delivery food for bare Team Handsome is here!)

1508
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:49,522
(What?)

1509
00:52:49,523 --> 00:52:51,192
- Who is it?
- I got goosebumps.

1510
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:52,352
(They spot someone in the intercom monitor.)

1511
00:52:52,353 --> 00:52:54,152
Why are you going this far?

1512
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:55,463
Let's ask.

1513
00:52:56,363 --> 00:53:00,293
(Tae Hyun is all fidgety from the sudden ringing of the doorbell.)

1514
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:02,532
Why are you hiding?

1515
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:03,533
This is my seat.

1516
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:04,632
- Don't hide.
- This is my seat.

1517
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:06,003
- Come here.
- This is my seat.

1518
00:53:06,073 --> 00:53:09,243
Let's ask why they're going this far.

1519
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,142
They made us dress like this.

1520
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:12,512
(How miserable do you want us to become?)

1521
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:14,243
What are they doing?

1522
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:16,982
It's her.

1523
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,652
(What made Team Handsome so flustered?)

1524
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,853
It's her.

1525
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:22,352
Well...

1526
00:53:22,353 --> 00:53:24,923
The Waterbomb Queen.

1527
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:25,953
Must she come now?

1528
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:27,352
- Eun Bi.
- Hello.

1529
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:29,362
- Hello.
- Hello.

1530
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:30,393
- Eun Bi.
- Hello.

1531
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:31,762
(We're happy to see you, but...)

1532
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:32,832
I got goosebumps.

1533
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:35,363
- Hello.
- I got goosebumps.

1534
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:37,262
Why did you come here?

1535
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:39,032
- Why...
- Eun Bi.

1536
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,072
Eun Bi.

1537
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:41,643
- How have you been?
- Long time no see. Yes.

1538
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:44,303
You must be feeling embarrassed now.

1539
00:53:44,543 --> 00:53:46,143
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to be rude.

1540
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,683
- It's rude to... My gosh.
- Wait.

1541
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:51,052
We're dressed like this because we just woke up.

1542
00:53:51,053 --> 00:53:52,552
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1543
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:54,752
(Surprised)

1544
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,422
- It is a bit odd.
- This...

1545
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:57,583
It's very odd.

1546
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,053
I'm sorry.

1547
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:01,593
What is happening?

1548
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:03,792
I'm dressed terribly too.

1549
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:06,392
- Gosh, I'm so sorry, Eun Bi.
- It's okay.

1550
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:07,663
(We're sorry for a lot of things on our first meeting.)

1551
00:54:07,963 --> 00:54:09,732
(The guest who came to visit Handsome Guys,)

1552
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:11,473
(who are too embarrassing to show to others!)

1553
00:54:12,103 --> 00:54:15,743
(Her 2025 Waterbomb video got 6 million views.)

1554
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:21,543
(The headliner of Waterbomb who seized the summer)

1555
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:26,813
(She is as stylish as the Waterbomb)

1556
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:30,483
(Waterbomb Queen and Summer Queen, Kwon Eun Bi)

1557
00:54:31,153 --> 00:54:32,523
I bought you breakfast.

1558
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,662
- We're grateful, but...
- Thank you.

1559
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:36,022
You're so nice.

1560
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,322
Thank you, but...

1561
00:54:37,323 --> 00:54:39,193
Does one of you like warm food?

1562
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,832
- He does.
- He feels cold easily.

1563
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,562
- He's feeling cold even now.
- I get cold easily.

1564
00:54:42,563 --> 00:54:45,102
- I bought something warm.
- Thank you.

1565
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:47,133
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

1566
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:49,342
(He opens the box faster than anyone else.)

1567
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,343
(Excited)

1568
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:52,013
- Did you buy this, Eun Bi?
- What's this?

1569
00:54:52,073 --> 00:54:53,672
This is kaya toast.

1570
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:54,842
Kaya.

1571
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:55,843
Let's share.

1572
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:57,883
Yes, let's all share.

1573
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:59,352
Eun Bi, have some too.

1574
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:00,912
- Thank you, Eun Bi.
- Thank you.

1575
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:02,253
(Kaya butter toast and jambon-beurre cheese toast with coffee)

1576
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:08,663
(Handsome Guys try the toasts that Eun Bi bought.)

1577
00:55:09,493 --> 00:55:16,363
(Today's breakfast is unusually silent.)

1578
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:17,602
(Munching)

1579
00:55:17,603 --> 00:55:18,803
It's delicious.

1580
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:21,303
Are they always this quiet?

1581
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:24,172
I guess clothes give you confidence.

1582
00:55:24,173 --> 00:55:25,272
You made us dress like this...

1583
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:26,342
- and invited a guest?
- How do they...

1584
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:27,913
- We feel small.
- make this?

1585
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:30,912
Wearing this makes me feel small.

1586
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:32,153
(Their self-esteem dropped overnight.)

1587
00:55:32,283 --> 00:55:34,653
Can you rank our outfits?

1588
00:55:34,823 --> 00:55:35,922
Rank this?

1589
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:37,182
Based on what we're currently wearing.

1590
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:38,823
Based on what you are wearing now?

1591
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:41,293
Let me show you this.

1592
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:44,092
(Isn't my Utan cute?)

1593
00:55:44,093 --> 00:55:45,193
Speak.

1594
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:47,363
I'm so sorry.

1595
00:55:49,063 --> 00:55:51,602
No, I offended you first.

1596
00:55:51,603 --> 00:55:52,702
(His self-esteem drops again.)

1597
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,642
You rank pretty high with just your upper body.

1598
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,702
- Really?
- Yes.

1599
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,173
- Forget what happened.
- But the lower half...

1600
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:00,272
Do you know how old he is?

1601
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,612
- I don't know.
- Make a guess.

1602
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:02,813
I think he's younger than me.

1603
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,812
- How old are you?
- I'm 31.

1604
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:06,813
My gosh.

1605
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:08,423
You think he's younger.

1606
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:10,453
- You're the same age.
- Really?

1607
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:12,552
- We're friends?
- Yes.

1608
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:14,563
You made a friend.

1609
00:56:14,993 --> 00:56:16,523
I thought you were younger than me.

1610
00:56:16,693 --> 00:56:18,232
- Really?
- This is the first time.

1611
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:19,762
- Yesterday...
- People usually think he's older.

1612
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:20,863
Really?

1613
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:27,233
(Everyone always thought Seung Ho was in his late 30s.)

1614
00:56:28,543 --> 00:56:30,472
I'll be energetic today.

1615
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:31,512
(His self-esteem goes back up.)

1616
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,012
- He looks young.
- He looks young.

1617
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:34,713
- He looks young.
- What about Sang Uk?

1618
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:36,942
I think he's slightly older than me.

1619
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:38,252
- Like a year or two?
- The opposite?

1620
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:39,713
- Not that far apart.
- One year?

1621
00:56:39,953 --> 00:56:41,082
Is he younger than me?

1622
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,482
He's a year younger than you.

1623
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,083
- He's younger.
- Really?

1624
00:56:44,153 --> 00:56:45,352
He's younger than you.

1625
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:46,422
I...

1626
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:47,552
- Interesting.
- I'm not hurt...

1627
00:56:47,553 --> 00:56:48,692
because she thought I looked older.

1628
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:50,493
Do I really look older than him?

1629
00:56:51,263 --> 00:56:52,963
Come on, Sang Uk.

1630
00:56:53,093 --> 00:56:54,093
Maybe because you put your hair up.

1631
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:55,103
Yes, it's your hair.

1632
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:57,733
I like to style my hair in an Italian style.

1633
00:56:58,303 --> 00:56:59,472
That could be why.

1634
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,033
(Let's just say it's due to his imposing hairstyle.)

1635
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,702
It's hard to rank their fashion based on their current outfits.

1636
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:04,972
- Yes.
- Since they're not...

1637
00:57:04,973 --> 00:57:06,212
in their usual clothes.

1638
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:08,012
So I looked up...

1639
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:10,782
their usual outfits on the internet.

1640
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,152
- Gosh, I...
- Come on.

1641
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:14,922
Can you see this and rank their fashion?

1642
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:16,652
I don't even know what picture he got.

1643
00:57:16,653 --> 00:57:18,852
How can you do that? Just rank us based on this outfit.

1644
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,293
This is a bit...

1645
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:23,163
(She expresses her displeasure as soon as she sees it.)

1646
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:25,633
Hold on, stop.

1647
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:27,433
This is...

1648
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:31,232
(What's that?)

1649
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:33,033
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1650
00:57:33,573 --> 00:57:35,772
That was 20 years ago.

1651
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:38,343
- This was 20 years ago?
- It was 15 years ago.

1652
00:57:38,813 --> 00:57:40,013
This looks fine.

1653
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,842
- This is a recent picture.
- He wears like this.

1654
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:42,843
This is a recent one.

1655
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:44,712
I don't have many pictures.

1656
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:46,782
- That's Tae Hyun.
- What's that? Oh, it's from...

1657
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:47,783
Is that Director Bong Joon Ho?

1658
00:57:47,784 --> 00:57:49,053
- Filming...
- Goodness.

1659
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,782
That's Director Bong Joon Ho.

1660
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:52,452
How could you choose the picture from a ritual for good fortune?

1661
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:53,653
That's Director Bong Joon Ho.

1662
00:57:55,423 --> 00:57:57,163
It's a shame, sir.

1663
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,533
She said, "Sir."

1664
00:57:58,793 --> 00:58:00,232
- Where's that?
- "Sir."

1665
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:01,433
I might end up in last place again.

1666
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:03,732
- Who is this?
- What's that?

1667
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:04,802
Who is this?

1668
00:58:04,803 --> 00:58:07,803
(Who are you in that fancy outfit?)

1669
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:09,202
That's me. I dressed like that in Japan.

1670
00:58:09,203 --> 00:58:10,903
- Really?
- In Japan.

1671
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:12,572
I dressed like that in Japan.

1672
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:13,642
(Considering)

1673
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:15,082
Japan...

1674
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,912
is accepting of such fashion.

1675
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,112
- It's too much.
- So I dressed like that in Japan.

1676
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:21,082
Dressing like me is better than going overboard like this, right?

1677
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,083
That was in Taiwan.

1678
00:58:22,783 --> 00:58:23,822
- My gosh!
- That...

1679
00:58:23,823 --> 00:58:25,452
- That was in Taiwan.
- This looks nice.

1680
00:58:25,453 --> 00:58:26,652
When I exercised in Taiwan.

1681
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:28,023
(Yi Kyung's outfit 2, his running attire)

1682
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:30,422
- Who is this?
- Isn't that Sang Uk?

1683
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,692
(Sang Uk's outfit 1, a dandy attire)

1684
00:58:31,693 --> 00:58:33,093
I like that reaction.

1685
00:58:34,163 --> 00:58:35,432
- Your shins...
- Wait.

1686
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,302
- His shins are one meter long.
- You can't even see his face.

1687
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:39,032
- Just from his legs...
- His shins...

1688
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,803
This is a bit problematic.

1689
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:42,802
What's that?

1690
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:44,603
This isn't right.

1691
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,843
But this is nice.

1692
00:58:48,683 --> 00:58:49,812
- Please check.
- Yes.

1693
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:51,113
Younger ones sure dress differently.

1694
00:58:51,183 --> 00:58:53,383
Come on. Why that picture?

1695
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:56,023
Come on. Why that picture?

1696
00:58:56,323 --> 00:58:57,782
You couldn't find my casual attire pictures?

1697
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,322
- What's this?
- Casual attire...

1698
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:01,623
I was wondering why my picture wouldn't show up.

1699
00:59:01,863 --> 00:59:03,562
- I was wondering why.
- Is that a jumpsuit?

1700
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:04,662
- What is it?
- I was so shocked.

1701
00:59:04,663 --> 00:59:06,892
Did you pay for this outfit?

1702
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:07,962
- This...
- Let me see.

1703
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:09,102
If you paid for this,

1704
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:10,462
- I won't let you live.
- It's body painting.

1705
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,872
I'm not in last place.

1706
00:59:11,873 --> 00:59:13,802
It's body painting. He drew on his body.

1707
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,542
I knew something was up when my picture didn't show up.

1708
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:17,643
What is this?

1709
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:19,013
This looks fine.

1710
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:21,043
That's fine, but remember what you saw.

1711
00:59:21,783 --> 00:59:23,883
He loves jeans.

1712
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:25,412
This is really hard.

1713
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:26,952
It's hard to choose, isn't it?

1714
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:28,723
(She is facing the greatest challenge of her life.)

1715
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,052
The best dresser?

1716
00:59:30,053 --> 00:59:31,222
(Trying to pick the best out of all the wrong answers)

1717
00:59:31,223 --> 00:59:32,322
Those shoes...

1718
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:34,352
It's hard to choose the winner too.

1719
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:35,363
Yes.

1720
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,723
- The shoes.
- Goodness.

1721
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:40,033
I chose the winner.

1722
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,202
The winner is... I'll show you.

1723
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,262
(Who is the best dresser?)

1724
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:44,602
It's my personal taste.

1725
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:45,902
Give the slippers to the winner.

1726
00:59:45,903 --> 00:59:48,103
(Who is the best dresser?)

1727
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:49,503
One, two, three.

1728
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:52,313
(The winner is Kim Dong Hyun.)

1729
00:59:52,973 --> 00:59:57,382
(He surpasses the actors and proudly places 1st.)

1730
00:59:57,383 --> 00:59:58,612
Why?

1731
00:59:58,613 --> 01:00:00,252
- Because...
- You must like sporty clothes.

1732
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:02,923
Yes. And he has a large build,

1733
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:04,952
which makes it harder for him to dress nicely.

1734
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:08,322
He matched the colors nicely too.

1735
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,292
I chose the outfit myself.

1736
01:00:10,293 --> 01:00:11,732
- Really?
- Even the shopping bag?

1737
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,962
That was in California.

1738
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:15,302
It suits you well. The background is perfect too.

1739
01:00:15,303 --> 01:00:16,862
Can you show the picture of the fifth place?

1740
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,502
- The 5th place?
- Yes. Show the 5th place.

1741
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:20,102
- Last place.
- Show us who's in last place.

1742
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:22,372
- Who is it?
- One, two, three.

1743
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:24,973
(They were neck and neck. Who will be in last place?)

1744
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,272
- Please.
- I knew it.

1745
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:29,142
(Worst fashion, Shin Seung Ho)

1746
01:00:29,143 --> 01:00:30,383
Body painting.

1747
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:32,682
- Yes.
- Please swipe.

1748
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:34,683
It's a shocking sight for me as well.

1749
01:00:35,323 --> 01:00:37,483
It looks fine like this.

1750
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:40,652
Everyone, you're left with...

1751
01:00:40,653 --> 01:00:42,392
the final schedule, which is a fan signing event...

1752
01:00:42,393 --> 01:00:43,963
in a big department store in Yeongdeungpo.

1753
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:45,593
This is...

1754
01:00:45,793 --> 01:00:47,793
You'll feel very embarrassed if you go dressed like this.

1755
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:49,333
Very.

1756
01:00:49,663 --> 01:00:51,573
So you'll play a group game...

1757
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:54,432
to win back the suits...

1758
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,672
you wore yesterday.

1759
01:00:56,673 --> 01:00:57,943
(We'll return your cool outfits from yesterday.)

1760
01:00:58,943 --> 01:00:59,943
Please.

1761
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:01,372
You all have good physiques,

1762
01:01:01,373 --> 01:01:02,682
so you'll look really cool in suits.

1763
01:01:02,683 --> 01:01:04,113
We came in very coolly.

1764
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:07,412
Your suits are ready.

1765
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,983
- It's like a tailor shop.
- It looks like a clothes shop.

1766
01:01:09,283 --> 01:01:10,882
(Five splendid suits are waiting for their owners.)

1767
01:01:10,883 --> 01:01:13,653
Imagine us going to a fan signing event in those.

1768
01:01:15,163 --> 01:01:16,462
For this group game,

1769
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:18,262
Eun Bi will join.

1770
01:01:18,263 --> 01:01:19,433
You don't know how it will turn out.

1771
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:22,162
The name of the game is, Ready, Action.

1772
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:23,463
- Ready, Action?
- Yes.

1773
01:01:23,703 --> 01:01:26,472
Eun Bi will read out a situation.

1774
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:28,372
(Eun Bi will relay a specific situation.)

1775
01:01:28,373 --> 01:01:30,072
You must act...

1776
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:31,642
according to the situation.

1777
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:32,643
- Act?
- Yes.

1778
01:01:32,644 --> 01:01:33,842
We have three actors.

1779
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,713
But it's not ordinary acting.

1780
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:40,253
You'll draw 1 out of 7 cards.

1781
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,022
The number you pick...

1782
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:44,483
is the intensity of your acting.

1783
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:48,052
(Act in Intensity 3)

1784
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:50,292
Eun Bi, after you watch them act,

1785
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:52,933
you have to list them according to the estimated intensity...

1786
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,202
of their acting, from the lowest to the highest.

1787
01:01:55,203 --> 01:01:56,663
- Not the numbers themselves?
- No.

1788
01:01:57,103 --> 01:01:59,072
- I need to get the order right.
- Yes.

1789
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:00,133
I understand.

1790
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:03,473
We'll play four rounds.

1791
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:05,573
Each time you fail a round,

1792
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,813
from the full set of suits,

1793
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:09,842
- What now?
- we'll remove one item.

1794
01:02:09,843 --> 01:02:12,313
(They'll remove 1 item each round.)

1795
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:14,312
It'll be either the trousers, the dress shirts, the jackets,

1796
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,523
or the ties and handkerchiefs.

1797
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:19,553
- My handkerchief...
- If we fail all four rounds,

1798
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,393
- we'll have to go like this.
- That's right.

1799
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:24,363
- I see.
- We can do this.

1800
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,862
We'll start right away.

1801
01:02:27,863 --> 01:02:29,263
Let's draw the cards first.

1802
01:02:30,503 --> 01:02:31,572
This is...

1803
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:32,872
(They each check a card in secret.)

1804
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:34,172
This is hard.

1805
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:36,602
(They each check a card in secret.)

1806
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:38,512
Shall we do a cheer first or start right away?

1807
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:40,412
- Let's cheer.
- Let's do a cheer.

1808
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:41,742
- Eun Bi.
- For the fan signing event.

1809
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:43,682
- Eun Bi, let's do this.
- For the fan signing event.

1810
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:45,712
- Eun Bi, let's do this.
- Eun Bi, let's do this.

1811
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:47,513
- Let's start.
- We can do this.

1812
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:49,123
Here I go.

1813
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,152
When one of the members says...

1814
01:02:51,153 --> 01:02:53,593
something boring during the shoot,

1815
01:02:53,823 --> 01:02:55,263
how do you react?

1816
01:02:55,763 --> 01:02:56,862
Level One,

1817
01:02:56,863 --> 01:02:59,363
you accept it with a generous smile.

1818
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:00,762
Level Seven,

1819
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:03,463
you get extremely furious that the staff has to calm you down.

1820
01:03:05,203 --> 01:03:07,972
For example, while we're shooting, someone suddenly does this.

1821
01:03:07,973 --> 01:03:10,672
Eun Bi, I remembered something very funny.

1822
01:03:10,673 --> 01:03:11,742
That's boring.

1823
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:13,813
(That's boring.)

1824
01:03:14,273 --> 01:03:15,882
Isn't that Level Seven?

1825
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:18,083
I haven't even said anything.

1826
01:03:18,313 --> 01:03:19,582
I haven't even said anything.

1827
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,452
What level was your acting?

1828
01:03:21,453 --> 01:03:22,453
Level Two?

1829
01:03:22,454 --> 01:03:24,552
- Without even listening to me?
- That's Level Two?

1830
01:03:24,553 --> 01:03:26,293
What you did just now was Level Two?

1831
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:29,193
- Okay.
- I haven't said anything yet.

1832
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,022
You have to be witty.

1833
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:32,662
- Make the right decisions.
- Yes.

1834
01:03:32,663 --> 01:03:33,793
- Watch him.
- I'll start.

1835
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:35,833
It's boring.

1836
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:38,733
That was good.

1837
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:40,372
- Don't say anything.
- He's smart.

1838
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:41,972
- Don't overthink it.
- I got it.

1839
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:43,243
- Okay.
- Next.

1840
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,443
Start.

1841
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:48,542
(Scoffing)

1842
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:49,842
- That's it.
- This is hard.

1843
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:51,242
- This is crazy.
- In this case...

1844
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:54,512
Is this lower or higher than Seung Ho?

1845
01:03:54,513 --> 01:03:55,652
Think carefully.

1846
01:03:55,653 --> 01:03:57,653
I should've acted like I was eating.

1847
01:03:57,783 --> 01:03:59,593
- Then...
- Redo it, then.

1848
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:01,053
- Can I?
- Of course.

1849
01:04:01,293 --> 01:04:03,323
(Eating)

1850
01:04:04,363 --> 01:04:05,493
(Scoffing)

1851
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:06,892
It's the same.

1852
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:07,893
(What's the difference?)

1853
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,332
- Is it the same?
- You just ate on top of it.

1854
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,333
Did I?

1855
01:04:10,334 --> 01:04:12,032
You just ate a few mouthfuls.

1856
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:13,233
It's the same.

1857
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:14,872
You should focus on fencing.

1858
01:04:14,873 --> 01:04:16,943
(Keep up your hard work in fencing.)

1859
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:18,872
I should focus on fencing.

1860
01:04:18,873 --> 01:04:21,043
Look at this. Be quiet!

1861
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:23,112
- Our greatest actor is ready.
- Be quiet!

1862
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,343
- Be quiet!
- Be quiet!

1863
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:26,683
- I'm looking forward to it.
- It's going to be emotional.

1864
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:29,223
Ready, action.

1865
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:31,722
(Surprised by the boring comment)

1866
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:33,123
My goodness.

1867
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:37,263
(Sighing)

1868
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:38,862
Should I have been more aggressive?

1869
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:39,863
No, Tae Hyun.

1870
01:04:39,993 --> 01:04:41,802
I got it.

1871
01:04:41,803 --> 01:04:42,902
That was nice.

1872
01:04:42,903 --> 01:04:44,802
Are all your numbers the same?

1873
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:46,032
- They're all different.
- No.

1874
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:47,773
I... What am I?

1875
01:04:48,503 --> 01:04:50,072
- It's my turn. Watch me.
- Okay.

1876
01:04:50,073 --> 01:04:51,542
- Watch carefully.
- Ready.

1877
01:04:51,543 --> 01:04:53,172
Someone said something boring.

1878
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:54,213
Action.

1879
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:56,413
(Scoffing)

1880
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:59,013
(Smiling silently)

1881
01:04:59,283 --> 01:05:00,412
(What?)

1882
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:01,483
That's it.

1883
01:05:02,283 --> 01:05:05,192
- You're all Level 1.
- You're all Level 1.

1884
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,023
- That's all Level One.
- Seriously.

1885
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:09,662
We still have Dong Hyun's acting.

1886
01:05:09,663 --> 01:05:11,362
Is it my turn? Okay.

1887
01:05:11,363 --> 01:05:12,633
(Eun Bi's last hope, Dong Hyun)

1888
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,603
Get out!

1889
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:17,902
(Very clear)

1890
01:05:17,903 --> 01:05:19,702
- Okay, that's it.
- Hey!

1891
01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:21,572
You jerk!

1892
01:05:21,573 --> 01:05:23,403
(There's nothing to be confused about.)

1893
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:26,613
- Get out!
- Hey.

1894
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:28,243
He's so clear-cut.

1895
01:05:29,213 --> 01:05:30,713
The four of us are hard to guess.

1896
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:32,813
- Yi Kyung and I...
- I...

1897
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,023
When Eun Bi calls your name,

1898
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,082
reveal your card.

1899
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,093
- Okay.
- Okay.

1900
01:05:39,723 --> 01:05:40,953
- Level One.
- Okay.

1901
01:05:41,393 --> 01:05:43,363
- Sang Uk.
- I thought so too.

1902
01:05:43,593 --> 01:05:45,893
- As in he has the lowest intensity.
- Sang Uk.

1903
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,892
(Sang Uk's intensity...)

1904
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:48,902
(is Level 3.)

1905
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:49,963
- What?
- What?

1906
01:05:51,503 --> 01:05:52,532
I told you.

1907
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,333
I should've swapped two of you.

1908
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,773
I even laughed.

1909
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:59,642
Let's continue first. Who's next?

1910
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:00,713
The second.

1911
01:06:00,843 --> 01:06:02,182
- Four...
- Yes.

1912
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:03,982
- I guessed this right.
- I did that just now.

1913
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:05,952
- Eun Bi said, "It's boring." - Exactly.

1914
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:07,382
So I did exactly that.

1915
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:09,123
- You did so well.
- Yes.

1916
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:11,922
- The 3rd... You're Level 1.
- We were swapped.

1917
01:06:11,923 --> 01:06:13,552
Look. I even smiled.

1918
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,822
(But Yi Kyung was Level 1.)

1919
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:16,392
(He acted generously.)

1920
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:17,722
You were Level One?

1921
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:20,092
- That wasn't Level One.
- I...

1922
01:06:20,093 --> 01:06:21,632
- Look.
- You got it all confused.

1923
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:23,232
I smiled just now.

1924
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,402
- It said generously.
- You...

1925
01:06:24,403 --> 01:06:25,703
- You're next.
- Yes.

1926
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,302
- And you're next.
- Yes.

1927
01:06:27,303 --> 01:06:28,332
- Yes.
- Mine was Level Six.

1928
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,272
- Why did you do that?
- I thought you were Level Three.

1929
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:32,112
Tae Hyun. I was the only one who acted...

1930
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,342
- "accept it generously." - Tae Hyun.

1931
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,672
You should've been more intense too.

1932
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:35,712
- Exactly.
- Tae Hyun too.

1933
01:06:35,713 --> 01:06:37,412
- Yours was most confusing.
- You...

1934
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:38,752
But Eun Bi got it.

1935
01:06:38,753 --> 01:06:40,382
- She guessed correctly.
- I felt it.

1936
01:06:40,383 --> 01:06:41,652
- See? She felt it.
- You...

1937
01:06:41,653 --> 01:06:43,182
- Yi Kyung was Level One?
- He...

1938
01:06:43,183 --> 01:06:44,282
That's nonsense.

1939
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:46,053
You should've acted with a lot less intensity than him.

1940
01:06:46,223 --> 01:06:48,352
I was Level One, so I should be less intense than they are.

1941
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,362
You should've just said, "It's so fun."

1942
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:52,493
But that doesn't suit the situation.

1943
01:06:52,663 --> 01:06:54,792
- I couldn't possibly laugh.
- Hold on.

1944
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,102
- That's not right.
- Yes.

1945
01:06:56,103 --> 01:06:57,302
- I'll do it my way.
- Yes.

1946
01:06:57,303 --> 01:06:58,332
- You should.
- Yes.

1947
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,832
Honestly speaking, you should've guessed right.

1948
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,202
- I'll do it my way.
- Eun Bi.

1949
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:03,942
- He's the best actor.
- I was really good.

1950
01:07:03,943 --> 01:07:05,142
- I'm a great actor.
- Yes.

1951
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:07,343
(She praises Dong Hyun's acting.)

1952
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,212
(On the other hand, the two actors are still a bit lost...)

1953
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:10,983
(because it's the first round.)

1954
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:12,713
- You failed.
- The handkerchief.

1955
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:14,782
Decide which piece of clothing to remove.

1956
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,153
- The tie.
- The handkerchief... Wait.

1957
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,052
We should remove the trousers.

1958
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:19,252
We'll be seated for the event anyway.

1959
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:20,392
We can't.

1960
01:07:20,393 --> 01:07:22,962
You can say that because you're wearing jeans.

1961
01:07:22,963 --> 01:07:24,893
We'll be seated.

1962
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,763
You want me to sit wearing this?

1963
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:29,663
(My bad.)

1964
01:07:30,003 --> 01:07:31,202
- Really?
- Since it's hot,

1965
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:32,532
- removing the jackets might work.
- Should we remove the jackets?

1966
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:33,902
- Jackets aren't a bad choice.
- Not bad.

1967
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,002
- We'll be sweaty.
- Since it's hot.

1968
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:36,373
- Jackets sound good.
- Not a bad choice.

1969
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:37,572
In 1, 2, 3.

1970
01:07:37,573 --> 01:07:38,612
- Jackets.
- Jackets.

1971
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:39,843
Remove the jackets, please.

1972
01:07:40,343 --> 01:07:41,442
Hold on.

1973
01:07:41,443 --> 01:07:43,113
No, that...

1974
01:07:43,543 --> 01:07:45,383
They look like boy band outfits. It's nice.

1975
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:46,713
Yes.

1976
01:07:47,753 --> 01:07:48,782
I'll start.

1977
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:50,753
(Round 2)

1978
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:52,723
You need to relieve yourself urgently,

1979
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:56,122
but the person in the toilet won't come out.

1980
01:07:56,123 --> 01:07:57,262
Why won't he come out?

1981
01:07:57,263 --> 01:07:58,733
How will you act?

1982
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:00,193
- That...
- Level One,

1983
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:02,603
you're very relaxed and chill.

1984
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:03,962
Level Seven,

1985
01:08:03,963 --> 01:08:05,833
your bladder is about to burst.

1986
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:07,673
Okay.

1987
01:08:08,803 --> 01:08:10,702
You're either relaxed or in a hurry.

1988
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:12,372
(The previous round's ace is thinking hard.)

1989
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:13,443
Let's go.

1990
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:15,513
This is the toilet door.

1991
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,043
I'll start.

1992
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:18,782
(He sees that the toilet is occupied.)

1993
01:08:18,783 --> 01:08:20,483
Someone is inside. He has to wait.

1994
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:24,652
(Rocking his body)

1995
01:08:24,653 --> 01:08:26,622
(Taking a peek)

1996
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:28,692
He isn't relaxed.

1997
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:29,822
I'll end it here.

1998
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,363
- I think I know.
- He doesn't look relaxed.

1999
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:34,163
That's the standard.

2000
01:08:34,663 --> 01:08:35,832
Here I go. I'll begin.

2001
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:36,963
(Yi Kyung's performance comes next.)

2002
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:39,102
(He groans and stamps his feet.)

2003
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:40,332
He's going crazy.

2004
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:43,043
(I see!)

2005
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:46,073
(Glaring and groaning)

2006
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:48,943
(You can tell that he really needs to go.)

2007
01:08:49,313 --> 01:08:50,382
That's it.

2008
01:08:50,383 --> 01:08:52,452
(Highly satisfied)

2009
01:08:52,453 --> 01:08:53,982
- Well done.
- I think...

2010
01:08:53,983 --> 01:08:55,152
the intensity is high,

2011
01:08:55,153 --> 01:08:57,122
- but I don't know by how much.
- That's right.

2012
01:08:57,123 --> 01:08:59,123
- You got it.
- We can discuss it, right?

2013
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:00,793
Here I go.

2014
01:09:02,123 --> 01:09:04,423
(Someone is inside.)

2015
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:07,462
(Uncaring)

2016
01:09:07,463 --> 01:09:09,332
- Okay. We got it.
- Okay.

2017
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:10,502
- Okay.
- Okay.

2018
01:09:10,503 --> 01:09:12,833
- So far, so good.
- Okay.

2019
01:09:13,273 --> 01:09:15,542
- But Sang Uk...
- There he goes.

2020
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:18,042
Sang Uk, we agreed to act like we were in a sitcom.

2021
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:19,943
- Okay. Hold on a second.
- Judge it precisely.

2022
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:22,242
Judge your order precisely.

2023
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:24,013
(He's even more nervous because he got criticized earlier.)

2024
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:26,182
(After careful consideration)

2025
01:09:26,183 --> 01:09:27,413
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2026
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,653
(Knocking hurriedly)

2027
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,692
(He sighs and moves hurriedly.)

2028
01:09:32,693 --> 01:09:34,152
This must be...

2029
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:36,563
(Eun Bi seems to be a bit confused.)

2030
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:39,032
(Let me make myself clear then.)

2031
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:40,563
That's good.

2032
01:09:41,063 --> 01:09:42,162
(He howls as if he's going through a crisis.)

2033
01:09:42,163 --> 01:09:43,833
I think I can get the number right.

2034
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:47,172
- All right.
- That was good.

2035
01:09:47,173 --> 01:09:49,203
(Okay, I got it.)

2036
01:09:49,703 --> 01:09:50,872
- All right.
- The last one.

2037
01:09:50,873 --> 01:09:52,572
There he goes.

2038
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:53,713
Let's do this.

2039
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:56,042
- Let's do this.
- Hold on a second.

2040
01:09:56,043 --> 01:09:57,983
We aren't having a talent show.

2041
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:00,153
Eun Bi, you need to focus.

2042
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,123
This isn't the National Peeing Show.

2043
01:10:04,183 --> 01:10:05,822
Eun Bi, please say, "Ready, action."

2044
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,523
Ready, action.

2045
01:10:09,223 --> 01:10:13,363
(Sucking in breath and groaning)

2046
01:10:13,693 --> 01:10:16,303
This is hard.

2047
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,502
Be friendlier with your performance.

2048
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,303
- Show us more.
- Be friendlier.

2049
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:23,672
(I'm okay.)

2050
01:10:23,673 --> 01:10:25,642
(No, I'm not okay.)

2051
01:10:25,643 --> 01:10:27,443
(I'm okay.)

2052
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:28,982
(Watching Dong Hyun's performance with an eagle eye)

2053
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:30,212
This one is hard.

2054
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:33,413
- There are awkward numbers.
- I know. He must've gotten one.

2055
01:10:33,913 --> 01:10:36,853
I think it's a match between Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung...

2056
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,053
when Eun Bi guesses.

2057
01:10:38,553 --> 01:10:40,152
- I...
- Our performances are confusing.

2058
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,093
I did my absolute best.

2059
01:10:42,223 --> 01:10:45,092
I watched Yi Kyung's performance and did my absolute best.

2060
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:47,162
- It's up to Eun Bi now.
- She needs to decide.

2061
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:49,132
- We've done our nest.
- Eun Bi needs to make the call.

2062
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:50,933
(She has the important task of setting them apart.)

2063
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:53,072
- I'll pick Level 1.
- The 1st one is easy.

2064
01:10:53,073 --> 01:10:54,533
The least intense one.

2065
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,643
- Level One.
- There you go.

2066
01:10:56,843 --> 01:10:58,402
It has to be him. His number has to be one.

2067
01:10:58,403 --> 01:10:59,672
It'll be bad if it's above two.

2068
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:00,772
It isn't above two.

2069
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:01,813
(What's the number on Tae Hyun's card?)

2070
01:11:01,873 --> 01:11:03,183
It's okay.

2071
01:11:03,243 --> 01:11:04,442
- Two.
- It's okay.

2072
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:05,553
(The intensity is Level 2.)

2073
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:06,912
The next one.

2074
01:11:06,913 --> 01:11:09,552
- That's right. Three.
- I think I was pretty accurate.

2075
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:10,752
- Okay.
- There you go.

2076
01:11:10,753 --> 01:11:12,052
(The intensity is Level 3.)

2077
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:13,093
There you go.

2078
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:14,523
- The next one.
- What?

2079
01:11:14,923 --> 01:11:16,062
This is the real deal.

2080
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,993
(Eun Bi's guess on the order is Tae Hyun, Seung Ho, and Dong Hyun.)

2081
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:21,692
(What's up with that facial expression?)

2082
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:24,633
I believe in you.

2083
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:32,712
- I did it! made it happen!
- We did it.

2084
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:35,612
I made it happen!

2085
01:11:35,613 --> 01:11:36,842
- We're set.
- I made it happen!

2086
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:39,852
- Dong Hyun, I believed in you.
- I...

2087
01:11:39,853 --> 01:11:42,282
Let me tell you what I did. I couldn't struggle too much...

2088
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:43,922
since I had to set myself apart from Level Four.

2089
01:11:43,923 --> 01:11:46,623
So, my facial expression was relaxed even though I was struggling.

2090
01:11:46,993 --> 01:11:49,262
My facial expression was relaxed even though I was struggling.

2091
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,123
(He was pretending to be relaxed even though he really had to go.)

2092
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:54,232
- Hey, we're set.
- Where is your card?

2093
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:55,532
Our numbers were among 5, 6, and 7.

2094
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:56,932
He and I...

2095
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:58,803
- acted it out and...
- It'll be a disaster if it's wrong.

2096
01:11:58,973 --> 01:12:00,702
- Reveal them at the same time.
- Okay, I got it.

2097
01:12:00,703 --> 01:12:02,503
- Reveal them on the count of three.
- Okay.

2098
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:04,873
One, two, three.

2099
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:06,573
Six.

2100
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,472
- We're set.
- Why?

2101
01:12:08,473 --> 01:12:09,582
If it's Level Six, we're set.

2102
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:11,082
There's no way you've acted that way when your number is seven.

2103
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:12,353
Your number is 5 or 6.

2104
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,282
- No way.
- No way.

2105
01:12:14,283 --> 01:12:16,082
- Your number has to be five.
- Seriously.

2106
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,823
Yi Kyung has 5, and Sang Uk has 6.

2107
01:12:18,353 --> 01:12:19,793
I'm 100 percent sure. Show us.

2108
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:21,122
Please let it be five.

2109
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:22,662
(Will they fail again or see the beginning of hope?)

2110
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:24,623
- Show us. Please let it be five.
- I'm sorry.

2111
01:12:25,463 --> 01:12:26,463
Five!

2112
01:12:26,464 --> 01:12:29,462
(We did it!)

2113
01:12:29,463 --> 01:12:30,763
That's incredible. She guessed correctly.

2114
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,473
She guessed correctly.

2115
01:12:32,803 --> 01:12:33,902
- That's incredible.
- Seriously.

2116
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:35,742
How did we choose these numbers? We chose 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2117
01:12:35,743 --> 01:12:36,773
(They succeed in securing one item.)

2118
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:38,402
- We're set. Pants.
- Pants.

2119
01:12:38,403 --> 01:12:41,312
- We have pants, so we're set.
- We have pants.

2120
01:12:41,313 --> 01:12:43,282
- We have pants, so we're set.
- Pants.

2121
01:12:43,283 --> 01:12:44,912
- We can go anywhere.
- That's right.

2122
01:12:44,913 --> 01:12:47,012
- Seriously.
- Everyone, hold on a second.

2123
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:49,253
Why is no one complimenting me when I've answered correctly?

2124
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,492
(Eun Bi is the number one contributor.)

2125
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,522
You did it.

2126
01:12:54,523 --> 01:12:56,723
We figured it out. We can do it.

2127
01:12:57,393 --> 01:12:59,132
Let's say we get one more item.

2128
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:01,332
- If we get a shirt, we'll be set.
- That's right.

2129
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,432
- That's right.
- Let's get one more item.

2130
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:03,662
- Let's get one more item.
- That's right.

2131
01:13:03,663 --> 01:13:05,303
Let's get one more item without being overly ambitious.

2132
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:06,803
Here I go.

2133
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:09,172
You've become the headliner...

2134
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:10,903
of a summer music festival.

2135
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:14,543
What kind of a dance will you show on the stage today?

2136
01:13:15,113 --> 01:13:19,283
Level One, a dance that doesn't have many movements.

2137
01:13:19,783 --> 01:13:23,123
Level Seven, a dance that turns the stage upside down.

2138
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:24,722
Okay. I'll nail it.

2139
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:27,223
(I'll turn things upside down today.)

2140
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:29,422
(Picking a song)

2141
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:30,423
Okay.

2142
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,292
Let me say this in advance.

2143
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:33,663
It's information they already have.

2144
01:13:33,863 --> 01:13:35,902
Level Seven is a dance that turns the stage upside down.

2145
01:13:35,903 --> 01:13:36,963
Focus on that.

2146
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:38,863
It turns the stage upside down.

2147
01:13:39,703 --> 01:13:42,802
I guess his number is pretty high up.

2148
01:13:42,803 --> 01:13:43,972
(Is that so?)

2149
01:13:43,973 --> 01:13:45,073
It turns the stage upside down.

2150
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,272
(He puts his body upside down.)

2151
01:13:47,273 --> 01:13:48,373
Watch.

2152
01:13:49,813 --> 01:13:52,352
(He lowers one leg by half.)

2153
01:13:52,353 --> 01:13:54,583
That's my intensity.

2154
01:13:56,283 --> 01:13:58,122
- I caught it. Not bad.
- Okay.

2155
01:13:58,123 --> 01:13:59,823
- Okay.
- I got the hang of it.

2156
01:14:00,193 --> 01:14:01,553
Eun Bi caught it as well.

2157
01:14:03,963 --> 01:14:06,263
(Gyrating his hips)

2158
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,492
That's hard.

2159
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:08,562
(She makes a memo as if she has figured it out.)

2160
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:09,633
That's hard.

2161
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,132
It should be an American dance.

2162
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:14,573
(It's Tae Hyun's turn.)

2163
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:16,002
Will you turn on the music?

2164
01:14:16,003 --> 01:14:17,443
Will you run down?

2165
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:22,342
(He appears a moment later with music,)

2166
01:14:22,343 --> 01:14:24,883
("Underwater" by Kwon Eun Bi.)

2167
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:28,282
(Passionate)

2168
01:14:28,283 --> 01:14:29,322
(Diligent)

2169
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:30,623
I know the intensity.

2170
01:14:30,823 --> 01:14:34,293
(He uses every dance move he knows to turn the stage upside down.)

2171
01:14:34,853 --> 01:14:36,363
This is driving me crazy.

2172
01:14:37,193 --> 01:14:39,532
Tae Hyun, what are you doing?

2173
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,393
(Tae Hyun, why are you trying so hard?)

2174
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:42,963
Okay.

2175
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:46,133
- This is driving me crazy.
- I could totally figure it out.

2176
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:49,872
(Sang Uk jumps up and down.)

2177
01:14:49,873 --> 01:14:51,072
That's it.

2178
01:14:51,073 --> 01:14:53,073
(Dong Hyun goes last.)

2179
01:14:53,473 --> 01:14:56,582
- His number must be high too.
- I know.

2180
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,513
- Gosh.
- They keep turning it upside down.

2181
01:14:59,253 --> 01:15:00,712
(Screaming)

2182
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:01,753
Okay.

2183
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:08,752
(The performance is like a deja vu.)

2184
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:09,763
Hey.

2185
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,522
What's this?

2186
01:15:11,523 --> 01:15:12,762
(Big confusion)

2187
01:15:12,763 --> 01:15:13,763
Hey.

2188
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:16,702
- Did we get the same number?
- What was that?

2189
01:15:16,703 --> 01:15:17,962
What was that?

2190
01:15:17,963 --> 01:15:19,472
- You know...
- Hold on.

2191
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,402
I have a feeling...

2192
01:15:21,403 --> 01:15:22,943
that one person didn't understand it.

2193
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:26,073
- I understood it.
- Eun Bi is confused about...

2194
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:29,683
- I'm confused about these two.
- She's confused about us.

2195
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:33,112
I performed before you did. Let's see what your number is.

2196
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:34,612
- Just you wait.
- Tae Hyun.

2197
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,623
- Tae Hyun, you need a scolding.
- No, you...

2198
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:40,592
(There's a heavy load on Eun Bi's shoulders.)

2199
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:42,193
- Okay. I'll begin.
- Okay.

2200
01:15:44,593 --> 01:15:45,593
The lowest level.

2201
01:15:45,593 --> 01:15:46,593
(She picks Sang Uk for the lowest intensity.)

2202
01:15:46,594 --> 01:15:47,893
- Really?
- Those two were confusing too.

2203
01:15:48,193 --> 01:15:49,502
- Those two were confusing too.
- That's right.

2204
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,003
- See?
- I'm not sure about this.

2205
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:52,402
- I...
- The second one.

2206
01:15:52,403 --> 01:15:53,473
(She picks Yi Kyung as the second one.)

2207
01:15:54,073 --> 01:15:55,672
- He was less intense than Yi Kyung.
- That's right.

2208
01:15:55,673 --> 01:15:57,202
Of course. I'm good at this.

2209
01:15:57,203 --> 01:15:59,373
(Yi Kyung's intensity is Level 4.)

2210
01:15:59,813 --> 01:16:00,913
- Five.
- His level is five.

2211
01:16:02,043 --> 01:16:04,542
- See? I told you so.
- What?

2212
01:16:04,543 --> 01:16:05,683
(Is Seung Ho Level 5?)

2213
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:09,582
- Six, seven.
- See? You punk. Hey.

2214
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:10,682
(But the result is the opposite.)

2215
01:16:10,683 --> 01:16:12,152
- I...
- I told you so.

2216
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:14,052
- Timeout.
- Are you crazy?

2217
01:16:14,053 --> 01:16:16,322
- Timeout.
- Since I had gone all out,

2218
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:18,223
- you should've done less.
- Timeout. Hear me out.

2219
01:16:18,723 --> 01:16:20,132
Seung Ho messed it up.

2220
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:23,302
He said that Level Seven turned the stage upside down.

2221
01:16:23,303 --> 01:16:25,832
Since he went upside down, I figured that he was Level Seven.

2222
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:26,833
- But...
- After all, Seung Ho can't dance.

2223
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:28,772
- But only one leg was upside down.
- Eun Bi, please explain it to him.

2224
01:16:28,773 --> 01:16:30,702
- What?
- Only one leg was upside down.

2225
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:31,872
- Not two legs.
- Didn't you see that?

2226
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:34,113
Wasn't he making number seven?

2227
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:36,012
Instead of keeping them straight,

2228
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:38,012
he put a leg down to make number seven.

2229
01:16:38,013 --> 01:16:40,112
- Hey, sit down.
- Dong Hyun.

2230
01:16:40,113 --> 01:16:42,922
- Dong Hyun, listen.
- What was this?

2231
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:44,982
(The betrayal of the ace member)

2232
01:16:44,983 --> 01:16:46,723
- What was this?
- Listen.

2233
01:16:47,253 --> 01:16:48,253
Do you admit...

2234
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:49,663
that your performance was the most intense?

2235
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:51,322
- He didn't think I had seven.
- I thought...

2236
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:52,592
- Seung Ho had seven.
- That's right.

2237
01:16:52,593 --> 01:16:53,932
- And I had 6.
- You had 6.

2238
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:56,302
"Why did Tae Hyun go all out when he had five?"

2239
01:16:56,303 --> 01:16:58,232
With that thought, I made it more intense than his performance.

2240
01:16:58,233 --> 01:16:59,472
- So...
- Only you understood it wrong.

2241
01:16:59,473 --> 01:17:00,732
Only you understood it wrong.

2242
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:03,602
Listen. Who will understand if you do a headstand and say...

2243
01:17:03,603 --> 01:17:05,602
that you turned the stage upside down only by half?

2244
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:06,842
- Everyone.
- Everyone?

2245
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:08,742
- Everyone except for you.
- Everyone?

2246
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:10,043
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

2247
01:17:10,883 --> 01:17:12,242
Okay.

2248
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:13,613
(In that case, I'm sorry.)

2249
01:17:14,053 --> 01:17:16,523
Take out the tie.

2250
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,592
- Take out the tie.
- This is our last chance.

2251
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,593
Eun Bi is incredible.

2252
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,892
- Eun Bi is good.
- She's good.

2253
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:24,122
- She got all other levels.
- My dance was the most adequate.

2254
01:17:24,123 --> 01:17:25,892
- Had he done well...
- Exactly.

2255
01:17:25,893 --> 01:17:27,293
Eun Bi is good.

2256
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:30,233
- Everyone, this is the last round.
- It's the last round.

2257
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:34,332
When you don't like the woman you meet on a blind date,

2258
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,773
how do you act?

2259
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:40,843
Level One, showing manners without making it obvious.

2260
01:17:41,643 --> 01:17:44,082
Level Seven, showing the worst behaviors...

2261
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,542
that'll make her lose all interest.

2262
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:47,412
(Showing the worst behaviors that'll make her lose all interest)

2263
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,053
It's a given that I don't like this woman.

2264
01:17:49,383 --> 01:17:50,983
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

2265
01:17:52,153 --> 01:17:54,353
I'm sitting across from her.

2266
01:17:54,393 --> 01:17:56,462
It's a restaurant. A Korean restaurant.

2267
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,893
(Man 1 sits across from his date and eats a meal.)

2268
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:01,293
(He eats with his brows furrowed.)

2269
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:03,403
Gosh, why is the soup so salty?

2270
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,032
(From the start, they get a man with a trashy personality.)

2271
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:08,203
What's this?

2272
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:11,243
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

2273
01:18:11,543 --> 01:18:13,772
- The thing is...
- Make it extreme.

2274
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:14,812
Make it extreme.

2275
01:18:14,813 --> 01:18:17,243
I keep my food bland.

2276
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,882
- Does it come from his experience?
- That has to be...

2277
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:21,352
Auntie! This soup is salty!

2278
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:22,823
(Auntie! This soup is salty!)

2279
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:24,422
I'm sorry.

2280
01:18:24,423 --> 01:18:25,552
(His duality rivals that of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.)

2281
01:18:25,553 --> 01:18:27,693
Hold on. That was unbelievable.

2282
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:30,023
Is there number 20?

2283
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:32,223
- Is there number 20?
- Watch.

2284
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:34,832
I imagined myself as his date.

2285
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,632
I lost all interest.

2286
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:38,863
- Okay.
- That was the absolute worst.

2287
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:40,032
It was successful then.

2288
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:41,372
(My performance was successful then.)

2289
01:18:41,373 --> 01:18:43,343
- But... You did well.
- Yes.

2290
01:18:43,603 --> 01:18:44,742
Okay.

2291
01:18:44,743 --> 01:18:46,412
- Sang Uk.
- That was the absolute worst."

2292
01:18:46,413 --> 01:18:47,543
(Since he was the worst, figuring out the level was easy.)

2293
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:48,973
As for me...

2294
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:52,283
Hello.

2295
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:54,013
You're really kind.

2296
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:56,223
What would you like to have?

2297
01:18:56,253 --> 01:18:59,122
This place has tasty pasta and steak.

2298
01:18:59,123 --> 01:19:00,722
It's on me.

2299
01:19:00,723 --> 01:19:02,422
Would you like some wine as well?

2300
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:03,563
Doesn't he like her?

2301
01:19:03,593 --> 01:19:04,623
It looks like...

2302
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:06,232
It looks like he'll ask for another date.

2303
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:08,232
It's a given that you don't like her.

2304
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:09,462
- Hold on.
- Well done.

2305
01:19:09,463 --> 01:19:11,002
Is there a negative number?

2306
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:12,162
Well done.

2307
01:19:12,163 --> 01:19:13,603
(Is there a negative number?)

2308
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:17,343
(Now comes Dong Hyun, the ace member and traitor.)

2309
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:19,142
Hello.

2310
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:20,972
(Chuckling)

2311
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:23,042
He's doing well. Not bad.

2312
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:24,083
The way he acts...

2313
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:27,282
He acts with his teeth.

2314
01:19:27,283 --> 01:19:28,513
(He acts with his teeth.)

2315
01:19:28,553 --> 01:19:29,622
He uses his teeth.

2316
01:19:29,623 --> 01:19:31,282
He acts with his front teeth.

2317
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:32,323
(He shows emotions with his teeth.)

2318
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:34,593
You're handsome. I mean, you're beautiful.

2319
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:36,763
He's acting.

2320
01:19:37,863 --> 01:19:40,063
You're beautiful.

2321
01:19:40,793 --> 01:19:42,332
He did his best.

2322
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,802
- We did our best.
- That's right.

2323
01:19:43,803 --> 01:19:46,172
- We're athletes.
- We're doing our best.

2324
01:19:46,173 --> 01:19:47,173
Well done.

2325
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:49,442
I see.

2326
01:19:49,443 --> 01:19:50,472
(I see.)

2327
01:19:50,473 --> 01:19:51,702
You know,

2328
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:52,742
I left my wallet at home.

2329
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:54,213
I'll send the money to your account.

2330
01:19:54,543 --> 01:19:55,712
I'll pay for half.

2331
01:19:55,713 --> 01:19:57,543
(His tone is dry.)

2332
01:19:57,813 --> 01:19:59,083
This is hard.

2333
01:19:59,683 --> 01:20:02,013
You must have one of the in-between numbers.

2334
01:20:03,123 --> 01:20:04,822
(Tae Hyun's performance...)

2335
01:20:04,823 --> 01:20:06,092
It's my turn.

2336
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,593
(will change the difficulty level for Eun Bi.)

2337
01:20:08,723 --> 01:20:11,193
Why is the soup so salty?

2338
01:20:11,593 --> 01:20:12,963
- What? Is it salty again?
- Auntie!

2339
01:20:13,363 --> 01:20:14,493
For goodness' sake!

2340
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:16,762
Why did I even come here?

2341
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:18,202
I'm such a fool.

2342
01:20:18,203 --> 01:20:19,703
I should've just stayed home.

2343
01:20:20,773 --> 01:20:22,572
(He collapses to the floor...)

2344
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:26,312
(and suddenly shows a water show.)

2345
01:20:26,313 --> 01:20:27,372
Okay.

2346
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:30,113
Why did I crawl all the way here...

2347
01:20:30,143 --> 01:20:31,983
despite my busy schedule?

2348
01:20:32,443 --> 01:20:34,052
The soup is too salty!

2349
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:35,612
(Man 5 has so many complaints.)

2350
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:36,982
- Okay. That's good.
- Two people made it obvious.

2351
01:20:36,983 --> 01:20:38,322
- Tae Hyun.
- Okay.

2352
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:40,922
- It was like what I said earlier.
- Okay. We're set.

2353
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:43,092
It was like what I said earlier.

2354
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,962
- You need to get it right, Eun Bi.
- Okay.

2355
01:20:44,963 --> 01:20:45,992
It'll be a disaster if you don't get it right.

2356
01:20:45,993 --> 01:20:48,132
- The awkward numbers are confusing.
- But it's okay.

2357
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:49,332
I'm confused about the two of you.

2358
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,502
It's understandable,

2359
01:20:50,503 --> 01:20:52,203
- but think hard.
- Now, it's Eun Bi's fight.

2360
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:54,332
- I'll start with the highest.
- The highest.

2361
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,932
- The highest number.
- That's it.

2362
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:57,173
- Okay.
- That's it.

2363
01:20:57,443 --> 01:20:59,043
- The next one.
- That's it.

2364
01:20:59,073 --> 01:21:00,342
Six. That's right.

2365
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:01,812
- It has to be 6 or 5.
- It's 6.

2366
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:03,712
- Okay. Well done. That's right.
- Good.

2367
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:04,882
Dong Hyun.

2368
01:21:04,883 --> 01:21:06,413
(She picks Dong Hyun as having the third highest intensity.)

2369
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:08,613
There you go. Not bad.

2370
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:09,983
Not bad.

2371
01:21:10,023 --> 01:21:11,322
Not bad. This is good.

2372
01:21:11,323 --> 01:21:13,052
Your number has to be 3. It'll be wrong if it's 5.

2373
01:21:13,053 --> 01:21:14,652
My number can either be five...

2374
01:21:14,653 --> 01:21:16,293
- or three.
- I kept things ambiguous.

2375
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:18,392
- It has to be three.
- You never know.

2376
01:21:18,393 --> 01:21:20,692
My number is 4, right? His number has to be 3.

2377
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:22,162
- I think Yi Kyung has 3.
- My guess is 5.

2378
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:23,432
I think Yi Kyung has 5.

2379
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:24,762
- My number is 4, right?
- I think Yi Kyung has 5.

2380
01:21:24,763 --> 01:21:26,533
- My guess is five too.
- Do you know why?

2381
01:21:26,603 --> 01:21:28,272
Dong Hyun showed his dislike,

2382
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:29,973
but Yi Kyung didn't.

2383
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,943
(Will Seung Ho be correct?)

2384
01:21:35,269 --> 01:21:36,808
Dong Hyun showed his dislike,

2385
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,409
but Yi Kyung didn't.

2386
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:43,308
(Is Yi Kyung's number 2 or 3 as Seung Ho has guessed?)

2387
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:44,908
You pay attention to details!

2388
01:21:44,909 --> 01:21:46,678
(Seung Ho's judgment was correct.)

2389
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:47,779
You pay attention to details!

2390
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:49,949
- Hey!
- It's correct!

2391
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,618
You pay attention to details!

2392
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:56,488
(We'll wear normal clothes now.)

2393
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:57,658
Eun Bi.

2394
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:58,759
You pay attention to details!

2395
01:21:58,989 --> 01:22:01,159
Eun Bi, well done. You're the best.

2396
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:02,898
Eun Bi did so well. Thank you.

2397
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:04,728
- Eun Bi, well done.
- Eun Bi.

2398
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:05,928
She did an incredible job.

2399
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:08,268
She's so witty. Things were really uncertain.

2400
01:22:08,269 --> 01:22:09,709
She's so witty.

2401
01:22:09,739 --> 01:22:12,439
You've succeeded in two rounds.

2402
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:14,979
You've acquired shirts and pants.

2403
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:16,948
All right.

2404
01:22:16,949 --> 01:22:18,208
Eun Bi, thank you so much.

2405
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:19,878
Congratulations. Thank goodness.

2406
01:22:19,879 --> 01:22:21,679
- Eun Bi is the best.
- Thank goodness.

2407
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,289
Are the shoes included?

2408
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:25,018
- No.
- Aren't the shoes included?

2409
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:26,049
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

2410
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:32,158
(Although there are no fancy dress shoes,)

2411
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:37,269
(everyone's fashion gets an upgrade!)

2412
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:41,139
(Only Seung Ho has the perfect outfit.)

2413
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:43,738
I'm satisfied with what I have.

2414
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:44,909
This is incredible.

2415
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:46,638
- Seriously.
- Eun Bi, thank you.

2416
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:47,779
Eun Bi, come again.

2417
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:49,338
Thank you.

2418
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:50,349
(We'll return with cool looks.)

2419
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:51,678
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2420
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,179
(It's time to go and meet the fans.)

2421
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,618
Why did you take away my shoes?

2422
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:56,589
- What are we doing?
- Seriously...

2423
01:22:57,589 --> 01:22:58,948
Seriously,

2424
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:00,258
it feels like I'm riding a horse.

2425
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:01,559
It's so nice.

2426
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,259
It feels like I'm riding a horse.

2427
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,488
Here comes a general.

2428
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:06,498
(Pretty satisfied)

2429
01:23:06,499 --> 01:23:08,498
- This is hard on me.
- Exactly.

2430
01:23:08,499 --> 01:23:10,298
Why did you take my shoes?

2431
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:12,399
You punk, why did you take my shoes?

2432
01:23:12,669 --> 01:23:13,868
Thank you.

2433
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:15,798
Put him down quickly. Behind you,

2434
01:23:15,799 --> 01:23:16,939
the horses are backed up.

2435
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:18,668
Hello.

2436
01:23:18,669 --> 01:23:19,839
Thank you.

2437
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:22,008
That's what you get for taking my shoes.

2438
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:23,078
My goodness.

2439
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,979
This puts me at a disadvantage.

2440
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:27,879
Sang Uk, is he heavy? Is it doable?

2441
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:30,548
- It's doable. He weighs 90kg.
- Nice.

2442
01:23:30,549 --> 01:23:32,088
It's only doable when the distance is short.

2443
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:33,118
It was very comfortable.

2444
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:34,888
You'll break into a sweat. You're panting now.

2445
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:35,918
Sweat is the problem.

2446
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:37,229
- That's right.
- Sweat is the problem.

2447
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:40,358
Sir, please turn on the air conditioner at full blast.

2448
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:41,729
- It's closed.
- Here.

2449
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:42,969
Thank you.

2450
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,339
(They go to the fan signing event as they enjoy air conditioning.)

2451
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:48,568
The weather is amazing these days.

2452
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:51,039
(They drive under the blue sky.)

2453
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:55,909
(They arrive at their destination.)

2454
01:23:56,679 --> 01:23:59,009
(It's the location of today's fan signing event.)

2455
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:02,249
(It's always full of people.)

2456
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,489
(It's a big shopping center at the center of Seoul.)

2457
01:24:07,059 --> 01:24:08,459
Seriously,

2458
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:10,989
it would've been a disaster to come here in a tank top.

2459
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:13,399
I don't think the tank top was a problem.

2460
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:15,499
The pants were a bigger problem.

2461
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,598
Let's get off.

2462
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:18,668
My goodness.

2463
01:24:18,669 --> 01:24:19,839
(Okay, here we go.)

2464
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:21,739
(Seung Ho got his look back with the dress shoes.)

2465
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:24,239
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk are wearing slippers and a suit.)

2466
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:25,908
(And...)

2467
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:26,939
Tae Hyun first.

2468
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:29,009
(Chuckling)

2469
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:30,748
It's awkward, right?

2470
01:24:30,749 --> 01:24:32,248
(Two older members are barefoot.)

2471
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:33,348
- Tae Hyun.
- I'm sorry.

2472
01:24:33,349 --> 01:24:34,378
- My goodness.
- Tae Hyun.

2473
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:35,419
You're a horse.

2474
01:24:35,949 --> 01:24:37,548
(Under the scorching sun)

2475
01:24:37,549 --> 01:24:38,648
We can't go like this.

2476
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:39,688
I'm sorry.

2477
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,218
- Why did you take my shoes?
- I'll give them back.

2478
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:42,219
I'll give them back.

2479
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,288
I like this.

2480
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:45,388
- Tae Hyun, isn't it nice?
- No.

2481
01:24:45,389 --> 01:24:46,528
(I like it too.)

2482
01:24:46,529 --> 01:24:47,698
He brought it upon himself.

2483
01:24:47,699 --> 01:24:48,958
- Why did you take my shoes?
- I'll give them back.

2484
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,628
(He spots something.)

2485
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:53,138
They have the shoes.

2486
01:24:53,139 --> 01:24:54,338
- Stop.
- What?

2487
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,638
The sun is too strong.

2488
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:56,709
(The slippers the younger members acquired.)

2489
01:24:56,739 --> 01:24:58,668
- Sang Uk, will you lend them?
- Why did you take my shoes?

2490
01:24:58,669 --> 01:25:00,138
- I'll lend them.
- Here.

2491
01:25:00,139 --> 01:25:01,209
I'm okay with this.

2492
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:02,909
- No, Dong Hyun.
- What?

2493
01:25:03,549 --> 01:25:04,848
- All right.
- Here.

2494
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:06,378
- Put me down.
- The camera...

2495
01:25:06,379 --> 01:25:08,018
- Isn't this the picture you wanted?
- No.

2496
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:09,748
We can't go on like this. The sun is too strong.

2497
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:10,749
- Thank you.
- It's impossible.

2498
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,819
You need to take me there.

2499
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:14,658
(Heave-ho!)

2500
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:16,729
Why did you take my slippers?

2501
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,629
- It was your punishment.
- Don't give them back.

2502
01:25:18,859 --> 01:25:19,859
It was like riding a horse.

2503
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:20,859
- I liked it.
- The sun is too strong.

2504
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,228
Hold on. It's too much.

2505
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:24,769
- We can't make them sweaty.
- Okay.

2506
01:25:25,099 --> 01:25:26,768
I can't do it because it'll make me sweaty.

2507
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:27,868
We can't make them sweaty.

2508
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:28,898
(Thankfully, they enter the place on their feet.)

2509
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:29,968
This place...

2510
01:25:29,969 --> 01:25:31,669
- But...
- We're in slippers.

2511
01:25:31,869 --> 01:25:34,038
It would've been a disaster. This is legit.

2512
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:35,409
How many stories are there?

2513
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:38,149
What's that? Why did you make it so big?

2514
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,048
(The signing station is in the middle of the shopping center.)

2515
01:25:44,049 --> 01:25:46,188
Look at the line!

2516
01:25:46,189 --> 01:25:49,859
(The size of the crowd matches that of the idol fandom.)

2517
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:56,059
(Fan signing event)

2518
01:25:56,299 --> 01:25:57,299
(Entering)

2519
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,599
Look at the line!

2520
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:01,038
- Hello.
- It could've been bad.

2521
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:02,698
- Isn't this too much?
- Hello.

2522
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,809
Hello.

2523
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:07,408
- It could've been bad.
- There are people on other floors.

2524
01:26:07,409 --> 01:26:08,608
(They become flustered by the scale of the event.)

2525
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:10,079
- Isn't this too much?
- My goodness.

2526
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:11,548
Eun Bi made this possible.

2527
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:12,549
Eun Bi.

2528
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:13,718
Eun Bi, thank you.

2529
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:14,748
(We avoided the worst thanks to you.)

2530
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:16,378
If it weren't for Eun Bi, it would've been a disaster.

2531
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,649
It really would've been a disaster.

2532
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:19,048
Hello.

2533
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:20,058
(They enter the photo wall in much better outfits.)

2534
01:26:20,059 --> 01:26:21,589
- Hello.
- Hello.

2535
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:23,658
The slippers...

2536
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:24,688
(Embarrassed)

2537
01:26:24,689 --> 01:26:26,458
- Is this right?
- I feel naked...

2538
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:27,628
- because I'm in slippers.
- Hey,

2539
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:30,128
be grateful that we're in proper clothes.

2540
01:26:30,129 --> 01:26:31,728
Before we begin,

2541
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,669
we'll have a photo time.

2542
01:26:33,799 --> 01:26:36,199
Please put down the cameras and microphones.

2543
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:37,939
Gosh, what's going on?

2544
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:39,608
Look to the front.

2545
01:26:39,609 --> 01:26:42,209
(The front)

2546
01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:43,848
Look to the left.

2547
01:26:43,849 --> 01:26:46,309
(The left)

2548
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:49,318
Now,

2549
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:51,018
look to the right. The first floor.

2550
01:26:51,019 --> 01:26:52,019
Shall we do this?

2551
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:55,259
Hello.

2552
01:26:56,829 --> 01:26:58,759
Hello, everyone.

2553
01:26:59,229 --> 01:27:02,058
Have you heard of the TV show,

2554
01:27:02,059 --> 01:27:03,268
Handsome Guys?

2555
01:27:03,269 --> 01:27:04,428
- Yes!
- Yes!

2556
01:27:04,429 --> 01:27:05,528
Thank you.

2557
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:07,469
Firstly, we'd like to apologize...

2558
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,438
for wearing slippers...

2559
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:11,509
to this event.

2560
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:13,478
We hope you have a fun time.

2561
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,938
Please give Handsome Guys a lot of love.

2562
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,048
Thank you.

2563
01:27:17,049 --> 01:27:19,549
(Please give us a lot of love and attention.)

2564
01:27:20,419 --> 01:27:23,389
People will be invited over from the spot.

2565
01:27:23,519 --> 01:27:25,588
The people who get invited can get an autograph...

2566
01:27:25,589 --> 01:27:28,219
from just one member of their choice.

2567
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:29,488
(There's something hidden behind this again.)

2568
01:27:29,489 --> 01:27:30,788
Based on the results of the fan signing event,

2569
01:27:30,789 --> 01:27:33,128
the member with the lowest number of autographs done...

2570
01:27:33,129 --> 01:27:35,428
must stay on his own to study fashion.

2571
01:27:35,429 --> 01:27:38,298
(That member will stay on his own to study about fashion.)

2572
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:40,239
It wasn't over.

2573
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:42,739
Gosh, this is bad.

2574
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:45,308
(The real mission of the fan signing event)

2575
01:27:45,309 --> 01:27:47,439
(Sign the most autographs for the mans!)

2576
01:27:47,609 --> 01:27:50,609
(It's a popularity battle on the spot.)

2577
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:54,279
(Who will be the one to get the penalty?)

2578
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,819
I think Tae Hyun will win by a landslide with this one.

2579
01:27:57,249 --> 01:27:59,349
Tae Hyun is loved by people of all ages.

2580
01:27:59,889 --> 01:28:01,359
I think Sang Uk will have a lot of fans.

2581
01:28:01,589 --> 01:28:02,589
(I think that too.)

2582
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,528
Should we go out to gather people,

2583
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:05,759
or should we just sit here?

2584
01:28:06,389 --> 01:28:07,998
Should we just sit here and play it fair?

2585
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:09,428
- Yes. Let's sit.
- Just sit here?

2586
01:28:09,429 --> 01:28:10,628
- No signaling with the eyes...
- Okay.

2587
01:28:10,629 --> 01:28:11,868
- or making noises.
- Okay.

2588
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:13,399
- Let's play it fair.
- Let's play it fair.

2589
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:16,038
- Gosh.
- We will invite the first fan.

2590
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:17,139
I feel anxious.

2591
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:20,838
(The first fan enters.)

2592
01:28:20,839 --> 01:28:23,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

2593
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,448
(What are you guys doing?)

2594
01:28:26,449 --> 01:28:28,148
You said we shouldn't be signaling with our eyes.

2595
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:29,179
Hello.

2596
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:30,719
Is this "I Am Solo?"

2597
01:28:30,919 --> 01:28:32,348
It feels like the time to make the final decision...

2598
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,519
for a dating show.

2599
01:28:34,589 --> 01:28:35,918
(Testosterone outside, estrogen inside)

2600
01:28:35,919 --> 01:28:37,629
(The romantic guy, Dong Hyun)

2601
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:39,358
(The one loved by all age groups)

2602
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:40,629
(The original national first love, Tae Hyun)

2603
01:28:41,059 --> 01:28:42,298
(The Hand of the Handsome Guys)

2604
01:28:42,299 --> 01:28:43,599
(The charming young one, Sang Uk)

2605
01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:44,968
(The Some of the Handsome Guys)

2606
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:45,969
(The rising testosterone-guy, Seung Ho)

2607
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:47,638
(Who will she pick for her first impression?)

2608
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:49,798
- Is this "I Am Solo?" - We still should greet her.

2609
01:28:49,799 --> 01:28:51,109
(Startled)

2610
01:28:51,709 --> 01:28:53,678
(She walks forward right away?)

2611
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:54,909
You can't go that way.

2612
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:57,209
(I can't?)

2613
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,349
(She makes a sharp left turn.)

2614
01:28:59,909 --> 01:29:01,018
(She isn't coming here?)

2615
01:29:01,019 --> 01:29:02,019
Gosh.

2616
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:04,489
(Could it be me?)

2617
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,018
(Torn)

2618
01:29:06,019 --> 01:29:07,158
(She makes a sharp curve.)

2619
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:08,219
No!

2620
01:29:08,789 --> 01:29:09,919
You can't go that way!

2621
01:29:10,689 --> 01:29:11,989
- Lucky you.
- No!

2622
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:14,398
(Feeling thankful)

2623
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:16,258
- This is bad.
- This is "I Am Solo."

2624
01:29:16,259 --> 01:29:17,829
(Depressed)

2625
01:29:17,929 --> 01:29:19,598
- What's your name?
- I'm Park Joo Yeon.

2626
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:20,838
Thank you, Joo Yeon.

2627
01:29:20,839 --> 01:29:21,969
You chose me out of everyone.

2628
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:23,308
One, two, three.

2629
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:24,568
(He provides a perfect fan service even with a photo.)

2630
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,238
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2631
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:27,708
- I love you.
- Gosh. He got one vote.

2632
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:28,839
Thank you.

2633
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:30,549
Goodbye.

2634
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:32,478
(Yi Kyung became the first one to sign an autograph.)

2635
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:34,819
We'll bring in the next fan.

2636
01:29:35,349 --> 01:29:36,648
This is bad.

2637
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:38,688
Up next is a young fan.

2638
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:40,759
Please come to the front.

2639
01:29:40,889 --> 01:29:43,289
Hold on. They have a bag of LEGO.

2640
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:44,929
You're right.

2641
01:29:45,459 --> 01:29:48,299
It must be a gift for the child. He's right next to her.

2642
01:29:48,459 --> 01:29:49,759
What's your name?

2643
01:29:49,999 --> 01:29:52,768
My name is Song Yu Jun, and I'm from Gumi.

2644
01:29:52,769 --> 01:29:53,799
- Gumi?
- Gumi?

2645
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:55,569
That's quite far away.

2646
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:58,908
Will it be based on the son's favorite star...

2647
01:29:58,909 --> 01:30:01,439
or the mother's favorite star, or will it be done separately?

2648
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:03,578
My son will be the one to decide.

2649
01:30:03,579 --> 01:30:06,149
- The son.
- The son will be the one to decide.

2650
01:30:06,749 --> 01:30:09,619
He might've watched "The Great Escape."

2651
01:30:10,249 --> 01:30:11,718
(Seung Ho gets expectant as well.)

2652
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:14,219
The son will be the one to decide where to go.

2653
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:16,288
- It's Dong Hyun.
- I think it's you, Tae Hyun.

2654
01:30:16,289 --> 01:30:17,628
- It's Dong Hyun.
- The son will be the one to decide.

2655
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:18,659
Please.

2656
01:30:19,089 --> 01:30:21,098
(Who will the second fan pick?)

2657
01:30:21,099 --> 01:30:22,529
Who will it be?

2658
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:23,968
It's Dong Hyun.

2659
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:25,099
(Walking forward without hesitation)

2660
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:27,468
(He chooses Dong Hyun.)

2661
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:30,039
Thank you!

2662
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,038
Thank you!

2663
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:33,639
(Disappointed)

2664
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:36,439
What do you like about Dong Hyun?

2665
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:39,208
His muscles.

2666
01:30:39,209 --> 01:30:40,549
- You like his muscles?
- Yes.

2667
01:30:41,179 --> 01:30:42,878
(He's so cute.)

2668
01:30:42,879 --> 01:30:43,888
Here you are.

2669
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:44,889
- Here's my autograph.
- Thank you.

2670
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:46,088
Let's take a picture now.

2671
01:30:46,089 --> 01:30:47,558
- Do you know this?
- Yes.

2672
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:49,489
- Let's do it together.
- One, two, three.

2673
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:52,459
Thank you. Bye.

2674
01:30:52,559 --> 01:30:54,258
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2675
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,298
Thank you.

2676
01:30:55,299 --> 01:30:57,299
What a relief.

2677
01:30:57,769 --> 01:30:59,829
I feel a lot more relaxed after getting one vote.

2678
01:31:00,299 --> 01:31:01,999
The next person may enter.

2679
01:31:02,939 --> 01:31:03,939
Hello.

2680
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,368
(Rushing forward)

2681
01:31:05,369 --> 01:31:06,568
- Hello.
- It's Dong Hyun.

2682
01:31:06,569 --> 01:31:08,008
(It's me again?)

2683
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:09,109
It's Dong Hyun.

2684
01:31:09,509 --> 01:31:10,909
Gosh, it's Dong Hyun.

2685
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:12,908
Thank you! Gosh.

2686
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:14,249
I'll get an autograph from him.

2687
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:15,379
Gosh!

2688
01:31:15,849 --> 01:31:16,849
(What?)

2689
01:31:16,849 --> 01:31:17,849
(I'll get an autograph from him.)

2690
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:20,418
(I'll get an autograph from Tae Hyun.)

2691
01:31:20,419 --> 01:31:22,558
My eyes met with Dong Hyun's eyes.

2692
01:31:22,559 --> 01:31:23,589
Thank you.

2693
01:31:24,559 --> 01:31:26,158
(I got happy for nothing.)

2694
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,198
Gosh!

2695
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,228
It's a great honor.

2696
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:29,798
Gosh, not at all. I'm the one who feels honored.

2697
01:31:29,799 --> 01:31:31,769
This has never happened before.

2698
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:33,468
It's my first time getting a celebrity's autograph.

2699
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:35,339
Gosh, thank you.

2700
01:31:35,939 --> 01:31:36,939
(They signed 0 autographs.)

2701
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,339
This is really bad.

2702
01:31:39,339 --> 01:31:41,178
It's a male fan next.

2703
01:31:41,179 --> 01:31:43,478
- Dong Hyun is feeling hopeful.
- If it's a male fan...

2704
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:46,348
If it's a male fan, there's a big chance...

2705
01:31:46,349 --> 01:31:48,849
that he'll go to Dong Hyun or me.

2706
01:31:49,019 --> 01:31:50,148
Seeing the thickness of his calves,

2707
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:51,748
I can tell that he enjoys working out.

2708
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:53,658
- He enjoys watching MMA.
- Stop getting his attention.

2709
01:31:53,659 --> 01:31:56,759
I have a feeling that he'll come to me.

2710
01:31:56,989 --> 01:31:59,059
Please head to the one you want to get an autograph from!

2711
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:01,158
Dong Hyun.

2712
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:02,159
(You got my signal, right?)

2713
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:05,428
Okay! Thank you so much.

2714
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:08,498
I knew it! Hello!

2715
01:32:08,499 --> 01:32:09,538
Thank you!

2716
01:32:09,539 --> 01:32:11,468
(Sighing)

2717
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:13,479
Is there a reason you're a fan of Dong Hyun?

2718
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:15,938
I enjoy watching his YouTube channel.

2719
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:16,948
Thank you.

2720
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,508
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

2721
01:32:18,509 --> 01:32:19,648
- What a relief.
- Right away,

2722
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:21,519
- let's let in the next person.
- What a relief.

2723
01:32:21,979 --> 01:32:23,719
(The next person is a male fan as well.)

2724
01:32:23,849 --> 01:32:25,518
Hold on. You're not pretending, right?

2725
01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:27,788
- I'm not pretending.
- You're not pretending? Okay!

2726
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:29,789
- I really wanted to meet you.
- I knew it!

2727
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:31,658
The ones who work out will come to me no matter what.

2728
01:32:31,659 --> 01:32:33,188
Could I get your autograph here as well?

2729
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:34,458
Will it be okay on a black shirt?

2730
01:32:34,459 --> 01:32:35,558
- It's fine.
- It's fine?

2731
01:32:35,559 --> 01:32:36,998
- I'll give it a try.
- Even a trace of it will be fine.

2732
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:38,569
- It can be seen.
- It can be seen.

2733
01:32:38,799 --> 01:32:41,238
- The ones who work out love him.
- Right.

2734
01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:42,939
He's definitely an idol star for men.

2735
01:32:43,909 --> 01:32:44,968
There's no doubt.

2736
01:32:44,969 --> 01:32:47,378
I hope a lot of the men get in line.

2737
01:32:47,379 --> 01:32:48,978
Gosh, I feel nervous.

2738
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:50,138
(The sixth fan is a woman.)

2739
01:32:50,139 --> 01:32:52,549
- Gosh!
- My goodness!

2740
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:54,419
(Yi Kyung gets to sign another autograph.)

2741
01:32:55,049 --> 01:32:56,078
(Excited)

2742
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:57,148
- Awesome.
- Gosh.

2743
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:58,989
- Tae Hyun.
- Gosh, it's Tae Hyun.

2744
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:00,819
Thank you.

2745
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:02,758
(Tae Hyun signs his second autograph.)

2746
01:33:02,759 --> 01:33:04,258
- What's your name?
- Lee Ji Hye.

2747
01:33:04,259 --> 01:33:05,358
- Ji Hye?
- Yes.

2748
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:07,498
Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

2749
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,529
Thank you.

2750
01:33:09,099 --> 01:33:10,398
There are still a lot of opportunities left.

2751
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:11,828
(The young ones still have signed 0 autographs.)

2752
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:13,969
Please put down the mic and move to the star of your choice.

2753
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:15,569
She's moving this way.

2754
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:19,269
(Finally, someone is moving toward the young ones!)

2755
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:21,308
(Feeling shy)

2756
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:23,079
Seung Ho.

2757
01:33:23,409 --> 01:33:25,449
(Seung Ho finally gets to sign his first autograph.)

2758
01:33:25,549 --> 01:33:27,979
I waited for you. What took you so long?

2759
01:33:29,619 --> 01:33:31,048
(Gosh, this can't be true.)

2760
01:33:31,049 --> 01:33:32,089
No!

2761
01:33:32,749 --> 01:33:34,389
(Laughing)

2762
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:36,589
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you.

2763
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:38,729
You looked into my eyes.

2764
01:33:38,859 --> 01:33:39,889
What?

2765
01:33:40,259 --> 01:33:42,029
You looked into my eyes just now!

2766
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:45,498
(Gosh, I feel angry.)

2767
01:33:45,499 --> 01:33:46,569
I feel angry.

2768
01:33:48,699 --> 01:33:50,638
One, two...

2769
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:51,839
(He does his best with his fan service out of gratitude.)

2770
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:55,339
(Sang Uk gets in the picture as well.)

2771
01:33:55,639 --> 01:33:57,808
- Thank you!
- Didn't he take a selfie?

2772
01:33:57,809 --> 01:33:59,478
- Thank you.
- Didn't he take a selfie?

2773
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:00,748
- Goodbye.
- Make sure to check.

2774
01:34:00,749 --> 01:34:01,919
I think he took a selfie.

2775
01:34:02,249 --> 01:34:03,379
This is bad.

2776
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,919
I'm going to study fashion at this rate.

2777
01:34:05,949 --> 01:34:08,418
Sang Uk isn't someone who should be treated like this.

2778
01:34:08,419 --> 01:34:09,489
Right.

2779
01:34:10,429 --> 01:34:12,528
Move to the star of your choice.

2780
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:13,659
Move over to that person now.

2781
01:34:14,499 --> 01:34:16,699
(Desperate)

2782
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:18,699
She's going that way again.

2783
01:34:19,469 --> 01:34:21,639
- What?
- It's Sang Uk.

2784
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:23,908
- She's going that way again.
- What?

2785
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:24,968
- I'm here.
- It's Sang Uk.

2786
01:34:24,969 --> 01:34:26,169
I just gave a piece of candy.

2787
01:34:27,339 --> 01:34:29,838
(He finally gets to sign his first autograph.)

2788
01:34:29,839 --> 01:34:30,909
It's Sang Uk!

2789
01:34:31,849 --> 01:34:33,178
(Hugging tight)

2790
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:34,279
This feels great!

2791
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:36,918
- Someone finally went to Sang Uk.
- I feel thankful for her.

2792
01:34:36,919 --> 01:34:38,589
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

2793
01:34:39,019 --> 01:34:40,188
She's going over to him.

2794
01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:41,819
(The next person moves right away.)

2795
01:34:41,919 --> 01:34:43,759
- Is it really me?
- Yes.

2796
01:34:44,489 --> 01:34:46,028
(It's Sang Uk again?)

2797
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:47,098
- It's Sang Uk!
- What?

2798
01:34:47,099 --> 01:34:48,528
- Really?
- It will be hard to predict now.

2799
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:50,598
- Thank you.
- It will be hard to predict now.

2800
01:34:50,599 --> 01:34:52,028
We might end up studying fashion.

2801
01:34:52,029 --> 01:34:53,568
This is bad.

2802
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:55,238
(Current vote ranking, Sang Uk in the lead with 4 votes)

2803
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:56,398
(Current vote ranking, Dong Hyun in the lead)

2804
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,838
- Thank you!
- Yi Kyung!

2805
01:34:58,839 --> 01:35:00,238
One, two, three.

2806
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,438
(Current vote ranking, Tae Hyun in the lead)

2807
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:05,808
(Current vote ranking, Seung Ho in the lead)

2808
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:08,019
How is it so balanced like this?

2809
01:35:09,019 --> 01:35:10,148
This is hard to predict.

2810
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:11,789
This is bad.

2811
01:35:12,689 --> 01:35:14,388
The result will be announced.

2812
01:35:14,389 --> 01:35:15,989
(It's time to announce the final result.)

2813
01:35:16,559 --> 01:35:17,828
(Feeling nervous)

2814
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:19,359
I feel like I'm in the safe zone.

2815
01:35:19,789 --> 01:35:21,159
I'm sweating.

2816
01:35:22,099 --> 01:35:23,999
We'll start by announcing the one in first place.

2817
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:25,928
Kim Dong Hyun.

2818
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,799
(Fan signing event winner, Kim Dong Hyun)

2819
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:29,599
(Congratulations!)

2820
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:31,808
(A dance celebration of joy)

2821
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:32,939
Thank you!

2822
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:34,338
(Feeling grateful)

2823
01:35:34,339 --> 01:35:36,138
A total of seven autographs were signed.

2824
01:35:36,139 --> 01:35:38,309
(He secures his escape from the Shortage in Fashion!)

2825
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:41,119
(Jealous)

2826
01:35:41,549 --> 01:35:43,418
Here you are.

2827
01:35:43,419 --> 01:35:45,719
Dong Hyun is enjoying his win.

2828
01:35:45,989 --> 01:35:47,459
He's celebrating his win.

2829
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:50,388
Out of the four that are left,

2830
01:35:50,389 --> 01:35:52,688
three have signed six autographs.

2831
01:35:52,689 --> 01:35:53,999
(Three people are tied for second with six autographs signed.)

2832
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:56,098
One person has signed five autographs.

2833
01:35:56,099 --> 01:35:57,199
- He was just 1 autograph short.
- He was just 1 autograph short.

2834
01:35:57,969 --> 01:36:00,669
(He was just one autograph short.)

2835
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:03,198
- I think it's me.
- I think it's me.

2836
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,109
It's definitely not Yi Kyung.

2837
01:36:05,539 --> 01:36:07,379
It's me. I signed five.

2838
01:36:08,139 --> 01:36:10,508
The one who will stay behind to study fashion.

2839
01:36:10,509 --> 01:36:11,879
It was a one-vote difference.

2840
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,478
It's Oh Sang Uk.

2841
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:16,849
(Oh Sang Uk with 5 autographs)

2842
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:20,318
(It's me again in the end.)

2843
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:21,388
It's Sang Uk.

2844
01:36:21,389 --> 01:36:23,618
(Sang Uk will stay behind to study fashion.)

2845
01:36:23,619 --> 01:36:25,228
Sang Uk was in first place before coming here.

2846
01:36:25,229 --> 01:36:26,389
You're handsome!

2847
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:29,929
He's not someone who should be studying fashion.

2848
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:31,468
To be honest,

2849
01:36:31,469 --> 01:36:34,568
if all of the people here were to choose to get an autograph,

2850
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:36,699
Sang Uk would've won by a landslide.

2851
01:36:36,939 --> 01:36:38,439
- Of course.
- Right.

2852
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:41,739
They say, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."

2853
01:36:42,579 --> 01:36:44,148
I'll do my best to study fashion...

2854
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:45,678
while I'm at it.

2855
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:46,709
Thank you.

2856
01:36:46,809 --> 01:36:49,149
The other members...

2857
01:36:49,249 --> 01:36:50,918
may now go home...

2858
01:36:50,919 --> 01:36:52,149
and be free from the Shortage in Fashion.

2859
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:53,889
Thank you.

2860
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:55,618
Thank you.

2861
01:36:55,619 --> 01:36:58,858
Thank you for being with Handsome Guys.

2862
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:00,899
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, everyone!

2863
01:37:00,959 --> 01:37:02,698
Thank you! Stay healthy, everyone!

2864
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:03,769
Thank you!

2865
01:37:04,029 --> 01:37:05,469
- Thank you.
- Goodbye!

2866
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,569
(The fan signing event comes to an end.)

2867
01:37:11,539 --> 01:37:13,839
(Apgujeong, an hour later)

2868
01:37:14,809 --> 01:37:15,809
(The one who failed to escape)

2869
01:37:15,809 --> 01:37:16,809
Gosh.

2870
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:18,109
(The star of the makeover, Sang Uk arrives.)

2871
01:37:18,549 --> 01:37:20,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

2872
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:22,848
- I'm Oh Sang Uk.
- I'm Jung Yoon Ki.

2873
01:37:22,849 --> 01:37:24,049
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2874
01:37:25,219 --> 01:37:28,059
(The master of makeovers)

2875
01:37:28,959 --> 01:37:31,589
(The stylist loved by top stars)

2876
01:37:32,089 --> 01:37:34,559
- It's a pleasure.
- You're such an amazing athlete.

2877
01:37:34,799 --> 01:37:36,699
You're dressed nicely, but you're wearing slippers.

2878
01:37:37,599 --> 01:37:39,369
- Right. I'm wearing slippers.
- Right.

2879
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:42,369
- I got everything taken away.
- Right.

2880
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,639
Did you happen to see...

2881
01:37:46,109 --> 01:37:47,778
my fashion from yesterday?

2882
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:48,908
Yes. I did.

2883
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:50,779
How did you walk around in that?

2884
01:37:51,409 --> 01:37:54,018
Well, I did think...

2885
01:37:54,019 --> 01:37:56,818
I had a bit of style. Was I out of style?

2886
01:37:56,819 --> 01:37:59,688
Well, there was something special about it,

2887
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:03,219
but I think basic outfits will suit you.

2888
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:05,159
(Makeover expert Jung Yoon Ki's Escape from Shortage in Fashion)

2889
01:38:06,059 --> 01:38:08,058
(Style check for Oh Sang Uk)

2890
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:09,158
(Mint bucket hat and underwear)

2891
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:10,259
(Perfect looks and physique with a convoluted style)

2892
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:14,138
It's important to mix and match with your outfits.

2893
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:15,368
- Right.
- Right.

2894
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:16,799
You can be excited.

2895
01:38:16,839 --> 01:38:18,469
- I'm very excited.
- Right.

2896
01:38:19,239 --> 01:38:20,508
This is the first look.

2897
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:22,079
(The makeover begins.)

2898
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,908
It will be an outfit with a coat...

2899
01:38:24,909 --> 01:38:26,649
that will make you a man of fall.

2900
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,719
See? It looks amazing.

2901
01:38:29,319 --> 01:38:30,349
Should I step out now?

2902
01:38:30,749 --> 01:38:34,559
(How will the first makeover look?)

2903
01:38:36,389 --> 01:38:39,658
(He walks out with confident steps.)

2904
01:38:39,659 --> 01:38:40,759
Is this a runway?

2905
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:43,829
(How do I look?)

2906
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:48,938
- I really like it.
- It looks great.

2907
01:38:48,939 --> 01:38:49,968
I love the coat.

2908
01:38:49,969 --> 01:38:52,238
This was what I aimed for.

2909
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:55,708
I gave you an item that suited your physique well.

2910
01:38:55,709 --> 01:38:58,608
Coats are a trend this year.

2911
01:38:58,609 --> 01:39:01,918
You can open up the collar like a robe...

2912
01:39:01,919 --> 01:39:05,949
and tie up the back into a ribbon.

2913
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:10,689
I just went with a casual single knot.

2914
01:39:11,059 --> 01:39:14,598
This is a basic white utility shirt...

2915
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:18,268
styled with the basic pants that you already had.

2916
01:39:18,269 --> 01:39:21,269
It looks nice with his hairstyle, right?

2917
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:26,039
(Satisfied)

2918
01:39:31,779 --> 01:39:35,279
(It's time for the second makeover.)

2919
01:39:36,349 --> 01:39:40,389
(Full of casual vibes)

2920
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:43,088
- This looks nice.
- Right.

2921
01:39:43,089 --> 01:39:45,328
It was a dandy look earlier.

2922
01:39:45,329 --> 01:39:48,358
But the second look has the wide vintage denim pants...

2923
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:51,198
along with sneakers.

2924
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,768
It has a basic look,

2925
01:39:52,769 --> 01:39:56,338
but there's a scarf stuck on the hood.

2926
01:39:56,339 --> 01:40:01,139
It can be styled like a cape when it's cold.

2927
01:40:01,379 --> 01:40:03,378
It will become a new look like this.

2928
01:40:03,379 --> 01:40:04,748
(Glaring eyes)

2929
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:08,318
Sang Uk has sporty vibes,

2930
01:40:08,319 --> 01:40:10,518
so I also prepared the biker style...

2931
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:12,989
after the one with the hoodie.

2932
01:40:13,089 --> 01:40:15,458
- The biker style?
- Yes. It's a biker jacket.

2933
01:40:15,459 --> 01:40:17,789
- Let's just switch the top.
- Right.

2934
01:40:18,259 --> 01:40:19,658
- Thank you.
- Sure.

2935
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:20,659
(With just a change of the jacket...)

2936
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:24,799
You look good with these intense looks.

2937
01:40:24,869 --> 01:40:28,339
This would look nice on a special occasion.

2938
01:40:29,363 --> 01:40:31,403
(Turning around)

2939
01:40:33,503 --> 01:40:37,643
(A biker style with cuteness added to manliness)

2940
01:40:38,943 --> 01:40:42,413
(The final makeover)

2941
01:40:43,813 --> 01:40:48,082
(Style and glamor that reminds you of an award ceremony)

2942
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:51,722
This is a man's outfit...

2943
01:40:51,723 --> 01:40:53,352
loved by women the most.

2944
01:40:53,353 --> 01:40:57,362
Inside is the undershirt that Sang Uk was wearing...

2945
01:40:57,363 --> 01:40:59,432
matched with the silk tie shirt.

2946
01:40:59,433 --> 01:41:02,202
The tie isn't tied and is brought down.

2947
01:41:02,203 --> 01:41:05,002
There's a small detail here.

2948
01:41:05,003 --> 01:41:06,673
There's a hidden detail here.

2949
01:41:07,233 --> 01:41:09,043
- It looks amazing.
- Right.

2950
01:41:09,143 --> 01:41:12,072
You can put on the sunglasses here as well.

2951
01:41:12,073 --> 01:41:14,043
It will give off a retro vibe.

2952
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:17,553
(A retro vibe can be added with the tinted sunglasses)

2953
01:41:20,513 --> 01:41:23,682
(Guys, are you watching me?)

2954
01:41:23,683 --> 01:41:24,823
Don't do that?

2955
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:27,022
I've tried on three different outfits.

2956
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:29,592
They are levels above what I have been wearing.

2957
01:41:29,593 --> 01:41:32,992
I feel great as you have done a great job to look good in them.

2958
01:41:32,993 --> 01:41:35,632
You can pull off any outfit nicely.

2959
01:41:35,633 --> 01:41:37,402
(He became a human digestive with his ability to pull off any look.)

2960
01:41:37,403 --> 01:41:39,433
It feels great to complete your look, doesn't it?

2961
01:41:39,503 --> 01:41:43,173
How do you feel about escaping the Shortage in Fashion?

2962
01:41:43,743 --> 01:41:44,843
You too?

2963
01:41:45,543 --> 01:41:46,543
Me too.

2964
01:41:46,544 --> 01:41:47,712
You can do it as well.

2965
01:41:47,713 --> 01:41:48,713
(You can escape the Shortage in Fashion as well.)

2966
01:41:48,714 --> 01:41:49,783
You too?

2967
01:41:52,113 --> 01:41:53,512
(A successful escape from the Shortage in Fashion)

2968
01:41:53,513 --> 01:41:55,083
(You guys can escape as well.)

2969
01:41:55,343 --> 01:41:57,973
(The things accomplished through Handsome Guys)

2970
01:41:58,973 --> 01:42:00,413
(Eating meat 241,201 times)

2971
01:42:00,613 --> 01:42:02,382
- Another Coke Zero.
- A Coke Zero.

2972
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:03,642
Could we get three Coke Zeros?

2973
01:42:03,643 --> 01:42:04,653
(Ordering carbonated drinks 250,417 times)

2974
01:42:06,613 --> 01:42:07,753
(Eating carbs 250,904 times)

2975
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:10,253
(The fourth Life in Shortage comes to the Handsome Guys.)

2976
01:42:10,483 --> 01:42:12,853
(Meat, carbs, carbonated drinks)

2977
01:42:12,953 --> 01:42:14,763
(Shortage in MCC!)

2978
01:42:14,823 --> 01:42:16,093
(Confident)

2979
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:18,463
(It might be doable.)

2980
01:42:18,693 --> 01:42:19,962
(Can we get pork tripe?)

2981
01:42:19,963 --> 01:42:21,003
(No!)

2982
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:22,302
(I want to have it with rice.)

2983
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,002
(We don't have rice.)

2984
01:42:24,003 --> 01:42:25,803
(I can't think straight.)

2985
01:42:26,303 --> 01:42:27,872
(Beeping)

2986
01:42:27,873 --> 01:42:29,303
(This is a withdrawal symptom of the lack of MCC.)

2987
01:42:30,003 --> 01:42:31,213
(The beef brisket looks good!)

2988
01:42:31,643 --> 01:42:33,873
(Stage 1: Thinking of food all day)

2989
01:42:34,013 --> 01:42:37,983
(Stage 2: Getting angry for no reason)

2990
01:42:38,283 --> 01:42:40,082
(Stage 3: Minds lost)

2991
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,283
(Laughing)

2992
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:44,392
(The lack of MCC makes the Handsome Guys anxious.)

2993
01:42:44,393 --> 01:42:45,522
In earnest...

2994
01:42:45,523 --> 01:42:46,922
(If you want MCC,)

2995
01:42:46,923 --> 01:42:48,062
(win the games!)

2996
01:42:48,063 --> 01:42:49,823
(You keep putting us in war!)

2997
01:42:49,993 --> 01:42:51,392
(Dopamine to the max)

2998
01:42:51,393 --> 01:42:53,963
(To obtain MCC,)

2999
01:42:54,093 --> 01:42:55,302
(the Handsome Guys...)

3000
01:42:55,303 --> 01:42:58,572
(fight on land, in water,)

3001
01:42:58,573 --> 01:43:00,733
(and in the air.)

3002
01:43:01,373 --> 01:43:04,843
(For the ones who are reaching their limit,)

3003
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:06,772
(a special guest visits.)

3004
01:43:06,773 --> 01:43:08,743
(Eun Hye appears!)

3005
01:43:09,113 --> 01:43:10,212
(Why are you being scary?)

3006
01:43:10,213 --> 01:43:11,352
You can't be like that.

3007
01:43:11,353 --> 01:43:13,413
(From the Shortage in MCC that is intensifying,)

3008
01:43:15,723 --> 01:43:21,563
(will the Handsome Guys be able to escape?)

3009
