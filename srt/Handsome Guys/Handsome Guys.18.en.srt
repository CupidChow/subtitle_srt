1
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:19,435
(With one-day member Ahn Jae Hyeon substituting for Sang Uk)

2
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:24,304
(And Guest Lee Si Eon)

3
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,799
Today's Handsome Heritage is...

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,745
(Today's theme: Buildings in North Gyeongsang Province)

5
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:31,045
(The Handsome Race has changed.)

6
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,614
(Without the game of bingo)

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,814
(A real quiz fight)

8
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:35,884
(Teaming up with someone who's good at quizzes...)

9
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:36,885
(will be an advantage.)

10
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,526
(During our shoot for "Amazing Saturday")

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,595
(You kept looking down.)

12
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,194
(Dong Hyun wasn't picked as his teammate.)

13
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,125
(You didn't pick me?)

14
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,635
(They split into teams.)

15
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:50,434
(Team Handsome won the reattempt card.)

16
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:52,681
(The secret technique of Team Handsome with only the aces)

17
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:54,404
(School, region, )

18
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,105
(and Si Eon?)

19
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:57,245
What?

20
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:59,674
(The ace team's Ace Si Eon)

21
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,144
(The answer is the name that doesn't exist.)

22
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,674
(The staff must have come up with a name.)

23
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:05,314
(By reasoning the intention behind the question)

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,315
Correct.

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,184
(Handsome 1: Guys 0)

26
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,254
(We can't lose like this.)

27
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:15,895
(After not getting picked, they become very competitive.)

28
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,525
(This is perfect.)

29
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,394
(Answering the quiz with their whole body)

30
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,395
Correct.

31
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,204
(Handsome 1: Guys 1)

32
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,605
(Handsome 1: Guys 2)

33
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,105
(Team Guys gets ahead after getting quizzes in a row.)

34
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:31,775
(Who will be the winner of this competitive fight?)

35
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,675
It's so nice to travel together.

36
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,245
It's fun.

37
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,344
The three of us are working well together.

38
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,745
It's impressive.

39
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,214
When students enter school,

40
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:45,354
a congratulatory video with you in it is shown...

41
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,295
- during the entrance ceremony. - Right.

42
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:50,024
That video motivated me so much.

43
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,364
- I wanted to be in it too. - I know what you mean.

44
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,034
It almost drove me crazy.

45
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,164
"What can I do to be in that video?"

46
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,434
Now that I'm asked to be in it, I run away...

47
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:58,555
to avoid being in the video.

48
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,374
I tell them, "Stay away from me."

49
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,505
(It can be embarrassing.)

50
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,345
Si Eon, do you go fishing?

51
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,275
- Not really. - I see.

52
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,514
- I bike and play games. - Games?

53
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:10,044
My wife also loves playing games.

54
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,391
- That's wonderful. - You can play together.

55
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,984
My wife's sister is a professional gamer.

56
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:15,584
- Gosh. - Her name is Seo Ji Soo.

57
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,654
- Seo Ji Soo? - Really?

58
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:19,024
- She's a first-generation star. - I'm a huge fan...

59
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:21,254
Seo Ji Soo?

60
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,994
Is that why they're Seo Ji Seung and Seo Ji Soo?

61
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,025
Yes.

62
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,525
I'm her huge fan.

63
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,695
I love watching that game.

64
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:31,404
I've gone to watch the game.

65
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,605
I haven't gone to watch the game.

66
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,874
- Is Ji Seung her younger sister? - Yes.

67
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,445
- That's amazing. - I see.

68
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:41,245
It looks pretty now that it's snowing.

69
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:42,715
I agree.

70
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,384
Yi Kyung, are we going around in a circle on a mountain?

71
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,515
Before...

72
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,684
We were also on a mountain a moment ago.

73
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,255
Tae Hyun, we departed from Bonghwa.

74
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,754
We went to Yeongju.

75
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,195
- And... - We're in Yecheon now.

76
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,795
Will we get to see an old house this time?

77
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,965
I want to see an old house.

78
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:02,795
We're very deep in the mountain. We're almost there.

79
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,204
I bet it will be a historic house.

80
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,534
- An old house... - Right.

81
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:07,905
Made with wood?

82
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,044
We're almost there.

83
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,714
(After a long drive...)

84
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,315
What? This is it.

85
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,645
There's something.

86
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,255
It looks amazing.

87
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,035
It looks even more beautiful with the snow.

88
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,324
(At the foot of Mount Yongmun...)

89
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:27,095
(in Yecheon, North Gyeongsang Province)

90
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,224
(Picturesque Choganjeong Pavilion on a rock)

91
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,924
Choganjeong Pavilion in Yecheon.

92
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:31,965
Choganjeong Pavilion?

93
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,311
Choganjeong Pavilion is making me feel very nervous.

94
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,465
Gosh, that rhymes.

95
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,005
(He bursts out laughing.)

96
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,134
You're good with rhymes.

97
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,804
This sense of humor doesn't work with you, does it?

98
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,485
(You guys don't take a joke well, do you?)

99
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:45,545
- Ma'am. - Yes?

100
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,545
You always arrive before us.

101
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:50,445
- I got here not so long ago. - That must be it.

102
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:51,944
Isn't it beautiful here?

103
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:52,984
- What's this? - What's this?

104
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:53,985
How do we get there?

105
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,784
- Isn't it beautiful here? - What is that?

106
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,724
Do you see that pavilion?

107
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,055
- A pavilion? - A pavilion.

108
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,895
Is that a pavilion?

109
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,465
(It comes into view when you follow the Geumgok River.)

110
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:13,735
(Handsome Building 4, Pavilion on a Rock)

111
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:17,905
(Standing quietly on a rock by the brook)

112
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,715
(A detached pavilion that looks like nearby pine trees)

113
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,014
Is that a pavilion?

114
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,414
Yes, it is.

115
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,514
- It's on a rock. - It looks magnificent.

116
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,061
- Doesn't it look magnificent? - It looks amazing.

117
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,284
Do you know Yi Hwang?

118
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:31,354
- Yes. - Toegye Yi Hwang.

119
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,225
One of Toegye Yi Hwang's pupils was...

120
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:34,954
named Kwon Mun Hae.

121
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,465
He was a scholar in Yecheon.

122
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:40,364
He's the author of the first encyclopedia in Korea...

123
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,894
called "Daedong Unbu Gunok."

124
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,334
He wrote such an extraordinary series...

125
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,735
of 20 books.

126
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:48,474
He wrote about the civilization from Gojoseon to the Joseon dynasty.

127
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,644
- From nature to geography... - It must be very old.

128
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:53,344
Kwon Mun Hae's nickname was Chogan.

129
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,044
- "Chogan?" - So the pavilion was...

130
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,814
named after Chogan.

131
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:58,214
- Choganjeong Pavilion? - This place is called...

132
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,684
Choganjeong Pavilion and Garden.

133
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,615
It wasn't decorated artificially.

134
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:05,055
After selecting a spot with a nice view,

135
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,154
a garden was built around it.

136
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,255
That's the type of place it is.

137
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,094
- It was like his second home. - These days,

138
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,224
- Right. - it'd be called a hideout.

139
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,634
- You could say that. - A hideout.

140
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,234
A very famous one is called Bogildo Yun Seon Do Garden...

141
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,364
in Haenam.

142
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,564
(Bogildo Yun Seon Do Garden that represents gardens in Korea)

143
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,874
There's also Yeongyang Seoseokji in Yeongyang.

144
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,274
(Yeongyang Seoseokji)

145
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,575
Sosaewon Garden in Damyang is also famous.

146
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:29,114
This place in Yecheon is also famous.

147
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,284
- Choganjeong Pavilion. - Is this...

148
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:32,785
- What's in this frame is amazing. - spot...

149
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,285
It's really beautiful.

150
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,185
(The green scenery during the summer is also amazing.)

151
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,755
- Shall we go there? - Sure.

152
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:43,364
The way to get there...

153
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:45,065
- isn't ordinary either. - What?

154
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,795
- What's this? - Hold on.

155
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,894
- This is incredible. - It's only for one person.

156
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,404
We should cross it individually.

157
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,905
This is no joke.

158
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,675
This is interesting.

159
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,375
- Gosh. - What?

160
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:58,274
We're okay with it, but you must not like it.

161
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,475
I can't say I like it.

162
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,875
(They're walking carefully.)

163
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:04,715
Gosh.

164
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,344
My goodness.

165
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:07,654
(Swaying)

166
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,055
- Isn't it scary? - Goodness.

167
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:10,884
- Ms. Roh. - Stop it.

168
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,084
(Screaming)

169
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,495
Ms. Roh, you're walking well.

170
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,494
- Aren't you scared? - I'm going to run.

171
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,624
(While Ms. Roh is crossing the bridge in a hurry...)

172
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,665
Stop swaying it.

173
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,934
Stop swaying it. Who's swaying it?

174
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,034
(The one who's suffering is in the back.)

175
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,135
I can even hit you.

176
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,265
Stop swaying it.

177
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:31,474
Look at this. Don't sway it.

178
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,975
It's true when they say that actors shouldn't get mature.

179
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,575
I hate this. Stop jumping.

180
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,944
(Cha Tae Hyun, 49 years old)

181
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,915
Goodness. Stop it.

182
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,385
I hate things like this.

183
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:43,784
(Despising)

184
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:44,785
I hate things like this.

185
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,384
(Happy)

186
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,394
I hate things like this.

187
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:50,624
It's a place with fun things to do.

188
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,625
Gosh.

189
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,565
I can't even go on rides.

190
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:57,505
It wasn't scary but entertaining enough.

191
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:58,864
- It was fun. - My goodness.

192
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,334
I can't even go on rides.

193
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:01,804
(They stroll around the quiet pavilion and garden.)

194
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,205
This tree doesn't look ordinary.

195
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,774
All the trees are numbered.

196
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,314
(Covering the front of Choganjeong Pavilion)

197
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:10,814
- It's really... - These trees aren't just ordinary.

198
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:14,054
(Old pine trees are covering the front of Choganjeong Pavilion.)

199
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,615
When you take a closer look,

200
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,324
it's very overwhelming.

201
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:19,584
The pavilion is located on a rock.

202
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,154
(When they pass the pine forest, Choganjeong Pavilion appears.)

203
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,325
This place is incredible.

204
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,464
- Shall we go inside? - Yes.

205
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:27,494
Let's go inside.

206
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,565
(Shall we go inside?)

207
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,335
He built an amazing place to have fun.

208
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,634
He must have studied passionately too.

209
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,134
The inside... The floor heating must be on.

210
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,144
- Do you see the smoke coming out? - Yes.

211
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,145
- Yes. - That's amazing.

212
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,244
That's not smoke, is it?

213
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,575
The floor heating is on right now.

214
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:46,245
(Si Eon looks around where the smoke is rising.)

215
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:48,014
(The smoke is really rising.)

216
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,114
Si Eon, is it real?

217
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,354
- Yes. - It's real.

218
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,784
Is there a pavilion...

219
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:52,984
- that has floor heating? - It usually does.

220
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,124
- Really? - There are also pavilions...

221
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,654
without floor heating.

222
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:56,994
- Is that so? I've never seen... - This way...

223
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,064
a pavilion with floor heating.

224
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,335
Let's go up into a room with floor heating.

225
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:05,005
(A room with floor heating inside a pavilion?)

226
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,204
The floor heating is nice.

227
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:08,525
(Team Handsome goes into a room.)

228
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,505
There are places that are warm.

229
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,514
There's a path.

230
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,114
- There's a path. - Right.

231
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,415
I noticed that there was a warm path.

232
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,314
Is it here?

233
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:22,054
There should be...

234
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,524
(Detecting warmth)

235
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,384
I feel it here.

236
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,105
- It's close to the fireplace. - I feel it.

237
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,624
It can't be helped since it's close to the fireplace.

238
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,754
We have to stay close to each other.

239
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:31,195
Come here if you want to live.

240
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,095
It's cold. There's floor heating.

241
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,634
There's a particular smell to the fire.

242
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,805
- I like this smell. - It's rising.

243
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,234
(Since when was there floor heating inside a pavilion?)

244
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,374
After the Imjin War in the 17th century,

245
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,344
it was very cold in Korea due to the Little Ice Age.

246
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:49,945
Since then, there was a supply of floor heating.

247
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,015
Floor heating was also built inside pavilions.

248
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:57,124
In this pavilion with two rooms,

249
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,755
- Right. - there's floor heating.

250
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,394
During Kwon Mun Hae's stay here,

251
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:01,725
he studied diligently.

252
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,924
(On the other hand)

253
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,095
Ms. Roh, what's this?

254
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,594
(Si Eon is curious about the ring hanging from the ceiling.)

255
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,094
- This is... - This one here.

256
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,434
Do you see this door?

257
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,535
- When you lift the door... - I see.

258
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,574
Is it used to hook this door?

259
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:16,874
You lift it up to open it.

260
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,105
This is incredible.

261
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,145
It's like modern folding doors.

262
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,284
You're right. It's like a folding door.

263
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,084
It's exactly like a folding door.

264
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,085
(You can feel the nature with your skin during the summer.)

265
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:29,114
Throughout the four seasons,

266
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,184
- you can stay here. - You're right.

267
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:32,354
You close it when it's cold.

268
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:33,955
When it gets hot, you can open the door.

269
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,694
(This is the charm of a Korean-style pavilion.)

270
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:36,965
It's a little scary.

271
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:38,724
I have a fear of heights.

272
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:42,535
- The flowing river is beautiful. - Goodness.

273
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,634
(Our ancestors liked to stay close to nature through all seasons.)

274
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,805
There are rocks too.

275
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,204
Another aspect of Korean architecture is...

276
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:54,774
that there's no border between the space and nature.

277
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,374
(Korean pavilions are connected to nature.)

278
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,585
Here's a famous anecdote from the past.

279
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,484
The most famous garden in Korea is...

280
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,555
Changdeokgung Palace.

281
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,624
It used to be called a secret garden.

282
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,154
The garden at Changdeokgung Palace is...

283
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,524
the biggest garden in Korea.

284
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,794
(Changdeokgung Secret Garden represents Korea's garden.)

285
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,235
Japan is known for their garden landscaping.

286
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,934
A Japanese landscape architect was invited, and he was shown...

287
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,965
the garden and the valley. They gave him a tour for hours.

288
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,874
The Japanese architect was amazed, but then he asked...

289
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,905
- when they'd show him the garden. - What?

290
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,174
- Goodness. - The Koreans were giving him...

291
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,374
a tour around the garden.

292
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,615
For him, it wasn't a garden.

293
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:33,544
To the Japanese architect, a garden was supposed...

294
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,684
to be swept, wiped, and decorated.

295
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:37,584
A pavilion situated in nature wasn't...

296
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,354
a garden at all.

297
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,055
- They had different ideas. - Even the fence below...

298
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,024
- There isn't a fence here. - Right.

299
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,094
There isn't any.

300
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:46,794
There shouldn't be a fence here.

301
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,365
Otherwise, the view would be wasted.

302
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:51,504
(Our garden is part of the view instead of being man-made.)

303
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,035
It's beautiful.

304
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,575
Let's do this swiftly without hesitating.

305
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,055
We have a reattempt card anyway.

306
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,514
If you get the next quiz right, you'll get...

307
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,414
- taepyeongchu. - "Taepyeongchu?"

308
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,015
It's a local dish in Yecheon.

309
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,285
- Let's get started. - Okay.

310
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:09,755
All right.

311
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,425
In Yecheon,

312
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,625
there's a tree designated as a Natural Monument...

313
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,724
called Seoksongnyeong Pine Tree.

314
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,125
- Seoksongnyeong Pine Tree? - Yes.

315
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,565
According to the Korea Record Institute,

316
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,434
Seoksongnyeong Pine Tree is...

317
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:24,505
the first tree in Korea to inherit this.

318
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,864
What is this?

319
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:28,905
- A tree inherited something? - Yes.

320
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:30,745
Could it be a government post?

321
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,845
- A government post. - That sounds reasonable.

322
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,314
There's a pine tree with a government post...

323
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,015
like Jeongipum Pine Tree.

324
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:41,461
He said that it was the first. Is this the first one?

325
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:43,015
Is this Jeongipum Pine Tree?

326
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:44,895
- Didn't you say it was the first? - Yes.

327
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:47,525
Is a government post inherited?

328
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,164
- "Assigned?" - When you inherit something,

329
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,464
- it's handed down from someone. - Right.

330
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,234
The person who planted the tree...

331
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:56,965
could have handed down his government post.

332
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,735
That sounds very reasonable.

333
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,504
Let's stop thinking about this.

334
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,004
- Come up with something else. - Something else?

335
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,504
When we get obsessed with one answer,

336
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,674
- that's all we think about. - We can't brainstorm anymore.

337
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,145
What else can we hand down to a tree?

338
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:12,085
What can a tree inherit?

339
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:14,785
Seoksongnyeong... Hey.

340
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,524
Usually, assets are inherited.

341
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,885
When something is inherited.

342
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,754
"Seok" means rock, and "song" means pine tree.

343
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,225
Is it Seoksongnyeong?

344
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:26,665
Based on its name, the tree must be near rocks.

345
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:30,364
Maybe the tree inherited the mountain where it's planted.

346
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,265
- I bet it's land. - Land?

347
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,635
Land? Land is...

348
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:37,304
If land is given to a tree,

349
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,474
- who would take care of that land? - It seems like...

350
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,114
- an honorary post. - Right.

351
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:43,374
(It must be something without physical substance.)

352
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,845
What would I leave to a pine tree?

353
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,855
A name?

354
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:50,825
Can you inherit a name?

355
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,825
My father in the countryside...

356
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,195
He wrote a signpost...

357
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,594
saying "Granddaughter Tree" in front of a tree.

358
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,064
There's our family name on the tree.

359
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,434
I don't think it's the first tree to be named.

360
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,104
I'm sure there were many before that.

361
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:07,475
- A type of name? - Yes.

362
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,774
Trees have been named since the Stone Age.

363
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,675
He said that it was the first tree ever.

364
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:15,115
Ancestors, give us your wisdom.

365
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,185
The pine trees must be laughing at us so much.

366
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,531
(You won't improve from doing the quiz as you look at the answer.)

367
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:24,584
The answer might be one of what we said.

368
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:25,984
Don't you think?

369
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,554
Shall we say the answer...

370
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,325
as something like land or a government post?

371
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:34,194
- The answer is something like... - Land, government post, or a name.

372
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,394
- Or a name. - Hey.

373
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:37,555
Something like an asset, a government post, or a name.

374
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,104
We'll package it as a group.

375
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,835
(Can't we give a vague answer?)

376
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,825
Among rock, government post, and name,

377
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,645
which one do you think is incorrect?

378
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,765
- I don't think it's a rock. - Rock is out.

379
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:52,344
Si Eon, which one do you think is incorrect?

380
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:53,614
(Government post or name)

381
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,185
- A name. - You think it's incorrect?

382
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:56,454
I don't think it's a government post.

383
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:59,054
(Laughing)

384
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,624
We're at odds.

385
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,694
(They're at odds without any yield.)

386
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:02,924
Who will be correct?

387
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,294
The government post seemed likely at first,

388
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:07,125
but it's not something that's inherited.

389
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:10,734
Isn't it impossible to inherit a government post?

390
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,104
(An official post can't be hereditary.)

391
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,005
Is it possible to inherit a government post?

392
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:16,105
- Land is a type of asset. - Your answer is land.

393
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,144
- I think it's a name. - Name?

394
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,775
Either a name or a nickname.

395
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,544
But isn't that such an easy answer?

396
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,684
It's an easy answer, but the question is...

397
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,685
why it's recognized.

398
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,014
- Land wouldn't be recognized. - Right.

399
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,354
Of course it doesn't make sense.

400
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,995
They say that Ulsan Rock walked from Ulsan, but that's ridiculous.

401
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,355
Really?

402
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,054
Ulsan Rock...

403
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:37,094
- Ulsan Rock is in Gangwon Province. - Really?

404
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:39,124
Its name comes from the fact...

405
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,965
- that the rock walked from Ulsan. - Really?

406
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,564
In that case, land sounds reasonable.

407
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,405
- A name seems too... - Could it be correct?

408
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,375
It's something recognized by the country.

409
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:50,645
It must be from someone famous.

410
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,404
It must be someone famous.

411
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,414
- Since he was famous... - When he was asked,

412
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:55,415
"Tae Hyun,"

413
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,114
"what did you do with your car and your house?"

414
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:58,315
"I gave them to a pine tree."

415
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:00,715
"To a pine tree?"

416
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,614
He only wore shorts and short sleeves...

417
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:04,784
even in winter.

418
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:06,554
Because of Si Eon's acting,

419
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,554
everything he says sounds correct.

420
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,094
It's because he was that famous.

421
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,094
- "Did you see Tae Hyun?" - "What about him?"

422
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,794
He only wears shorts and short sleeves in winter.

423
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:14,834
- Ask me why. - Why?

424
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,595
- He gave everything to a pine tree! - What?

425
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,134
He gave everything to a pine tree.

426
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,365
- A pine tree? - Yes.

427
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,004
Tae Hyun is on his way...

428
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,735
- to the district office. - What?

429
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,374
Would that be recognized?

430
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,645
He's on his way to the district office to be recognized.

431
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:30,014
Just say any answer. I'll take out the reattempt card.

432
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,185
Here we go.

433
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,644
Land.

434
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,585
- There are rocks on land. - Land.

435
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,215
Land?

436
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,305
- We're doomed. - There are mountains too.

437
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:43,355
(Their reattempt card is on standby.)

438
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,225
(What will be the answer?)

439
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,735
Correct.

440
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:51,334
(Answer: Land)

441
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:52,405
Si Eon.

442
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,435
What's going on?

443
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,104
What?

444
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,204
(Is this...)

445
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,404
What's going on here?

446
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,915
(Is this possible?)

447
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,374
Is it land that we're thinking of?

448
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,014
Let me explain. In 1930,

449
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:08,014
there was a local resident named Lee Soo Mok.

450
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,855
After being inspired by this tree,

451
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:12,124
he named it Seoksongnyeong.

452
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,325
He bequeathed his piece of land to this tree.

453
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:17,225
- It's actually correct. - It's correct.

454
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:21,194
Every year, the residents in the village pay...

455
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,364
property taxes on behalf of the tree.

456
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,211
They created a scholarship to support the students.

457
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,474
Did you hear what Si Eon said? Someone who wears...

458
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,945
- only shorts... - "He gave all his assets."

459
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,874
- He said it all. - "He gave everything to a tree."

460
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,914
(Without using the reattempt card, )

461
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:35,915
(We'll be back in 60 seconds.)

462
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,145
(They got the second quiz.)

463
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,885
- Land. - Land.

464
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:41,815
Tae Hyun in his shorts.

465
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,285
(Current score, Handsome 1: Guys 2)

466
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:44,854
That was really...

467
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:45,855
(Current score, Handsome 2: Guys 2)
That was incredible.

468
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,948
Without you two...

469
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:51,318
That was amazing.

470
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:53,858
How are you so good at reasoning?

471
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:56,228
I remember...

472
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,658
studying in the past.

473
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,498
I missed a call from Yi Kyung.

474
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,097
Shall we call them?

475
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,527
(They don't know each other's score.)

476
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:06,268
(Calling Yi Kyung)

477
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,308
- Don't make it obvious. - What?

478
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,684
(He doesn't want them to find out.)

479
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,578
Don't even complain.

480
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,848
- Instead, we could say, - What?

481
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,447
"Yes, we got everything right."

482
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,817
Right. Pretending to be strong could be better.

483
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:19,818
Pretend to be strong.

484
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,558
Shall I say, "I'm getting off work?"

485
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:22,947
Instead, pretend to be strong.

486
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:25,087
- He isn't picking up. He's busy. - He must be busy.

487
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,958
Think about it. They have a reattempt card.

488
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,058
If they got all the quizzes right, they wouldn't call us.

489
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,058
They used the card and got one quiz wrong.

490
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:34,568
Feeling anxious,

491
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:37,067
they thought of calling us.

492
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,337
You know how Yi Kyung is.

493
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,497
(Feeling anxious, they must have tried to feel us out.)

494
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,708
They keep wanting to do this.

495
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:43,868
We can do it.

496
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,477
- Seriously, we can do it. - We can do it.

497
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,678
We'll probably win.

498
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,168
I can't believe that we're eating grilled salted mackerel in Andong.

499
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:52,978
Can you eat it all?

500
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,347
- It's food for my muscles. - It's food for our muscles.

501
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,417
(A specialty in Andong, grilled salted mackerel meal restaurant)

502
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,787
- Here you go. - Okay.

503
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:59,428
- Hello. - It suddenly came into my mind.

504
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:02,187
Gosh. These side dishes look great.

505
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,987
(Various side dishes...)

506
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,127
(and the main dish, the grilled salted mackerel)

507
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,668
- Gosh, it's so big. - It's crazy.

508
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,737
(It's crispy on the outside like chips.)

509
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:15,008
(And it's soft and moist inside.)

510
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:21,748
(A generous amount of the grilled salted mackerel meal)

511
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,477
So I lift the bone like this?

512
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,018
(They start eating now.)

513
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,048
- That's mackerel galbi. - Hey, look.

514
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:30,647
(Amazed)

515
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:31,988
It's a big chunk.

516
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:35,288
Look at the flesh. Gosh.

517
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:36,858
How can it be this big?

518
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:40,197
(He can't help but be amazed after taking a bite.)

519
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:41,368
- It's crazy. - Goodness.

520
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:45,837
I've never had a grilled mackerel...

521
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,008
that is as juicy as this one.

522
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,667
(Seung Ho carefully debones it too.)

523
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,308
- Please enjoy. - Yes. Thank you.

524
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:55,648
(Amazed)

525
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,177
The mackerel is so juicy.

526
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,938
(He separates the flesh and takes a bite...)

527
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:04,118
But why is the grilled salted mackerel so famous in Andong?

528
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:05,417
(After having a spoonful of white rice...)

529
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:06,688
- Exactly. - Gosh.

530
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,227
This is a true Korean meal.

531
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:11,958
(This is what a Korean meal is.)

532
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:15,328
Also,

533
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,667
because it's so meaty,

534
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,314
it feels like a fresh mackerel, not a salted one.

535
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,338
I'm shocked...

536
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,899
- because it's perfectly salted. - Yes.

537
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,737
- I don't like salty food. - Me too.

538
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,908
It's not salty at all.

539
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,878
- It's so tasty. - Look. It's...

540
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,747
- Right. - It's a whole fillet.

541
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,947
After removing some bones, I can eat the whole thing.

542
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:33,017
Gosh, it's...

543
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,118
(Get inside my mouth.)

544
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,658
My muscles are growing.

545
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:40,957
I usually don't eat the flesh around the bone.

546
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,428
(Pardon?)

547
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:46,828
(Addicted to the grilled mackerel. It was worth coming to Andong.)

548
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,938
(By the way, Seung Ho, who had been focused on eating, )

549
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:52,138
Seriously.

550
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:57,608
(takes a bite of something pickled.)

551
00:19:58,078 --> 00:19:59,708
- Guys. Seriously. - What?

552
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,207
- We take a bite of the mackerel... - Yes.

553
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,977
- and a spoonful of rice, right? - Yes.

554
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:05,317
I want you to have...

555
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,078
- the pickled dong quai after that. - Okay.

556
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,847
- It's the best combination. - Is that so?

557
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:10,934
(The pickled dong quai is Seung Ho's favorite choice.)

558
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,087
I'll try it.

559
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,964
(He tries the combination Seung Ho recommended right away.)

560
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:15,757
(A bite of the mackerel...)

561
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:16,988
(and a spoonful of rice...)

562
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,228
The one who loves grilled mackerel...

563
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,268
(and the pickled dong quai to top it off.)

564
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,668
It's good, right?

565
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,038
Gosh. It tastes so good.

566
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,938
- I wasn't hungry. - Me too.

567
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,438
(Starting with a spoonful of rice topped with mackerel...)

568
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,638
- It's so good. - Our bellies were almost empty.

569
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:35,047
(Devouring the rice)

570
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:37,047
(Devouring the side dishes)

571
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:39,378
(Devouring the soup)

572
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:44,258
(Jae Hyeon finishes a bowl of rice too.)

573
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:46,857
It's the best thing after the beef tartare.

574
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,227
(He puts it on his tasty food list.)

575
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:49,527
- Shall we? - Let's go.

576
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,127
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

577
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,357
(Andong's grilled salted mackerel, Andong's braised chicken)

578
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,527
(Famous dishes are famous for a reason.)

579
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:54,897
Gosh. I loved it.

580
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:56,498
(Famous dishes are famous for a reason.)

581
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:58,897
I didn't know I'd solve the quiz so well.

582
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,467
Usually, I hate quizzes.

583
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,908
I'm a bit relaxed after getting two questions right.

584
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:05,077
The dish is named taepyeongchu. Why is it called taepyeongchu?

585
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:06,338
Is it for another quiz?

586
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,907
"Why is it called taepyeongchu?"

587
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,148
(They've come to have an unfamiliar dish, taepyeongchu.)

588
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,777
Yi Kyung is so good at this.

589
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:13,954
(Yi Kyung pours water for his seniors.)

590
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:16,818
This is the senior-junior relations at Seoul Institute of the Arts.

591
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:18,587
It's because they were beaten before.

592
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:20,148
(It's because they were beaten before.)

593
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:22,257
Taepyeongchu is a traditional dish...

594
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:24,087
that people in the royal court had during the Joseon Dynasty.

595
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:25,827
It's a type of noodle.

596
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,457
Some say it's called so because...

597
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,097
- it's similar to tangpyeongchae. - It was served...

598
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:31,597
for important feasts or events in the palace.

599
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:33,067
(Taepyeongchu: Yecheon's local dish...)

600
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,367
(made with pork, kimchi, and buckwheat jelly.)

601
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,184
(Some say it's a peasants' version of the royal tangpyeongchae.)

602
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,477
(And it looks like this!)

603
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:39,577
Are they fish balls?

604
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:41,247
- It's not what I expected. - I know.

605
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,547
It's not gukbap.

606
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:43,807
- They have kimchi - I've never seen it before.

607
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,947
And buckwheat jelly instead of tofu.

608
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,117
It's my first time having it.

609
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:47,478
Suddenly, it gives me an appetite.

610
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,547
- Doesn't it? - Not really.

611
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:51,618
(Laughing)

612
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,987
It's similar to kimchi stew.

613
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,457
Gosh. It's something beyond my imagination.

614
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,897
With the seasoned spinach,

615
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,358
- we can tell how salty it is here. - Seriously.

616
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:01,997
- No? - Do it like this.

617
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,697
- Sorry. - Have you already stirred it?

618
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,537
Scoop it up as it is like this.

619
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:06,698
Can we eat it right now?

620
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,007
(Place cold buckwheat jelly on kimchi stew.)

621
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,708
- We don't put them in it? - No.

622
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:11,908
Quickly ladle it out.

623
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,507
We eat the buckwheat jelly as is.

624
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:17,947
I think it'll be salty, though.

625
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:19,848
But still. I think it might be all right.

626
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,748
- Gosh. It's interesting. - The kimchi is tasty.

627
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,148
(Surprised)

628
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:27,457
I like it. I don't need rice.

629
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,258
(It's a new flavor that just amazes him.)

630
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,097
- It's not the jelly we expected. - Right. It's different.

631
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,258
- In my mouth, it's... - Yes.

632
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,697
It's chewy.

633
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:36,667
Buckwheat jelly is supposed to melt in our mouths, right?

634
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:38,037
Normally,

635
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,937
- buckwheat jelly is bouncy. - But this one feels heavy.

636
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:42,937
- It sticks in my mouth. - Yes.

637
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,478
- It's similar to tofu. - Yes.

638
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,408
This kimchi is tasty.

639
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,807
Kimchi is so good.

640
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,578
(The spicy and sour kimchi gives it a kick to the jelly.)

641
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,364
Its combination with the buckwheat jelly is interesting.

642
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:58,418
This is a dish that only exists in this area, isn't it?

643
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:00,117
It's tasty.

644
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,487
- Tae Hyun, you're eating it well. - It's tasty.

645
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:03,327
- It's good. - Hey.

646
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:04,457
Tae Hyun.

647
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,697
(A rare scene)

648
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:06,897
You're eating so much.

649
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:09,274
(The one who eats like a bird can't stop using his utensils.)

650
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:10,827
Try this now.

651
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,338
(Try sungnyung too.)

652
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,198
I'm so full, though.

653
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,037
Why do you keep feeding me when I'm so full?

654
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:18,207
- Help yourself. - Sir, have this.

655
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,037
Sir, you have to have this to finish it up.

656
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:22,158
Sungnyung is great when you have a problem digesting.

657
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,677
I wasn't expecting much, but it tastes superb.

658
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:25,924
(He eats everything they give him.)

659
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,247
You said you didn't have an appetite,

660
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:28,547
but you're eating so much.

661
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:30,148
(He's eating so well.)

662
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:32,187
Gosh. My great-grandfather passed away...

663
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:33,458
after finishing a whole meal.

664
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,727
The discipline of the Seoul Institute of the Arts...

665
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,998
has been slacking.

666
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:40,957
I was talking about my great-grandfather.

667
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,127
You should eat over there. What are you doing?

668
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,488
It was about my great-grandfather.

669
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:48,038
The people in Tae Hyun's class are like great-grandfathers to you.

670
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,737
You got recruited as an actor when you were 20 years old.

671
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:53,337
I took the test as soon as I entered college and got in.

672
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:55,707
Didn't you take off right away? Was it "General Hospital?"

673
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,677
No. That was way before my debut.

674
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,547
I starred in "General Hospital Two."

675
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:00,917
People get it confused.

676
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,387
I saw you for the first time in "General Hospital Two."

677
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:03,417
The one where you shaved your head.

678
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:04,557
- That was "Sunflower." - Was it?

679
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,317
- Hold on. - This is not a conversation.

680
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:08,187
- Wasn't "Sunflower"... - He's been saying...

681
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,457
- the one with Kim Jung Eun? - that it was "Sunflower."

682
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,297
So you shaved your head for "General Hospital Two?"

683
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:12,458
For "Sunflower."

684
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:15,627
How many times does he have to tell you?

685
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,627
It was Jung Eun. I shaved her hair.

686
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:18,737
Jung Eun as in Lee Jung Eun?

687
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:20,098
- Kim Jung Eun. - Kim Jung Eun.

688
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:22,007
- Lee Jung Eun was in "Parasite." - Nothing is correct.

689
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,267
Hold on. It was her, not you,

690
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,537
- who shaved the hair? - Yes.

691
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:25,738
What on earth did you watch?

692
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,277
I clearly remember you with the shaved head.

693
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,877
- You have a terrible memory, then. - No, I shaved the hair...

694
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,878
- for her. - I was a baby.

695
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:34,354
That was the first time I started shooting commercials.

696
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:36,018
- Your commercial was... - With Jung Eun.

697
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:41,558
(The advertisement industry sought after him after "Sunflower.")

698
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,557
He's a living fossil.

699
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,704
(They ate with a living fossil in the acting industry.)

700
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,667
I was enlisted after watching...

701
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:49,828
"Piano."

702
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:51,767
I wasn't in "Piano."

703
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:52,897
No, you weren't?

704
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:54,567
(Was it Zo In Sung, then?)

705
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,637
- How confused are you? - It was a different story.

706
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,254
- I was talking about another thing. - What?

707
00:24:58,278 --> 00:24:59,578
Anyway, this is tasty.

708
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:03,448
Let's get going now. Stop eating.

709
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,578
Tae Hyun finished it.

710
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:07,577
- I think I ate them all. - Gosh.

711
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:08,848
(He's no longer a light eater.)

712
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,357
We enjoyed taepyeongchu.

713
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:12,858
(We enjoyed taepyeongchu very much.)

714
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,657
(They now move on to the last destination, Mungyeong.)

715
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:19,498
- It was very good. - If Tae Hyun ate that much...

716
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:21,627
- It was so good. - It means it's a good restaurant.

717
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:24,198
Mungyeong. Gosh. Why is Mungyeong always so cold?

718
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:28,067
- Its mountain wind is haunted. - Gosh. Mungyeong.

719
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,067
When I shoot period dramas, I'm always outside the palace.

720
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:32,208
Right.

721
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:33,807
- And my shoes are made of straw. - I...

722
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:35,777
Si Eon and I always play the lower class.

723
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:37,747
- Do you play the lower class too? - I've never done an upperclass.

724
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:39,648
I played a slave.

725
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:43,088
When I first entered the company,

726
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,017
I rode in the company's bus because I didn't have a car.

727
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:48,687
I rode the bus when I played extras too.

728
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,687
But I wasn't an extra.

729
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,658
The head of the extras...

730
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:55,097
gave them an order, and I followed them.

731
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,197
And the assistant director said,

732
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:59,938
"Hey. Not you. Come here."

733
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:01,968
"Not me?"

734
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,478
I'd play a police officer who was dozing off.

735
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:07,777
And I guess the assistant director liked me.

736
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:10,048
So he put me in a higher position.

737
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:13,578
- Did you climb up the ladder? - Yes. I wore the hat.

738
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:15,388
I became the chief of the police officers.

739
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:17,017
So I went there with my mustache glued on.

740
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:18,058
And the director said,

741
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,757
"Hey. He looks like a kid."

742
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,227
"Take him out of the scene."

743
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:23,327
(His role was gone with a word from the director.)

744
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,327
- I looked too young. - That's right.

745
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:27,798
"It won't work. Get rid of him."

746
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,327
So, you were taken out of the scene?

747
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:30,728
Yes, I was taken out.

748
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:36,307
(While talking to one another, )

749
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,838
(they've driven to reach...)

750
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:44,008
(Mungyeong.)

751
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:47,778
(They arrive at their destination before they know it.)

752
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:50,128
It's here. I don't see a special building here.

753
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:53,457
What? Are we here to see a lifelong learning center?

754
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,004
(What? Are we here to see a lifelong learning center?)

755
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,957
There's no special building here.

756
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,698
(This place doesn't seem to have anything special.)

757
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:01,928
It's here.

758
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:10,238
(They get out of the car for now.)

759
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:14,308
We just saw the 500-year-old pavilion.

760
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:17,408
- Now, it's so... - They're all cutting-edge.

761
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,378
Is it that round building?

762
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,547
That's interesting. It's a church.

763
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:24,228
- Is that what it is? - Isn't it a church?

764
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:26,287
What on earth...

765
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:28,428
It looks like a tunnel tent.

766
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,287
- This is it. She's here. - It's here.

767
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:32,797
- I see. - This way.

768
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,274
- Is this the building? - Yes. This is the building.

769
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:36,768
- It's a mall. - It's a shopping mall.

770
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:38,337
- What is this place? - Here.

771
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:40,537
As you can see, they are houses with the round roof.

772
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,268
(Round-roofed houses)

773
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:43,637
Is it a mall?

774
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,607
No, they are houses for families.

775
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:46,777
- What? - Residential houses?

776
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,047
Really?

777
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:49,547
They're residential houses?

778
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,708
(They didn't expect them to be residential buildings.)

779
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:56,048
(In the middle of the city filled with rectangular buildings, )

780
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:01,658
(are unique Houses with round roofs.)

781
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:06,658
(Handsome Building 5: Round roofs are up.)

782
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,397
- You're saying the roof is round. - Right.

783
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,497
The roof is round.

784
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:12,038
So it's called Round Roof House.

785
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:14,807
This design is a bit unique, right?

786
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,767
- Right. - It holds reference...

787
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,477
to being the gateway of Mungyeongsaejae.

788
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:21,948
(The houses were inspired by the gate of Mungyeongsaejae.)

789
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:24,448
- They look a bit like tunnels. - They do.

790
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:26,577
They're also an expression of...

791
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:29,117
the mine tunnels in Mungyeong.

792
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:30,887
The design has some symbolic elements.

793
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:33,788
(The design reflects the local identity of Mungyeong.)

794
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:35,357
Oh, someone's waving.

795
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,358
Hello.

796
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,257
Oh, my!

797
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,027
(So nice to see you.)

798
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:41,527
- Shall we go there? - Let's go this way.

799
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:43,248
- Let's go this way. - What do we see here?

800
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,438
I didn't even imagine this.

801
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:47,497
(Who would’ve thought this was just a regular house?)

802
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,137
The most extraordinary thing is...

803
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,408
- the first floor is concrete. - Right.

804
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,438
- But the second floor is wood. - Really?

805
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,308
- This is wood? - It's wood?

806
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:58,388
I didn't know they could make something like that out of wood.

807
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:03,347
(The process of making the round roof)

808
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,518
It was made in advance at the factory.

809
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:07,858
The semi-circular structures were made in advance.

810
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:11,388
The three houses have the same shape and structure.

811
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:15,097
The parts were pre-attached here and then placed on top.

812
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,098
(They were built by filling in the wooden frames.)

813
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:18,637
It is a hybrid structure.

814
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,314
(It is a hybrid structure combining concrete and wood.)

815
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:21,467
In 2024, it also won...

816
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,067
the Grand Prize at Gyeongsangbuk-do Architecture Culture Awards.

817
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,238
- Last year. - Yes.

818
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:28,247
(Impressed)

819
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,278
Was this built by an architect?

820
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:33,477
A regular person consulted with an architect to build this.

821
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:35,247
- A regular person. - I see.

822
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,847
But I don't think he's an average person.

823
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:38,288
- He isn't. - I know.

824
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,157
How can we enter this place?

825
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,158
- That way. - The entrance?

826
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,087
- That's the door? - Really?

827
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:44,657
The first floors are all commercial space.

828
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,697
They are?

829
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,898
(The second-floor residence is reached by a staircase.)

830
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,768
(What does the inside of this round-roofed house look like?)

831
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,397
This is what it looks like inside!

832
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:55,638
Each has...

833
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:58,107
a separate entrance.

834
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:00,938
The spaces in between give a bit of a courtyard feel.

835
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,177
- Yes, it has that vibe. - That's how it's structured.

836
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,178
- Yes. - Wow!

837
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:05,648
It even has an upper floor.

838
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:09,017
It has the 2nd and 3rd floor.

839
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:10,187
That's the third floor.

840
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,657
It has two floors.

841
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:12,757
(To be exact, there’s also a third floor.)

842
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,387
Please go inside.

843
00:30:14,388 --> 00:30:16,157
Let's go inside.

844
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:17,558
(Please excuse us.)

845
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,568
(The first thing you see is a charming little orange staircase.)

846
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,838
(They enter the house carefully.)

847
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:28,968
Amazing!

848
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:35,978
(The wide-open interior makes your jaw drop.)

849
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:40,378
(The giant window offers a wide-open view.)

850
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,048
(To give the space a sense of openness, )

851
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:49,228
(the ceiling stretches endlessly upward.)

852
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:53,258
Listen to the echo of the house.

853
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:56,597
(Voices echo through the high ceiling.)

854
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,737
- Amazing! - The roof...

855
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:01,167
(The vast interior makes your eyes open wide.)

856
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,937
This is the lower part...

857
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:05,077
of the round roof we saw outside.

858
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,108
Oh, my.

859
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,438
I want to live here.

860
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,008
Incredible.

861
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,547
(It’s seriously incredible!)

862
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:11,818
It’s seriously incredible!

863
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,118
I can watch TV sitting here.

864
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:22,228
(This is the view you get.)

865
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:27,178
It’s even more amazing that the homeowner isn’t an architect.

866
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:29,077
The owner isn't an architect.

867
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:32,117
He did a lot of thinking. This land is triangular.

868
00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:34,987
So regular rectangle buildings couldn't fit.

869
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,057
(The site has an irregular, triangular shape.)

870
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:37,517
He was presented with many designs.

871
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:39,127
And he liked this one the best.

872
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,657
(He chose the design of a round-roofed house.)

873
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:43,827
As it turns out, this part isn't really the third floor.

874
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,327
- That area is the third floor. - Right.

875
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:47,027
And they raised the height of the ceiling here.

876
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,298
Yes, this living room is six meters high.

877
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:54,367
(The ceiling height alone is 6 meters.)

878
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,878
The third floor at the back...

879
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,077
- holds the daughters' rooms. - Why is this the third floor?

880
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,507
I get it... according to this house.

881
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:01,877
The second floor has the living room,

882
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,518
the master bedroom, and other things.

883
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,417
Because of the rounded structure,

884
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:10,288
doesn't it feel a little as if you are in a cave?

885
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,657
- I love this feeling of coziness. - It's cozy.

886
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,618
(It feels as if you’ve stepped into a cozy cave.)

887
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:15,858
So true.

888
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:18,419
This kind of place would make me want to come home all the time.

889
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:20,127
Would the homeowner like to adopt a son?

890
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,768
It makes me think that.

891
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,268
You'd have to come here after work.

892
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,038
All the way to Mungyeong.

893
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:27,508
(It's a 2-hour drive from Seoul to Mungyeong.)

894
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:30,538
I looked at the books that the owner reads.

895
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,308
It's all about money. "Money, Cycles and Chance"

896
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:34,877
"First Time Learning About Money."

897
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,678
"My First Business Class."

898
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,117
"Trend Korea." Look.

899
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:40,247
They're all about money and the future.

900
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,087
- You're right. - It's all here.

901
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,718
"Don't Sell. Make Them Buy."

902
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:47,658
(Even the books are not ordinary.)

903
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:49,257
- It's special. - The stairs.

904
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,628
I think the upstairs will be the focal point.

905
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:52,997
Shall we take a look?

906
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:57,697
(They move to the 3rd floor.)

907
00:32:57,698 --> 00:32:59,507
It will be fun for the kids.

908
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:00,508
Of course.

909
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:03,408
Other kids would envy them for living in a place like this.

910
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:05,507
They would bring friends home every day.

911
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,708
The daughters' rooms are here.

912
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:09,248
Look, it's so pretty.

913
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:11,077
Shall we take a look?

914
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:12,598
(When you go up the orange staircase, )

915
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:19,958
(you see the elder daughter's room with an interesting arch structure.)

916
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:23,657
- The girls must love this. - Yes.

917
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:27,467
This is not an easy space.

918
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:30,468
They tried to use as much custom-made furniture as possible.

919
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:31,968
So nice.

920
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:35,138
There's no other house like this in the world.

921
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:36,577
Tae Hyun, look over here.

922
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:38,338
There is a desk back here.

923
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,448
It's such a great idea that this area is hidden.

924
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:44,747
The sleeping area is separated from the study area.

925
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:47,287
It'd be so stressful to be looking at the desk.

926
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,318
I know.

927
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:50,657
- I love this. - This is such a good idea.

928
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:52,428
It would be easy to concentrate here.

929
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:54,827
I think they had this in mind...

930
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:56,258
- right from the start. - Yes.

931
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:58,127
- Is there only one room? - There's another one.

932
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:59,298
- Next to this one. - Right.

933
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:00,828
I think they have two kids.

934
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:02,637
The rooms are actually quite far apart.

935
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:04,968
Right. So they won't be on top of each other.

936
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,607
(The second daughter's room has a different layout.)

937
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:11,408
The layout is slightly different.

938
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:12,847
- This room looks different. - Yes.

939
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:13,908
Great.

940
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,817
The rooms are on the same floor.

941
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,588
But she is in a different room from her older sister.

942
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,347
- They won't run into each other. - I can feel it.

943
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:22,357
Right.

944
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,857
When you open the door, you can't see the kids right away.

945
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,988
- I think that's the best thing. - Yes.

946
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:30,527
So, this is everything.

947
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,944
- These two rooms. - This is everything.

948
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:34,067
- It's not that spacious. - Right.

949
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:35,237
- The layout is well-structured. - That's right.

950
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:36,938
- It's well-designed. - Yes.

951
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,337
While the first floor had soaring ceilings,

952
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:41,167
this space wraps around you.

953
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:43,808
It’s the kind of space kids would love.

954
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:46,178
It also feels a bit like an attic.

955
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,617
This building is made of concrete and wood.

956
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:52,187
The two materials have completely different characteristics.

957
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:54,118
- Right. - And they have come together.

958
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:56,557
So there are parts with little gaps.

959
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,757
They don't fit perfectly.

960
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:00,357
Places like that.

961
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:02,227
- I see it. Over there. - The area with the arch.

962
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:04,757
- The area with the arch. - They fixed them together.

963
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,428
Even in hanok, when you're sleeping,

964
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:09,667
- you might hear a "zzang" sound. - Right.

965
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:12,567
In the past, people called it "the house crying."

966
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,437
The house made these sounds once in a while.

967
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,407
It is shifting and adjusting itself.

968
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,607
It's because of Korea's climate.

969
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:20,308
Can't you fill it up with something?

970
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,217
- That? - Yes. With something like silicone,

971
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:24,647
You shouldn't repair it right away.

972
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,947
You should wait and see for one season.

973
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,887
It could stick back together again.

974
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:31,157
It's better to wait and see.

975
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:32,457
- I see. - That's why...

976
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,997
Thanks for teaching us about wood and buildings all day long.

977
00:35:35,998 --> 00:35:37,527
- Thanks for everything. - Thank you too.

978
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:39,167
- I also had a great experience. - Thank you.

979
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:40,427
- Thank you. - Thank you.

980
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:41,727
(Thank you for the fascinating insights into architecture.)

981
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:44,437
It's 42km to our final destination.

982
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,538
It's Sangju. I feel quite nervous.

983
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,977
Did you hear anything from Yi Kyung?

984
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,237
- No. - He's not answering my texts.

985
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:52,648
(He checks his phone again.)

986
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,777
He sent me a text just now.

987
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,447
- What did he say? - He asks, "When is good for you?"

988
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,617
- What is? - I guess he means when to call.

989
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:00,688
Call him.

990
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:04,657
(He calls Yi Kyung right away.)

991
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,927
Don't tell him where we're headed.

992
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:07,327
Or which question we're solving.

993
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:08,657
I'll tell him we're taking a drive because we're full.

994
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:09,827
- Right. - Hey.

995
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:10,958
Where are you?

996
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:12,628
We're at the last destination.

997
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,527
- The last one? - Yes.

998
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:15,768
We have nowhere else to go.

999
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:17,937
It's not that. This is the last place.

1000
00:36:17,938 --> 00:36:19,908
- How did you do? - We got two.

1001
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:21,538
You got everything?

1002
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,038
No, we got two until the last.

1003
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:26,277
- You guys are finished? - Yes.

1004
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,678
We were told to wait to get together separately.

1005
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:31,177
You got 2 answers out of 3 questions?

1006
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:32,524
You've finished the three questions?

1007
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:34,788
Ah... 3 questions... 2 questions...

1008
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:36,998
I don't think they got the two questions.

1009
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:39,887
Don't try to guess.

1010
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:42,158
This is not bingo, you know.

1011
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:45,028
- What now? - Frankly,

1012
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:46,597
it's really difficult.

1013
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:49,068
- I know you, Seung Ho. - Yes?

1014
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:51,298
Your voice is full of hope.

1015
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:53,067
I am full of hope.

1016
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,738
Because we still have one left.

1017
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,338
You have at least 1 or 2 right.

1018
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:01,308
- We're so full. - What?

1019
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:03,228
- We keep on eating. - You got the answer?

1020
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,638
Are you saying we lose if you get the last one right?

1021
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:07,348
We're full.

1022
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:09,288
I think you are lying.

1023
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:11,558
I'm full.

1024
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,188
I think you are lying.

1025
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:17,157
Seung Ho sounds as if he has some hope now.

1026
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:18,527
My belly is about to burst.

1027
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,767
You're full?

1028
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:21,327
Then you should go to pick cucumbers tomorrow.

1029
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:23,298
Andong grilled salted mackerel is the best.

1030
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:25,408
The fish was...

1031
00:37:26,308 --> 00:37:28,308
What happened? Who hung up?

1032
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:29,808
I didn't.

1033
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:33,308
What do you think?

1034
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:38,117
In this round, we don't have to lie...

1035
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,618
to get information.

1036
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:42,288
At the end of the day,

1037
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:44,887
I think it's either 3 or 2. And I think it's 2.

1038
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,928
Me too. When I think about this,

1039
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,797
Yi Kyung lies.

1040
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:50,997
Since he says they have two, it's likely that's not true.

1041
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:53,067
- Putting that aside, - Yes?

1042
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:56,098
It's the fact that he was curious, and called asking questions.

1043
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:58,638
If they got three right, I doubt they would have cared.

1044
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,337
No, forget it.

1045
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,237
- If we have time to care... - You're right.

1046
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,837
- Let's just go with good vibes. - Yes.

1047
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:07,078
- Okay. - If we get it right, we win.

1048
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:09,247
- Let's do it with that mindset. - Of course.

1049
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,918
Let's stay clear-headed and have fun.

1050
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:13,688
Only 10 more minutes to go.

1051
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:16,017
I like this.

1052
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,758
(With a vow for victory, they draw near to the final place.)

1053
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:20,728
Let's go!

1054
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:21,858
We can do this!

1055
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:23,328
We can do this.

1056
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:26,668
(After passing through Bonghwa and Andong, they're nearing Sangju.)

1057
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:31,198
(What's the last architecture they will discover here?)

1058
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:36,377
(Handsome Building 6: House with Trees)

1059
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:38,778
Let's head to the final stage.

1060
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,148
- Let's go in. - We can do this!

1061
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:42,448
What is this?

1062
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:44,647
(Impressed)

1063
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:45,648
What is this?

1064
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,048
What is this?

1065
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:49,588
So interesting. It's very pretty.

1066
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,517
It's like those perfectly packed international deliveries.

1067
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:52,857
It's put together neatly.

1068
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:54,387
- What is this? - Hello there.

1069
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:55,557
- Welcome. - Hello.

1070
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:56,657
It's quite cold.

1071
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,397
Thank you for all your trouble.

1072
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,198
How did it go?

1073
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:02,697
- We got it right. - Great!

1074
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,737
- You seem more energetic. - Yes.

1075
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:05,738
(They seem more energized.)

1076
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,367
- It's this house. - Right.

1077
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:08,368
What do you think?

1078
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,208
It looks very interesting.

1079
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:14,078
(It has a distinctive exterior made of wood.)

1080
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:18,718
(The structure beyond the window captivates your attention.)

1081
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:22,587
(At a glance, it’s hard to tell what kind of building it is.)

1082
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,957
- I can't tell what it's used for. - It's a residential house.

1083
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,088
It looks very safe.

1084
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,528
- It's a house? - It is.

1085
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:31,297
The exterior is very unique, isn't it?

1086
00:39:31,298 --> 00:39:32,868
It doesn't look like a house.

1087
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,598
- You'll see when you go inside. - I can't wait.

1088
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:36,898
It's very distinctive.

1089
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:39,067
- The son... - Yes?

1090
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:41,268
Constructed this house for his father.

1091
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,677
The son personally did nearly everything.

1092
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,037
- It's so interesting. - They live here?

1093
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:46,977
Yes, his father and mother live here.

1094
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:48,647
- The House of Three Trees? - That's right.

1095
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:50,768
- It's written there. - That's the name of the house.

1096
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:53,547
- Shall we go? Can't wait to see it. - Let's go that way.

1097
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:54,817
(It is called The House of Three Trees.)

1098
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:55,818
What?

1099
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:57,988
Excuse us.

1100
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:00,958
(What is it like inside?)

1101
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:05,628
- This is amazing! - It has some special vibes.

1102
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:06,927
The columns...

1103
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:09,098
It has some special vibes.

1104
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:12,098
This is amazing!

1105
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:15,407
- What is this? - Amazing!

1106
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:16,478
It's very sturdy.

1107
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:23,548
(Intertwined branches fill the entire house.)

1108
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:29,188
(As you look downward something comes into view.)

1109
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:31,457
There are three trees.

1110
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,757
How did he think of this?

1111
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,287
He made the columns in the shape of trees.

1112
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,898
- There are three trees, right? - Yes.

1113
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,498
That's how this house got its name.

1114
00:40:37,628 --> 00:40:38,898
This is incredible!

1115
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:41,168
Isn't it unique?

1116
00:40:41,298 --> 00:40:43,237
They don't have to buy a Christmas tree.

1117
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:44,767
(It is possible to enjoy Christmas without buying a tree.)

1118
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:46,337
- They can hang decorations here. - That's right.

1119
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,807
They're living inside the tree.

1120
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,607
If you connect a pull-up bar here, it would be perfect.

1121
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,347
I can't help thinking about things like that.

1122
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,407
You could install a jungle gym.

1123
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:56,417
- Or something like a net. - Install it over there.

1124
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:57,447
- You could climb and stuff. - Right.

1125
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:59,608
- You could do it like this. - Practice some climbing.

1126
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:02,047
- You can use ropes. - The kids can hang here and play.

1127
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,488
- Just like Tarzan. - Play on ropes.

1128
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:06,027
It feels like being inside a tree.

1129
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,928
Doesn't it? It's like being in a forest.

1130
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:09,227
- Like a zelkova tree. - Right.

1131
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:10,474
- What I want to know is... - Yes?

1132
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:14,027
To support the ceiling or the weight of the house,

1133
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:16,067
- are the trees also playing a role? - They are supporting the house.

1134
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,837
- The trees are doing that? - They are doing just that.

1135
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:19,838
- They're not just decorations? - They're columns.

1136
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,008
- What? - Is that possible?

1137
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:25,477
It has to bear the weight of the roof.

1138
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:27,747
The weight has to be transferred down to the ground.

1139
00:41:27,748 --> 00:41:29,277
- Right. - The way to do that...

1140
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,278
is to transfer the weight here at the endpoint.

1141
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,617
When I touched it, it was really sturdy.

1142
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:35,517
Both side panels provide support.

1143
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:37,217
- Then the force is spread out. - Safely.

1144
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,527
That weight collects and goes down to the legs.

1145
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,987
That’s pretty much how it works.

1146
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:43,627
It looks as if it isn't taking any weight.

1147
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,667
It looks like it would move if you tap it.

1148
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:46,767
But it's not like that at all.

1149
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:48,597
This is plywood.

1150
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:50,438
They glued several sheets of plywood together.

1151
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,237
(Several sheets of plywood are glued together.)

1152
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:55,577
The advantage of plywood is that solid wood tends to...

1153
00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:57,377
- expand and contract a lot. - I see.

1154
00:41:57,378 --> 00:42:00,477
Since plywood is a manufactured wood product,

1155
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,347
it undergoes much less expansion and contraction.

1156
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:04,268
- It must be less prone to bending. - Much less.

1157
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:07,217
It has that kind of advantage.

1158
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:08,717
(It was a choice that took both cost and upkeep into consideration.)

1159
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:10,587
I wonder how he came up with this idea.

1160
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:14,357
He pondered about ways to modernize hanok.

1161
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:15,927
This is how he tackled the challenge.

1162
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:18,127
Over there in the middle... When you look at Geunjeongjeon Hall,

1163
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:19,867
- the wooden pieces are interlocked. - That's right.

1164
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:21,867
- You can see it here and there. - Right.

1165
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:23,397
- They're fitted together. - This way and that.

1166
00:42:23,398 --> 00:42:24,537
They're biting on each other.

1167
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:26,537
- It's like that there too. - It's biting on each other.

1168
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,537
(The structures here are also interlocked with one another.)

1169
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:32,007
When we visit a temple or a royal palace like Geunjeongjeon,

1170
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,947
they have columns and a roof.

1171
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:35,947
And in between, there are all these intricate stuff.

1172
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:37,317
They are called "gongpo."

1173
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:39,794
(A structure installed on a column to support the weight of the roof.)

1174
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:44,118
(Wood is carved and shaped, then the components are assembled.)

1175
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:48,757
(This completes the structure called gongpo.)

1176
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,527
This house interpreted the gongpo method in a modern way.

1177
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,728
In a very unique way.

1178
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,797
All these act as...

1179
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:58,297
- crossbeams, rafters... - That's right.

1180
00:42:58,298 --> 00:42:59,708
- They're columns. - Everything.

1181
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:03,277
There's something this architect thought about.

1182
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:05,848
What is an easier method to do this?

1183
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,578
- Assembling them. - That's right.

1184
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,547
- But this... - He assembled them.

1185
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,777
But these are not existing products.

1186
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:12,987
Didn't he custom-make them himself?

1187
00:43:12,988 --> 00:43:14,917
But now we have computer-controlled cutting.

1188
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:17,717
You draw up the design and feed it into the computer.

1189
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,827
- You print them. - The machine prints them.

1190
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:22,858
(Materials are cut by machine instead of by hand.)

1191
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:26,497
Pieces are put together without using nails.

1192
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:28,327
They are tapped and fixed together by hand.

1193
00:43:28,328 --> 00:43:30,344
(Each piece is connected only using joinery without nails.)

1194
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:32,337
(Total wooden pieces used:)

1195
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:35,067
(4,006 pieces)

1196
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:37,478
We've visited a truly authentic hanok.

1197
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:40,478
(Traditional hanok)

1198
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,377
We’ve also seen a modernized one.

1199
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:43,877
(Modernized hanok)

1200
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:46,687
- This is a very progressive hanok. - I agree.

1201
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:48,988
- It's futuristic. - Yes, it's a futuristic hanok.

1202
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,557
If structures like this continue to be developed,

1203
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:53,287
young people can construct them easily.

1204
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:55,387
- They just have to assemble them. - That's right.

1205
00:43:55,388 --> 00:43:58,928
I think that will be possible in the near future.

1206
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,297
But you said this was a house.

1207
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:03,937
There doesn't seem to be any other space than this.

1208
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,907
Where do the owners sleep?

1209
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:08,707
It appears as if this is everything you see.

1210
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,737
But there are hidden spaces here and there.

1211
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:11,907
The kitchen is over there.

1212
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,777
- Can we see it? - Come this way here.

1213
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:14,984
(It's time for the full house tour!)

1214
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:17,548
(There is a kitchen, living room, bathroom, and utility room.)

1215
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:20,047
(Pass by the spacious living room, )

1216
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,818
(and enter the inner area.)

1217
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,187
There is a simple kitchen here.

1218
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:26,257
- It's the kitchen. - The kitchen is here.

1219
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:29,457
- It has quite a bit of depth. - Yes.

1220
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,457
- You can see everything easily. - Only two people live here.

1221
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,204
- That's right. - So it doesn't have to be large.

1222
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:34,997
This leads to the upstairs area.

1223
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:36,167
- Can we see it? - You can go up.

1224
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,168
Through here?

1225
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:39,938
(The bedroom)

1226
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:43,478
The stairs are offset like this.

1227
00:44:43,678 --> 00:44:46,977
(Unlike typical stairs, the steps are offset in height.)

1228
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,207
The stairs are so unique.

1229
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:51,477
They're fascinating. You take a step and another.

1230
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:54,247
He minimized the staircase area.

1231
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,817
- He placed the steps side by side. - One stair each.

1232
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,394
(This method minimizes stair area and reduces step height difference.)

1233
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:58,687
This is very convenient.

1234
00:44:58,688 --> 00:44:59,828
(Surprisingly convenient)

1235
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:01,088
Where's the bedroom?

1236
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:05,998
(You go up the stairs one step at a time.)

1237
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:09,468
(Go all the way into the back of the 2nd floor.)

1238
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:10,867
It's here!

1239
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:15,807
(Bedroom)

1240
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:16,808
It's cozy.

1241
00:45:17,308 --> 00:45:18,678
I'd fall asleep easily here.

1242
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:22,478
It's very cozy here.

1243
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:24,047
It's like a bird's nest in the middle.

1244
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:26,118
It's like a bird's nest, isn't it?

1245
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:28,587
- This... - It's so sturdy.

1246
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:32,018
It must feel like waking up in a fairy tale every day.

1247
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:36,698
(This is their everyday wake-up view.)

1248
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:38,357
This is fun.

1249
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,398
This certainly feels like being inside some forest.

1250
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:43,067
I want to install a slide here.

1251
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,797
That's a great idea.

1252
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:46,937
(Do you mean something like this?)

1253
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:49,037
In different spots,

1254
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,808
there are photo frames bringing back memories.

1255
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:55,178
I think you'll love this place more as time goes by.

1256
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:01,287
This is a house where memories continue to gather.

1257
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:03,288
(There are many memories placed around the house.)

1258
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:07,128
(You can't help but wonder about the people living in such a space.)

1259
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:08,857
- Oh, dear. - Welcome.

1260
00:46:08,858 --> 00:46:10,728
- Hello. - Hello.

1261
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:12,498
- Hello. - Hello.

1262
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,097
(Kim Jeong Ryeol, Choi Gyeong Sook)

1263
00:46:14,098 --> 00:46:15,798
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1264
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,667
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1265
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:19,768
Please sit.

1266
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:22,578
Thank you for showing us your house.

1267
00:46:23,608 --> 00:46:26,207
- When your son became an architect, - Yes.

1268
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:29,047
The first house he built was for you, his parents.

1269
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:32,118
- This is the house he built. - Right.

1270
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,517
It must have made you feel so happy.

1271
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:35,717
Your two children,

1272
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:38,617
gave you this present using their talents.

1273
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:39,788
Present for you two.

1274
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,657
How would that feel?

1275
00:46:41,658 --> 00:46:43,618
It must have made you so happy. How did you feel?

1276
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:45,358
At first...

1277
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:49,498
When they first started this house, I couldn't come here.

1278
00:46:49,738 --> 00:46:50,998
I didn't come.

1279
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,568
I came during mid-construction to have a look.

1280
00:46:53,738 --> 00:46:56,207
Oh! The house was weird.

1281
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,037
- Was it strange to you at first? - Yes.

1282
00:46:58,038 --> 00:46:59,977
"It's not the house I thought of. What is this?"

1283
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:02,507
- It wasn't an ordinary house. - It was a bit awkward for you.

1284
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:05,117
I was flustered at first.

1285
00:47:05,118 --> 00:47:06,788
I couldn't complain back then.

1286
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:08,417
It was because...

1287
00:47:08,418 --> 00:47:10,087
You couldn't take it back because it was already completed.

1288
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,288
You couldn't complain.

1289
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:14,157
At first, it felt a bit uncomfortable.

1290
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:16,997
But after I got used to it, it was all right. In fact,

1291
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:18,497
when I open the doors and come in here,

1292
00:47:18,498 --> 00:47:19,967
- I face an open space. - That's right.

1293
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:22,198
- I'm so grateful now. - Right.

1294
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:23,467
The walk within the house is short.

1295
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:25,868
I can do everything in here.

1296
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:29,137
It's cool in summer, and it's warm in winter.

1297
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,837
It's bright too.

1298
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:34,207
- Others come and praise it. - Right.

1299
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,747
They must praise it a lot.

1300
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:38,877
If I come here on a sunny day, sit here, and watch up there,

1301
00:47:38,878 --> 00:47:40,387
it'll make me really happy.

1302
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:43,158
(The house feels even better on a sunny day.)

1303
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:48,628
- I have one last question. - Okay.

1304
00:47:48,688 --> 00:47:52,057
Do you sleep on the bed on the second floor?

1305
00:47:52,058 --> 00:47:53,867
- Well, about that. - We did in the beginning.

1306
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:55,827
- We used the room upstairs... - "At first."

1307
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:59,837
for about six months.

1308
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,737
- But the stairs... - I have bad knees because I'm old.

1309
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:04,608
So it was hard to go up and down the stairs.

1310
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:08,578
- My wife uses the bedroom upstairs. - Yes.

1311
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:11,377
I've made a separate bedroom next to here.

1312
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:12,578
Where?

1313
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:14,087
- We built a separate building. - It's next to this building.

1314
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:16,587
- Is there a separate building? - It's a separate building.

1315
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:18,517
- It's right out there. - It's a room.

1316
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,258
- It was built recently. - I see.

1317
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,428
So we're living separately right now.

1318
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:25,128
- They're separated. - Really?

1319
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:26,827
As a married couple,

1320
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:29,738
it's not a good idea to stay together...

1321
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:31,967
- all the time. - It's uncomfortable.

1322
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:34,168
- Pardon? - We'll keep that in mind.

1323
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:35,768
Gosh. It's feisty.

1324
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:37,338
(Dizzy)

1325
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:39,177
In foreign films, there's a house.

1326
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:42,007
- And Dad builds a house in a tree. - That's a treehouse.

1327
00:48:42,008 --> 00:48:44,777
Similar to that, it feels like a nest.

1328
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:46,047
Our grandchildren love it.

1329
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,687
When they're here, they'd go up there...

1330
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,387
and say, "Grandma, can you bring the snack up here?"

1331
00:48:50,388 --> 00:48:52,358
- They wouldn't come down. - I can imagine that.

1332
00:48:52,618 --> 00:48:54,927
They lie up there, and I'll talk to them.

1333
00:48:54,928 --> 00:48:56,597
They'd hear it and say,

1334
00:48:56,598 --> 00:49:00,097
"Grandma, we're going to sleep soon. Please keep talking a bit more."

1335
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:01,667
"Please keep talking to us."

1336
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:04,137
- For your grandchildren, - Yes.

1337
00:49:04,138 --> 00:49:07,238
The voice they heard here would be hard to forget.

1338
00:49:07,268 --> 00:49:09,977
Gosh. It's amazing.

1339
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:12,477
I've never seen a house like this before.

1340
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:14,677
- Thank you for showing it to us.. - It's nothing.

1341
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:16,318
- It's really cool. - Thank you.

1342
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:18,447
- Gosh. Well done today. - Yes.

1343
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:20,247
- It was really fun. - Thank you so much.

1344
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,987
I hope you get the last quiz right.

1345
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:23,817
- We'll do our best. Thank you. - Thank you.

1346
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:24,988
- Thank you. - Yes.

1347
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,157
(Team Guys is done touring the last house of the day.)

1348
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:30,657
(Team Handsome)

1349
00:49:30,658 --> 00:49:33,067
But they sounded hopeful.

1350
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:35,628
- They got two questions right. - That's possible.

1351
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:38,237
I'd hate to have a rematch when it's tied at three.

1352
00:49:38,238 --> 00:49:39,867
If it's 3 versus 3,

1353
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:41,167
it means we lost.

1354
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:42,244
(If it's 3 versus 3, it means we lost.)

1355
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:43,977
- They don't have a reattempt card. - Exactly.

1356
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:46,307
If it's a tie when we had the card, it means...

1357
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:49,717
- Here's the last quiz. - Okay.

1358
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:51,878
- The last quiz. - I want to make history.

1359
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:54,217
The round roof of this house...

1360
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:57,587
was inspired by the gates of the Mungyeongsaejae Pass.

1361
00:49:57,588 --> 00:49:59,088
- The Mungyeongsaejae Pass. - What?

1362
00:49:59,258 --> 00:50:01,728
- The Mungyeongsaejae Pass's gates. - The gates.

1363
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:04,098
- I know where those are. - Okay.

1364
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:07,597
There's a special stone marker on the Mungyeongsaejae Pass.

1365
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:09,027
Taejo Wang Geon.

1366
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:10,737
(Taejo Wang Geon.)

1367
00:50:10,738 --> 00:50:11,798
(Smiling)

1368
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,467
(Does he know about this one?)

1369
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,507
If you know about it, keep quiet.

1370
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:18,038
Choi Soo Jong. I don't know.

1371
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:20,248
(It was just gibberish.)

1372
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:21,977
For goodness' sake.

1373
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,317
(He was fooled.)

1374
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:24,818
- This is the stone marker. - What?

1375
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:26,688
He's showing it to us.

1376
00:50:26,718 --> 00:50:28,587
(What's going on?)

1377
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:30,318
And you want us to get that?

1378
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:32,827
This stone marker is estimated to have been built...

1379
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:34,058
during the Joseon Dynasty.

1380
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:36,827
It was written in complete Korean without using Chinese letters,

1381
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:39,328
so it has a high value as a cultural asset.

1382
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:42,838
On the stone, it's written, "Avert this."

1383
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:44,998
What is "this"?

1384
00:50:45,138 --> 00:50:46,867
Avert? Is that Korean?

1385
00:50:46,868 --> 00:50:48,068
"Avert."

1386
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:50,308
- I can tell it's a one-word. - I see.

1387
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:52,677
"Avert this."

1388
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:54,178
What does "avert" mean?

1389
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:57,317
- Do I have to guess that? - You should get that too.

1390
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:58,547
Our discussion will begin again.

1391
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,517
- Tae Hyun, it's the same thing. - This is too hard.

1392
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:02,958
I think "Avert" means "Watch out for."

1393
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,258
"Avert wolves."

1394
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,157
"Avert bears." Something like that?

1395
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:08,557
"Avert dogs?"

1396
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:10,298
"Avert" means "Watch out for," then?

1397
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:11,457
I think it has to do...

1398
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,527
- with filial love. - "Filial love?"

1399
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,498
It's about one's love as it's a stone market.

1400
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:18,597
(Let's see.)

1401
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:19,937
I don't think it has to do with the filial love.

1402
00:51:19,938 --> 00:51:21,467
It's written in red.

1403
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:24,038
You wouldn't write "filial love" in red.

1404
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:25,838
(Is that so?)

1405
00:51:26,008 --> 00:51:27,247
"Avert..."

1406
00:51:27,248 --> 00:51:29,247
(Avert...)

1407
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:31,717
Tae Hyun, can you recite "Hunminjeongeum" until the end?

1408
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:33,347
If we go over that,

1409
00:51:33,348 --> 00:51:35,587
we'd know what "avert" means here.

1410
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:36,987
"The spoken language..." So and so.

1411
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:38,564
- "is different from that of China." - "Is different from that of China."

1412
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:41,258
(They can't go on after that.)

1413
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:42,827
- "is different from that of China." - "Is different from that of China."

1414
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:45,158
- It's so hard. - Then it's meaningless.

1415
00:51:45,598 --> 00:51:47,597
See? We can't help but sit.

1416
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:48,927
- Let's sit. - I mean...

1417
00:51:48,928 --> 00:51:50,637
- Sit. - you can't go on like this.

1418
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:52,638
(They have a feeling that it'll take a long time.)

1419
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:54,168
Yes. Look through the light.

1420
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:57,207
Gosh. How thick is this board?

1421
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,108
- The light doesn't go through. - "Avert..."

1422
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:01,947
I think "Avert" means "Watch out for."

1423
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:03,247
I think it means "Watch out for" too.

1424
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,254
- Right? It's written in red too. - It's a stone marker.

1425
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:07,317
Something like "Watch out for ghosts."

1426
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:09,494
- It means "Watch out for." - What should they watch out for?

1427
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:11,888
It's "Watch out for something." What would it be?

1428
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:14,087
Let's think about that first.

1429
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:16,697
In the question, it mentioned...

1430
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:19,798
about the gates on the Mungyeongsaejae Pass.

1431
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:22,297
If it's about the gates,

1432
00:52:22,298 --> 00:52:25,167
you have to go through the gates.

1433
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,367
In front of the gates,

1434
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:27,837
there must have been many thugs.

1435
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:28,867
(Many thugs)

1436
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:31,137
- There must have been bandits. - The bandits in the mountains?

1437
00:52:31,138 --> 00:52:32,708
So, watch out for the thieves?

1438
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:34,207
"Watch out for the thieves."

1439
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,478
"Watch out for the bandits?"

1440
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,318
It's funny how we somehow find ourselves on track.

1441
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:41,787
"Watch out for the bandits" is a bit...

1442
00:52:41,788 --> 00:52:42,957
(Persuaded)

1443
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,157
"Watch out for the bandits."

1444
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:45,788
Should we act it out again?

1445
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:48,887
- He's going to act. - You have to watch out for them.

1446
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:51,697
From Busan, I've brought many gifts for Mom,

1447
00:52:51,698 --> 00:52:53,598
and I've reached the gate.

1448
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,797
"You."

1449
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,097
(The scary-looking bandit says, "You.")

1450
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:57,767
(Laughing)

1451
00:52:57,768 --> 00:52:59,067
"Are you passing the gate?"

1452
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:00,307
"Yes. I'm passing the gate."

1453
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:02,037
"What's in that bag?"

1454
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:03,637
- "Pardon?" - "Open it already. Darn it."

1455
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,038
"He's a bandit!"

1456
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,778
"Avert the bandit!"

1457
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,777
He'd steal everything, including silk.

1458
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:14,017
The bandits would take the grilled salted mackerel and all.

1459
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:16,288
- Gosh. It sounded so plausible. - Gosh.

1460
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:20,757
"Magistrate Kim, I heard there are many bandits these days."

1461
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:21,887
"What are you going to do about it?"

1462
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:22,997
"Let's establish a stone marker."

1463
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:24,157
"Would that be enough?"

1464
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:25,227
"It would be if it's big."

1465
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:26,397
"Write in red, then."

1466
00:53:26,398 --> 00:53:28,127
"Should it say watch out or avert?"

1467
00:53:28,128 --> 00:53:29,498
"Avert, it is."

1468
00:53:29,968 --> 00:53:32,297
(The craftsman inscribes the stone marker.)

1469
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:33,637
He'd write it like this.

1470
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:35,358
(The craftsman inscribes the stone marker.)

1471
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:36,607
So many bandits...

1472
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:37,677
- Is this the answer? - Yes.

1473
00:53:37,678 --> 00:53:39,278
"Avert bandits."

1474
00:53:39,308 --> 00:53:41,107
It looks weird when we write it down.

1475
00:53:41,108 --> 00:53:44,248
- That's so weird. - "Avert bandits." That's so...

1476
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:46,517
- "Avert bandits." - It looks plausible.

1477
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:47,848
"Avert bandits."

1478
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:50,057
- "Avert bandits." - Gosh.

1479
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:51,794
(Because of the method acting, it sounds plausible.)

1480
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:53,978
Gosh. I'm laughing because we have the reattempt card.

1481
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:55,857
If the correct answer is "bandits,"

1482
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,658
you should consider bandits, thieves, and robbers correct.

1483
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:00,968
Do they say "thieves" a lot in period dramas?

1484
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:02,427
- On the script? - Yes.

1485
00:54:02,428 --> 00:54:03,668
A gang of thieves.

1486
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:05,337
It won't be "robber," will it?

1487
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:07,768
A robber would work alone.

1488
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:09,838
"Avert thieves."

1489
00:54:10,008 --> 00:54:11,807
(When it's written down...)

1490
00:54:11,808 --> 00:54:13,347
"Avert thieves" is...

1491
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:15,078
Gosh. It sounds plausible.

1492
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:17,747
Should we do "thieves?" I think it's better.

1493
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,617
- I think it's better too. - Wait a minute.

1494
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:21,818
We've only talked about thieves.

1495
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:23,257
How about bears?

1496
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:24,534
(He feels pressure to call it their answer.)

1497
00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:26,158
Let's do it. Should we go for it?

1498
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:27,904
Should we go with "thieves" for now?

1499
00:54:27,928 --> 00:54:29,127
- Let's do it, Si Eon. - Shall we?

1500
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:30,697
- We can get a hint. - Yes.

1501
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,397
We were being too ambitious...

1502
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:33,667
not to use the card.

1503
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:35,268
- We have the answer. - Okay.

1504
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:37,838
"Avert thieves."

1505
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:39,468
Thieves.

1506
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:41,768
My heart is pounding.

1507
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:46,407
Your answer is "thieves."

1508
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,777
I don't think it's correct.

1509
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:49,477
(Avert thieves.)

1510
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:50,547
It's incorrect.

1511
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:51,678
(Incorrect)

1512
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:53,917
(They use the reattempt card right away.)

1513
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:55,817
- Yes. We were too ambitious. - It was just in case.

1514
00:54:55,818 --> 00:54:58,087
We had no basis to make our guesses.

1515
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,387
- Let's hear the hint. - Yes, let's do that.

1516
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:01,157
- It was impossible. - We have to hear the hint.

1517
00:55:01,158 --> 00:55:02,387
It was so difficult.

1518
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:03,498
Here's the hint.

1519
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,238
"When you're awake or asleep..."

1520
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:07,097
Watch out for fires?

1521
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,867
It's "Watch out for wildfires."

1522
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:11,868
(That's it.)

1523
00:55:12,868 --> 00:55:14,167
- That was why it was in red. - It's possible.

1524
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:15,637
- That's right. - It was in red.

1525
00:55:15,638 --> 00:55:17,808
Have we used red for fire prevention since then?

1526
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:21,484
Since the Joseon Dynasty, we said, "Watch out for wildfires."

1527
00:55:21,508 --> 00:55:24,348
Exactly. Have we used the phrase since the Joseon Dynasty?

1528
00:55:24,478 --> 00:55:27,287
I thought it was a phrase that was created when we were young.

1529
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,347
- Exactly. - Because it was dry.

1530
00:55:29,348 --> 00:55:31,187
- It was "wildfires." - Come to think of it,

1531
00:55:31,188 --> 00:55:32,717
wildfires would have been seriously dangerous...

1532
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:34,287
- during the Joseon Dynasty. - That's right.

1533
00:55:34,288 --> 00:55:36,027
- It's... Gosh. - That's right.

1534
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:38,434
- I never thought of wildfires. - I couldn't come up with it at all.

1535
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,527
Let's do it right away.

1536
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:41,397
One, two, three. Our answer is...

1537
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:42,668
- wildfires. - Wildfires.

1538
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:45,467
- "Avert wildfires." - Gosh. Wildfires.

1539
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:47,037
- Is it incorrect? - No, it's not incorrect.

1540
00:55:47,038 --> 00:55:49,168
- It has to be correct. - It's correct.

1541
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,838
- Correct. - Gosh.

1542
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:52,637
Peel it off.

1543
00:55:52,638 --> 00:55:55,048
- Peel it off. - I'll peel it off carefully.

1544
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:57,618
How was it written down and said, "Avert wildfires?"

1545
00:55:58,678 --> 00:55:59,988
- Goodness. - I see.

1546
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:02,847
- It clearly says, "wildfires." - Come on.

1547
00:56:02,848 --> 00:56:04,857
In a way, it was a really easy quiz.

1548
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:06,958
It was such an easy one.

1549
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:08,827
At that time,

1550
00:56:08,828 --> 00:56:11,557
since Mungyeong was a producer of Joseon red pines,

1551
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:13,567
the nation wanted to protect the forest.

1552
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:16,397
Since a lot of people came and went on the Mungyeongsaejae Pass,

1553
00:56:16,398 --> 00:56:18,967
they put up the stone marker to be aware of it.

1554
00:56:18,968 --> 00:56:21,707
For the commoners to read it easily,

1555
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,637
it is assumed they wrote "avert" with an archaic word.

1556
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:26,177
- It's assumed so. - Yes.

1557
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,607
Gosh. It's done.

1558
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:30,517
We were already all set with "the land" before.

1559
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:32,118
When you got that quiz right back there,

1560
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:34,917
- we were all set. - What if I got that wrong?

1561
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,217
Then we would have gotten this question wrong too.

1562
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,487
That's right.

1563
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:38,687
- Well done. - Sure.

1564
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,728
- Let's go end it. - Gosh. We've...

1565
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:42,058
done so well today.

1566
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:45,457
- Avert wildfires. - Avert wildfires.

1567
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,998
- Avert them. - Avert them.

1568
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:48,068
(Current score)

1569
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:49,837
(Team Handsome: 3 versus Team Guys: 2)

1570
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,567
(Team Guys)

1571
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:53,867
Let's go. It's the last quiz.

1572
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,307
Okay. Give us the last quiz.

1573
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:57,008
- Last one. - We'll get it.

1574
00:56:57,308 --> 00:56:58,308
Please.

1575
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:00,478
(Nervous)

1576
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:03,878
You're in Sangju, home to the House with Three Trees.

1577
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:06,748
The city has long been known for its dried persimmons.

1578
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:08,318
Yes, Sangju dried persimmons.

1579
00:57:08,448 --> 00:57:09,817
Because of their exceptional taste and quality,

1580
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:11,657
they were deemed valuable enough...

1581
00:57:11,658 --> 00:57:13,688
to be offered as tributes to the king.

1582
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:15,028
That being said,

1583
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:19,257
how did the fruit come to be named "gotgam" in Korean?

1584
00:57:19,258 --> 00:57:20,767
(How did the fruit come to be named "gotgam" in Korean?)

1585
00:57:20,768 --> 00:57:23,537
Hold on a second. The answer could be anything,

1586
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:25,258
but he asked it as a short-answer question.

1587
00:57:25,968 --> 00:57:29,507
(Sighing)

1588
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:31,437
Hold on. Let me go over the question again.

1589
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:33,107
Can you read the question again?

1590
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:36,148
Sangju has long been known for its dried persimmons.

1591
00:57:36,378 --> 00:57:37,777
Because of their exceptional taste and quality,

1592
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:39,247
they were deemed valuable enough...

1593
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,887
to be offered as tributes to the king.

1594
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:44,358
How did the fruit come to be named "gotgam" in Korean?

1595
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:46,157
We must write everything down.

1596
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,228
- Sangju... - The answer is in the question.

1597
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:49,927
It was offered as tributes to the king.

1598
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,028
The king.

1599
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:52,928
Meaning "it'll soon be there."

1600
00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:54,397
That can't be right.

1601
00:57:54,398 --> 00:57:55,667
- I was joking. - Besides,

1602
00:57:55,668 --> 00:57:56,938
it's written like this.

1603
00:57:57,868 --> 00:57:59,598
I'm getting a weird feeling about this.

1604
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:03,578
I want to go with how the director pronounced the word.

1605
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:07,847
(Sangju has long been known for its dried persimmons.)

1606
00:58:07,848 --> 00:58:11,147
(How did the fruit come to be named "gotgam" in Korean?)

1607
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:13,988
(He reads into the pronunciation.)

1608
00:58:14,618 --> 00:58:16,018
He pronounced it as "ggot".

1609
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:18,618
A flower blossomed. One of a persimmon tree.

1610
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:21,687
Or maybe it means a big and juicy fruit.

1611
00:58:21,688 --> 00:58:22,728
A blooming persimmon.

1612
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,197
You may be right.

1613
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:26,258
- "Ggot" means flower. - As you know,

1614
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:30,668
we give flowers to the people we love and respect.

1615
00:58:31,468 --> 00:58:33,338
As the best kind of persimmon,

1616
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,484
- one that is like a flower... - No, that's not why.

1617
00:58:35,508 --> 00:58:37,307
Dried persimmons...

1618
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,577
are white on the outside.

1619
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:39,807
The elders describe them as having blossomed.

1620
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,007
My grandfather used to say that.

1621
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:43,818
Look. This is what I think.

1622
00:58:44,348 --> 00:58:45,817
"The city has long been known for its dried persimmons."

1623
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:47,647
"They were deemed valuable enough..."

1624
00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:49,488
"to be offered as tributes to the king."

1625
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,618
- This one. - Straight ahead.

1626
00:58:51,858 --> 00:58:53,327
Isn't it spelled like this?

1627
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:54,328
- Right. - Sure.

1628
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:57,097
Without the middle syllable, you get "godgam."

1629
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,457
I think...

1630
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:01,567
the D could've turned into a T when the middle syllable was removed.

1631
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:02,828
- I... - The basic idea...

1632
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:05,498
is that it came from the expression "will be there soon."

1633
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:07,368
I...

1634
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:09,267
I think you're right.

1635
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:12,538
The persimmons were dried throughout the entire winter,

1636
00:59:13,078 --> 00:59:14,847
and they would've been dying...

1637
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:16,688
to offer them to the king as soon as possible.

1638
00:59:16,918 --> 00:59:19,647
"The persimmons will soon be there."

1639
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:21,648
That speaks to me rather than the flower theory.

1640
00:59:22,218 --> 00:59:24,318
- This... - It could blossom in the spring.

1641
00:59:24,388 --> 00:59:26,558
Hear me out. In Korean, it's "gotgam."

1642
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:30,398
Let's think about how we spell that word.

1643
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:32,398
Jieut is added to "go."

1644
00:59:32,828 --> 00:59:34,728
That could mean "to peg."

1645
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:36,328
Think about threads.

1646
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:38,037
- You're right. - Reeling white thread...

1647
00:59:38,038 --> 00:59:39,637
- You're right. - to make a spool.

1648
00:59:39,638 --> 00:59:41,207
The persimmon looks like one on a stick.

1649
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,168
- That's been pegged. - That could be its origin.

1650
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:44,577
That's not a bad idea.

1651
00:59:44,578 --> 00:59:46,137
A persimmon that's been pegged.

1652
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:48,348
In short, the word became "gotgam."

1653
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:50,177
- No way. - That...

1654
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:51,547
- What is it? - What now?

1655
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:52,677
- Did something come to you? - You won't believe it.

1656
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:53,687
- Go ahead. - What is it?

1657
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:55,788
Look at how the house is designed on the inside.

1658
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:57,187
Doesn't it look like them?

1659
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:58,787
- Persimmons on trees? - Yes.

1660
00:59:58,788 --> 01:00:00,364
- Those hanging from trees. - Pegged persimmons.

1661
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,787
Persimmons that are pegged on twigs.

1662
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:03,457
You're right. Persimmons on sticks!

1663
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:04,627
They all make sense,

1664
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:06,098
so we need you to choose one.

1665
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:08,767
- Everything makes sense, - If we get it wrong,

1666
01:00:08,768 --> 01:00:10,397
I hope the answer...

1667
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,637
- isn't among what we discussed. - Same here.

1668
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:13,398
- It wouldn't even have been close. - Right.

1669
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:15,437
It's one out of these three.

1670
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:16,718
We have three potential answers.

1671
01:00:16,938 --> 01:00:18,608
Here's where I stand.

1672
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,448
Eighty percent,

1673
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:23,077
nineteen percent, and one percent.

1674
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,694
It'd be funny if none of them were the answer.

1675
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:26,447
- Where do you stand? - If the answer isn't here...

1676
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:27,587
Tell us where you stand.

1677
01:00:27,588 --> 01:00:28,847
(Dong Hyun: Flower, Soon, Pegged)

1678
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:30,388
Flower, 70 percent.

1679
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:31,988
Soon, 20 percent.

1680
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:34,188
And ten percent for pegged.

1681
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:36,257
There. You're next.

1682
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,357
(Flower: In the lead)

1683
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:38,358
Just tell us where you stand.

1684
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:39,927
What's your take on it?

1685
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,497
(Flower: In the lead)

1686
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:42,628
Are you 100 percent sure?

1687
01:00:44,268 --> 01:00:45,397
Then that's our answer.

1688
01:00:45,398 --> 01:00:47,198
Jae Hyeon is sure that it came from "flower."

1689
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:49,808
- Flower. - Flower?

1690
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,984
He's sure that it's because the persimmons look like flowers.

1691
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:53,578
Flower is our best option.

1692
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:55,007
Like you said earlier,

1693
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:56,847
let's forget about the rest.

1694
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:58,377
- Remove "soon" from the board. - Sure.

1695
01:00:58,378 --> 01:00:59,518
That can't be it.

1696
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:01,048
But soon...

1697
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:02,618
Do you think that's the answer?

1698
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,887
We'll follow your hunch, then.

1699
01:01:03,888 --> 01:01:04,987
Don't do that, Dong Hyun.

1700
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:07,488
If the answer is something else...

1701
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:10,928
How about we go with "pegged?"

1702
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,627
We can't think of anything else.

1703
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,297
I'm sorry for taking so long.

1704
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:16,527
- But... - Let's check it again.

1705
01:01:16,528 --> 01:01:18,468
I think it's "flower."

1706
01:01:19,368 --> 01:01:22,708
(Another debate begins.)

1707
01:01:23,268 --> 01:01:26,978
(An endless nightmare of dried persimmons)

1708
01:01:27,478 --> 01:01:30,818
(The staff can't help but think this.)

1709
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:36,718
(Why did they bother with the probabilities?)

1710
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:39,157
Let's go with our first answer which was flower.

1711
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:40,657
This is actually a good thing.

1712
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:43,387
At times, I think that an answer could in no way be correct.

1713
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:44,497
That turns out to be right.

1714
01:01:44,498 --> 01:01:45,958
That's the answer-whisperer.

1715
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:47,997
Right now, flower seems absurd.

1716
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:49,667
(They took the long route, but they're back to flower.)

1717
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:50,668
Okay.

1718
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:52,867
I'd rather not get it wrong...

1719
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:54,967
with soon or pegged,

1720
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:56,877
- but get it wrong with flower. - Sure.

1721
01:01:56,878 --> 01:01:58,877
I'd feel less annoyed in that case.

1722
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:00,347
If we say that it's something else,

1723
01:02:00,348 --> 01:02:01,807
and the answer turns out to be flower,

1724
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:03,007
I'll lose sleep for over a week.

1725
01:02:03,008 --> 01:02:04,847
- Right? That's how we should think. - Go with flower.

1726
01:02:04,848 --> 01:02:06,747
- All right. - Why are you on the fence again?

1727
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:08,818
- The... - The tip?

1728
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,698
- Persimmons with only the tip. - The tip?

1729
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:12,857
(The tip of a persimmon?)

1730
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:13,928
The tip!

1731
01:02:14,128 --> 01:02:15,128
- The tip. - Hold on.
- Wait. - The tip.

1732
01:02:16,129 --> 01:02:17,597
The skin is peeled off.

1733
01:02:17,598 --> 01:02:19,297
- And then... - Wait!

1734
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:20,767
Only the tip of a persimmon is left.

1735
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:22,374
- Couldn't that be the name? - Couldn't it be that?

1736
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:23,837
Hold on. It's like I said earlier.

1737
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:24,937
Persimmons are dried...

1738
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:27,237
after their skin is peeled off, leaving only the tip behind.

1739
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:29,038
- They're then hung on strings. - Right.

1740
01:02:29,238 --> 01:02:30,378
The tip.

1741
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:32,237
The tip turned into gotgam.

1742
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:34,108
- It's cute, if you ask me. - I'm sure of it.

1743
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:36,647
Didn't you say your hunch is always off?

1744
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:38,728
- When you're sure of something. - I'm sure of this.

1745
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:40,788
- I mean it. - Let's go with it.

1746
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:43,818
It's either flower or the tip.

1747
01:02:44,058 --> 01:02:45,388
I cautiously say...

1748
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:47,557
- that it's 20,000 percent this. - That's being cautious?

1749
01:02:47,558 --> 01:02:50,297
I mean it. I'm 20,000 percent sure.

1750
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:51,727
Seriously. It just hit me.

1751
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:52,728
The tip.

1752
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:54,327
"Yeonsi" got its name because the skin is soft.

1753
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:55,527
- Isn't that why? - Yes!

1754
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:56,897
And "dangam" is harder than other forms of persimmons.

1755
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,938
That's right.

1756
01:02:58,168 --> 01:02:59,297
- I also... - But...

1757
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:01,067
Seung Ho should decide since he's the team leader.

1758
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,407
He's the one who...

1759
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:04,088
I can't believe he came up with "the tip."

1760
01:03:04,308 --> 01:03:05,828
I wasn't sure about the other answers.

1761
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:09,707
I wondered what Sang Uk would think.

1762
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:10,878
- But... - That's what I did.

1763
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:13,477
I don't want you two to be persuaded by me.

1764
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:15,147
- I... - Hold on.

1765
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:17,588
- I wasn't certain about anything. - Didn't you say...

1766
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:20,287
you'd die if this wasn't right?

1767
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:21,827
- That's not what I meant. - You said you'd...

1768
01:03:21,828 --> 01:03:22,828
- hold us accountable. - It's not that.

1769
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:24,697
I don't mind being held accountable.

1770
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,357
Will one of you please take responsibility?

1771
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:27,727
- Here's what I think. - Sure.

1772
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:29,897
(This has been going on for 30 minutes...)

1773
01:03:29,898 --> 01:03:32,267
(We're all stuck in a persimmon nightmare...)

1774
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:35,207
We'll feel guilty for getting it wrong.

1775
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,337
- Of course. - Right?

1776
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:38,977
We'll decide by majority on this one.

1777
01:03:38,978 --> 01:03:39,978
Sure.

1778
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:41,408
- If we get it wrong, - Yes?

1779
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:42,707
We'll feel guilty about it.

1780
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:43,817
- Sounds good. - After all, he's the hero.

1781
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:44,818
Got it.

1782
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:47,347
I can't believe you made a grand speech out of it.

1783
01:03:47,348 --> 01:03:48,348
I think it's "the tip."

1784
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:49,749
- Right. The tip. - What about you?

1785
01:03:49,988 --> 01:03:51,158
I think it's "flower."

1786
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:52,887
Go with that, then.

1787
01:03:52,888 --> 01:03:54,027
- Oh, no. - We're good.

1788
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:55,528
You have the final say in it.

1789
01:03:56,288 --> 01:03:58,028
There's nothing more we can do about it.

1790
01:03:58,298 --> 01:03:59,627
Seung Ho, the decision is yours.

1791
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:01,468
Why did you have to answer last?

1792
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:03,327
(Distancing themselves)

1793
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:04,367
Go ahead. Speak your mind.

1794
01:04:04,368 --> 01:04:05,568
Got it. I will.

1795
01:04:05,898 --> 01:04:07,338
"The tip" was a great idea.

1796
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:09,307
Only the tip is left before they're dried.

1797
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:10,977
- Who'd take it off? - The tip of a persimmon.

1798
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:12,637
The word for "it'll soon be there..."

1799
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:14,308
can turn into "gotgam."

1800
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:16,807
Seung Ho, you decide.

1801
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:18,848
- Okay, let's do this. - I'll go with "the tip."

1802
01:04:19,078 --> 01:04:20,147
- What? - The tip.

1803
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,447
Let's not have any regrets.

1804
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:22,487
Don't regret it.

1805
01:04:22,488 --> 01:04:23,817
We can't think of anything else.

1806
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,017
- That's right. - We'll go with "the tip."

1807
01:04:25,018 --> 01:04:27,027
(Are we finally escaping from the persimmon nightmare?)

1808
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,057
Jae Hyeon, let's do this.

1809
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,487
Jae Hyeon, you're on fire today.

1810
01:04:29,488 --> 01:04:31,658
- Dong Hyun... - Your hunches were usually right.

1811
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:32,957
- We're done. - Should we discuss it some more?

1812
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:35,227
No, we've been talking for 40 minutes.

1813
01:04:35,228 --> 01:04:36,827
Let's stop this right here. Sorry about this.

1814
01:04:36,828 --> 01:04:38,968
- This is it. - Come to the center.

1815
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:40,937
If we get this right, you'll be our hero.

1816
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,007
Why don't we answer it in that formation from before?

1817
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:44,808
- Sure. - That sounds good.

1818
01:04:44,978 --> 01:04:47,007
All right. Let's do this.

1819
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,847
You were holding this up.

1820
01:04:48,848 --> 01:04:50,208
(This formation...)

1821
01:04:50,778 --> 01:04:54,647
(Mansan House)

1822
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:57,688
(Hanok Hotel)

1823
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:01,057
(The formation that yielded only correct answers)

1824
01:05:01,058 --> 01:05:04,427
(The so-called Dong-Ho-Hyeon Formation)

1825
01:05:04,428 --> 01:05:06,358
Jae Hyeon, go on and say it.

1826
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:08,528
- I can't... - Go on.

1827
01:05:10,768 --> 01:05:12,268
I can't.

1828
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:13,807
Just do it already!

1829
01:05:13,808 --> 01:05:14,907
- Jae Hyeon, say it. - I can't.

1830
01:05:14,908 --> 01:05:15,908
- Do it. - How can I?
I can't say it.

1831
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:18,237
- This is how stressed out we are. - Wait.

1832
01:05:18,238 --> 01:05:20,447
Guys, let's go with "the tip."

1833
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:21,477
Just say whatever you want.

1834
01:05:21,478 --> 01:05:23,278
- What should it be? - The tip.

1835
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,118
The tip?

1836
01:05:25,248 --> 01:05:28,288
- For goodness' sake! - The odds are at 59 to 41 anyway.

1837
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:29,787
- Go ahead. - The tip.

1838
01:05:29,788 --> 01:05:31,487
- We'll say that together on three. - Sure.

1839
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:32,787
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1840
01:05:32,788 --> 01:05:33,928
- The tip. - The tip.

1841
01:05:33,988 --> 01:05:35,787
- Wait. - Let's say it again.

1842
01:05:35,788 --> 01:05:36,788
We must say it with energy.

1843
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:37,797
Here's our answer.

1844
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:39,057
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1845
01:05:39,058 --> 01:05:40,058
- The tip. - Persimmon...

1846
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:41,098
Wait.

1847
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:42,797
- One, two... - This is our last attempt.

1848
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:44,037
After this, I'm giving up.

1849
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:45,167
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1850
01:05:45,168 --> 01:05:46,197
- The tip. - The tip.

1851
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:48,367
Because only the tips remained during the process of making them.

1852
01:05:48,368 --> 01:05:49,607
- I'm exhausted. - That's how it got the name.

1853
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:51,037
- I really don't know. - Because only...

1854
01:05:51,038 --> 01:05:52,207
the tip remained.

1855
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:54,184
- I have no idea. - That's why it's called gotgam.

1856
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,847
- I can't look. - I can't look at the director.

1857
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:58,077
If he tells us the answer is wrong,

1858
01:05:58,078 --> 01:06:00,517
the look on his face...

1859
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:01,987
will be etched in my memory...

1860
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:03,994
- and traumatize me forever. - There's nothing we can do now.

1861
01:06:04,018 --> 01:06:05,787
If our answer isn't correct,

1862
01:06:05,788 --> 01:06:07,457
rather than saying "incorrect,"

1863
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:09,088
can you say "too bad?"

1864
01:06:09,888 --> 01:06:11,058
The tip.

1865
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:13,327
There's a good chance we're wrong.

1866
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,098
I just hope the answer isn't flower.

1867
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:16,368
Incorrect.

1868
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:18,367
(Incorrect)

1869
01:06:18,368 --> 01:06:21,607
(That's too bad.)

1870
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,738
Hold on a second.

1871
01:06:24,038 --> 01:06:25,907
Don't tell me...

1872
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:27,408
- Is it flower? - Is it flower?

1873
01:06:27,878 --> 01:06:29,107
Is it flower because it blossoms?

1874
01:06:29,108 --> 01:06:30,277
(What's the answer?)

1875
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,318
Come on.

1876
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:33,688
- What is it? - It'll be there soon?

1877
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:35,188
- Flower? - Soon?

1878
01:06:36,088 --> 01:06:39,587
"Got" in "gotgam" came from the word "gotda."

1879
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:42,488
This is an archaic word that translates to peg or stick.

1880
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,058
- To peg? - On a stick.

1881
01:06:45,428 --> 01:06:47,128
After the skin was removed,

1882
01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:49,827
persimmons were dried while skewered onto bush clover twigs.

1883
01:06:49,828 --> 01:06:52,097
- That's how they got the name. - Skewered.

1884
01:06:52,098 --> 01:06:53,967
- They were skewered. - Got in gotgam...

1885
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,637
was always spelled with a T.

1886
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,808
They were skewered.

1887
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:00,877
- They were pegged on a skewer. - That's insane.

1888
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:03,177
You know what? I'm not that disappointed.

1889
01:07:03,178 --> 01:07:05,047
The answer wasn't "flower."

1890
01:07:05,048 --> 01:07:06,877
- Dong Hyun. - Why aren't you disappointed?

1891
01:07:06,878 --> 01:07:07,917
- It's... - I'm bummed out.

1892
01:07:07,918 --> 01:07:09,247
- Me too. - What else can we do?

1893
01:07:09,248 --> 01:07:10,517
- A moment ago, - Hold on.

1894
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:11,787
Didn't we write it down?

1895
01:07:11,788 --> 01:07:14,587
- But at the last moment... - We wrote it down.

1896
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:15,827
It's okay. We tried our best.

1897
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:17,697
- Dong Hyun, well done. - It's okay.

1898
01:07:17,698 --> 01:07:19,727
- If the answer was "flower," - Good job.

1899
01:07:19,728 --> 01:07:22,997
It could've harmed our relationship. I feel relieved.

1900
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,298
Also,

1901
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:25,867
we don't know what's going on with the other team.

1902
01:07:25,868 --> 01:07:27,067
- The score could be tied. - Also,

1903
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,537
we worked hard today.

1904
01:07:28,538 --> 01:07:30,637
- Let's just accept it and move on. - Let's do this.

1905
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:31,677
That's such a bummer.

1906
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:33,007
I'll ask ChatGPT...

1907
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:34,547
if it's related to the tip at all.

1908
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:36,248
If so, I have to do something about it.

1909
01:07:36,408 --> 01:07:40,648
(Final score Handsome 3: Guys 2)

1910
01:07:41,148 --> 01:07:42,547
I feel bad for the others.

1911
01:07:42,548 --> 01:07:43,587
(At that time, Team Handsome)

1912
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:45,388
They're taking their time.

1913
01:07:46,218 --> 01:07:50,427
(They've been waiting for Team Guys for 30 minutes.)

1914
01:07:50,428 --> 01:07:52,297
I'm so happy about being good at the game.

1915
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:53,358
(However, )

1916
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:55,997
(he's holding the scoreboard very tightly for some reason.)

1917
01:07:55,998 --> 01:07:57,168
We're the winners.

1918
01:07:57,738 --> 01:07:59,698
- It's all thanks to you. - Si Eon.

1919
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:01,338
Don't be surprised.

1920
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:05,338
(There are 2 stickers?)

1921
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:07,407
- Don't be surprised. - For now...

1922
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:08,577
(Tired of waiting, they started plotting something.)

1923
01:08:08,578 --> 01:08:09,977
That startled me.

1924
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,247
I thought that it was true.

1925
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:14,348
(Will their surprise for Team Guys be successful?)

1926
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:16,347
Dong Hyun, we still worked very hard today.

1927
01:08:16,348 --> 01:08:18,257
Definitely. We were amazing.

1928
01:08:18,258 --> 01:08:19,588
We accomplished the impossible.

1929
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:21,927
I don't know if the score is 2 to 2 or 3 to 2.

1930
01:08:21,928 --> 01:08:23,787
- I think it's 2 to 2. - Right?

1931
01:08:23,788 --> 01:08:24,998
Yes, I think it's 2 to 2.

1932
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:27,268
- Good job, everyone. - Well done.

1933
01:08:27,328 --> 01:08:29,098
- Let's find out. - We did our best.

1934
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,067
We were the best.

1935
01:08:31,068 --> 01:08:33,267
(Team Handsome and Guys have gathered.)

1936
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:34,408
It feels hazy in my head.

1937
01:08:34,768 --> 01:08:37,438
- Goodness. - While waiting for you,

1938
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:39,678
- I almost fell asleep. - Hey.

1939
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:41,407
- Gosh. - You got robbed again.

1940
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,378
- Gosh. - You told him again?

1941
01:08:46,478 --> 01:08:48,448
- Is that your... - Did you see it?

1942
01:08:48,948 --> 01:08:50,268
- Do they have three? - Goodness.

1943
01:08:50,318 --> 01:08:51,957
- I'm going to the restroom. - Do they have three?

1944
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,887
(Jae Hyeon takes it with him.)

1945
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:55,428
- Did you see it? - Goodness.

1946
01:08:55,728 --> 01:08:58,358
- Did you see it? - They definitely had many.

1947
01:08:58,858 --> 01:09:00,528
- Was it 2 or more? - It was 2 or more.

1948
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,197
- They have two or more. - They did well.

1949
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,697
(Did I hide the sticker for nothing?)

1950
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:05,768
That's insane.

1951
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:09,138
Come in.

1952
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,638
- This is shocking. - Hurry up. We've been waiting.

1953
01:09:13,078 --> 01:09:14,278
Stop taking more time.

1954
01:09:14,578 --> 01:09:16,907
Why are you so late? We should've decided the time.

1955
01:09:16,908 --> 01:09:18,677
- Good job, Seung Ho. - Good job.

1956
01:09:18,678 --> 01:09:19,678
(You did a good job.)

1957
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,047
- We worked very hard. - Well done.

1958
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:24,287
Well done, everyone.

1959
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:25,517
I like your attitude.

1960
01:09:25,518 --> 01:09:27,327
Good luck with picking cucumber tomorrow.

1961
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:29,587
(Dancing)

1962
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:30,798
You know what?

1963
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:35,298
Jae Hyeon came in with the scoreboard.

1964
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:37,667
I glanced at it, and I was shocked.

1965
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:39,037
- Why? - You have so many stickers.

1966
01:09:39,038 --> 01:09:40,437
(They throw some bait first.)

1967
01:09:40,438 --> 01:09:41,807
- They have so many stickers. - Did you really see them?

1968
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:43,607
- What? - I took a quick look.

1969
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:45,114
I didn't see how many they had exactly.

1970
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:46,777
I'm sure that they have two or more.

1971
01:09:46,778 --> 01:09:48,747
Did you have a hard time?

1972
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:49,877
Take a seat.

1973
01:09:49,878 --> 01:09:52,648
We came all the way here without any reattempt cards.

1974
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:55,017
- The last question was... - The last one was...

1975
01:09:55,018 --> 01:09:56,587
(Without realizing Team Handsome's secret plan)

1976
01:09:56,588 --> 01:09:57,588
Seriously.

1977
01:09:58,358 --> 01:09:59,358
At the last moment,

1978
01:09:59,858 --> 01:10:01,457
if Jae Hyeon didn't bring that up...

1979
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,587
I can tell from Dong Hyun's face that they got three.

1980
01:10:03,588 --> 01:10:05,127
They really got three right?

1981
01:10:05,128 --> 01:10:06,128
I can't wait to find out.

1982
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:08,867
You guys are really amazing.

1983
01:10:08,868 --> 01:10:10,767
Why don't we exchange our scoreboards?

1984
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:12,197
- Let's reveal it at the same time. - No way.

1985
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:13,567
- Reveal it at the same time. - At the same time?

1986
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:14,814
- Yes. - Shall we exchange them?

1987
01:10:14,838 --> 01:10:15,937
Isn't it better to do it at the same time?

1988
01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:17,454
- Let's reveal it at the same time. - Go ahead.

1989
01:10:17,478 --> 01:10:20,238
- Just open it. - We'll open it. Take a look.

1990
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:21,708
Hurry up.

1991
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:25,217
(Screaming)

1992
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:26,218
Hey.
(Screaming)

1993
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,218
Hey.

1994
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:29,847
(Delighted)

1995
01:10:29,848 --> 01:10:31,587
This is such a relief.

1996
01:10:31,588 --> 01:10:32,618
Is the score tied?

1997
01:10:32,888 --> 01:10:34,557
How did they get two right?

1998
01:10:34,558 --> 01:10:36,027
- I told you that they got two. - Is the score tied?

1999
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:37,397
How did they get two right?

2000
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:39,357
(Working hard to act)

2001
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,727
- Wait, didn't you get 3? - They got 2.

2002
01:10:41,728 --> 01:10:43,397
- Didn't you get 3? - How did they get 2?

2003
01:10:43,398 --> 01:10:45,297
Two? I see that a sticker was taken off.

2004
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:47,438
We put one by mistake.

2005
01:10:47,468 --> 01:10:49,708
- We worked very hard. - Did you really get two?

2006
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:51,807
- How many did you get? - We got two.

2007
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:53,937
- Seriously... - What we said was true.

2008
01:10:53,938 --> 01:10:56,307
We were close to getting three.

2009
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:57,747
- Seriously. - You did an amazing job.

2010
01:10:57,748 --> 01:10:59,017
- By the way... - We worked very hard.

2011
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:00,478
We could've won.

2012
01:11:00,848 --> 01:11:02,088
The questions were hard.

2013
01:11:02,618 --> 01:11:04,017
How did they get two right?

2014
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:05,357
(Team Guys think that the score is tied.)

2015
01:11:05,358 --> 01:11:07,534
- The question about history... - You did an amazing job.

2016
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:09,487
- The question about history... - You did an amazing job.

2017
01:11:09,488 --> 01:11:12,558
Goodness, it's so hot that I can't do this.

2018
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:14,327
Goodness.

2019
01:11:14,328 --> 01:11:17,027
(Taking off his jacket)

2020
01:11:17,028 --> 01:11:19,298
Seriously, this is...

2021
01:11:19,498 --> 01:11:21,107
This is really...

2022
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:22,737
- I feel heated. - Be quiet.

2023
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:25,137
This is infuriating.

2024
01:11:25,138 --> 01:11:27,347
(They didn't see it yet...)

2025
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:29,777
We were nervous that Yi Kyung kept calling us.

2026
01:11:29,778 --> 01:11:31,017
So here's what we thought.

2027
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:32,317
(Please look at me.)

2028
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:33,617
You got the first question right after using the reattempt card.

2029
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:35,698
You got the 2nd one wrong and got the 3rd one right.

2030
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:37,657
- You're exactly right. - Right?

2031
01:11:37,658 --> 01:11:38,717
(Still untainted without knowing anything)

2032
01:11:38,718 --> 01:11:40,464
- He was feeling anxious. - We kept talking about it.

2033
01:11:40,488 --> 01:11:43,358
- You guys won first place. - Hold on!

2034
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:45,527
- You guys won first place. - Hold on!

2035
01:11:45,528 --> 01:11:47,997
(Hold on!)

2036
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:49,668
- What's this? - You punk.

2037
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:53,598
You punk.

2038
01:11:54,638 --> 01:11:57,138
(Flopping)

2039
01:11:57,838 --> 01:11:59,007
Seriously.

2040
01:11:59,008 --> 01:12:03,348
(They're very satisfied with the result of the surprise.)

2041
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:06,478
Wait, time-out.

2042
01:12:06,578 --> 01:12:08,147
(Giggling)

2043
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:10,547
- You fools. - This is so...

2044
01:12:10,548 --> 01:12:11,587
(Disappointed)

2045
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:13,887
- Hey, you fools. - Where did you get this?

2046
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:14,927
(Brutal)

2047
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:16,087
Is this a badge? What's this?

2048
01:12:16,088 --> 01:12:17,757
I'm covering the brand label.

2049
01:12:17,758 --> 01:12:19,097
It looked like...

2050
01:12:19,098 --> 01:12:20,698
something got taken off.

2051
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:22,898
Then why were you waiting for us?

2052
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,298
(Very disappointed)

2053
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:25,637
- How could you do this? - Why didn't you call us instead?

2054
01:12:25,638 --> 01:12:26,738
Wait, time-out.

2055
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:29,238
You stepped over the line with your prank.

2056
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:31,507
- Even if you're the oldest... - You should have called us.

2057
01:12:31,508 --> 01:12:32,578
Tae Hyun.

2058
01:12:32,638 --> 01:12:34,248
You went too far with your joke.

2059
01:12:35,348 --> 01:12:37,477
- Don't get physical. - Tae Hyun.

2060
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,917
- Please don't get physical. - You went too far with your joke.

2061
01:12:39,918 --> 01:12:41,718
If a martial artist like you gets physical...

2062
01:12:42,648 --> 01:12:44,487
- This is fun. - There's a limit to pulling pranks.

2063
01:12:44,488 --> 01:12:45,688
This is fun.

2064
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:47,728
Hey.

2065
01:12:47,758 --> 01:12:50,188
When you said that you had two, Jae Hyeon and I hugged.

2066
01:12:50,758 --> 01:12:52,657
Jae Hyeon and I hugged.

2067
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:53,998
After seeing this...

2068
01:12:54,468 --> 01:12:56,598
Seung Ho, say something.

2069
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:59,697
You know what makes me angry?

2070
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:01,108
You're so good at acting.

2071
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,407
While staying doubtful,

2072
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:04,808
I took a look at yours.

2073
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:06,318
Since the three of you are actors...

2074
01:13:07,878 --> 01:13:09,807
- This is... - I thought it was a magic trick.

2075
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:11,317
A sticker suddenly appeared.

2076
01:13:11,318 --> 01:13:12,877
- What's this all of a sudden? - Goodness.

2077
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:15,017
- I was really shocked. - We should've filmed Jae Hyeon.

2078
01:13:15,018 --> 01:13:16,018
(It's hard to get over it.)
Wait.

2079
01:13:17,019 --> 01:13:19,758
I'm so embarrassed about having walked in like this.

2080
01:13:20,928 --> 01:13:23,258
- It's so embarrassing. - He walked like this.

2081
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:26,758
(Shameful)

2082
01:13:28,398 --> 01:13:30,167
I can't believe that it worked so well.

2083
01:13:30,168 --> 01:13:31,338
I feel so proud.

2084
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:32,997
I feel so happy right now.

2085
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:34,608
I had a big rush of dopamine today.

2086
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:37,137
I feel so happy that my everyday life seems boring.

2087
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:39,177
- All my stress was relieved. - This is so much fun.

2088
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:40,178
(The difference in temperature is huge.)

2089
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:42,077
We started off by winning in the morning.

2090
01:13:42,078 --> 01:13:43,147
(In tatters)

2091
01:13:43,148 --> 01:13:45,177
- This is so gratifying. - Please stop...

2092
01:13:45,178 --> 01:13:46,718
hurting our feelings.

2093
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,247
I might have to pick...

2094
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:49,387
- cucumbers tomorrow. - Find out who gets the penalty.

2095
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:50,587
Will it be Seung Ho?

2096
01:13:50,588 --> 01:13:52,657
- Find out who gets it. - Dong Hyun or Sang Uk's substitute,

2097
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:54,387
- Jae Hyeon. - Do we get to watch them play?

2098
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,388
- Yes. - Of course.

2099
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:57,674
- Why would we leave first? - You'll get more dopamine.

2100
01:13:57,698 --> 01:13:59,157
- This is no joke. - You can leave.

2101
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:00,527
Won't they get divided as a team?

2102
01:14:00,528 --> 01:14:01,867
- This is the most fun part. - It's no joke.

2103
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:03,067
They're going to fight.

2104
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,337
No way. Why would we fight?

2105
01:14:05,338 --> 01:14:06,368
(It's thrilling already.)

2106
01:14:06,468 --> 01:14:09,238
Here's the quiz to select who gets the penalty tomorrow...

2107
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:10,768
at the cucumber farm.

2108
01:14:10,878 --> 01:14:12,437
Seung Ho, good luck.

2109
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:13,907
He's the only one who never got the penalty.

2110
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,047
He never got selected.

2111
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:16,224
(Candidate 1: Shin Seung Ho with no penalty experience)

2112
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:17,888
If Dong Hyun who looks like a cucumber...

2113
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:20,318
gets the penalty, what Seung Ho said would be foreshadowing.

2114
01:14:20,718 --> 01:14:22,317
Why would that be foreshadowing?

2115
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:23,318
(Candidate 2, Kim Dong Hyun who looks like a cucumber)

2116
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:25,757
- That has nothing to do with it. - He said he looked like a cucumber.

2117
01:14:25,758 --> 01:14:27,357
When we were eating,

2118
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:29,804
Jae Hyeon started with cucumber. He said that it looked delicious.

2119
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:30,897
That's closer to being foreshadowing.

2120
01:14:30,898 --> 01:14:32,828
(Candidate 3, Ahn Jae Hyeon who likes cucumber)

2121
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:35,227
See that? They aren't a team anymore.

2122
01:14:35,228 --> 01:14:36,367
From now on...

2123
01:14:36,368 --> 01:14:38,167
- They aren't a team anymore. - Yes!

2124
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:39,637
There are precise stages.

2125
01:14:39,638 --> 01:14:41,607
- And they're at the division stage. - It's usually what happens.

2126
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:42,867
It's relieving all my stress.

2127
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:45,184
- Cucumber and dried persimmon. - They'll be divided soon.

2128
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:46,508
Why are you warming up?

2129
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:49,607
What are you doing?

2130
01:14:49,608 --> 01:14:51,077
(Starting with a sign of division)

2131
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:54,618
We'll pick the first one to be exempted.

2132
01:14:55,248 --> 01:14:56,717
The elevator was...

2133
01:14:56,718 --> 01:14:57,857
(Inside the elevator)

2134
01:14:57,858 --> 01:14:59,657
invented for the first time...

2135
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,057
in the US in 1853.

2136
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:02,928
In the 1800s? Okay.

2137
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:05,757
When it was invented for the first time,

2138
01:15:05,758 --> 01:15:07,357
the elevator wasn't fast enough.

2139
01:15:07,358 --> 01:15:09,478
- I know the answer. - So the users complained a lot.

2140
01:15:10,668 --> 01:15:12,898
- One employee came up... - I got it.

2141
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,938
With an idea to quieten down the complaints.

2142
01:15:16,968 --> 01:15:18,338
- What was it? - Jae Hyeon.

2143
01:15:19,108 --> 01:15:20,108
- Jae Hyeon? - What was it?

2144
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:24,177
(Right away?)

2145
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:25,377
- Jae Hyeon? - Incredible.

2146
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:27,418
- Jae Hyeon? - Inside the elevator,

2147
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:29,648
he put up mirrors.

2148
01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:34,258
He put up mirrors inside the elevator?

2149
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:36,128
Correct.

2150
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:38,657
Correct.

2151
01:15:38,658 --> 01:15:40,627
(Ahn Jae Hyeon is exempt from the penalty.)

2152
01:15:40,628 --> 01:15:41,668
Cucumber.

2153
01:15:43,928 --> 01:15:45,897
Jae Hyeon, how you ended it was boring.

2154
01:15:45,898 --> 01:15:47,168
No way.

2155
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:49,068
During the team game...

2156
01:15:49,638 --> 01:15:51,137
During the team game today,

2157
01:15:51,138 --> 01:15:53,107
- he didn't say a word. - This is...

2158
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:54,108
(Cutting ties quickly)

2159
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:56,878
- How could you? - He didn't say a word.

2160
01:15:57,918 --> 01:15:59,077
- He kept... - He didn't say a word.

2161
01:15:59,078 --> 01:16:00,998
- Let's just watch them. - saying wrong answers.

2162
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:04,117
- This is why it's fun to watch. - You kept saying...

2163
01:16:04,118 --> 01:16:05,218
wrong answers.

2164
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:06,987
- Now they're at the stage... - Here's exactly...

2165
01:16:06,988 --> 01:16:08,057
what Jae Hyeon did today.

2166
01:16:08,058 --> 01:16:09,328
"Wait a minute!"

2167
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:10,997
- "I think that's it." - "Hold on."

2168
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:12,258
"Hey, this is groundbreaking."

2169
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:13,958
- "I think that's it." - "Wait."

2170
01:16:14,498 --> 01:16:15,667
"This must be the answer."

2171
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:17,197
(The show satisfies their dopamine level.)

2172
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,838
I got a huge rush of dopamine.

2173
01:16:20,098 --> 01:16:22,244
- This is like gambling. - Look how the blood is circulating.

2174
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:24,168
This is why people gamble.

2175
01:16:24,638 --> 01:16:26,377
- It's the last one. - Is this the real competition?

2176
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,648
I'll just pick cucumbers.

2177
01:16:27,778 --> 01:16:29,608
- The final match. - This is funny.

2178
01:16:30,148 --> 01:16:31,718
Here's the question.

2179
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:37,118
During the Joseon dynasty when scholars from Yeongnam Region...

2180
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,358
went to take the state examination,

2181
01:16:40,018 --> 01:16:42,887
they preferred to take the Mungyeongsaejae Pass.

2182
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:46,358
They avoided the Jungnyeong Pass and the Chupungnyeong Pass.

2183
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,067
They interpreted Mungyeongsaejae...

2184
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:51,037
as "get good news..."

2185
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:54,508
"and fly like a bird," so they preferred it.

2186
01:16:55,038 --> 01:16:56,207
As Chupungnyeong meant...

2187
01:16:56,208 --> 01:17:00,537
"fall like leaves in the fall," they disliked it.

2188
01:17:00,538 --> 01:17:02,498
- That's interesting. - I didn't know about that.

2189
01:17:02,578 --> 01:17:03,708
In that case, why...

2190
01:17:04,148 --> 01:17:06,317
- did they avoid Jungnyeong Pass? - Juknyeong?

2191
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:07,547
- Jungnyeong. - Jung?

2192
01:17:07,548 --> 01:17:08,548
Jungnyeong.

2193
01:17:08,549 --> 01:17:09,747
- Jung? - With the letter G.

2194
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:12,058
Why did they avoid the Jungnyeong Pass?

2195
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:14,958
- Oh that's how you spell it? - Yes.

2196
01:17:16,258 --> 01:17:17,487
(Quietly)

2197
01:17:17,488 --> 01:17:18,928
- Dong Hyun. - Gosh.

2198
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:20,827
I prefer to answer quickly.

2199
01:17:20,828 --> 01:17:22,668
Otherwise, I'll think for a long time.

2200
01:17:23,468 --> 01:17:24,538
Dong Hyun.

2201
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,198
There's a saying...

2202
01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:29,008
that means "a waste of time and energy."

2203
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:32,078
They thought that taking the exam would be a waste of time.

2204
01:17:32,578 --> 01:17:33,637
Correct.

2205
01:17:33,638 --> 01:17:35,547
(Correct)

2206
01:17:35,548 --> 01:17:36,647
Correct.

2207
01:17:36,648 --> 01:17:38,648
(Correct)

2208
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:42,217
(Performing to celebrate escaping the penalty)

2209
01:17:42,218 --> 01:17:43,748
(Have a good time picking cucumbers.)

2210
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:46,788
There it is again. It's an upgraded version.

2211
01:17:47,018 --> 01:17:51,058
(The room is filled with his annoying act.)

2212
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:53,327
- Dong Hyun. - Seriously?

2213
01:17:53,328 --> 01:17:55,167
- He ended up surviving. - It makes you fly.

2214
01:17:55,168 --> 01:17:56,227
What does it mean exactly?

2215
01:17:56,228 --> 01:17:57,644
(And the only person who can't join in the fun)

2216
01:17:57,668 --> 01:18:00,238
He's not the Stun Gun that I know.

2217
01:18:00,498 --> 01:18:02,537
He always gets the right answers that way.

2218
01:18:02,538 --> 01:18:05,007
(It ended when I didn't even do anything.)

2219
01:18:05,008 --> 01:18:06,637
- This is amazing. - He went far...

2220
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:07,807
in that seat.

2221
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,948
I'm sorry for being too excited.

2222
01:18:10,008 --> 01:18:11,118
It's okay.

2223
01:18:11,148 --> 01:18:12,777
- He always does that. - It's good.

2224
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:14,347
- It's good. - When he gets it wrong,

2225
01:18:14,348 --> 01:18:15,917
he says that he was thinking of the right answer.

2226
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:17,987
Seung Ho got the penalty for the first time.

2227
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:20,687
- That's why he yielded to me. - It's my first time.

2228
01:18:20,688 --> 01:18:21,957
- He didn't yield. - No way.

2229
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,987
Each of our members got the penalty at least once.

2230
01:18:23,988 --> 01:18:25,397
You're right.

2231
01:18:25,398 --> 01:18:26,958
- All of us... - Seung Ho.

2232
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:28,798
Look at this.

2233
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:32,437
Look at this.

2234
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:35,237
(Annoying)

2235
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:37,637
(The blessing of dopamine is endless.)

2236
01:18:37,638 --> 01:18:40,238
- You just went too far. - Okay, I'm sorry.

2237
01:18:41,348 --> 01:18:42,907
- Apologize to him. - I will.

2238
01:18:42,908 --> 01:18:44,478
I'm sorry.

2239
01:18:44,548 --> 01:18:46,218
Is this how you felt a moment ago?

2240
01:18:46,278 --> 01:18:48,147
- Is this how you felt? - Yes.

2241
01:18:48,148 --> 01:18:49,917
By the way,

2242
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:52,118
today...

2243
01:18:52,388 --> 01:18:53,987
The other team doesn't know,

2244
01:18:53,988 --> 01:18:56,068
but we worked very hard, so I don't regret anything.

2245
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,428
It's unfortunate that I got the penalty,

2246
01:18:59,598 --> 01:19:01,768
but everyone should get it at least once.

2247
01:19:02,228 --> 01:19:03,968
- This is good. - Don't look at Dong Hyun.

2248
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:06,498
Don't look at Dong Hyun.

2249
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:10,737
I'm sorry.

2250
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:12,008
Let's end the shoot.

2251
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:14,647
I have to pick cucumbers tomorrow.

2252
01:19:14,648 --> 01:19:15,754
(With wounds left in Seung Ho's heart)

2253
01:19:15,778 --> 01:19:17,547
(The next day)

2254
01:19:17,548 --> 01:19:20,578
(Cucumber farm in Sangju)

2255
01:19:20,618 --> 01:19:25,388
(The penalty man appears.)

2256
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:29,558
(He seems excited for his first penalty.)

2257
01:19:29,758 --> 01:19:31,428
(Sliding)

2258
01:19:32,658 --> 01:19:34,568
(I see.)

2259
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:37,128
(Surprised)

2260
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:42,608
(Fascinated to see a cucumber field for the first time)

2261
01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:44,478
- Hello. - Gosh.

2262
01:19:44,508 --> 01:19:46,537
My goodness.

2263
01:19:46,538 --> 01:19:48,848
- What brings you to a shabby place? - Not at all.

2264
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:50,747
- Thank you for coming. - Hello.

2265
01:19:50,748 --> 01:19:52,217
- Is this for me? - Yes.

2266
01:19:52,218 --> 01:19:55,448
You have to put this on for today.

2267
01:19:56,518 --> 01:19:58,017
Your work today is...

2268
01:19:58,018 --> 01:19:59,658
picking cucumbers of this size.

2269
01:20:00,288 --> 01:20:03,527
Pick cucumbers that are bigger than this one.

2270
01:20:03,528 --> 01:20:06,527
If it's bigger than this, please pick it.

2271
01:20:06,528 --> 01:20:08,698
- Would you like to look? - Sure.

2272
01:20:09,298 --> 01:20:11,738
- Sir, can you show it to me? - Okay.

2273
01:20:11,798 --> 01:20:13,198
This is...

2274
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:18,338
Dong Hyun, were you happy to go home early yesterday?

2275
01:20:18,738 --> 01:20:19,807
Sleep well.

2276
01:20:19,808 --> 01:20:21,454
(Sleep well, Dong Hyun. I'll pick the cucumbers.)

2277
01:20:21,478 --> 01:20:24,148
(Good luck, Seung Ho!)

2278
01:20:24,178 --> 01:20:26,747
Push this forward as you go.

2279
01:20:26,748 --> 01:20:27,888
About this size.

2280
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:30,618
You can pick it if it's about this size.

2281
01:20:30,648 --> 01:20:32,487
- Hold the stem. - Hold the stem.

2282
01:20:32,488 --> 01:20:33,658
Pull it up.

2283
01:20:34,318 --> 01:20:35,557
Like this.

2284
01:20:35,558 --> 01:20:37,628
- Including the tip? - Yes.

2285
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:40,697
Leave the stem as much as possible.

2286
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:41,998
Put it in here.

2287
01:20:42,528 --> 01:20:43,968
As you push it forward...

2288
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:46,898
Could you try to find one over here?

2289
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:48,968
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

2290
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:52,077
Hold the stem.

2291
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:53,637
- Pull it up. Pluck. - Right.

2292
01:20:53,638 --> 01:20:56,677
That's right. Well done.

2293
01:20:56,678 --> 01:20:57,977
(That's right. Well done.)

2294
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,018
(Pleased)

2295
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,618
(Picking his first cucumber is a success.)

2296
01:21:05,018 --> 01:21:06,218
Who's next?

2297
01:21:07,118 --> 01:21:08,258
Turn yourself in.

2298
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:13,257
(He finds his target.)

2299
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:15,097
I caught it. It was hiding.

2300
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:16,228
You're sharp-eyed.

2301
01:21:16,368 --> 01:21:17,728
You punk.

2302
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:20,267
(Target acquired)

2303
01:21:20,268 --> 01:21:22,108
(He picks the cucumber neatly.)

2304
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:24,678
I will find all of you.

2305
01:21:25,238 --> 01:21:26,378
I caught you.

2306
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,108
I caught this brat.

2307
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:29,547
Here it is.

2308
01:21:29,548 --> 01:21:33,648
(The cucumber detective is getting better results quickly.)

2309
01:21:34,178 --> 01:21:35,887
I picked so many already.

2310
01:21:35,888 --> 01:21:37,488
(Soon, he picked 10 cucumbers.)

2311
01:21:37,618 --> 01:21:39,157
You're good at picking them now.

2312
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:40,488
- Aren't I good? - Yes.

2313
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:43,828
Let me tell you why I stayed behind.

2314
01:21:44,128 --> 01:21:45,157
Sangju is known...

2315
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:46,674
- for dried persimmons. - That's right.

2316
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,097
Where does the name...

2317
01:21:49,098 --> 01:21:51,467
dried persimmon come from?

2318
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:53,568
That was the question.

2319
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,367
May I tell you the answer?

2320
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:58,407
Yes, tell me. I don't know the answer to that.

2321
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:01,078
- You have friends around you. - Yes.

2322
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:03,978
"Do you know where the name dried persimmon comes from?"

2323
01:22:04,648 --> 01:22:06,548
- You can ask them that. - Right.

2324
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:08,747
It's something to discuss over drinks.

2325
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:09,888
Could you pick this?

2326
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:13,087
- I'm sorry for being talkative. - No,

2327
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:14,857
- it's okay. - I'm usually not talkative,

2328
01:22:14,858 --> 01:22:16,827
but I tend to say useless things.

2329
01:22:16,828 --> 01:22:17,948
(I say many useless things.)

2330
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,597
Today, we're working together...

2331
01:22:20,598 --> 01:22:23,967
This may be something you do every day,

2332
01:22:23,968 --> 01:22:27,037
but it will be a good experience for me.

2333
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:28,038
(Right)

2334
01:22:28,268 --> 01:22:30,508
Could you twist that one off?

2335
01:22:30,538 --> 01:22:32,707
I guess,

2336
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,978
I'm not fun for you.

2337
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,747
I'm having fun.

2338
01:22:35,748 --> 01:22:38,478
After all, I came here to work.

2339
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:41,047
- You came to help me. - Of course.

2340
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:42,287
You know what?

2341
01:22:42,288 --> 01:22:43,847
(Another attempt to chat)

2342
01:22:43,848 --> 01:22:45,888
(Shot down again)

2343
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:50,457
- I'm tactful. - I see.

2344
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:51,897
I'm very tactful.

2345
01:22:51,898 --> 01:22:53,957
Right now, you're listening to me...

2346
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:57,228
without saying a word,

2347
01:22:57,628 --> 01:22:59,998
but you must be thinking, "This punk talks too much."

2348
01:23:00,638 --> 01:23:01,737
"He doesn't work."

2349
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:03,737
I understood how you felt right away.

2350
01:23:03,738 --> 01:23:05,037
That's not what I'm thinking.

2351
01:23:05,038 --> 01:23:06,437
There are many over here.

2352
01:23:06,438 --> 01:23:08,118
(He reads his mind and gets back to work.)

2353
01:23:08,448 --> 01:23:11,208
(I will stop talking for a while and work.)

2354
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:12,648
(Pluck)

2355
01:23:13,478 --> 01:23:14,548
(Pluck)

2356
01:23:15,148 --> 01:23:17,818
(Picking cucumbers without hesitation)

2357
01:23:19,118 --> 01:23:20,758
I see them right away.

2358
01:23:21,488 --> 01:23:22,787
I'm a cucumber hunter.

2359
01:23:22,788 --> 01:23:23,788
(I'm a cucumber hunter.)

2360
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:25,327
Scanning.

2361
01:23:25,328 --> 01:23:26,328
(Scanning cucumbers)

2362
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:29,568
Here it is.

2363
01:23:29,728 --> 01:23:31,028
I caught it.

2364
01:23:31,868 --> 01:23:34,598
(The cucumber hunter is merciless.)

2365
01:23:34,638 --> 01:23:39,038
(Sweeping up the cucumbers)

2366
01:23:39,178 --> 01:23:41,547
(Soon, his bucket is filled with cucumbers.)

2367
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:42,748
I picked a lot.

2368
01:23:44,008 --> 01:23:47,847
(Picking all the cucumbers including the last one)

2369
01:23:47,848 --> 01:23:49,017
(Heavy)

2370
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:50,148
Seriously.

2371
01:23:50,618 --> 01:23:51,918
Goodness.

2372
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:54,488
You worked hard.

2373
01:23:54,758 --> 01:23:56,127
Please take a look.

2374
01:23:56,128 --> 01:23:58,398
- You picked a lot. - Yes.

2375
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:01,598
- You promised to pack them too. - Yes.

2376
01:24:01,798 --> 01:24:04,228
(Packing cucumbers)

2377
01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:06,397
Put ten cucumbers at the bottom.

2378
01:24:06,398 --> 01:24:08,307
- Ten in the other direction. - Okay.

2379
01:24:08,308 --> 01:24:09,668
- Fifty? - Yes.

2380
01:24:10,038 --> 01:24:14,107
(Packing cucumbers carefully)

2381
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:15,548
Six, seven.

2382
01:24:16,008 --> 01:24:17,377
You're focused now,

2383
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:19,678
but you talked a lot while picking cucumbers.

2384
01:24:20,148 --> 01:24:22,648
Is there nothing to say?

2385
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:25,918
Here's why.

2386
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:30,257
I'm finishing the work as I pack cucumbers.

2387
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:33,727
This is the final product that consumers will get.

2388
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:34,927
- That's right. - Yes.

2389
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:37,167
It's like acting without making mistakes.

2390
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:38,467
(He resisted talking to avoid making mistakes.)

2391
01:24:38,468 --> 01:24:40,437
Thinking of it going to consumers...

2392
01:24:40,438 --> 01:24:41,508
I see.

2393
01:24:42,268 --> 01:24:44,068
It's the last one.

2394
01:24:44,638 --> 01:24:45,808
It's done.

2395
01:24:46,678 --> 01:24:48,378
It's complete. Here it is.

2396
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:50,607
It's done.

2397
01:24:50,608 --> 01:24:52,277
- Seung Ho. - It's done.

2398
01:24:52,278 --> 01:24:54,547
- You can finish with that. - Okay.

2399
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,387
This was my last one.

2400
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:58,887
- Gosh, good job today. - Don't mention it.

2401
01:24:58,888 --> 01:25:00,758
- I'll move this one. - Okay.

2402
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,087
You've worked hard since early this morning.

2403
01:25:03,088 --> 01:25:05,528
- Don't mention it. Thank you. - Well done.

2404
