I haven't come back here in years.

Bring back the balloon.

See, balloons are so fun to play with.

the next step we need to work on

is to look for an opportunity and find a way

Yes.

Good.

How about Wang Bingrui?

Can't get through to him.

those two were really close

How did you know?

102
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,100
My fan told me.

103
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,440
I've got an idea.

104

Enough, enough.

105
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,750
Don't be such a busybody.

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,760
I've heard that

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,000
this one had put in a lot of effort

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
and stocked 10 types at once.

109
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,120
How I want to get them all.

110
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,090
I'm not that greedy.

111
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,090
I just want to get the one

112
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
with Rem in overalls.

113
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,470
Then... I like the one

114
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,530
with her in a dress more.

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,220
I'll be content as long as I get that one.

116
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,330
How come there's no Rem in it?

117
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,050
Looks like someone else has caught them all.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,590
Greetings.

119
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,190
Why do you have them?

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,380
I've heard that you like figures.

121
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,610
How about we play a game?

122
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,460
What do we play then?

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Rock paper scissors.

124
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,370
Rock paper scissors.

125
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,940
Yes, best 2 out of 3.

126
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,390
If you win,

127
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,500
you can have them all.

128
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,500
What if we lose?

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,410
If you lose,

130
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,170
then we'll talk again.

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,970
OK.

132
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,890
Rock. Paper. Scissors.

133
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,760
You didn't know it, did you?

134
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
Since you are going to be my juniors,

135
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,310
I'll teach you some tricks.

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,510
According to my research,

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
The probability that people choose rock

138
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,690
in the first round is the highest.

139
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,560
Just pure luck.

140
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,170
Come on.

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,040
You don't believe me?

142
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,880
No.

143
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,330
Come on.

144
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Rock. Paper. Scissors.

145
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,320
Why are we so unlucky today?

146
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,160
It has nothing to do with luck.

147
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,380
It's a matter of probability.

148
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,690
If the probability of choosing rock is the highest,

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
then the probability of picking scissors is the lowest.

150
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,280
In addition, the loser usually chooses

151
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,560
the one that is weak to the one they chose last time.

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,180
So,

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,610
it's easy for me to guess

154
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,600
what you will play.

155
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,660
I don't believe any of this.

156
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,250
Again.

157
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,480
You...

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,110
I won.

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,790
How come I lost?

160
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,600
I lost, what do we do?

161
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,480
How about this?

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,490
You'll do a 10-minute round-robin.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,520
OK.

164
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,990
How come I lost every time?

165
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,560
Let me tell you why.

166
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,610
It's because...

167
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,570
It's... well...

168
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,960
Forget it. I'll give the chance to you.

169
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,490
Come on, tell him.

170
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,710
I read an analysis

171
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,960
that says humans have

172
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,720
a high Markov property.

173
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,290
The so-called Markov property is that

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
in the present given state

175
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,690
and among

176
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,230
all past states,

177
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,520
its past states

178
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,560
are conditionally independent.

179
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,710
In other words,

180
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,440
people depend entirely on

181
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,450
whether they win or lose this round

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,990
to decide what to choose in the next round.

183
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,670
So I just did the opposite

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,520
by remembering

185
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,270
the order of all your picks.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,810
The longer you played

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,280
and the more rounds you had,

188
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,750
the more accurate my guess will be.

189
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,310
This is the method I taught him.

190
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,770
You can actually remember

191
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,960
what I picked for each round?

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,840
But I was the one

193
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,890
who kept winning.

194
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,960
So you are amazing.

195
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,830
Mingjiang University is a good choice,

196
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,230
but the research direction you are interested in

197
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,640
is the strongest subject

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
in our university.

199
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,000
Please think it through.

200
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,480
See?

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,270
We can play tricks

202
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,500
with a game as simple as rock paper scissors,

203
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,610
then think about

204
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,560
how smart we are.

205
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,150
So

206
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,720
call us your seniors

207
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,120
and I'll give you

208
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,830
all the figures.

209
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,620
What do you say?

210
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,790
I didn't expect all the top 3 students

211
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,040
to be enrolled in our university.

212
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,050
We are so amazing.

213
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,090
Tell me about it.

214
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
I reckon when people from Mingjiang University

215
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,140
find out about this,

216
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,480
they will be fuming.

217
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,060
Chengcheng,

218
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,370
Thank you for your hard work this time.

219
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,240
You flatter me.

220
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Wait, dude.

221
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,120
Who provided the key information?

222
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,080
The key point of table-turning

223
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,920
was also provided by me.

224
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,120
-I made a lot of effort.
-Fine.

225
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,480
You... You are the most hard-working one.

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,550
Yes, yes.

227
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,290
You are the best.

228
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,240
I am so hard-working.

229
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,690
-Have more.
-That's more like it.

230
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,870
Let me get some soup.

231
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,470
Please add some soup for me.

232
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,520
Are you alright?

233
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,600
Yes, I'm fine.

234
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,970
Hurry up and eat.

235
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,130
Then we can get back early.

236
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,900
It's almost the time.

237
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,380
Let me see.

238
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,450
38.9 degree Celsius.

239
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,040
How come you have such a serious fever?

240
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,540
Cold.

241
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,910
Cold.

242
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,860
Let me get you some hot water.

243
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,590
What are you giggling at? Drink some.

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,280
How do you feel?

245
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Still a bit cold.

246
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,220
You...

247
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,040
I've turned on the air conditioning.

248
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,810
Is it any better?

249
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,630
Still cold.

250
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,690
I'll get you a blanket, then.

How's it?

292
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,670
Delicious.

293
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,330
How did you know that

294
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,130
I like my chicken soup unsalted?

295
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,820
These were all made by your mom.

296
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,640
She made a lot of dishes

297
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,600
and stored them in the fridge.

298
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's eat.

299
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,550
Aren't you going to eat?

300
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,770
I'll watch you eat.

301
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,720
[Southeast University of Science and Technology]

302
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:45,700
Hello.

303
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,410
I'm almost at school.

304
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,890
Really?

305
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,340
OK, I see.

306
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,140
What's up?

307
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,240
Lin Ying said she found the solution

308
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,570
to Musk's transmission problem

309
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,520
and it can be fixed soon.

310
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,450
Really?

311
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,050
That's great.

312
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
Then Musk can

313
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,310
enter the competition soon.

314
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,930
You are really happy.

315
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,090
In fact, these days I saw that

316
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,270
even the closest people

317
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,410
could still have misunderstandings with each other.

318
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,540
Everyone

319
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,360
is like an island,

320
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,520
there's always a distance between us

321
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,040
even if we want to approach one another.

322
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,680
But it'll be different

323
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,550
if we have Musk.

324
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,200
With its help,

325
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,290
everyone can

326
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
know themselves better,

327
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,130
as well as how to communicate with others better.

328
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,710
Then gradually, everyone will realize that

329
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,430
we are not islands,

330
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,440
but parts of

331
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,950
a continent.

332
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,040
You've made progress.

333
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,720
Then how about

334
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,100
we visit the lab together later?

335
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,470
Emotional communication

336
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,970
is very difficult for Musk.

337
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,800
It needs to accurately determine the target's emotions

338
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,830
through multiple dimensions

339
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,910
and provide a more accurate response

340
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,380
in order to comfort people.

341
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,440
There was a period of time before

342
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,580
when I almost gave up.

343
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,520
But fortunately I met you.

344
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,680
Communicating with you

345
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,110
and being constantly influenced by you

346
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,690
made me try to understand what  other people saying,

347
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,400
feel their emotions,

348
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,970
learn how to express myself

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,990
better,

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,530
and understand how to communicate with others.

351
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,840
Thus, I was able to

352
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,830
complete Musk better.

353
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,360
Chengcheng.

354
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,240
We are going to dine together tonight,

355
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,680
do you think

356
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,230
we should invite Xiaomeng?

357
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,740
What's up?

358
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,210
Is it about Xie Xiaomeng?

359
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,900
Everyone has something they are afraid of

360
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,320
and don't want to face.

361
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,020
They have no choice

362
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,520
but to do it.

363
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,490
Li Meizi, help.

364
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
It's too heavy.

365
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,120
Li...

366
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,850
Let me help you.

367
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,910
Thanks.

368
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,920
I bought this for you.

369
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,590
Chengcheng, thank you.

370
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,320
It's fine.

371
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,110
Chengcheng.

372
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,310
Someone gave me this

373
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,380
before,

374
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,100
and I know you like to eat these,

375
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,960
so I've kept it.

376
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,590
I'm sorry for

377
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,310
what happened last time.

378
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,040
It's fine.

379
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,070
Chengcheng.

380
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,800
In fact,

381
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,580
my family's condition is quite poor.

382
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,020
I can't study abroad at all

383
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,990
and can only depend on the postgraduate recommendation.

384
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,240
In

385
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,470
the last exam,

386
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,730
you were one rank above me.

387
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,740
If I'm no longer in the top third of our class,

388
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,230
I may not have the chance to be recommended for graduate school.

389
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,730
I...

390
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,980
I panicked all of a sudden at that time.

391
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,560
I don't know what got into me.

392
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,030
Xie Xiaomeng,

393
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,510
I've always seen you

394
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,560
as my good friend.

395
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,570
Do you know how sad I am

396
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,660
that you did this to me?

397
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,960
I feel like you betrayed me.

398
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,470
I'm sorry, Chengcheng.

399
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,370
If you have difficulties in the future,

400
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,480
could you just tell me?

401
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,690
I bought you this

402
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,450
at the amusement park last time.

403
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,670
But I was mad at you

404
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,000
so I didn't want to give it to you.

405
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,340
Did you wait for a long time?

406
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,450
I was making the beds

407
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,320
with Xiaomeng

408
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
and didn't check my phone.

409
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,330
No, I just arrived.

410
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:25,730
Let's go.

411
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,820
Junior Lin Ying

412
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,390
is really  smart.

413
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,220
She found out Musk's problem

414
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,320
by simply calculating its conduction ratio.

415
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah.

416
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,280
She made a new one

417
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,310
in such a short period of time

418
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,280
and it solved the problems

419
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,490
with the conduction device once and for all.

420
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,370
Of course.

421
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,800
Our Ying is really amazing.

422
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,490
There are still a lot to be done.

423
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,600
Perhaps

424
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,400
I could try to find him.

425
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,560
You came.

426
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,480
He's inside.

427
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,470
Steal.

428
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,600
Speed up.

429
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,950
Rebound.

430
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,940
Block shot. Block shot.

431
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,960
Really?

432
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,070
Run away when you lost?

433
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,090
What do you want to say?

434
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,750
I entered

435
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,860
the Brain-Computer Interface Competition

436
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,660
and had built a robot

437
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,620
called Musk.

438
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,280
It's

439
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,330
a Companion Robot.

440
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,920
Do you want to work with me?

441
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,400
I've told you that

442
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,670
I would never touch robots again.

443
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,710
Whether

444
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,200
you entered the Brain-Computer Interface Competition

445
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,890
or

446
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,470
built an Emotional Companion Robot

447
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,080
has nothing to do with me.

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,700
I know you've been blaming yourself,

449
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,410
but do you really

450
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,540
not want to start over again?

451
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,000
Do you want to be like this forever?

452
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,810
Like a good-for-nothing.

453
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,170
Did you remember that

454
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
this was the place

455
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,520
we signed up for the robot competition for the first time?

456
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,040
[Lin You]

457
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:28,900
Lin You,

458
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,870
I don't expect you

459
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,310
to enter the competition with me,

460
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,310
I just don't want you

461
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,620
to keep living in the past.

462
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Everyone should

463
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,200
give themselves

464
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,400
a chance to start over.

465
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,070
So do I.

466
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,460
You suck

467
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,740
at this game.

468
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,360
Here, have this.

469
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,660
What goody is this?

470
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,260
A coriander-flavored lollipop.

471
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:21,890
It's a new product.

472
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,560
The helmet of today has a lot of functions.

473
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,050
You bet.

474
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,290
Unwrap it for me.

475
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,300
Let's go.

476
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,310
Here's your helmet.

477
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,620
Let's go.

478
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,500
Done.

479
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,340
Hold tight.

480
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,260
Let's go.

481
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,720
Come on, let's begin.

482
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:14,800
OK.

483
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,800
The Comfort Module will now begin testing.

484
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,600
For the best test results,

485
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
an extremely heartbroken student

486
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,240
in the lab

487
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,040
just volunteered

488
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,620
to test Musk's effort

489
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,530
himself.

490
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,940
Hello, Musk.

491
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,620
My name is Zhang Li.

492
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,360
Hello, Zhang Li.

493
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,760
Did you feel heartbroken

494
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,280
simply because Zhao Yiran wouldn't talk to you?

495
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
There are so many painful things

496
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,660
in the world,

497
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,160
yours

498
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,740
is just trivial.

499
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,780
It is important to me.

500
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,490
A lot of things

501
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,410
will fade away like passing clouds.

502
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,520
There's nothing utterly important.

503
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,790
There's no one

504
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,200
worth being with no matter what, either.

505
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,170
Nowadays

506
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,980
no one really needs anyone to survive.

507
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,290
But...

508
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:07,930
You...

509
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,030
I care about her. I...

510
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
It doesn't matter if you care about her,

511
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,699
maybe she doesn't care about you.

512
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,330
It's not going to work out between the two of you.

513
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,880
Who are you to say it won't work out between us?

514
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,760
What's wrong with the Comfort Module?

515
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,929
I have no idea.

516
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,090
But

517
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,130
a similar situation

518
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,960
happened several days ago.

519
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,659
There's nothing wrong with the data?

520
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,360
You're still working?

521
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,640
I knew it.

522
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,190
You must be here

523
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,050
if you didn't reply to my messages.

524
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:15,860
Don't worry.

525
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,740
I can type for another 10 years

526
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,560
before worrying about going bald.

527
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,780
Rest for a bit.

528
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,060
No.

529
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:39,690
Do you feel comfortable?

530
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,840
Am I considerate?

531
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes.

532
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,230
How's Musk's fix coming along?

533
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,990
There are still problems

534
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,850
with the training sample.

535
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,440
It used to train with me.

536
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,960
It lacks a good training companion

537
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,480
so it can't

538
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,640
comfort people effectively.

539
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,750
How about I train it?

540
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,830
Didn't you say that

541
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,480
I gave you a lot of inspiration

542
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,920
in communicating

543
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,230
with others?

544
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,120
Am I qualified?

545
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,220
I'm not questioning your competence,

546
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,640
but I'm afraid your health will be affected

547
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,250
by the tight schedule

548
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,340
and heavy mission.

549
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,140
I can handle it.

550
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,740
Hello, Musk.

551
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,490
Hello, Su Chengcheng.

552
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,250
Musk,

553
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,740
you have to study hard.

554
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,250
Why am I a little bit bashful?

555
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,410
Be gentle to me, will you?

556
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,180
Time flies.

557
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,500
It's almost the 20th.

558
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,800
Fortunately

559
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,830
we've finished training Musk

560
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,080
before the preliminary.

561
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,210
I'm ready.

562
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,280
Musk is ready.

563
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,520
Are you ready?

564
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,150
Chengcheng,

565
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,470
thank you for your effort.

566
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,190
