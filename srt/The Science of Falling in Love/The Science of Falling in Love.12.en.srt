[Episode 12]

4
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,310
Take the lab rat,

5
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,590
no,

6
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
the roast chicken.

7
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,750
Take the roast chicken and locate

8
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,030
the midpoint of the front line of the upper spine as the center line.

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,910
Five millimeters to the left of the center line,

10
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,270
we bluntly separate the subcutaneous tissue...

11
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,230
And paravertebral muscles.

12
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,990
And paravertebral muscles.

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,870
How about that?

14
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,550
A whole morning of experiments on lab rats

15
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,440
is not a waste of time, is it?

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,280
Yes, it is.

17
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,579
Can you say something I like to hear instead?

18
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,220
Say,

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,040
Gu Chen was doing great

20
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,980
in his previous lab,

21
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,870
why did he suddenly transfer

22
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,720
to your lab?

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,630
He said that he's more interested in

24
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,410
Du Zhuanjia's research fields.

25
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,470
It's but an excuse.

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,590
Gu Chen's GPA is 4.9.

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,600
He'll be accepted by any lab

28
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,700
if he applies, right?

29
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,310
Right.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Moreover,

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,110
if he's so interested in

32
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,990
Prof. Du's experiments,

33
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,990
why didn't he apply

34
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,860
at the beginning?

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,380
Am I right?

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,350
Yes.

37
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,890
Yes, you are.

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,300
What do you mean?

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,500
Say,

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,770
is there any possibility that Gu Chen is

41
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,630
into you?

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,630
He knew that you are not happy

43
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,350
working at Xiao Yuhe's place,

44
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,960
so he discreetly and deliberately

45
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,790
transferred here to lend you a hand.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,100
Be realistic.

47
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,270
When I bought allergy medications

48
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,910
and a jacket

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,670
for Xiao Yuhe,

50
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,910
it was Gu Chen who kept me company.

51
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,220
He knows that I have a crush on Xiao Yuhe.

52
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,810
Then that's even more telling.

53
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:09,920
Previously,

54
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,090
he knew that you have a crush on someone,

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
so he cannot do much

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,710
other than supporting you

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,600
silently from behind.

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,890
But now it's different.

59
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,790
The situation has changed.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Instead of supporting in silence,

61
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,550
he decides to step in.

62
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,410
In.

63
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,030
In.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,079
Li Meizi,

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,210
look at me.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm all hurt and broken.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,900
Any teeny-weeny

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,110
trivial stuff

69
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,550
can be my last straw.

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,620
Just let me be,

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,410
please.

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Hurry up and eat.

73
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,760
Then I'll head to the lab.

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,150
They are a... a...

75
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,060
a match made in heaven.

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,600
OK, we've done messing around.

77
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,390
Let's dig in.

78
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,950
Look.

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,810
The clubs are full of handsome boys.

80
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,460
They are recruiting new members recently.

81
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,540
We should drop by and have a look later.

82
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,870
Hurry and eat.

83
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,680
Hello,

84
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,630
can I interest you in the Ping Pong Club?

85
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,050
A hit on the ball, and you'll be the best of all.

86
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,500
Hello,

87
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,750
can I interest you in the Street Dance Club?

88
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,590
I... I'll take a look at the Ping Pong Club.

89
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,350
Then I'll take a look over there.

90
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,860
Later.

91
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,470
Chengcheng,

92
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,280
you are interested in calligraphy?

93
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,340
I... I'm just browsing around.

94
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,060
You are also trying to join a club?

95
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes, I'm still choosing.

96
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,270
Is there any possibility that Gu Chen's

97
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
into you?

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
He knew that you are not happy

99
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,950
working at Xiao Yuhe's place,

100
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,670
so he discreetly and deliberately

101
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,530
transferred here to lend you a hand.

102
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,710
Then I suppose you have already

103
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,490
finished the physics assignment that's due tomorrow.

104
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,630
Have you picked a topic?

105
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,400
Not yet.

106
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,230
It's due tomorrow.

107
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,550
How about this.

108
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,440
You hurry up and pick one today,

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,760
and I'll ask the professor tomorrow

110
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,550
to give our class one more day.

111
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,670
Thank you, monitor.

112
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,710
I'll go and find Meizi, then.

113
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,350
OK.

114
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,900
Are you alright?

115
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,350
Thank you.

116
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,300
Xixi.

117
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,420
Xixi.

118
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,640
Could you take a look at

119
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,550
my design and see

120
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,000
if there's something wrong with it?

121
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,950
Your design is

122
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,790
an experiment for long-term monitoring

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,190
of lab rats' brain neuronal activity.

124
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,900
Electrodes are implanted for up to one year.

125
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,200
Now, you are using a

126
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,360
Utah Electrode Array.

127
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,910
It will cause immune responses

128
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,860
when implanted for too long,

129
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,590
which will lead to failure.

130
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,910
In the end, the functioning time will only be a few months.

131
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
You should change it into

132
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,280
nano-mesh electrodes.

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,890
OK.

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,960
Thank you, Xixi.

135
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,050
Wait, Xixi,

136
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,550
do you have any time available in the next two days?

137
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,260
I want to treat you to dinner.

138
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,909
You have time for dinner,

139
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,020
but you don't have time for your thesis?

140
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,680
If you don't submit it tomorrow,

141
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,820
you'll be doomed.

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,850
I will. I will.

143
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,890
Thank you, Xixi.

144
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,790
Xixi,

145
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,740
why are today's chips all coriander flavored?

146
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,770
[Cilantro flavor]

147
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,170
Who bought these?

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,930
They were all purchased by Gu Chen.

149
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,550
By Gu Chen?

150
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,250
Xixi, Dongmao.

151
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,010
Both of you are here.

152
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,430
Gu Chen.

153
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,540
Do you also like

154
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,570
coriander flavored chips?

155
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,590
Didn't you

156
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,590
give me a bag of coriander flavored chips last time?

157
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,710
I found it tasty.

158
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,610
So I bought some more.

159
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,500
Right, Xixi.

160
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,710
How's your study

161
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,430
on how to use steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)

162
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,710
to locate retinopathy cells

163
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,670
coming along?

164
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,690
It's still processing.

165
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm going to study more about it

166
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,200
tonight.

167
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,210
This flavor tastes awful.

168
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,230
Fortunately,

169
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,020
I didn't pay for it myself.

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,820
What tastes so awful?

171
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,210
Coriander flavored chips.

172
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,060
Coriander flavored?

173
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,580
Why are you eating

174
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,970
Zhang Xixi's stuff?

175
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,470
It's not her purchase.

176
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,390
Gu Chen bought it.

177
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,940
There are plenty of these in the lounge.

178
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,690
I can fetch one for you.

179
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,470
No, I'm good.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,810
Here, try one.

181
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,310
No.

182
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,430
Who bought it?

183
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,180
Gu Chen.

184
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,250
This dog cafe

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,300
is trending on social media.

186
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,490
It's very difficult to book a table.

187
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,120
But of course,

188
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,380
all our consumption

189
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,720
will be paid for by Ms. Li.

190
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,340
Cheers.

191
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,730
I want a snap too.

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm gonna post it on Moments.

193
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,350
This is delicious.

194
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,490
Too sweet.

195
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,350
It's fine.

196
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:49,830
Good grief.

197
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,980
Did you check your Moments?

198
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,100
Who did Gu Chen

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
make the romantic gestures for?

200
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,070
It's not something he normally would do.

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,840
Take a look.

202
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,890
Let me see.

203
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,390
Here.

204
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,410
"Dragons should hide in clouds."

205
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,310
I know this one.

206
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,370
It's from The Scenery under Moon by Shen Congwen.

207
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,270
The next sentence is

208
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,590
"You should hide in my heart."

209
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,760
Gee.

210
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,710
Gu Chen has a crush on someone.

211
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
I should gossip about this.

212
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,850
How come I can't see this?

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,840
How come you can't...

214
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,130
Gimme. Lemme see. Hurry.

215
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,990
Why can't you see this post?

216
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,090
Can you all see it?

217
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,270
Yes, of course.

218
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,300
We all can see it.

219
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,160
Let me think.

220
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,700
No way.

221
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,570
You can't be the heroine

222
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,180
Gu Chen's talking about.

223
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,810
You are his crush.

224
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,280
He's too shy about it,

225
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,800
so he blocked you on this post.

226
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,310
It's impossible.

227
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,030
Maybe Gu Chen

228
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,450
blocks me entirely.

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,350
Lemme see.

230
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,600
See for yourself.

231
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,440
It's just this one post that's hidden from you.

232
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,430
Right?

233
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,990
What do you think?

234
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,900
Does Gu Chen like Su Chengcheng?

235
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,940
Good for you, Chengcheng.

236
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,460
I heard that Gu Chen

237
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
grew up in a wealthy family.

238
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,510
He bought his own house

239
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,660
when he was in high school.

240
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,170
I also think Gu Chen is a decent choice.

241
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,180
He's more suitable for you than Xiao Yuhe.

242
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,260
See?

243
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,050
Even Bro Ying, who's always silent in discussions,

244
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,800
spoke up.

245
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,150
What do you think?

246
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,790
But,

247
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,950
the person I have a crush on is not Gu Chen.

248
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,990
What did you say?

249
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,150
What did I say?

250
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,230
I mean we are just

251
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,950
good friends.

252
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,430
I'm pretty sure he only sees me as a friend.

253
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,480
Don't overthink this.

254
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,700
Let's give this post a like.

255
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't you enjoy

256
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,200
coriander flavored beverages?

257
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,650
What are you trying to say?

258
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,360
Since you are Su Chengcheng's friend,

259
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,320
you should stay in the friend zone.

260
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,010
Chengcheng,

261
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,330
did you finish retrieving the equipment?

262
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,470
When are you heading back to the dorm?

263
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,920
Moreover, did Gu Chen contact you?

264
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,330
I reckon he's going to

265
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,470
confess his feelings to you in two days.

266
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,940
You'd better prepare for that.

267
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,430
Chengcheng.

268
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,790
Let me help you.

269
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,750
This is too heavy.

270
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,890
Chengcheng, do you have a moment?

271
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,660
I have something to tell you.

272
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm busy at the moment. I need to

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
return the stuff to the laboratory.

274
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm all tied up.

275
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,220
Well, then, what about tonight?

276
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,950
The night's already taken, too.

277
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,410
OK, it's alright.

278
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,230
I'll tell you another day.

279
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,750
Then it would be better if you tell me tonight.

280
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,500
OK.

281
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,270
Let's meet at the garden at nine.

282
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,360
The garden?

283
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,790
Why are you here?

284
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,530
As soon as I saw you borrow the card from Zhang Li,

285
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,420
I knew something was off.

286
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,400
Now you even left the door unlocked.

287
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,000
You are so confident about not being caught, aren't you?

288
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,800
What's the matter?

289
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,980
Du asked me to talk some sense into you.

290
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,020
If that's the case, you can go back now.

291
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,660
I figured that you wouldn't listen.

292
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,480
If you did, then you wouldn't be Xiao Yuhe.

293
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,550
Don't beat around the bush, get to the point.

294
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,570
The development of Musk needs the knowledge of

295
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,230
algorithm,

296
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,700
psychology,

297
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,800
mechanics,

298
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,750
all those subjects.

299
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,720
Even if you are a prodigy,

300
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,470
don't you realize

301
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,850
it would be

302
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,770
too difficult to complete

303
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,000
without any help?

304
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,770
I already acknowledge all these problems

305
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,330
you mentioned,

306
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,600
and I can solve them.

307
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,250
I've already fed Musk

308
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,030
plenty of data.

309
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,590
It's in the

310
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,660
reinforcement learning stage.

311
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,500
There's no need to worry.

312
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,180
Everything's fine.

313
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,560
You know for yourself that

314
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,410
Musk needs a large amount of

315
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,150
data on human emotional representations

316
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,550
in order to accurately correspond to

317
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,430
the mapping relationship of

318
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,740
external appearances

319
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,510
and internal emotional characteristics.

320
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,230
Who's its current learning sample?

321
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,220
Who does it interact with every day?

322
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,490
It's only you, right?

323
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,910
You set Musk

324
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,900
as an

325
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,560
emotional companion robot.

326
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,610
But you yourself

327
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,100
are a person with avoidant attachment style.

328
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,590
Do you think you can train it well?

329
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,340
I know I am

330
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,430
a person with avoidant attachment style.

331
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,660
It's hard for me to be aware

332
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,680
of my true feelings,

333
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,310
and it's even harder to directly express

334
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,180
my feelings,

335
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,950
which results in contrasting

336
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,650
behaviors and thoughts.

337
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,430
If someone

338
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,340
makes me feel stressful,

339
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,120
I'll instinctively choose to avoid them.

340
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,200
This will indeed become

341
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,400
the greatest obstacle of Musk's training.

342
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,770
But I'll overcome it.

343
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,630
Xiao Yuhe,

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,700
you've changed.

345
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,270
Did Du tell you

346
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,280
about the lab?

347
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,830
What's the matter?

348
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,110
Our school hosts an assessment

349
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,310
every three years.

350
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,850
This year is when it takes place.

351
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,800
Our lab

352
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,350
has been doing basic research

353
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,210
these recent years,

354
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,510
and we haven't reached much of an achievement.

355
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,020
So if we cannot

356
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,020
pass the assessment this year,

357
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,470
our lab

358
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,270
might exist no more.

359
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,690
What do you mean our lab might exist no more?

360
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,530
It might get relegated,

361
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,319
then split and merged with other labs.

362
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,660
Du's been distressed lately,

363
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,599
but he doesn't want us to feel pressured,

364
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,220
so he said nothing about it.

365
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,990
I know Musk

366
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,460
means a lot to you.

367
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,120
I'm not Du,

368
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,790
I think it's perfectly fine

369
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,240
for you to do what you want to do.

370
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,200
But I also want you to know that

371
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,540
you are a member of our lab.

372
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,930
You must carry the responsibility

373
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,890
assigned to you.

374
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,950
I understand.

375
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,230
You can head back now.

376
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,870
Thank you.

377
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,990
I'll lock the door for you.

381
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,290
How about it?

382
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,190
Am I right?

383
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,310
Gu Chen and Xiao Yuhe

384
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,060
both like you.

385
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,830
What do you think?

386
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,030
I don't know.

387
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,390
Do you like Gu Chen?

388
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,940
No.

389
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,100
How about Xiao Yuhe?

390
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,730
You still like him?

391
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,860
At the beginning,

392
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,380
I just thought he's handsome.

393
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,950
Hotheadedly,

394
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,960
I confessed my feelings to him.

395
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,750
After the love experiment

396
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,870
I felt exasperated.

397
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,730
I made up my mind

398
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,440
never to make a fool of myself again,

399
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,860
and never to have anything to do

400
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
with this person again.

401
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,670
But then a lot of things happened,

402
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,660
and I got to know

403
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,570
a different aspect of him.

404
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,740
Then I

405
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,350
truly fell in love with him.

406
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,340
He even treated me very well,

407
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,230
which made me feel that

408
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,560
maybe he,

409
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,900
more or less,

410
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,790
also has a little bit of

411
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,720
a crush on me.

412
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,690
It turned out that it's my own wishful thinking again.

413
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,430
I was wrong again.

414
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,820
He always makes me think

415
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,850
that I'm a fool.

416
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,910
He always makes me think

417
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,260
that I'm not a person who's worth

418
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,030
being loved.

419
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,810
I hate to feel this way.

420
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,230
You're wrong.

421
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,820
Why do you always think for him?

422
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,730
You cannot deny yourself

423
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,040
just because of someone else.

424
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,590
Right?

425
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,990
No matter what Xiao Yuhe thinks,

426
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,690
we all like you,

427
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,410
and you are not a fool at all.

428
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,220
There, there.

429
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,660
Well,

430
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,570
what about Gu Chen?

431
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,370
You're gonna make it clear to him?

432
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,190
I'll make it clear to him.

433
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,070
OK.

434
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,370
Chengcheng.

435
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,470
Gu Chen.

436
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,610
I bought you bubble tea.

437
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,630
It's your favorite flavor.

438
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,060
Thank you.

439
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,440
Why don't you look at the screen?

440
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,230
What's worth looking at?

441
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,890
The drone. Where's the drone?

442
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,850
Take a look, are these two

443
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,510
Su Chengcheng and Gu Chen?

444
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,420
I finally understand.

445
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,970
I said a lot last time

446
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
and nothing registered with you.

447
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,380
Xiao Yuhe.

448
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,570
It's not that I'm against you

449
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,290
participating in the competition,

450
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,310
I'm not a...

451
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,440
ruthless person either.

452
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,430
I also grew up...

453
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,240
from your age.

454
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,750
I understand the passion

455
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,730
young people at your age possess

456
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,680
when they want to do something.

457
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,960
But it really

458
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,820
is not the right time.

459
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,750
What happened to you

460
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,620
years ago

461
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,350
was just barely suppressed,

462
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,960
and you want to do it again.

463
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,780
Aren't you deliberately

464
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,320
putting yourself in danger?

465
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,870
Right?

466
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,920
Moreover,

467
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,110
our laboratory is

468
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,390
under great pressure as well.

469
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,470
A lot of pairs of eyes

470
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,320
are on us.

471
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,820
Our research paper

472
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,780
was rejected, again.

473
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,320
If it continues this way,

474
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,830
our laboratory's funding

475
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,060
will be withdrawn entirely.

476
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,880
Your phone just won't stop, right?

477
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,600
It's been buzzing the entire time.

478
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,490
Take a look at it.

479
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,490
See.

480
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,470
Are these two Chengcheng

481
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,090
and Gu Chen?

482
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
They are at the garden,

483
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,830
talking and laughing all by themselves.

484
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,470
Are you sure you are not going to take a look?

485
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,240
You can leave. Just go.

486
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,250
Please take good care of

487
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,920
your own business.

488
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,030
I see that

489
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,470
our laboratory

490
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,420
really can't count on you.

491
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,950
Prof. Du,

492
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,910
please do not worry,

493
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,150
I'll put my heart

494
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,130
in this project.

495
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,960
But I have my own insistence.

496
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,990
I asked you to come here today

497
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,710
is mainly because of

498
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,400
one thing I wanted to tell you.

499
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,170
-I like Senior Xixi...
-I have a crush on someone else.

500
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,820
What did you say?

501
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,670
You like Senior Xixi?

502
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,110
You know about how Senior Xixi is.

503
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,880
She's not a person who likes

504
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,830
to socialize,

505
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,270
so it's even harder to chase after her.

506
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,100
I've never told her,

507
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,490
but

508
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,290
you are in the same group

509
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,160
as her,

510
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,350
so, I want to...

511
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,710
I got it.

512
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,380
I got it.

513
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,910
Thanks.

514
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,060
Are you heading back to the dorm?

515
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,490
I'm going to the library,

516
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,390
I can give you a lift.

517
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,900
I'm good.

518
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,960
I'll wait here for...

519
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:34,910
I mean,

520
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,120
I have an appointment with someone.

521
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,110
I have something else to do later.

522
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,580
Well,

523
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
I'll wait here a bit,

524
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,130
you go ahead.

525
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,100
OK, then bye.

526
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,570
Gu Chen,

527
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,590
why did you

528
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,510
block me on Moments?

529
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,150
Why did I block you?

530
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,160
I didn't.

531
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,150
You did.

532
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,620
Tell me which post?

533
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,500
The one with a quotation from Shen Congwen.

534
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,090
Here's the thing.

535
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,420
When I posted something on my Moments,

536
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,690
my relatives always

537
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,930
asked questions and it's annoying,

538
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,130
so I moved them

539
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,220
into a group and blocked them.

540
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,200
M-My aunt's also named Su Chengcheng,

541
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,010
and I might have made a mistake.

542
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,270
Take a look. Take a look.

543
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:18,870
It's true, see?

544
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,960
My aunt really is named Su Chengcheng.

545
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,180
My aunt's name is Su Chengcheng.

546
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
Fine, you win.

547
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,080
Hurry up and unblock me.

548
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,950
I know. I know.

549
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,390
OK.

550
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,250
I'm removing you from the group right now.

551
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,120
-Later, aunt.
-Off you go.

552
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,150
-Go. Bye.
-I'm leaving.

553
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,800
Bye. Bye.

554
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,390
See you.

555
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,390
I almost made a fool of myself again.

556
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,200
That's a close call.

557
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,870
Look.

558
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,930
What a tragedy.

559
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,180
Can you stop following me?

560
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,040
I'll send you back.

561
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,240
You're here to watch me make a fool of myself, right?

562
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,580
Then you can watch it all you want.

563
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,310
Are you happy?

564
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,840
Dry yourself with this.

565
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,350
Your hair's all wet.

566
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,830
Who asked you to pity me?

567
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,170
Who asked you to mind my business?

568
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,870
Who asked you to be

569
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,730
a hypocrite?

570
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,860
Who asked you to transfer me

571
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,680
to Senior Xixi's group?

572
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,580
Who asked you to let me stay in the lab?

573
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,080
Why are you being so unreasonable

574
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,130
and annoying?

575
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,020
I'm not wearing your clothes.

576
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,160
It's...

577
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,980
the one I bought for him.

578
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,140
So he didn't throw it away.

579
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,780
Put this on

580
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,160
and hurry back.

581
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,450
Don't catch a cold.

582
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,130
Drink something warm.

583
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,610
It's none of your business.

584
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,940
Drink it.

585
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
What are you gonna do this time?

586
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,150
Drink my sorrows away.

587
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,620
Cheers, my friend.

588
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,560
Cheers, my friend.

589
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,390
Bring up your glasses.

590
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,100
Friends.

591
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,950
Youth is brief.

592
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,710
Let's have another bottle again.

593
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,410
Su Chengcheng.

594
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,520
The gate is over there.

595
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,940
We should head back now.

596
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,270
Where did I go?

597
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm at home.

598
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm at home and I'm gonna sleep.

599
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,450
You're drunk.

600
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,710
Let me take you back.

601
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,710
Nope.

602
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,670
If you don't head back now,

603
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,750
the dorm's gonna close.

604
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,470
Xiao Yuhe,

605
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,300
do you know how much

606
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,510
I've devoted to you?

607
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,080
Because of you,

608
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,990
I spent the money

609
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,550
I had saved up for an electric bicycle.

610
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,250
Do you know how hard it is

611
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,080
for me to save up that amount of money?

612
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
I saved for over six months.

613
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,190
Do you know how many

614
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,650
surveys I completed,

615
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,340
and how many times I became the practice partner with someone

616
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,880
to save up that small amount of money?

617
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,460
Don't cry.

618
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,140
Don't cry.

619
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,890
Really, I worked so hard.

620
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,040
I worked hard to buy you a piece of clothing,

621
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,830
and you threw it away.

622
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,720
What are you laughing about?

623
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,960
Am I ridiculous?

624
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,940
No.

625
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,930
OK, you're drunk.

626
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

627
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,220
Don't say tomorrow to me.

628
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,360
I don't want to hear it.

629
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,900
Tomorrow I need to

630
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,380
ride my bicycle.

631
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,550
The chain of my bicycle

632
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,570
always falls off.

633
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,340
I have to place it back in place everyday.

634
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,290
My hands are permeated with the smell of engine oil.

635
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,710
Really. They still stink

636
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,010
with engine oil.

637
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,270
Have a sniff.

638
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,670
Really.

639
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,290
Don't cry.

640
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,680
My hands smell like engine oil.

641
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,889
OK, OK. Let's walk normally.

642
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,440
Watch your step.

643
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm not gonna fall over.

644
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,280
I'm good at walking.

645
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,820
Watch me.

646
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,000
Am I good at walking?

647
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,560
Yes, not only walking,

648
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,460
you are good at everything,

649
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,030
OK?

650
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,170
What am I good at?

651
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,730
Why so sudden?

652
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,110
What am I good at?

653
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,719
Let me think.

654
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,469
You

655
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,690
have good skills in execution and action.

656
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,760
I've learned how to catch lab rats.

657
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,700
That's not what I mean.

658
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,730
You are happy every day.

659
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,370
You are always in a good mood, right?

660
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,820
What else? Crying all day?

661
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,060
How about this?

662
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,260
Well,

663
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,750
Jianming likes you,

664
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,360
which means you are a good person.

665
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,120
What's the point of Jianming liking me?

666
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,740
You don't like me.

667
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,860
Who says I don't like you?

668
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,110
Let's go.

669
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,780
We're here.

670
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,950
You should hurry up and get upstairs.

671
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,500
It's almost time for the curfew.

672
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,630
What for?

673
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,520
Why do I have to do

674
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,200
whatever you said?

675
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,570
Why do I have to listen to you?

676
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,200
You are drunk. Get upstairs already.

677
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,710
Lemme tell you something, Xiao Yuhe.

678
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,710
Don't you think you can do whatever you like to me

679
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,330
just because I have a crush on you.

680
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:06,950
Listen,

681
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,170
I was over you a long time ago,

682
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,620
to tell you the truth.

683
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,400
To me,

684
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,800
you are like this.

685
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,260
The air.

686
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,310
Do you understand, the air?

687
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,610
Like a bottle of air.

688
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,980
That's enough.

689
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,210
Are your roommates upstairs?

690
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,760
How about asking them to pick you up?

691
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,250
You don't believe me, do you?

692
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,990
I'll prove it to you!

693
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,910
See?

694
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,380
Even if I'm this close to you,

695
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm...

696
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,030
Am I blushing?

697
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,900
There are many reasons to cause a blushing face.

698
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,140
Blushing...

699
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,910
Blushing...

700
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,430
The causes of blushing

701
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,390
are plenty.

702
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,900
A person with high blood pressure

703
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,980
will have an enlarged heart

704
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,220
and increased myocardial contraction rate,

705
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,770
causing...

706
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,190
Blood vessels in the head to expand and become congested.

707
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,450
Yes.

708
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,160
Yes.

709
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,240
Blood vessel dilation in the brain

710
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,370
can also cause blushing.

711
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,830
In addition,

712
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,190
menopausal women

713
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,430
also blush

714
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,570
because of the decrease in estrogen.

715
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,350
So it cannot prove that I have a crush on you.

716
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,580
Let me try again.

717
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:54,730
See?

718
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,790
Even if I hug you like this,

719
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,240
I also...

720
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,710
My heart is racing.

721
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,940
There are various causes

722
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,810
of the acceleration of heart rate.

723
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,960
Intense exercise,

724
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,220
excessive mental stress,

725
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,420
and hyperthyroidism

726
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,360
can all result in heart racing.

727
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,550
So it's not because

728
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,320
I have a crush on you.

729
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,240
Don't overthink it.

730
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,270
You don't believe me?

731
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,180
No,

732
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,780
I can't do this.

733
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,560
♫The wind passing by is listening♫

734
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,580
♫The weather in summer is always changing♫

735
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,870
