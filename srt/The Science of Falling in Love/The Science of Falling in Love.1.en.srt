12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,080
Near-infrared brain function image results

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,640
show that,

14

when you said you liked me,

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,750

didn't change

19

How can you prove that

26
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,070

27

my heart beats faster.

32
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,250
There are many reasons for the rapid heartbeat.

Pressure,

34
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,890

36
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,580
and stimulating beverage

37
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,780
can all accelerate heartbeat.

38
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,710
I blush when I see you.

39
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,510
I dream of you

40
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,910
at night.

41
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,830
Blushed face may indicate

42
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,500
cervical spondylosis.

43
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,340
Cervical displacement stimulates sympathetic nerve,

44
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,720
causing facial angiotelectasis.

45
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,510
As for dreams,

46
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,840
there are even more reasons.

47
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,400

177
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,190
I overslept again.

178
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,230
Su Chengcheng,

179
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,110
your name will be called soon.

180
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,070
Have you come yet?

181
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,380
The lecturer is famous for letting students fail the exams.

182
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,230
Coming late for once,

183
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,320
you'll lose all your class performance grades.

184
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,610
Oh, no.

185
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,900
The chain is off again.

186
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,050
What should I do?

187
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,050
I'm going downhill.

188
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,440
The teaching building is 300 meters away.

189
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,740
At the current speed,

190
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,520
I can probably freewheel down there.

191
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,310
Hey,

192
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,460
your chain fell on the ground.

193
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,110
If I go pick the chain

194
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,140
[About 2 min away from classroom]

195
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,670
and then go to the class,

196
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,590
I'll definitely be late.

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,980
[Option A: Don't pick up the chain.]

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,980
[Option B: Pick up the chain.]

199
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,900
If I don't,

200
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,340
my chain will be lost.

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,630
[It takes 1 min to pick up the chain.]

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,630
[I'll be late for 30s.]

203
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
What should I do?

204
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,090
He's so cute.

205
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,560
I'll teach you

206
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,030
analog electronics technique

207
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,270
this semester.

208
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,570
I'm surnamed Du.

209
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,520
Du Zhuanjia.

210
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,970
Don't take it wrong.

211
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,700
My name is Du Zhuanjia.

212
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,780
Biomedical engineering is a

213
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,150
comprehensive discipline.

214
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,420
If you learn it well,

215
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,190
you'll be a pillar

216
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,980
of this era,

217
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,360
and even our country.

218
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,630
If you don't,

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,840
you'll be

220
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,120
miserable.

221
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,830
I don't want any of you

222
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,970
to take any chance

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,310
on my class.

224
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,790
Look over there.

225
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,500
Those are your seniors

226
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,780
of the fourth and fifth grades,

227
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,120
who have to take

228
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,950
this class again.

229
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,150
I don't care about the passing grade

230
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,150
set by the university.

231
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:42,840
The grade

232
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,820
I set for you is 80.

233
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,810
You'll pass if you score over 80.

234
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,320
If you don't pass,

235
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,600
I don't care which grade you're in

236
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,930
or what reasons you have,

237
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,410
you must come back

238
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,560
and sit there

239
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,800
to take the class again.

240
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,980
What held Su Chengcheng up?

241
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,770
Before the class begins,

242
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,430
let's call the roll.

243
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,910
Why hasn't she come?

244
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,430
Gu Chen.

245
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:08,940
Yes.

246
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,430
Xie Xiaomeng.

247
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,990
Yes.

248
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,190
Su Chengcheng.

249
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,970
Su Chengcheng.

250
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,690
Yes.

251
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
How many students are called Su Chengcheng?

252
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,460
Excuse me, sir,

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,480
only me.

254
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,490
I got a sore throat

255
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,880
just now

256
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,630
and coughed.

257
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,760
So I answered twice.

258
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,880
Today

259
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,080
is the first lesson of your class.

260
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,050
I won't blame you.

261
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,590
From now on, in my class,

262
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,550
if anyone skips any lesson,

263
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,730
or answers for others in the roll-call,

264
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,400
their attendance grades will be cleared.

265
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,010
Take a seat.

266
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,530
Thank you, sir.

267
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,260
What's wrong with your hands?

268
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,450
Bike chain lube.

269
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,810
Bike chain lube?

270
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,720
The trace of love.

271
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,350
Yes.

272
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,180
Wang Dazhi.

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,020
Yes.

274
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,860
Thanks.

275
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,760
Lin Ying.

276
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,510
Yes.

277
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,470
Chengcheng.

278
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,170
It might be fate that made us meet.

279
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,070
Chengcheng.

280
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,720
Su Chengcheng.

281
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,460
What does that boy look like?

282
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,640
Is he handsome?

283
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,630
He wore a helmet.

284
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,130
I didn't see him clearly.

285
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,190
But,

286
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,850
I feel

287
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,060
he's quite cute.

288
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,090
Others' chance encounter is always romantic.

289
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,950
Why is yours

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,170
so weird?

291
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,610
That's special.

292
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,430
Special?

293
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,150
Bike chain lube

294
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,710
is so special

295
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,510
and so romantic.

296
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,790
The labs for creative credit

297
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,750
are open to selection soon.

298
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,480
Let's go.

299
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,550
The early bird gets the worm.

300
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,150
Go to the computer room.

301
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,630
The net connection is fast there.

302
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:39,950
Go.

303
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,170
Have you got your campus cards?

304
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,590
Yes.

305
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,400
I haven't.

306
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,310
I'm going to the dorm to get it.

307
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,870
I'll meet you there.

308
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,070
OK.

309
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,630
You go and get in line.

310
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,420
Go.

311
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,510
Here. Here.

312
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:11,950
Chengcheng.

313
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,720
Hurry up.

314
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,520
Excuse me.

315
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,160
My friends are at the front.

316
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,500
Would you let me pass? Thanks.

317
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,510
Excuse me,

318
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,320
my friends are at the front.

319
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,950
Thanks.

320
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,680
Hurry.

321
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,670
We can go in now.

322
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,140
Chengcheng.

323
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,790
Don't wait for me.

324
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,590
You go in there.

325
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,130
Don't step on me. Don't.

326
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,940
Bike chain boy?

327
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,900
If the first time was a coincidence,

328
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,740
it must be

329
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,730
the arrangement of fate this time.

330
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,530
Chengcheng,

331
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,140
here, here.

332
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,130
How's your network?

333
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,440
[Welcome to the on-campus course selection system]

334
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,440
[Southeast Science and Technology University]

335
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,060
Where is he?

336
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,130
Yes!

337
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,990
I got it! I got it!

338
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,390
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

339
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,090
How about you?

340
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,300
Refresh again.

341
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,490
Chengcheng, did you get it?

342
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,270
I can never get a hot meal,

343
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,370
or find a guy that I like,

344
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,710
or select a lab that wants me.

345
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,620
Do I have to miss

346
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,660
everything in my life?

347
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,770
Don't worry,

348
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,390
Chengcheng.

349
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,450
You still have

350
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,770
a second chance.

351
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,720
Later,

352
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,830
you can check with the counselor.

353
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,930
The second chance

354
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,520
is based on

355
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,290
the rank of GPA.

356
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,850
If I can't select a lab,

357

I can't even get enough credits.

358
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,050
Chengcheng,

359
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,760
before I selected the lab,

360
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,820
I had done my research.

361
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,430
In the past,

362
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,990
those who couldn't select a lab

363
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,270
all took their courses successfully.

Don't worry.

366
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,960
Listen to Bro Ying.

367
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,280
Bro Ying is right.

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Moreover,

369
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,500
you should see it from another perspective.

370
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,390
Think about it.

371
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,940
If you didn't go to the computer room,

372
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,970
you wouldn't have met

373

I know his name.

398

I thought

407
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,350
he was about

408
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,720
the same grade as us,

409
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,910
not expecting

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,570
that he's doing a PhD.

411
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,410
Of course, Chengcheng.

412
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,150
He's Xiao Yuhe,

413
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,760
the top of straight-A students.

414
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,930
He skipped several grades.

415
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,720
I heard that

416
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,250
he was a postgraduate student

417
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,840
in MIT.

418
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,070
In only three years,

419
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,910
he had got five articles published by IEEE,

420
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,290
as the leading author.

421
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,710
And his tutor

422
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,080
tried to persuade him to study there,

423
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,040
promising to give him

424
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,880
a teaching job when he graduated.

425
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,570
But for some unknown reason,

426
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,040
he refused and came back

427
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,660
directly after his graduation.

428
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,310

he's famous.

How could you not know him?

it doesn't matter whether he's a straight-A student,

433
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,930
but it's important that

434
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,670
he's handsome.

435
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,710

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,760
was the beginning of my nightmare.

527
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,780
I told you its limbs couldn't coordinate.

528
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,150
I was thinking about how to adjust

529
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,440
the natural frequency of its body

530
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,060
and the suspension stiffness coefficient.

531
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,050
I was absentminded,

532
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,160
or you wouldn't have a chance.

533
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,150
You're funny.

534
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,640
No excuse.

535
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,450
Hello,

536
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,240
I'm Su Chengcheng.

537
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,420
I'm new here

538
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,280
to gain

539
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,470
my creative credit.

540
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,560
Hello.

541
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,590
What grade are you in?

542
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,460
I'm a sophomore.

543
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,190
Sophomore?

544
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,540
An undergraduate?

545
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,970
Have you got a GPA of 4.9?

546
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,270
Not yet.

547
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,850
Then you must have come to the wrong lab.

548
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,120
I didn't.

549
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,460
Xiao Yuhe asked me to come here.

550
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,510
Yuhe?

551
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,230
You don't have a high GPA,

552
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,110
and you're an undergraduate.

553
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,240
Why did he recruit you?

554
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,750
He did ask me to come.

555
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,410
He gave me this key card.

556
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,630
What's your

557
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,930
relationship with him?

558
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,380
I have nothing to do with him.

559
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,830
Because I said I liked him,

560
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,550
so he asked me to fill in

561
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,270
an application form

562
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,010
and let me join the lab.

563
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,090
Yuhe has never done this before.

564
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,000
Is it because...

565
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,580
Is it?

566
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,070
Chengcheng,

567
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,540
you're one of us now.

568
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:24,960
Sure.

569
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,830
How about

570
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,520
we give you a tour

571
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,300
around the lab?

572
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,940
I'm going too.

573
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,750
I'm going too.

574
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,790
This is Zhang Li,

575
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,710
from the Control Department.

576
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,550
The robot dog is his.

577
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,350
Get back to your work.

578
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,070
Let's go.

579
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,060
Have you printed all the logos?

580
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,960
Go print them.

581
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,910
Chengcheng, going forward from here

582
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,230
is Prof. Du's office.

583
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,830
Yes.

584
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
I'm Liu Dongmao,

585
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,850
from the Computer Department.

586
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,570
This fat guy

587
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,440
is Zhu Jiafa

588
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,610
from the Control Department.

589
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,890
We're responsible for

590
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,370
the mechanical parts of the brain-computer interface.

591
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,350
By the way, in our lab,

592
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,190
there's a senior who is

593
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,550
very good at brain surgery.

594
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,770
She's responsible for

595
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,110
the invasive brain-computer interface,

596
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,990
which is to implant a chip in the brain

597
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,220
to control an external device.

598
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,920
As for Yuhe...

599
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,430
I don't need to say much.

600
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,830
You must know him well enough.

601
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,480
He didn't tell me anything.

602
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,210
Sounds fair.

603
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,310
Yuhe doesn't like

604
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,730
to talk about himself.

605
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,990
But with more time,

606
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,830
you'll gradually

607
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,760
know him.

608
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,620
No...

609
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,020
Chengcheng, this way.

610
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,270
Go.

611
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,430
The Brain and Intelligence Lab

612
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,760
is a national key lab

613
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,990
of multidisciplinary

614
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,340
brain-computer integration.

615
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,790
Our three main

616
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,950
research fields are

617
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,540
invasive bain-computer interface,

618
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,510
non-intrusive bain-computer interface,

619
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,310
and AI brain-like computing.

620
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,700
Top-level lab.

621
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,130
Avatar in real life.

622
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,150
Yes.

623
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,350
Avatar used the

624
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,450
brain-computer interface tech.

625
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,190
It's cutting-edge

626
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,270
technology,

627
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,150
which can integrate

628
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,430
humans and computers

629
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,610
by reading EEG signals.

630
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,670
For example, it helps people control

631
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,570
robots and mechanical arms through mind.

632
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,830
Meanwhile, it's helpful in solving

633
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,070
many medical problems

634
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,070
like enabling paralyzed patients

635
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,460
to regain action competence.

636
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,090
This is the brainwave control.

637
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,540
Here, have a try.

638
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,750
The more concentrated you are,

639
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,790
the faster the car runs.

640
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,830
Cool!

641
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,110
Did you

642
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,270
do this with Jiafa?

643
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,050
Well,

644
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,180
absolutely.

645
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,110
But we did the

646
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,180
mechanical part mostly.

647
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,560
Yuhe did

648
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,120
the algorithm.

649
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,770
He did?

650
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,990
Yes, he's basically

651
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,740
responsible for algorithms

652
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,000
concerning all our research projects.

653
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,710
Aren't you recruited by him?

654
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,940
Work hard and learn from him.

655
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,810
So,

656
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,880
will he come to the lab today?

657
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,230
Sure. He comes every day.

658
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,620
Yeah.

659
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,720
Here he comes.

660
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,180
Speak of the devil.

661
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,890
Here the devil comes.

662
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,350
It's OK.

663
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,230
Thanks, Dongmao.

664
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,800
Go ahead.

665
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,880
Yuhe is dull usually.

666
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,380
Who would think he has such a junior?

667
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,350
I'm going to make her a coffee.

668
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,070
Go ahead.

669
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,020
Yuhe,

670
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,210
I came to report for duty.

671
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,390
They gave me

672
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,570
a tour around the lab.

673
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,820
I saw it.

674
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,990
You had a good time.

675
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,550
Anything else?

676
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,060
I want to know

677
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,860
why did you let me join the lab?

678
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,540
And,

679
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,480
what do you think of

680
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,930
the thing I told you yesterday?

681
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,990
During work, I only answer

682
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,150
work-related questions.

683
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,020
As for unrelated things,

684
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,600
we can talk after 8:00 PM.

685
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,800
8:00 PM, right?

686
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,090
OK. I'll wait for you.

687
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
What do you think?

688
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,520
Think what?

689
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,800
Chengcheng.

690
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,150
It's rare for you

691
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,630
to bring a girlfriend to the lab.

692
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,270
Rest assured.

693
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,460
I've arranged for you

694
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,070
clearly and properly.

695
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,330
No problem.

696
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,910
Have you solved the problem

697
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,570
of noise reduction clarity

698
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,950
and improved the accuracy of the singular value

699
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,510
based on wavelet analysis?

700
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,710
Are you really so free?

701
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,630
It only needs an undergraduate

702
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,560
to distract you from work.

703
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,410
Is there no problem?

704
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,320
Shouldn't you arrange some work

705
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,440
for the newcomer?

706
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,970
Why are you staring at me?

707
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,490
Do I look like wavelet analysis?

708
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,860
Here. Have a try.

709
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,070
This coffee is only served

710
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,830
to those who officially

711
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,150
join the Brain

712
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,950
and Intelligence Lab.

713
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,370
No food and drink in the lab.

714
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,390
The cleaning lady

715
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,990
asked for a day off today.

716
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,430
Newcomer, you clean

717
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,950
the lab later.

718
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,470
Jiafa,

719
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,610
tell her about the dos and don'ts.

720
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,130
Tell her what?

721
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:40,970
What?

722
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,480
Xiao Yuhe recruited her...

723
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,400
Come here quickly.

724
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,870
Wait.

725
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,270
Tell her what?

726
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,150
It seems that Yuhe recruited her

727
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,750
not because he

728
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,720
felt that way about her.

729
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,140
What way?

730
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,070
That way.

731
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,690
Let me tell you, really...

732
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,140
So...

733
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,160
Yuhe, you're here.

734
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,720
So,

735
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,880
what's your answer?

736
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,760
Does it matter?

737
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,010
It does.

738
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,860
When the form is printed out,

739
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:39,930
fill in your information.

740
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,440
And then?

741
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,220
Conduct brain data acquisition experiment.

742
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,850
What's a brain data acquisition experiment?

743
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,170
To extract brain data

744
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,140
with professional devices.

745
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,550
Didn't you say you liked me?

746
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,270
You have to prove it in a scientific way.

747
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,330
I know clearly that I like you.

748
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,210
I don't need an experiment.

749
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,900
The word "like" is too abstract

750
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,630
and unreal.

751
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,040
Only scientific data

752
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,140
won't lie.

753
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,070
I didn't lie to you. It's for real.

754
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,770
Feelings are deceptive.

755
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,850
Maybe you're cheated by yourself,

756
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,750
only that you don't know.

757
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,760
Fill it in.

758
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,290
So many?

759
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,980
How about this,

760
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,880
I ask and you answer me.

761
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,430
-Name.
-Su Chengcheng.

762
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,270
-Native place.
-Jinjiang.

763
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,470
Name of your elementary school.

764
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,320
Jinjiang Experimental Primary School.

765
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,380
Favorite snack in childhood.

766
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,230
Popsicle. Long

767
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,750
and could be broken.

768
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,470
Favorite color.

769
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,320
Chromatic colors.

770
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:44,840
Be specific.

771
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,280
Blue, red, yellow...

772
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,020
You're passionate.

773
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,730
Let's say tolerant.

774
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,790
Do you like to make friends?

775
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,460
Yes.

776
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,330
Do you think it's difficult to make friends?

777
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,030
Not at all.

778
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,570
What's your definition of friends?

779
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,170
Be frank with each other and do anything for each other.

780
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,040
How long does friendship last?

781
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,690
A lifetime.

782
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,640
What about love?

783
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,760
Also a lifetime.

784
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,790
It turns out that love and friendship

785
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,820
are the same in your eyes.

786
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,460
You set me in a trap.

787
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,630
Stop it.

788
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,830
The more honest you are,

789
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,190
the more accurate the data is.

790
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,850
Is that clear?

791
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,260
Let me proceed.

792
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,550
Do you like your childhood?

793
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,490
Why?

794
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,840
I can date when I grow up.

795
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,360
Didn't you have many friends?

796
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,870
Do you still remember

797
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,940
your best friends' names in childhood?

798
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,160
Your best friends.

799
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,590
Well, is there something wrong

800
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,520
with your question?

801
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,670
What do my best friends' names

802
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,830
have to do with

803
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,710
whether I like you or not?

804
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,190
It's used to assess whether

805
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,370
you are committed to a relationship.

806
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,740
Go ahead.

807
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,560
What are their names?

808
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,320
Wang Lunye.

809
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,440
Yuhang.

810
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:18,710
Beibei.

811
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,260
Mengmeng.

812
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,410
And many others.

813
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Is that all?

814
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,750
You don't know them, anyway.

815
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,370
That's all.

816
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,580
Su Chengcheng.

817
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,350
Did you really forget me?
