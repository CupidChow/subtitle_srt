5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,280
This is for Ying.

6
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,890
See if you like it.

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,930
Remember to use it.

8
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,240
Whose 2 hairbands are these?

9
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,190
They are mine.

10
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,310
Xiao Yuhe bought them for you, right?

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,720
You are showing off how lovey-dovey you are,

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,090
aren't you?

13
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,360
You are deliberately showing me this, aren't you?

14
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,160
This is for Xiaomeng.

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,790
Where is she?

16
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,260
It's good that you are all here.

17
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,990
I just met Xiaomeng outside.

18
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,930
She's not in a good mood

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,740
and she's been crying.

20
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,800
How about you go check on her?

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,630
Let's go.

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,500
She doesn't pick up.

23
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,250
Let's split up and search for her.

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,660
OK.

25
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,500
Let's split up.

26
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,990
OK.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,320
My dad played cards, lost money,

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,110
and cheated on you.

29
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,530
Hui didn't want to study again.

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,240
How could you call me for everything

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,630
and ask me to take responsibility for everything?

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,950
I'm still a student,

33
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,470
so how am I  able to help you out?

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,670
You can divorce him

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,930
if you can't stand living like this.

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,600
Excuse me,

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,930
have you seen Xiaomeng?

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,450
She's up there.

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,410
Got it, thank you.

40
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,329
Let me tell you,

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,579
there's only one way for me now,

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,020
and that's to be a recommended postgraduate.

43
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,400
For ranking,

44
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,829
I even went so far as

45
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,510
to report my roommate for cheating.

46
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,980
What more do you want from me?

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,960
You knew I didn't cheat.

48
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,280
Sorry.

49
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,390
So be it.

50
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,149
I'm at this section.

51
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,630
How come it's not?

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,870
Are you still working on it?

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,910
Isn't that good enough?

54
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,269
I'm done.

55
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,350
Remember to review the key points

56
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,320
of Chapter 5.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
We'll get straight into

58
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,880
doing experiments next week.

59
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,980
Read Chapter 6 in advance.

60
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,920
That's all for today.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,740
S-Senior Xixi.

62
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,420
I've got 2

63
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,670
concert tickets for the weekend,

64
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,240
would you like to go with me?

65
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,250
Thanks,

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,920
but I already have a date this weekend.

67
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,210
Yes, she already has a date.

68
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,170
Are they really together?

69
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,710
Yes.

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,180
Chengcheng.

71
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,860
I bought you breakfast

72
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,990
and put it on your table.

73
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,050
I'll have them in a moment.

74
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,460
Why is Musk's movement

75
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,180
so rigid?

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,920
I suspect if there's something wrong

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,710
with the program.

78
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,340
I have no idea.

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,840
I'll do a regression analysis

80
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,210
on all test data tonight

81
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,870
and check.

82
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,159
Could it be

83
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,990
the motion controller?

84
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,120
I don't think so.

85
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,200
I checked it just now and it's fine.

86
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,390
I think the servo drive

87
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,950
might be broken.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,510
How about we try

89
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,610
an external position controller?

90
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,700
Prof. Du.

91
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,150
Prof. Du.

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,870
Xiao Yuhe.

93
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,510
Our university

94
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,710
is going to send people to Jinjiang for undergraduate enrollment.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,800
You have to go.

96
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,980
Come to my office

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,190
for details.

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,070
I'll tell you more about it.

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,340
OK, I'll go in a minute.

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,270
The situation

101
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,190
is like this.

102
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,730
Alright,

103
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,840
for all that has left,

104
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,230
take back this document

105
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,330
and read it carefully.

106
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,440
This weekend.

107
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,560
We're leaving this weekend.

108
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,830
OK.

109
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,050
Jinjiang No. 1 High School.

110
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,230
What's the matter?

111
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,530
Prof. Du,

112
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,480
I would like to ask you for permission to do something.

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,520
May I bring Su Chengcheng with me

114
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,909
for this undergraduate enrollment?

115
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,310
She's a local

116
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,510
and she also graduated from Jinjiang No. 1 High School.

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,270
Lots of students

118
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,510
are her juniors.

119
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,409
If we bring her with us,

120
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,810
we can save a lot of effort.

121
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,730
Well...

122
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,659
for all the schemes

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,740
that you young people make,

124
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,250
to be honest,

125
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,260
I didn't quite get them in the past.

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,970
But right now,

127
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,310
I completely get what you meant.

128
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,630
Then your decision will be?

129
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,550
Why do you even ask?

130
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,660
I have approved it.

131
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,110
OK.

132
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,090
How come you be like this...

133
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,290
Then I have to go.

134
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,750
Thank you, Prof. Du.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,020
Hurry up and prepare for it.

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,700
Sure.

137
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,540
A couple.

138
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,770
I ship them.

139
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,630
Prof. Du has agreed to let you

140
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,740
come with me for the undergraduate enrollment.

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,450
We can go home together.

142
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,690
Chengcheng, you...

143
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,590
This chair is fine.

144
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,150
Not broken.

145
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,580
Chengcheng, well...

146
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,340
You are coming for

147
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,390
this undergraduate enrollment too, right?

148
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,870
And

149
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
I'm counting the number of people staying at the hotel.

150
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,470
See if you want to go home

151
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,350
or stay with us.

152
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,520
I...

153
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,590
Can I call my parents first

154
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,190
and ask them

155
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,310
before telling you?

156
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,630
OK.

157
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,700
Tell me when you get the answer.

158
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,170
OK.

159
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,230
Ying,

160
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,430
what brings you to our lab?

161
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,790
I came here

162
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,390
to take care of my lab transfer.

163
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,320
You are going to join our lab?

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,300
Great!

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,860
I want to expand my research direction.

166
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,750
I've also talked to Prof. Du,

167
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,690
who said he was willing to accept me.

168
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,600
So

169
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,700
all that's left is this application form.

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,900
Great.

171
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,600
Meizi is also on this floor.

172
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,050
We can come here together in the future.

173
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,870
How about

174
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,030
we throw a party at the dorm

175
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,830
tonight?

176
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,350
Fine by me.

177
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,780
Maybe another day.

Chengcheng.

179
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,700
What Xiaomeng did

180
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
really crossed the line.

181
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,650
But

182
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,400
probably she has her own difficulties.

183
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,550
After all, not everyone

184
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,490
can stand in the sun

185
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,500
without casting a shadow.

186
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,230
But Chengcheng,

187
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,030
you have to believe that

188
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,290
since we've been together for such a long time,

189
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,350
Xiaomeng definitely

190
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,650
sees you as a real friend.

191
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,600
Hello, Dongmao.

192
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,720
Sure,

193
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,370
when you are at the door of your own home,

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,430
why stay in a hotel?

195
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,860
Won't you make a fool of yourself that way?

196
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,130
When will you come?

197
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,010
I'll change

198
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,830
the bed sheet and duvet cover for you.

199
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,890
Sure. Chengcheng.

200

There's something wrong with Musk,

OK, Chengcheng,

Chengcheng,

273

when we were about to go out,

274
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,290
your little brother bumped into something,

275
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,390
so I took him to the hospital to bandage the wound

276
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,050
and couldn't go there to get you.

277
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,480
How about you take a taxi

278
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,530
or

279
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,640
ask your mom to pick you up?

280
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,370
OK.

353

♫To let my feelings find a home♫

364
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,620
Chengcheng.

365
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,030
Don't cry.

366
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,550
Let's get going.

367
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,430
Let's go.

368
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,560
We are here.

369
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,860
It's still working.

370
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,880
You're still keeping this house?

371
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,690
I haven't been back for a long time.

372
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,490
Make yourself at home,

373
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,420
and I'll tidy things up.

374
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,490
Xiao Yuhe,

375
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,620
why did you

376
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,090
show up all of a sudden tonight?

377
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,710
Where are you?

378
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,470
Have you arrived yet?

379
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,880
You still can't reach Chengcheng?

380
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,350
At this time,

381
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,270
you may still catch

382
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,480
the last high-speed train.

383
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,230
How about I look after Musk for you?

384
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,620
OK.

385
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,540
Go.

386
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,190
Thank you.

387
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,100
Are you happy?

388
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,750
I'll help you tidy up.

389
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,790
It's fine.

390
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,680
Let me help you.

391
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,630
It's fine.

392
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,500
Let me help you.

393
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,010
Let me help you.

394
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,350
OK.

395
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,510
Is this you as a kid?

396
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,100
How cute.

397
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,380
And this.

398
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,530
When did you take this one?

399
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,690
This...

400
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,140
this should be

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,470
when I was 6.

402
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,350
You were cuter

403
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,530
when you were little.

404
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,270
Is this your mom and dad?

405
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,750
Your mom was so elegant

406
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,440
when she was younger.

407
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,060
This one was taken

408
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,500
on Mid-Autumn Festival.

409
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,550
My mom and dad

410
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,450
hadn't started fighting at that time.

411
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,950
What about these leaves

412
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,690
in this notebook?

413
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,090
Did you pick them up together?

414
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,900
There's a long story

415
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,680
behind this notebook.

416
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,550
What is it?

417
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,330
My dad studied

418
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,300
city construction back then.

419
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,050
The botanical garden

420
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,560
is the place that he likes the most.

421
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,090
When I was little,

422
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,780
he took my mom

423
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,590
and me

424
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,930
to the botanical garden

425
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,450
every Mid-Autumn Festival.

426
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,440
As we passed by some flowers and grasses,

427
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,640
he would tell me

428
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,890
the origin of the grasses

429
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,680
and the type of the flowers.

430
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,510
If we came across

431
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,940
some fallen flowers and grasses,

432
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,090
we would take them back

433
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,920
and make them into specimens.

434
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,470
When I was little,

435
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,780
my mom didn't like to go outside,

436
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,630
the botanical garden was the only place

437
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,110
she would be willing to go.

438
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,850
When I was little, my mom and dad used to dote on me too.

439
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,750
Then one day,

440
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,680
they parted ways

441
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,500
without telling the reason,

442
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,630
and I suddenly became a person

443
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,320
without a home.

444
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,910
I really really hate

445
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,430
holidays.

446
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,680
I don't like ordinary holidays,

447
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,040
and I hate winter and summer vacations even more.

448
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,480
Because I don't know where to go.

449
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,750
Wherever I go, it seems like

450
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,790
it's someone else's home,

451
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,860
and I'm like a piece of luggage

452
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,500
that can be suddenly thrown away

453
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,570
at any minute.

454
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,410
I didn't like holidays, either.

455
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,770
But I like them now.

456
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,150
You've done taking your shower?

457
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,380
Then we'll...

458
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,780
we'll...

459
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,200
I mean...

460
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,930
the... bed is ready.

461
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,360
Yes.

462
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,020
I-I'll sleep out there.

463
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,050
Then turn in early.

464
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,090
Well... good night.

465
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,620
I'll go out.

466
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,199
Good night.

467
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,409
Good night.

468
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,429
Good.

469
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,340
I'm just out there.

470
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,179
If you feel afraid, just call me.

471
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,199
Good night.

472
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,700
Based on my years of experience in undergraduate enrollment,

473
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,130
the most important thing to do

474
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,550
at this stage

475
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,190
is to build an emotional foundation.

476
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,770
First, we need to find out

477
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,530
what these students'

478
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,170
majors of interest

479
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,350
really are,

480
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,880
and once you get that information,

481
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,720
share it with the rest of us right away.

482
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,850
People with the same major

483
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,580
should talk to them immediately.

484
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:59,550
[Navigation - Southeast University of Science and Technology Admission Preparation Meeting]

485
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,230
You should tell them

486
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,330
how you really feel about

487
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,640
studying

488
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,160
and living at our university

489
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,480
from the perspective of a senior.

490
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,140
Things like whether the courses are hard,

491
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,160
what the extracurricular activities are,

492
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,710
and how is the condition of the dormitory.

493
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,050
All in all,

494
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,770
the most important thing

495
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,720
is to build mutual trust.

496
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,510
I have a document of information

497
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,860
that I would like you to pass around.

498
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,490
You must read it carefully.

499
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,520
Listen to me

500
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,510
as you read.

501
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,430
Our main goal this time

502
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,990
is the 2 groups of students with outstanding performance in the competition

503
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,820
from No. 1 High School and Foreign Language High School.

504
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,710
In particular, we should focus on

505
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,850
Zhang Yichi, Wang Bingrui,

506
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,870
and Hu Zeyu

507
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,690
from Foreign Language High School,

508
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,750
because these 3 students

509
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,560
had outstanding performance

510
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,340
in the competition this time.

511
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,530
Therefore,

512
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,910
we have to

513
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,860
do our work well.

514
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,720
We'll strive for them to

515
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,880
trust us,

516
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,190
prefer us,

517
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,360
and choose us.

518
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,770
We can't fall behind

519
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,560
in this year's undergraduate enrollment.

520
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,710
Do we have the confidence?

521
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,910
Yes.

522
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,900
[Southeast University of Science and Technology Undergraduate Enrollment Seminar]

523
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,430
Our university

524
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,360
has a long history

525
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,750
and a rich cultural background.

526
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,460
Also,

527
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,690
we have read your information.

528
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,760
You've participated in

529
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,200
many program designing competitions,

530
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,840
and your ranks are always good.

531
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,240
As you may have known,

532
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,220
the Faculty of Engineering at Southeast University of Science and Technology

533
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,170
is outstanding.

534
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,390
If you study at our university,

535
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,780
you'll have a lot of space for development.

536
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,060
Senior,

537
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,980
excuse me,

538
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,840
I need to leave for a minute.

539
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,130
Hello, your application to Mingjiang University is always welcome.

540
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,290
Mingjiang University

541
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,560
specializes in the basic sciences.

542
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,400
You should know that

543
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,350
the main purpose of undergraduate study

544
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,580
is to build a foundation.

545
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,550
Our university

546
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,700
has a large variety of activities.

547
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,720
Look at how boring

548
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,860
the university across the way is.

549
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,500
And you also know

550
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,580
what their gender ratio is.

551
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:03,960
Zhang Li.

552
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,830
Chengcheng.

553
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,330
Prof. Du.

554
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,910
Prof. Du.

555
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,370
Everyone, thank you for your effort.

556
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,710
Go on.

557
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,660
Don't get affected by me.

558
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,010
You are doing great.

559
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,640
The communication you had just now

560
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,250
is very good.

561
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,160
Several of our target students

562
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,510
also expressed a strong desire

563
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,950
to apply for our university.

564
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:21,900
That's good.

565
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,570
However.

566
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,060
However,

567
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,220
don't ever let your guard down

568
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,710
for the following Foreign Language High School.

569
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,170
Of course we won't.

570
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,850
Prof. Du,

571
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,500
Chengcheng was awesome just now.

572
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,420
She just showed these juniors

573
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,380
some pictures of our experimental complex

574
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,750
and equipment

575
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,570
and successfully won their hearts.

576
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,430
You flattered me.

577
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,840
I just went for what they desire the most.

578
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,490
Besides,

579
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,620
our newly built experimental complex

580
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,240
is so good

581
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,790
that I have to

582
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,730
show it off.

583
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,120
The most important thing is that

584
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,510
I told them

585
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,300
there was air conditioning in the dorm.

586
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,430
You used it as a temptation.

587
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,550
I thought the communication time

588
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,520
arranged by Foreign Language High School

589
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,390
was 11:00.

590
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,730
Why haven't they arrived yet?

591
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,430
Yeah, Prof. Du.

592
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,000
Also,

593
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,250
there are much less people on the side of Mingjiang University.

594
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,740
