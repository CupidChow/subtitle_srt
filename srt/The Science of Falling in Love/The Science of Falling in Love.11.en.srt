[Episode 11]

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,990
Come on, Su Chengcheng.

5
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,910
Let out all your anger

6
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,979
from the past few days!

7
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,570
Are you playing coquettish?

8
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,260
Harder!

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,280
One more time!

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
One, two!

11
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,130
Again!

12
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,180
Again!

13
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,340
I...

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,300
One more time!

15
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,690
One, two!

16
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,410
Hit it!

17
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,950
One more time!

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,230
Use your leg!

19
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,220
Good job!

20
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,980
You feel good?

21
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,010
Yes.

22
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,310
I feel like I can do it again.

23
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,680
Okay.

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,380
Do you want to stay?

25
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,380
Stay?

26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,810
Stay

27
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,520
and follow Xiao Yuhe

28
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,180
or

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,090
come to my group.

30
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,940
Follow you?

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,360
You don't want to?

32
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,230
It’s okay.

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,070
Anyway, the NSF program

34
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,590
have extra credits,

35
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,490
which are helpful for getting postgraduate recommendation and going abroad.

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,690
And

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,350
there are also creative credits.

38
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,630
I think there are other students

39
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,640
who want to join us.

40
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,700
I don't force you.

41
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,130
I...

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,030
I want to come.

43
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,270
Thank you, Senior Xixi.

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,160
No need to thank me.

45
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,300
See you in the lab.

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,750
When can I

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,270
be as handsome as Senior Xixi?

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,330
It's done.

49
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,030
Don't forget what you promised me.

50
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,500
Okay.

51
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,240
Chengcheng, what are you doing?

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,020
Packing up my things

53
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,130
to go back to the lab.

54
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,300
Didn't you fail to change the lab?

55
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,070
She didn't change it.

56
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,830
She's still in the same lab.

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,690
What about Xiao Yuhe?

58
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,909
Didn't you and he already

59
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,760
have a standoff?

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,110
Even if I go back,

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,230
I won't be in his group.

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,370
I'll go to Senior Xixi's group.

63
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,310
Now,

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
I’ve gotten over it.

65
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,830
Xiao Yuhe

66
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,590
such a small trouble

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,360
is not even

68
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,470
in my consideration.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,080
When I see him now,

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,700
I just

71
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,980
ignore him.

72
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,230
That's good.

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,560
I heard that

74
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,690
Senior Xixi's research

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,310
is mainly about

76
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,410
EEG analysis and recognition of mouse behavior.

77
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,370
If you

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,310
study with her,

79
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,340
you'll definitely improve a lot.

80
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,810
I looked it up.

81
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,750
There are a lot of English in this area.

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,390
Aren't you preparing for IELTS?

83
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,570
You must have a very large vocabulary.

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,090
If I don’t know anything,

85
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,860
I will ask you.

86
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,730
Anyway, in the future,

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,630
I no longer have to

88
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,590
follow Xiao Yuhe

89
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,310
to collect data and run data.

90
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,540
Mice, I'm coming.

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,990
Sitting here again?

92
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,460
Isn't this the jacket

93
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,610
that Chengcheng bought for you?

94
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,260
It’s new, why did you dry clean it?

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,610
Because someone I don't like

96
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,370
tried it on.

97
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,680
Xiao,

98
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,770
as your senior,

99
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,130
I have to enlighten you.

100
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,420
You are

101
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,760
usually good at everything,

102
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,040
but you are too boring.

103
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,110
I think that

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,290
you are a typical

105
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,220
lack of security.

106
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,930
I've read a paper before

107
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,860
which is about the people who are quite similar to you.

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,910
It’s said that

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,500
there is a type of people

110
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,680
who want to be loved,

111
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,470
but when others

112
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,670
respond to you,

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,780
you reject them.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,450
When others reject you,

115
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,890
you don’t want to be abandoned.

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,760
You are

117
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,590
contradicting yourself.

118
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,170
Take the case

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,400
between you and Su Chengcheng before.

120
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,460
You are the one

121
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,740
who helped her clean the data.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,740
But

123
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,210
you didn't even tell her.

124
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:46,680
To help her change the lab,

125
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,180
you did a lot of work,

126
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,960
but you still didn’t tell her,

127
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,820
which blew it all up.

128
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,909
Well,

129
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,480
you can't always act like

130
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm helping you,

131
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,050
but I won't tell you.

132
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,550
Just for fun.

133
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,750
How... how can you

134
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,540
let others understand you?

135
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,570
Right?

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,660
Right?

137
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,180
Express yourself truthfully

138
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,160
to Chengcheng.

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,170
It's not that hard.

140
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,160
Good morning, everyone.

141
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,950
Good morning, Chengcheng.

142
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,190
You're back.

143
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,570
Yes.

144
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,760
Senior Jiafa,

145
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,250
I bought you some milk tea.

146
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,110
As soon as Chengcheng comes back,

147
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,190
my treatment

148
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,020
comes back.

149
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,170
Senior Dongmao,

150
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,280
my gift for you

151
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,030
is a wired headset.

152
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,030
Thank you.

153
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:41,990
Nothing.

154
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,940
This is good.

155
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,100
Senior Zhang Li,

156
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,560
this packet of pumpkin seeds is for you.

157
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,580
It's a local specialty,

158
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,540
which is hard to buy.

159
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,980
And it has thin skin and thick flesh.

160
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,390
It's delicious. Try it.

161
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,750
Okay, thank you, Chengcheng.

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,840
Nothing.

163
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,140
Senior,

164
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,900
this hand cream

165
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,870
is bread scented. It smells good.

166
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,470
After applying it,

167
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,700
you'll look lovely.

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,880
I think it suits you.

169
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,470
How can a hand cream

170
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,610
smell like bread?

171
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,770
Rum cheese flavor.

172
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,900
It smells good.

173
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,320
Right?

174
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,220
Thank you.

175
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,710
You're welcome.

176
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,650
Senior Xixi,

177
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,660
this hand brewed coffee,

178
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,080
I bought it for you.

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,920
I don't need it.

180
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,110
After being a butterfly,

181
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,930
come to the lab later.

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,540
Are you comfortable?

183
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,560
Catch it.

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Senior,

185
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,370
after I catch it,

186
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,180
then what should I do?

187
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,990
First anesthetize it,

188
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,390
then position it in three dimensions

189
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,840
and disinfect its head.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,390
Cut a small opening

191
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,820
and use a dental drill to make a hole.

192
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,350
Scared?

193
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,890
It doesn’t matter.

194
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,860
I had a graduate student

195
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,310
who also didn't dare to do it.

196
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,070
Then Pro. Du sent him

197
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,630
to medical school

198
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,440
to kill mice for two years. Then...

199
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,460
Well,

200
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,890
let me send you there too?

201
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,100
To learn about behavioral therapy.

202
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,230
No, no, no.

203
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,390
I... I can do it.

204
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,180
Hello,

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,530
what ingredients do you want?

206
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,300
Pearls, taro balls...

207
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,050
All of them.

208
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,360
Are you sure?

209
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,640
All ingredients?

210
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,620
Yes.

211
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,330
Okay.

212
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,750
Hello,

213
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,530
your ingredients are a little too much

214
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,830
for our cups.

215
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,960
I use an extra-large cup.

216
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,900
Take it.

217
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,690
Thank you.

218
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,660
Chengcheng.

219
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,430
Gu Chen, why are you here?

220
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,630
Last time I did the experiment,

221
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,760
and found it really interesting,

222
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,810
so I applied to the school

223
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,460
to transfer over.

224
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
Senior Xixi is not here?

225
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,860
She just went out for something.

226
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,050
Did you apply

227
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,230
and transfer here directly?

228
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,770
What's your GPA?

229
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,330
4.9.

230
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,500
Sure enough,

231
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,830
opportunities are always reserved

232
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,890
for those who have a good GPA.

233
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,250
Chengcheng,

234
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,580
are you going to

235
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,680
implant electrodes in mice?

236
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,910
You need to prepare the skin first,

237
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,460
and then fix it with a brain stereotaxic.

238
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,420
Well,

239
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,540
let me show you how to do it.

240
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,080
Come on, you do it.

241
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,270
Gu Chen, you are really my savior.

242
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,310
After removing the hair here,

243
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,730
make an incision

244
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
along this sagittal suture,

245
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,930
and then peel the fascia and muscle

246
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,860
from the skull.

247
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,590
I don't see any hydrogen peroxide here.

248
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,570
Go and get one.

249
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,080
Okay.

250
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,120
Hello, Senior Xiao.

251
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,890
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,910
I applied to be transferred

253
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,740
to our lab.

254
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,190
I've already told Du Zhuanjia.

255
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
He said I'll follow you in the future.

256
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,610
If you need anything,

257
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,410
just tell me.

258
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,170
Gu Chen,

259
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,070
in fact, you can can learn more things

260
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,110
in Senior Xixi's group.

261
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,230
Why don't you tell the teacher

262
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,940
to transfer to our group?

263
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,410
Gu Chen,

264
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,790
please

265
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,430
go and change the padding for the mice first.

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,870
Okay.

267
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,790
Wait.

268
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,600
Gu Chen hasn't decided

269
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,510
to go to your group yet,

270
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,850
why are you asking him to do that?

271
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,830
Besides,

272
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,740
the mice are the business of our group,

273
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,580
it's not your business.

274
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,010
I don't think

275
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,020
he needs to change the padding.

276
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,750
He has already said that

277
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,810
he is under my charge.

278
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,780
So

279
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,870
he has to do

280
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,610
whatever I tell him to do.

281
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,230
Please go and change the padding.

282
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,510
Okay.

283
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,070
It's okay, Chengcheng.

284
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,860
I'll go change it.

285
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,780
Inexplicable.

286
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,650
I need to collect

287
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,640
EEG data from the olfactory layer

288
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,810
of mice during sleep.

289
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,930
Cooperate with me.

290
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,830
Sorry,

291
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,030
I'm not very good at it.

292
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,250
Aren't you a whiz?

293
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,220
You can do it yourself.

294
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,270
Fine.

295
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,590
Someone else is good at it.

296
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,230
I'll tell Zhang Xixi later that

297
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,200
you don't cooperate with me,

298
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,430
and let her cooperate with me herself.

299
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,340
I go with you.

300
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,370
I can't send it off.

301
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,510
Senior Xiao,

302
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,050
I've changed it.

303
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,320
Prof. Wang has a data,

304
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,930
go to get it.

305
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,740
I just ran into Senior Dongmao

306
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,620
on the way.

307
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,550
He also told me about it.

308
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,590
So I got it back

309
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,330
on the way to change the padding.

310
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,660
Our lab

311
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,990
has opened a new experiment

312
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,590
related to neural pathway damage

313
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,210
in spinal cord injury.

314
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,840
Gather some information

315
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,070
and write a literature review.

316
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,510
When I first transferred to the lab,

317
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,830
I talked with Prof. Du about this topic,

318
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,880
and he also told me about it.

319
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,210
So,

320
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,780
I made some preparations in advance.

321
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,260
Look, Senior Xiao,

322
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,350
if there's not enough,

323
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,990
I'll find more.

324
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,830
Gu Chen, are you done?

325
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,800
Whose milk tea?

326
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,230
Who knows?

327
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,180
Yuhe,

328
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,930
didn't you

329
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,820
just bring it here yourself?

330
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Someone

331
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,110
said before that

332
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,310
the daily caffeine intake

333
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,110
of a healthy adult

334
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,540
should not exceed 200 milligrams.

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,590
But the caffeine content

336
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,550
of milk tea

337
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,670
is 300 milligrams.

338
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,150
In order to get a good sleep,

339
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,420
he never drinks milk tea.

340
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,360
This is the one I often drink.

341
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,330
I have to

342
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,110
experiment late today,

343
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,050
so I bought a cup on the way.

344
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,420
Such a big cup.

345
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,540
Stay up all night?

346
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,410
Why don't you drink it?

347
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,810
I ate too much this morning,

348
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,890
I couldn't drink it.

349
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,470
I'll see if you drink it later.

350
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,390
When I drink it is none of your business.

351
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,510
Who cares when you drink?

352
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,270
I will drink it

353
00:16:59,270 --> 00:16:59,830
whenever I want.

354
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,800
I don’t care.

355
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,040
I want to drink now, I drink now.

356
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,720
Drink it.

357
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,800
Fine.

358
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,420
Delicious.

359
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,230
Annoying!

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,100
Gu Chen, have you eaten?

361
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,880
No.

362
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,810
Let's go eat.

363
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,320
Okay.

364
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,790
Our counselor

365
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,330
is very strict with us.

366
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,620
What's wrong?

367
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,830
I feel like someone is following me.

368
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,630
I don't think so.

369
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,630
You're looking at it wrong.

370
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,700
Yuhe,

371
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,760
where are we going to eat?

372
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,740
We're almost done.

373
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,270
I want to eat something spicy.

374
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,220
Let's find a heavy one.

375
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,630
Spicy. We just

376
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,950
passed a skewer store.

377
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,500
Isn't it...

378
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,350
Isn't it quite good?

379
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,420
Yes.

380
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,890
Hey, hey!

381
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,180
Maybe it's a mistake.

382
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,380
Let's go.

383
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,590
Nothing.

384
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,530
I thought someone was calling.

385
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,350
What's wrong with you?

386
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,330
Nothing. Nothing.

387
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,910
We're lost.

388
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,790
Just find one to eat.

389
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,740
Come on, let's eat there.

390
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,230
Let's go.

391
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,040
What do you want to eat?

392
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,110
I heard that

393
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,670
their fig and quinoa salad is very popular.

394
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,110
[Light Salad]

395
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,270
We can order one to try.

396
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,730
Okay.

397
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,270
Here's your order.

398
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,430
Please wait for a moment.

399
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,390
Hello,

400
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,870
I'd like

401
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,790
one quinoa fig salad.

402
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,070
And one...

403
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,840
Wait a moment, let me take a look.

404
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,070
Hello, Senior.

405
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,500
You order.

406
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,470
Thank you.

407
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,550
Thank you.

408
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,620
Why are you cutting in line?

409
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,970
I’d like one classic salad.

410
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,910
Childish.

411
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,650
Wait a minute.

412
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,280
Thank you.

413
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,230
Senior Xiao,

414
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,610
sit here.

415
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,150
No need.

416
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,750
It’s okay.

417
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,690
Sit here.

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,580
Senior Jiafa, sit here.

419
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,650
It’s okay. Thank you.

420
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:39,910
Have a seat.

421
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,470
Thank you.

422
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,470
Do you have to

423
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,520
share a table with us?

424
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,870
This is a public area.

425
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,740
It’s so late.

426
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,130
Why isn't the food served yet?

427
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,290
Hello. Here's your salad.

428
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,240
Thank you.

429
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,130
Yuhe,

430
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,090
don't you want to eat something spicy,

431
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,240
and heavy?

432
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,670
You ordered me a plate of green vegetables,

433
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,040
even without a piece of meat?

434
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,790
You have high blood fat, high blood pressure

435
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,480
and high uric acid recently.

436
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,220
Don’t eat meat.

437
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:13,730
I...

438
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,270
What a party!

439
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,310
Meizi, you come today...

440
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,330
Sit here.

441
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,970
I’ll pack it up to see the counselor.

442
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,710
Okay.

443
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,470
Sit here.

444
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,360
Bye bye.

445
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,380
Chengcheng,

446
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,580
you come here often, right?

447
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,550
Yuhe and I chose for a long...

448
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,270
Xiao Yuhe,

449
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,530
you were going to the cafeteria, right?

450
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,470
Don't you want to eat meat

451
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,440
and spicy food?

452
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,190
-This is a public area.
- Take it.

453
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,270
By the way, Chengcheng,

454
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,350
you’re following

455
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,300
to do the mouse experiment now.

456
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,050
Senior Xixi posted a paper

457
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
on the repair

458
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,000
of spinal cord injury in mice.

459
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,830
I think it is particularly useful.

460
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,750
You can read it.

461
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,590
Which one?

462
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,780
I even collected it today.

463
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,950
This one.

464
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,100
Gu Chen,

465
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,840
there is some equipment in the lab

466
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,450
that needs to be reimbursed.

467
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,780
Take the invoices

468
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,230
to find Dongmao.

469
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,170
Okay.

470
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,190
Chengcheng,

471
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,830
I’m leaving now.

472
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,110
I'll send you the paper on WeChat.

473
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,700
Okay.

474
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,270
He's been

475
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,140
picking on me all day,

476
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,990
Don't know what he's thinking now.

477
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,510
Su Chengcheng,

478
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,070
the data you gave me

479
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,860
is too noisy.

480
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,810
The signal-to-noise ratio is lower than 85 db.

481
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,750
The electrodes must not

482
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,860
have been implanted in the right place.

483
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,160
Redo this data.

484
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,760
This data can't be wrong.

485
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,430
I’ve checked it many times.

486
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,150
You may not have checked it correctly.

487
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,780
I don't care about you.

488
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,570
I've already switched to another group,

489
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
but you're still tormenting me.

490
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,710
You asked me

491
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,830
to do EEG experiments on mice,

492
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,350
and then you said

493
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,630
the data from EEG experiments are not good,

494
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,330
and asked me to do it again.

495
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,580
I can’t do it.

496
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,030
If you can, do it yourself!

497
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,090
Senior Chengcheng,

498
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,470
Yuhe asked you to do mice experiments?

499
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,170
Actually Yuhe...

500
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,120
In fact,

501
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,230
I should not tell you this.

502
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,440
But you are new here.

503
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,760
Yuhe is afraid of mice.

504
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,960
Really?

505
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,520
He has high self-esteem,

506
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,900
so we don't usually talk about it.

507
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,270
He works in the lab.

508
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,550
How can he be afraid of mice?

509
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,730
There are all kinds of fishes...

510
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,270
Well,

511
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,300
all ordinary people

512
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,970
have some shortcomings.

513
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,200
Don't tell him that I told you that.

514
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,720
Be afraid of mice.

515
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,170
Speechless.

516
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,070
Senior,

517
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,880
I just thought about it.

518
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,100
My attitude is not right.

519
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,940
So I’m here to apologize to you.

520
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,120
So

521
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,110
can you

522
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,350
show me how to do it?

523
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,090
I promise

524
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,390
I won't make the same mistake

525
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,310
next time.

526
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,340
Your apology...

527
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,670
No need.

528
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,210
You just do it.

529
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,960
I'll check the quality of the data later.

530
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,840
No, Senior,

531
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,100
show it to me,

532
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,450
then I can learn with you.

533
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,030
No need.

534
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,510
Senior,

535
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,790
I'm really

536
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,980
afraid of making mistakes

537
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,270
in my experiments.

538
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,290
Please show me once.

539
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,070
Why are you hiding?

540
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,030
Senior, why is your face white?

541
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,980
Are you afraid of mice?

542
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,600
How could I be afraid?

543
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,160
I’ll just do it once.

544
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,610
Take it.

545
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,700
Let me open it for you.

546
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,600
No need.

547
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,440
Oh my God!

548
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,810
Senior Xiao Yuhe

549
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,100
has let the mice go.

550
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,040
Why are you so loud?

551
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,360
I heard that

552
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,590
Yuhe let the mouse go.

553
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,390
Yes.

554
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,150
I saw that.

555
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,430
Really?

556
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,590
If Prof. Du knows that,

557
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
he must be furious.

558
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,930
Yes.

559
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,960
He'll be furious.

560
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,470
So many potato chips and drinks

561
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,700
flavored with cilantro.

562
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,650
Did Senior Xi buy them?

563
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,530
I don't think so.

564
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,030
I saw that Gu Chen

565
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,180
brought a box of them when he came up today.

566
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,970
Chengcheng,

567
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,070
someone is here for you.

568
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,050
Why didn't you answer the phone?

569
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:13,730
Where's your phone?

570
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,790
I have a big gossip

571
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,440
to tell you.

572
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,290
Hurry up! Let’s go.

573
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Chengcheng’s friend,

574
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,680
there are no outsiders here.

575
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,470
If it's convenient,

576
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,940
let's gossip together.

577
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,950
It seems a bit...

578
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,430
It's not appropriate.

579
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,040
Sit down.

580
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,780
I'll sit down then.

581
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,610
This matter

582
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,840
has to start with you.

583
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,510
Do you remember that

584
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,110
the teacher who let you change the lab last time

585
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,760
named Jiang Songrui?

586
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,730
I now know that

587
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,520
he is a superb person

588
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,140
who loves to exploit students.

589
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,470
Do you know

590
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,120
the time clock for their lab?

591
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,570
Do you know?

592
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,280
007.

593
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,730
Yes, 007.

594
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,620
And he also loves to

595
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,860
squeeze the student's allowance.

596
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,270
Do you know how much money

597
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,480
he pays for his doctors every month?

598
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,270
Do you know?

599
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,870
200 yuan.

600
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,730
Yes, 200 yuan.

601
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,640
So many doctors

602
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,260
can't stand it anymore.

603
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,430
They are in the sixth year of their doctorate.

604
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,590
Their pressure is too much,

605
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,510
so their hair falls out by the handful.

606
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,610
Sorry, Senior,

607
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,440
I didn't mean you.

608
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,600
It doesn’t matter.

609
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,670
So they're all posting together

610
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,730
on the Internet now.

611
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,640
Really?

612
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,470
I met Prof. Jiang before,

613
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,100
and he seemed kind,

614
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,730
could he be such a person?

615
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,810
You still don't believe me?

616
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,170
See for yourself.

617
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,730
Really?

618
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,490
Don't doubt, that’s true.

619
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,110
Fortunately, last time you didn’t transfer to his lab.

620
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,500
Otherwise, as a small undergraduate,

621
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,350
you'd be a sheep in a tiger's mouth,

622
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,100
with no bones left.

623
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,830
That's right.

624
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,430
That's what Jiang Songrui is.

625
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,870
When you told me that

626
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,110
you were going to his lab,

627
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,150
I didn't react.

628
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,910
If I had,

629
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,160
I wouldn't have let you go.

630
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:08,830
Right?

631
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:09,910
Later when Yuhe

632
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,880
knew about it,

633
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,250
so he immediately stopped you.

634
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,900
But,

635
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,130
you two got into a fight.

636
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:14,890
So bad.

637
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,490
Wait.

638
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,410
You mean that

639
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,270
Xiao Yuhe was helping me?

640
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,180
Yes.

641
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,780
If you don't believe,

642
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,470
you can ask

643
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,400
Yuhe and Zhao Yiran.

644
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,080
They've both worked with Jiang Songrui,

645
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,900
and they know him pretty well.

646
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,800
Right, Yiran?

647
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,670
Take it.

648
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,970
Chengcheng’s friend,

649
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,870
have some potato chips.

650
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,710
No need.

651
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,790
Senior, I’ll leave first.

652
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,210
Okay.

653
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,870
Share the gossip next time.

654
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,450
Okay.

655
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,430
Come and play often!

656
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,000
Senior.

657
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,510
Zhao Yiran!

658
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,830
You heard

659
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,600
what we just said, right?

660
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,990
I've always

661
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,990
thought of you as a good senior.

662
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,740
Why did you do that?

663
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,640
You...what do you mean?

664
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,950
I saw you had no place to go,

665
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,990
so I wanted to help you with good intentions.

666
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,360
Besides,

667
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,740
how could I know that Prof. Jiang

668
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,680
has problems?

669
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,710
Didn't you know that?

670
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,640
I...

671
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,980
That's it this time.

672
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,540
Next time, you'd better not let me know.

673
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,020
Otherwise I will...

674
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,310
Otherwise, what can you do?

675
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,640
Recently, Xixi seems

676
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,260
to have participated in a boxing competition.

677
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,080
She may need someone to practice with.

678
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,120
You can go.

679
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,390
I’ve gotten the reviewers' comments.

680
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,510
Many of these comments are things

681
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,950
I've already

682
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,660
mentioned before!

683
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,230
Have they all been corrected?

684
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,120
Who?

685
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,170
What sound?

686
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,640
It sounds like

687
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,820
a mouse eating potato chips.

688
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,130
Who’s so bored?

689
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,450
Have nothing to do?

690
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,150
Then why did you feed the mouse chips?

691
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,230
No one fed it that.

692
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,400
So you mean that

693
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,330
the mouse opened its cage

694
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,830
after the experiment,

695
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,400
and went to the supermarket and scanned a QR code

696
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,760
to buy a packet of potato chips?

697
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,950
Of course not, Prof. Du.

698
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,480
Because...

699
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,260
Catch it!

700
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm coming, I'm coming.

701
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:04,860
Go.

702
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:09,950
This side.

703
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
There, there, there.

704
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,810
Run that way!

705
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,010
It's gone. It's gone.

706
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,620
♫Like falling into the bottomless ocean♫

707
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,530
It's in the...lab.

708
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,070
I'm coming! I'm coming!

709
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,429
I've got it!

710
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,510
Great!

711
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,660
I caught it myself.

712
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,710
Little mouse.

713
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,690
Am I good?

714
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,390
Senior,

715
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,710
you helped me

716
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,710
by not letting me

717
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,350
transfer to Prof. Jiang's lab?

718
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,210
Don't think too much.

719
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,230
I did it for a reason.

720
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,260
Because you

721
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,030
have participated in our lab's

722
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,940
important projects,

723
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,900
I'm afraid...

724
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,930
You are afraid that I will disclose the content of the research,

725
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,860
so

726
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,120
you don't want me to go to another lab?

727
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,590
Yes.

728
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,180
That's a poor excuse.

729
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,190
No button for coffee?

730
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,060
I don’t drink!

731
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,780
Senior Xixi, are you eating?

732
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,980
Otherwise?

733
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,100
Other...

734
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,950
Other...otherwise,

735
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,720
I'll go to get some more food.

736
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,610
Senior Xixi,

737
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,020
here is the juice I bought for you just now.

738
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,580
Very tasty.

739
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,560
It's mango flavor. Try it.

740
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,150
What do you want?

741
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,780
I want to say

742
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,280
thank you for letting me stay.

743
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,150
If it weren't for you,

744
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,290
I'd have to leave.

745
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,180
And if I had left,

746
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,450
I would have regretted it now.

747
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,810
I want to ask

748
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,920
do you have time?

749
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,590
If you have time,

750
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,490
can I invite you to dinner?

751
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,380
No need to thank me.

752
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,220
I'm not the one

753
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,460
who wants you to stay.

754
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,640
Then who is it?

755
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,070
Who do you think it is?

756
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,410
With your brain,

757
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,070
how did you

758
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,000
get into our lab?

759
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,340
In order to let you stay, Xiao Yuhe

760
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,430
now owes me

761
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,550
a set of mice facial recognition

762
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,470
automatic feeding system.

763
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,230
And he also promised to help Jiang Songrui

764
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,150
to do the project together.

765
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,090
Three labs a day,

766
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,810
he really works hard for you.

767
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,200
No way.

768
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,800
How could he help me?

769
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:58,990
I'm full.

770
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,610
Ask him the rest yourself.

771
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,690
Remind you,

772
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,940
he is

773
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,720
sometimes like this.

774
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,670
What he says is

775
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,700
the opposite of what he thinks.

776
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,420
Did I misunderstand Xiao Yuhe?

777
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,470
He doesn't

778
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,610
seem as bad as I think.

779
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,270
I'm getting more and more

780
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,340
confused about him.
