00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,210
He’s just on my way. Don’t get us wrong.

181
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,470
Bye.

182
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:13,990
Chengcheng.

183
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:14,930
When did they

184
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,670
get so close?

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,880
It's the first time

186
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,670
I've seen him carry

187
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,490
anyone other than you.

188
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,390
Really?

189
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,830
Yes.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,990
Don't you think

191
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,440
there seems to be

192
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,710
something wrong

193
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,790
with the two of them?

194
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,360
Don't forget to

195
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,710
watch the fireworks together tonight.

196
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,460
Are you still in charge of reception

197
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,100
today?

198
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,280
Okay.

199
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,690
Well.

200
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,770
Since you are still in charge of

201
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,400
reception today,

202
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,370
I have to emphasize

203
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,780
something to you again.

204
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,500
These experimental data

205
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,540
are of great importance.

206
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
And our usage time

207
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,820
is until 6 pm.

208
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,010
The last batch of subjects

209
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,630
will come today.

210
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,510
All data

211
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,670
cannot be re-entered.

212
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,890
So you have to make sure that

213
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,480
every subject

214
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,840
can attend

215
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,650
and finish on time.

216
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,240
Okay.

217
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,090
The subjects are coming.

218
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,360
Go pick them up.

219
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,300
Okay.

220
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,730
Okay, I remember.

221
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm going to pick up the subjects now.

222
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,870
See you at night.

223
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,330
What are you doing?

224
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm here waiting for the subjects.

225
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,900
What are you doing?

226
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,110
I'm here waiting for the bus.

227
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,190
I'm going to the modeling contest.

228
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,280
Where did you get the money

229
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
to buy KFC?

230
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,420
Xiao Yuhe gave it to me.

231
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,900
He teaches you Thai boxing,

232
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,790
drives you to the lab,

233
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,730
and gives you money to buy KFC.

234
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,640
Are you sure you're just close?

235
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,970
Then what other reasons

236
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,780
could there be?

237
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,660
Really?

238
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,790
I think

239
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,240
you two are hiding something from me.

240
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,800
Chengcheng.

241
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,570
We’re so close.

242
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,670
You’ve known everything about me since childhood.

243
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,460
How could I hide anything from you?

244
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,720
And that’s Xiao Yuhe.

245
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,740
No way!

246
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,040
Chengcheng.

247
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,220
Take it.

248
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,640
Here.

249
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,640
I’ll bring it to Zhu Panpan.

250
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,359
Zhu Panpan only eats

251
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,450
square chicken nuggets without skin.

252
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,510
Did you think of Zhu Panpan?

253
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,070
I can't think about him.

254
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,690
This way I can feel better.

255
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,560
If...

256
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean...

257
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,820
What would you think

258
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,700
if Zhu Panpan

259
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,400
suddenly appeared?

260
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,770
How come?

261
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,560
He hasn’t contacted me

262
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,540
for so many years.

263
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,970
Forget it. Let’s not talk about this.

264
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,360
Senior.

265
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,790
Senior.

266
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,940
The server

267
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,970
in the lab is down.

268
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,810
All the paper data is disconnected.

269
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Have you tried remote?

270
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,400
Yes, but it doesn’t work.

271
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:35,820
Okay.

272
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm going to the server room.

273
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,390
There is no signal there.

274
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,600
After the server is restored,

275
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,280
remember to run the data.

276
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:40,950
Okay.

277
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,940
The bus is coming. Bye.

278
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:50,870
Bye.

Okay.

293
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,600
This kid

294
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
looks so much like Xiao Yuhe

295
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,460
when he was a kid.

296
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,630
Xiao Yuhe?

297
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,040
I've seen photos of him

298
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,410
as a kid before.

299
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,120
They look so alike.

300
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,050
It happens that

301
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,600
Prof. Du asked me to fetch some chairs

302
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,440
from the storage room.

303
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,100
You...

304
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,710
Man, what’s your name?

305
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,090
Chengcheng. Chengcheng.

306
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,720
Let’s go.

307
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,380
Where to go?

308
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,520
Fetch some chairs.

309
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,550
Let’s go.

310
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
What’s this?

311
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Why is it

312
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
in the lab?

313
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,430
This was brought here

314
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,480
by Wang Lunye yesterday.

315
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,820
I heard that senior Xiao

316
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,560
was badly terrified.

317
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,910
Wang Lunye also said that

318
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,890
the two of them had known each other

319
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,700
since elementary school.

320
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,320
So he knows that

321
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,290
Xiao has been afraid of these since childhood,

322
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,580
such as snakes, mice, and cockroaches.

323
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
He’s afraid of so many things.

324
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,670
Xiao is afraid of mice.

325
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
You and Wang Lunye

326
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,480
are also elementary school classmates.

327
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,650
Did the three of you

328
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,510
know each other since childhood?

329
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,840
Do you remember that

330
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,870
there was a classmate named Zhu Panpan

331
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,340
in elementary school?

332
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,770
We... are close.

333
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,320
We are close.

334
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,710
Right.

335
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,170
Chengcheng.

336
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,150
Chengcheng.

337
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,060
Chengcheng.

338
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,610
Senior.

339
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,020
Where is Xiao Yuhe now?

340
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,990
Do you think

341
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,990
we've met before?

342
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,510
When?

343
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,010
A long time ago.

344
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,480
How do you know to do this?

345
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,530
I saw it

346
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,150
in a magazine before.

347
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,790
Could it be that someone taught you?

348
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,530
Have we met before?

349
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,580
Didn't you say that

350
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,930
if you had met me,

351
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,360
you would recognize me?

352
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,320
I only eat square chicken nuggets

353
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,770
without skin.

354
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Zhu Panpan only eats square

355
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,520
chicken nuggets without skin.

356
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,150
What’s this?

357
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,210
A robot.

358
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,090
Where did you get the robot?

359
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,320
I made it myself.

360
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,830
Urticaria caused by mosquito bites.

361
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,590
This kid

362
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,240
looks so much like Xiao Yuhe

363
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,460
when he was a kid.

364
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,840
Zhu Panpan, is that you?

365
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,730
It’s me.

366
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,720
Xiao Yuhe.

367
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,360
Xiao Yuhe.

368
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,710
Let me ask you.

369
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,890
Are you Zhu Panpan?

370
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,140
I said, are you Zhu Panpan?

371
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,140
Chengcheng.

372
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,420
Listen to me.

373
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,740
Tell me,

374
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,050
why did you leave without saying goodbye?

375
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,960
Back then, Zhu Panpan

376
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,180
only had you as a friend.

377
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,110
But you didn't only have Zhu Panpan.

378
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,990
At that time, Zhu Panpan was sad

379
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,720
because you gave the ice cream that

380
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,770
you gave him to others.

381
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,700
Why did you give

382
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,450
the color sticks

383
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,520
he gave you to someone else?

384
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,250
Why did you say to others

385
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,600
what you said to him?

386
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,910
He felt that you didn't need him

387
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,710
and that he wasn’t important to you.

388
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,410
He had no choice but to leave.

389
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,330
Wang Lunye bought the ice cream himself.

390
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,960
And the color sticks too.

391
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,820
I have kept everything well

392
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,330
you gave me until now.

393
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,870
Why didn't you

394
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,780
ask me then,

395
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,070
but left without saying goodbye?

396
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,930
Why didn't you say anything

397
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,780
when you knew

398
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,630
I was Su Chengcheng?

399
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,250
Chengcheng.

400
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,390
Half for you and half for myself.

401
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,230
We are good friends.

402
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,640
Here.

403
00:26:59,540 --> 00:26:59,980
Let’s go.

404
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,540
[Sorry]

405
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,930
♫The passing wind is listening♫

406
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,110
♫Changeable weather in summer♫

407
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,040
♫Through time and space, I found you♫

408
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,690
♫In the foggy memories♫

409
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,050
♫Complicated emotions♫

410
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,030
♫What to use to make sure♫

411
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,600
♫The throbbing heart♫

412
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,360
♫Clarifies the misunderstood past♫

413
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,010
♫The distance of missing♫

414
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,560
♫Makes me unprepared♫

415
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,400
♫It turned out to be you♫

416

♫How much I like you♫

420
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,870
We finally sent the paper.

421
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,910
Xiao.

422
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,890
You are our God.

423
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,340
We have to celebrate.

424
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:12,930
Of course.

425
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,160
Where is Su Chengcheng?

426
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,460
Chengcheng has class this morning.

427
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,190
I guess she went to class.

428
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,080
But she will come to the lab

429
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,260
to pick up the documents later.

430
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,190
She’d be here soon.

431
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,760
Okay.

432
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,990
We stayed up all night.

433
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,230
Anything to eat?

434
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,190
I want to eat French fries.

435
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,710
I want to eat Japanese food.

436
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
Crayfish.

437
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,070
Everything will do.

438
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,530
Okay, let’s eat French fries.

439
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,890
Xiao.

440
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,540
You have fallen from the altar.

441
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,010
Look at you.

442
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,720
Thank you, senior Xiao.

443
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,270
Chengcheng.

444
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,760
Look at the e-bike I just bought.

445
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,480
It’s the same as yours.

446
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,160
Best configuration

447
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,750
Best configuration.

448
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,310
Are you in a bad mood?

449
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,930
I got a prize

450
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,490
in the modeling contest.

451
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,160
I will give you

452
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,970
the wages I owe you.

453
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,270
What’s wrong with her?

454
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,510
Don’t you have any idea?

455
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,510
You clearly know that Xiao Yuhe

456
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,130
is the Zhu Panpan

457
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,800
she knew when she was a child,

458
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,620
why didn't you

459
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,260
tell her earlier?

460
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,180
You are good for nothing.

461
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,290
I don’t want to talk to you.

462
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,310
What should we do?

463
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,600
I don't know if Prof. Du knows it.

464
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,220
But I’m afraid that he wouldn’t love to.

465
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,800
Don’t...

466
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,370
Hold on, Yuhe.

467
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,320
Xiao.

468
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,120
Yuhe.

469
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,800
We’ve finished such a big thing.

470
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,770
Shall we go out

471
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,480
to have fun?

472
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,490
Hang out!

473
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,040
You should go.

474
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,540
You should go.

475
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:02,900
Prof. Du.

476
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,530
I totally agree.

477
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,870
Okay.

478
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,290
During this period of time,

479
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,450
everyone has worked hard.

480
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,630
We haven't used up

481
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,420
the activity funds last time.

482
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,890
Dongmao.

483
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,420
This time you're in charge of

484
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,180
organizing a weekend getaway

485
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,230
for everyone to relax.

486
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,320
Okay, Prof. Du.

487
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,560
Thank you, Prof. Du.

488
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,460
Long live Prof. Du!

489
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,150
Life saver!

490
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,910
You should

491
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,970
really relax.

492
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,010
Yes.

493
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,100
Xiao Yuhe.

494
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,270
Xiao Yuhe.

495
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,430
Come to my office.

496
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,740
Dongmao, I want to

497
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,380
go to the place

498
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,170
we didn't go last time.

499
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,030
Where?

500
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,110
Amusement park.

501
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,790
I got an idea.

502
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,390
Where?

503
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,000
Canyon rafting.

504
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,700
Canyon rafting?

505
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,210
The water is dirty

506
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,410
and will get all over the body.

507
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,950
Right, that would be troublesome.

508
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you think you are not tanned enough?

509
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,500
Chengcheng, come over.

510
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,770
Prof. Du approved

511
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,470
the team building of us on this weekend.

512
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,220
We're talking about

513
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,500
- where to go.
- Yes.

514
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,040
Any advice?

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,210
Any advice?

516
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,830
Everywhere will do. It’s up to you.

517
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,970
What happened to Chengcheng?

518
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,520
She's not even interested in hanging out.

519
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,390
No idea.

520
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,910
Whose takeaway?

521
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,580
Here.

522
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,430
Let me.

523
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,090
Just French fries. Why so excited?

524
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,540
Come on.

525
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,490
All of these?

526
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,780
Yes.

527
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,890
Thank you senior Xiao for the takeaway.

528
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,460
Thank you senior Xiao.

529
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,240
Hurry up.

530
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,030
Take some French fries.

531
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,170
Take some French fries.

532
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,760
Take some.

533
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,270
No, thanks.

534
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,639
I know a way to

535
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,530
make french fries super tasty.

536
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,550
Take a try.

537
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,139
How is it? Does it taste good?

538
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,830
I eat this every time

539
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,370
I'm unhappy.

540
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,420
And I’ll be happy after eating it.

541
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:35,820
By the way,

542
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,060
since the paper is published,

543
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:37,810
let's take a photo

544
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,949
and send it to Moments to celebrate.

545
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,489
Here.

546
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,239
Once again.

547
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,780
Hurry up.

548
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,639
Come on.

549
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,810
One, two...

550
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,150
Yuhe.

551
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:48,900
Xiao.

552
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,100
Xiao.

553
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,670
Come on.

554
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,420
Take a photo.

555
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,030
Come on.

556
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,929
Chengcheng.

557
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:55,739
Hurry up.

558
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,080
Smile.

559
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,870
Smile,

560
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,200
Cheer up.

561
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,550
Yuhe, look at the camera.

562
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,580
Cheer up.

563
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,540
One, two, three.

564
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,430
One, two, three.

565
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,470
One, two...

566
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,300
Okay.

567
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,450
Done.

568
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,530
Let me see.

569
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,030
Good.

570
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,640
I’ll send it. It’s okay.

571
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,530
Any Photoshop needed?

572
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,600
I think so.

573
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,660
Don't spoil our image.

574
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,970
Your smile is so fake.

575
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,240
Chengcheng.

576
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,680
I paid you

577
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,890
what I owed you.

578
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
Cheer up.

579
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,180
What’s up?

580
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,470
Nothing special.

581
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,530
I'm here to see my good friend

582
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,080
Su Chengcheng.

583
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,470
Let’s go eat something delicious.

584
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,790
What about...?

585
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:50,700
Chengcheng.

586
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,290
So sorry.

587
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,450
Why are you so complacent?

588
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,910
Your treat.

589
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,020
Okay.

590
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,690
Let’s go.

591
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,340
Here.

592
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
Chengcheng.

593
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,670
Take some.

594
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,640
Chengcheng.

595
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,970
I’m sorry.

596
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
I know Zhu Panpan

597
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,430
is very important to you.

598
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,490
I actually thought about

599
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,760
whether to tell you this before.

600
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,580
But I was afraid you couldn’t accept it.

601
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,330
That’s why...

602
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,450
How about

603
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,270
you hit me?

604
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm thick-skinned and can take it.

605
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,270
Come on.

606
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,250
Do it.

607
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,880
I'm thick-skinned.

608
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:15,770
Piss off.

609
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,680
You can't bear to hit me.

610
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,780
Still upset?

611
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,530
Well.

612
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,840
A new fashion shop is opened

613
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,940
over there.

614
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,860
Let’s go shopping.

615
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,400
I will pay

616
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,660
for everything.

617
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,110
Okay.

618
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,900
Well...

619
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,730
I...

620
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,640
Forget it.

621
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,510
I...

622
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,610
I didn't take my phone today.

623
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,520
Where do you want to go for a while?

624
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,760
I’ll go with you.

625
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,380
As long as you don't feel sad,

626
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,740
I can

627
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,580
do anything.

628
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,310
Okay?

629
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,390
Smile.

630
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,870
Don’t be sad.

631
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,590
I want to stay here myself.

632
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,270
Leave me alone.

633
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,740
