Senior Jiafa is so kind to me.

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,110
All right.

20
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,650
I saw you taking pictures with your family

21
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,120
at the school gate this morning.

22
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,470

That’s my father and my aunt.

When the freshmen checked in,

25
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,829
I was the only one in the class

26
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
who checked in by myself.

27
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,630
Many people took photos

28
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,710
at the school gate at that time.

29
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,790
But everyone was shooting

30
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,900
with the whole family.

31
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,540
I didn't really want to take pictures

32
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,690
alone at that time.

After the school year started,

34
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,310
I thought it was a bit too touristy

35
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,020
to take photos at the school gate,

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
so I didn't take them either.

37
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,720
So

38
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,230
it seems that I really haven’t

39
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,370
taken any serious photos at the school gate.

65
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,010
love festivals.

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,520
Because when it comes to the festival,

67
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,150
I had all kinds of reasons

68
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,310
to ask my parents

69
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,060
for gifts and pocket money.

But then they got divorced,

71

my family

77
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,460
went to the top of the mountain to enjoy the moon.

78
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,520
There was nothing really interesting.

79
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,370
Our mountains are not high

81
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,550
It was full of barbecue stalls and small stalls.

82

So noisy.

83
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,760
It was the same every year.

84
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
So I got used to it.

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
Then my parents got divorced,

86
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,910
and I didn't want to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival,

87
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,420
let alone eat mooncakes.

Senior,

89
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,470
let me take you to a place.

90
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,130
Where?

91
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,350
Here we are.

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,350
It's so beautiful here.

93
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,850
How did you find this place?

94
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,550
Once I escaped from self-study at night

95
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,740
and wandered here.

96
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,320
Usually there are few people here.

97
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:09,950
Come with me.

98
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,380
From here,

99
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,150
the whole city

100
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,570
becomes especially small.

101
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,410
Twinkle, twinkle.

102
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,890
Like a cartoon.

103
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,169
I really like this place.

104
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,669
Unfortunately,

105
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,480
there's no moon today.

106
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,620
Senior, close your eyes.

107
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,470
Why?

108
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,870
Just close.

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,250
No.

110
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,740
Close .

111
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,760
Don't open .

112
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,960
Don’t be so nervous.

113
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,550
Take it.

114
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,630
Don’t open your eyes.

115
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Now,

116
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,050
we're in a new world.

117
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,980
Write all your worries

118
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,330
on this piece of paper.

119
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,990
Then put the paper

120
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,010
into a small box

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,910
and lock it with a key.

122
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,550
The paper airplane in your hand

123
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,310
is the key to this box.

124
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,370
Now raise your arm,

125
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,370
listen to my command,

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,790
and then fly the paper plane out

127
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,710
with all your might.

128
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,160
Then your worries

129
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,940
will float away

130
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,060
with the paper plane

131
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,300
and never come back.

Xiaomeng, cheers.

136
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,480
Xiaomeng, I heard from your classmates that

137
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,280
you are planning to go abroad after graduation.

138
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,020
Have you decided where to go?

139
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Not yet.

140
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,790
Maybe

141
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,670
I'll apply to a few schools.

142
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,140
What's wrong, Senior?

143
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,750
Nothing.

144
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,140
I want to know which school you're going to.

145
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,480
We can go together in the future.

146
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,950
Xiaomeng, in fact, I...

147
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,470
Senior, I have to answer the phone first.

148
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,510
Hello.

149
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,710
What?

150
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,200
He withdrew the money again.

151
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,630
I’ve told you many times that

152
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,670
you must hide the money well,

153
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,790
and don't let him know the password.

154
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,830
Why is it still like this?

155
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,650
Hui doesn't have money for tuition, right?

156
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,540
How much are in short?

157
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,600
Tell him

158
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,450
to be a little more aggressive.

159
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,830
He still needs to attend tuition classes.

160
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,350
Whenever you eat, you swipe your phone.

161
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,960
Are there any rules at all?

162
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,790
When it comes to celebrity gossip,

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,090
there's nothing you don't know.

164
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,040
When it comes to study and future planning,

165
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,190
you just make light of it.

166
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,910
I think

167
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,350
you have a simple mind

168
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,970
but a complicated heart,

169
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,070
spending all your energy

170
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,590
on things that aren't worth it.

171
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,710
You don't have the ability

172
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,390
to think deeply

173
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,390
about the important things.

174
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,050
Come on, Dad.

175
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
Can you let me have a good meal?

176
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,090
Have some water.

177
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,980
Brother,

178
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,940
you've been waiting for a long time, right?

179
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,580
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

180
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,130
[Boys' Dormitory]

181
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,430
It's okay.

182
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,860
I probably got it

183
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,250
in the interest class.

184
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,980
Well, I'm going to go back.

185
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
It's been three years,

186
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,270
you still can't let it go?

187
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,860
Chengcheng,

188
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,630
thank you.

189
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,950
I'm happy today.

190
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,160
Unfortunately,

191
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,080
there's still no moon.

192
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,680
I also have a gift to you.

193
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,440
Close your eyes.

194
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,880
Why?

195
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,750
Close your eyes.

196
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,260
No.

197
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,040
Just close.

198
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,090
Don't peek.

199
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,020
Okay.

200
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,080
This is the moon I give you.

201
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,840
Although it's a bit rough.

202
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,750
No, I think it's cute.

203
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,960
Are you mocking me?

204
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,680
No, I'm not.

205
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,790
It's really cute.

206
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,440
Let me project it into the sky for you.

207
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,730
The moon is coming out!

208
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,980
Senior,

209
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,310
want some mooncakes?

210
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Thank you.

211
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,370
Is it good?

212
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes.

213
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,829
Are you teasing me as a dog?

214
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,819
It's already late. why don’t sleep.

215
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,290
Why are you...

216
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,480
What happened to your arm?

217
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,410
I accidentally fell yesterday.

218
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,030
Your arm is injured,

219
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,790
why are you still so happy?

220
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,700
Did you break your brain?

221
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,520
Why are you back?

222
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,120
Didn't you go out

223
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,640
with your parents?

224
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,050
I had a fight with my parents,

225
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,940
so I came back early.

226
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,430
But

227
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,230
even the atmosphere was so tense,

228
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,180
I didn't forget

229
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,000
to bring you the souvenirs.

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,560
How's that? Am I nice?

231
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,370
True sister.

232
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,720
At noon today,

233
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,050
let’s eat in the Guojiao Canteen.

234
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,590
It's on me.

235
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,770
Let's go now.

236
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,260
Let's go.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,150
Wait, I need to take a call.

238
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,260
Hello? Senior Jiafa.

239
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,900
Chengcheng, come over here.

240
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,190
Jianming has escaped from its cage.

241
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,210
Mr. Wang from the breeding room

242
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,250
has gone home on vacation.

243
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,590
Jianming hasn't seen him

244
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,230
for a few days in a row,

245
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,650
so it is anxious.

246
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,740
Okay, I'll come over and take a look.

247
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,070
Okay, okay. Come over.

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,730
Senior, well,

249
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,220
is everyone in the lab?

250
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,670
Yes, we're all here.

251
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,110
Is Senior Xiao also there?

252
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,450
Yuhe? Yuhe is here.

253
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,600
It's useless even if he's here.

254
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,760
He didn't feed Jianming.

255
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,380
Okay, okay. Come on, come on.

256
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,280
Waiting for you.

257
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,670
Who is it?

258
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,500
Chengcheng.

259
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,750
Last time Jianming escaped,

260
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,560
it was thanks to Chengcheng.

261
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,370
She has experience.

262
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,470
Let her help out.

263
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,780
No, I can handle it myself.

264
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,840
Really?

265
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,400
Yes.

266
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,280
I'll fix it for you right now.

267
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,210
Come on, get out of the way.

268
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,720
Senior.

269
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Senior Xiao.

270
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,650
Senior Xiao was hit by Jianming.

271
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:05,780
How is it?

272
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,060
He's still in there.

273
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,260
Jianming hit him.

274
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,750
I can't handle it.

275
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,990
Are you okay?

276
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,830
Did you get scratched?

277
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,870
I'm fine.

278
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,640
Close the door.

279
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,080
Oh, my God!

280
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,980
What are you doing? So noisy.

281
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,540
What are you doing?

282
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,470
Jianming.

283
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,940
Look.

284
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,420
Jianming is usually good.

285
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,410
It is splashing water.

286
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,910
Hurry up!

287
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,110
Today Jianming is really...

288
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,260
Chengcheng, are you okay?

289
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm not cold.

290
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,810
Go back to the dormitory.

291
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,100
That monkey...

292
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,790
Go back.

293
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,150
Go.

294
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,880
Go back.

295
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,630
Well...

296
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,470
How...

297
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,920
How about?

298
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,020
How about?

299
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,630
Jianming is really...

300
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,460
There is a fly.

301
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,510
Should I go?

302
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,640
Okay!

303
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,910
Is it just a monkey?

304
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,340
Prof..

305
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,120
Jianming, you can't do this.

306
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,720
Put it down.

307
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,140
Jianming!

308
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,830
Are you crazy?

309
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,020
You... you're for real!

310
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,640
Prof. Du.

311
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,750
Come on!

312
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,890
Fuck you!

313
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Prof. Du, are you okay?

314
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,740
Hurry up!

315
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,870
Go get the keeper.

316
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,770
Okay, let’s go.

317
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,230
Don't all go.

318
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,890
Come back one.

319
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,510
Mr. Wang from the breeding room

320
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,470
has gone home on vacation.

321
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,780
Jianming hasn't seen him

322
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,510
for a few days in a row,

323
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,960
so it is anxious.

324
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,450
Mr. Wang's clothes.

325
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,890
Mr. Wang's keys.

326
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,390
According to my observation,

327
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,780
Jianming is most sensitive

328
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,950
to smells and sounds.

329
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,830
Play Jianming's

330
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,010
favorite cartoon

331
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,360
to attract its attention.

332
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,350
The clothes

333
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,870
have Jianming’s familiar smell,

334
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,460
and the keys have its familiar sound.

335
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,260
Just as I expected.

336
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,490
It's done!

337
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:20,960
You’re back.

338
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,060
Whose clothes are you wearing?

339
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,560
What's going on?

340
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,840
This style looks familiar.

341
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,250
Is it a man

342
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,460
named Xiao's?

343
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,660
I knew it.

344
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,710
When I left,

345
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,700
you two were acting weird.

346
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,230
Is there something going on between you?

347
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,630
What's going on with you and Xiao Yuhe?

348
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,920
Tell me. Tell me.

349
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,260
Why are your underwear transparent?

350
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,470
No wonder Xiao Yuhe

351
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,680
gave me his jacket.

352
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm too ashamed. I don't want to live anymore.

353
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,140
You mean that

354
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,950
Xiao Yuhe knew that

355
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,790
your clothes were wet,

356
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,580
so he took off his jacket

357
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,790
and gave it to you?

358
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,470
Is this the Xiao Yuhe

359
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,900
you told me about before?

360
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,130
He's changed his mind for you?

361
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,250
What kind of idol drama is this?

362
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
This is so romantic.

363
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,370
Do I believe in love again?

364
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,680
That's great.

365
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Look.

366
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,610
Yes.

367
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,070
The most important part

368
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,950
is the new love skills

369
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,810
learned from the script.

370
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,610
The hero saves the beauty.

371
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,350
The hero saves the beauty.

372
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,620
Hello, Senior Xiao.

373
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,990
Let's go.

374
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,110
Let's go.

375
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,190
Are you okay?

376
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,180
Yes, I just have a cold.

377
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,870
It is cold these days.

378
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,430
Put on more clothes, don't catch a cold.

379
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,080
Where's your jacket?

380
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,560
I left it in the lab.

381
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,730
Do you need to go back and get it?

382
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,680
No, let's go.

383
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,220
Let's go then.

384
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,250
Let's go.

385
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,340
Get on my beloved bike.

386
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,950
Is the power of love so great?

387
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,340
Su Chengcheng can get up by herself

388
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,450
without an alarm clock.

389
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,190
Li Meizi,

390
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,810
I...

391
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,230
I got his jacket dirty.

392
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,380
Don’t worry, it's not obvious.

393
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,220
Obvious, it’s obvious.

394
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,190
Come down quickly.

395
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,280
Go with me to wash the clothes.

396
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,570
Kill me

397
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,600
to cheer you up.

398
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,590
Meizi, Li Meizi.

399
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,810
Li Meizi, Meizi, Li Meizi.

400
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,560
Meizi, Li Meizi.

401
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,660
Meizi, Li Meizi, Li Meizi.

402
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,180
Li Meizi.

403
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,390
Okay.

404
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,700
Hurry up.

405
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,990
Put more clothes in it.

406
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,190
One piece won't get the machine running.

407
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,710
That’s enough.

408
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,030
Why are they all white?

409
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,340
I'm afraid that

410
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,400
if the other clothes lose color,

411
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,410
it will be stained.

412
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,470
Disgusting.

413
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,660
Show your love here.

414
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,460
Show off by washing clothes.

415
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,770
The lab has a temporary meeting.

416
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,120
I have to go there.

417
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,740
When the laundry is done,

418
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,090
please help me take it out to dry.

419
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,470
Okay.

420
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,270
Don't forget.

421
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,020
Don't worry.

422
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,730
I feel like

423
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,940
the left brain is used to listen to language

424
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,320
and music.

425
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,310
Really?

426
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,370
Yes, the left ear...

427
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,040
Two people.

428
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,170
Senior,

429
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,820
I was going to return the clothes to you.

430
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,220
But it's a little bit dirty.

431
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,130
Can I wash it

432
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,870
and then bring it back to you?

433
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,680
Okay.

434
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,110
What's wrong with you?

435
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,510
Did you give me your jacket yesterday,

436
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,710
and you got cold?

437
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,400
No, I'm allergic to pollen.

438
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,420
Isn't it autumn now?

439
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,760
Chrysanthemum.

440
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,960
Chrysanthemum?

441
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,130
There are no chrysanthemums in our school.

442
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,590
Osmanthus.

443
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,870
There is no osmanthus either.

444
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,600
Newly planted osmanthus? Where?

445
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,240
We're all here now.

446
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,930
Okay.

447
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,750
Before we start,

448
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,420
let me tell you

449
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,440
one little thing.

450
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,070
Last week, I went to Shanghai with your senior sister

451
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,860
to attend a meeting.

452
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,030
I accidentally mentioned

453
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,220
the love experiment

454
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,970
in our lab before.

455
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,190
The experiment

456
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,040
Yuhe and Su Chengcheng did.

457
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,260
Many people are interested in it,

458
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,290
and hope that

459
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,350
our experiment

460
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,130
can be extended further.

461
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,710
Because

462
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,980
in terms of the current technology,

463
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,490
it is indeed impossible to define liking.

464
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,160
But it doesn't prevent us

465
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,320
from observing it

466
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,490
from different angles.

467
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,440
I have found a small direction.

468
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,920
To study the difference in brain activity

469
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,710
between men and women

470
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,610
when processing romantic information.

471
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,670
In this way,

472
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,750
we can accumulate some data,

473
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,940
which is also

474
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,740
helpful for our research.

475
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,250
At the weekly sharing meeting,

476
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,030
you can share

477
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,570
your observations

478
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,920
with us.

479
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,130
It's time to start dating at public expense again,

480
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,860
and abuse singles openly

481
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,870
under the guise of academics.

482
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,070
Actually,

483
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,280
the most important part

484
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,510
of this experiment

485
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,190
is to study the similarities and differences

486
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,650
in the activation of different parts of the brain

487
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,800
during the processing of romantic information by the opposite sex.

488
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,330
It doesn't have much to do

489
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,090
with liking.

490
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
If you are interested,

491
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,580
just participate in the experiment.

492
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,780
Look,

493
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,540
our dean still cares about

494
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,870
us singles .

495
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,110
Okay, you all go back

496
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,750
and get ready.

497
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,480
You can divide up into groups, okay?

498
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,130
Okay.

499
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,330
Okay, let's get back to the subject.

500
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,550
Let's discuss

501
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,680
some key points

502
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,540
of our academic research

503
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
last week.

504
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,330
Students, you're all so serious.

505
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,120
Hello, Prof. Du.

506
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,750
Go on with your work.

507
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,680
Go on with your work.

508
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,750
Nothing, I'm here

509
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,250
to check some data

510
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,190
from our previous studio.

511
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,350
Senior Xiao

512
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,530
has been using this machine.

513
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay, go on with your work.

514
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,490
Okay.

515
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,340
Go on with your work.

516
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,110
Okay.

517
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,620
Okay.

518
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,520
Xiao,

519
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,930
Prof. Du asks you to go to the office.

520
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,950
Are you still

521
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,110
developing Musk

522
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,290
by yourself in secret?

523
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,180
Why are you doing this?

524
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,310
Do you still want to

525
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,360
participate in this year's competition?

526
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:34,950
Yes.

527
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,980
Nonsense!

528
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,850
You're completely fooling around!

529
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,990
Xiao Yuhe,

530
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,740
I'm not stopping you from pursuing your dream.

531
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,980
I hope you

532
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,220
realize your dreams.

533
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,040
I also hope that

534
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,830
one day you will become a valuable

535
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,030
and successful

536
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,900
researcher.

537
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,240
But have you thought about

538
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,430
what you will face

539
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,010
if you go to

540
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,760
this competition now?

541
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,990
Don't forget

542
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,060
the incident

543
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,820
happened three years ago,

544
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,120
which had a very bad impact.

545
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,390
If you go to the competition

546
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,490
at this time,

547
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,670
there are many difficulties

548
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,100
that you can't even imagine.

549
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,430
Even if you think about it,

550
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,520
you can not solve it.

551
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,810
Senior,

552
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,210
what’s going on?

553
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,970
Several years ago,

554
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,820
Senior Xiao

555
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,700
took part in a competition.

556
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,460
The robot he made

557
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,880
lost control on the spot

558
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,250
and hurt people.

559
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,630
Crucially, he clashed

560
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,560
with the staff.

561
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,910
Then things got worse and worse.

562
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,410
He even went abroad to study

563
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,280
for a few years.

564
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,170
He just went back to school this year.

565
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,780
Why did the robot go out of control?

566
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,200
The robot went out of control...

567
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,850
I don't know exactly what happened.

568
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,380
I heard it from someone else.

569
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,730
I really don't know.

570
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,880
Meizi, what's wrong?

571
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,639
What about the other clothes? Are they all there?

572
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,770
Only that one is gone.

573
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,650
How could this happen?

574
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,989
Don't worry, don't worry.

575
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,710
I'm going back to the dorm.

576
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,630
Don't worry.

577
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,260
Okay, okay, okay.

578
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,880
What happened?

579
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,150
Just now I deliberately set a time

580
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,739
to come to pick it up.

581
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,989
When I came over,

582
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,590
your clothes

583
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,870
had all been put aside.

584
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,190
And Xiao Yuhe's jacket

585
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,640
was gone.

586
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,180
Don’t worry, let’s find it.

587
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,070
I've told you everything.

588
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,690
In fact,

589
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,500
I quite understand your insistence.

590
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,090
Researchers

591
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,220
should have the spirit of

592
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,330
not being afraid to lose.

593
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,800
But this is

594
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,680
the situation now.

595
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,820
I think,

596
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,660
for one thing,

597
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,830
the technical difficulty of Musk

598
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,650
is too much

599
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,440
for you to deal with alone.

600
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,750
For another thing,

601
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,790
I am also very worried about it.

602
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,640
If you participate in this competition,

603
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,510
if someone

604
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,550
with ulterior motives

605
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,170
digs up what happened back then,

606
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,680
it will be harmful to you

607
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,440
and to our lab.

608
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,710
Right?

609
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,070
Given your character,

610
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,710
even if I ask you

611
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,610
to give up now,

612
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,150
you won't do it.

613
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,290
Well,

614
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,230
let's stop for a while.

615
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,710
You think about it.

616
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,970
I'll think about it too.

617
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,250
When we figure it out,

618
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,660
then let’s talk about it

619
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,810
sometime,

620
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,370
and see what we can do about it.

621
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,500
But,

622
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,570
until we come to a conclusion,

623
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,350
I want you

624
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,670
to put down

625
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,100
the door card of the mechanical lab.

626
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,490
It's okay.

627
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,120
It's okay.

628
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,760
Where's Su Chengcheng?

629
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,020
She's going to...

630
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,030
Su Chengcheng has gone back to the dorm.

631
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,790
Senior Xiao,

632
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,550
what's wrong

633
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,430
with  Su Chengcheng?

634
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,610
She's not active in her studies,

635
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,760
but she's lazier than anyone else.

636
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,050
Are you done?

637
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,690
Yes.

638
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,310
Go on with your work.

639
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,530
Whose jacket is this?

640
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,190
Here it is.
