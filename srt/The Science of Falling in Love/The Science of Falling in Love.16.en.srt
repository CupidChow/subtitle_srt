00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,530
But...

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,090
Thank you, senior.

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,810
But thanks to this lab activity...

182
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,710
But thanks to

183
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,810
this lab activity

184
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,520
I participated,

185
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
The seniors

186
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,180
took special take of me.

187
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,320
They taught me

188
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,350
how to interpret

189
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,230
the codes inside machines

190
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,300
and their principle,

191
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,440
After that,

192
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,000
I finally know

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,240
what I like.

194
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,480
I know

195
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,640
which direction I should go.

196
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,539
Senior Chengcheng.

197
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,450
I'll apply for

198
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,230
the major of computer science at Southeast Science and Technology University in the future,

199
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,929
and I'll keep fighting,

200
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,750
keep going,

201
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,650
and keep trying

202
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,370
to achieve my goal.

203
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,840
Great.

204
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,190
It really is that useful?

205
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,330
Yes, it is.

206
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,170
Of course, Sir.

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,280
Interest is the best teacher

208
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,150
for children.

209
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,330
Look over there,

210
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,420
his name is Xiao Yuhe.

211
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,330
Our Senior Xiao

212
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,440
is only 21,

213
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
but he's already

214
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,450
a first-year doctoral student.

215
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,190
He's amazing.

216
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,940
Really amazing.

217
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,740
I'm tired. I'm tired.

218
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,740
What are you doing?

219
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,760
Get off immediately.

220
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,450
Why?

221
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
If I hadn't showed up in time,

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
would you have been able to recruit students so smoothly?

223
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,090
Look at...

224
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,450
look at his face.

225
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,710
He's ill,

226
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,250
don't fight with him over this.

227
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,160
He's ill?

228
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,830
What does that have to do w-with me?

229
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,960
Asking you nicely

230
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
won't work, right?

231
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,410
Get lost this instance.

232
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,890
What a pain in the neck.

233
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,560
But wh-what about me?

234
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,400
What are you going to do?

235
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,620
H-having dinner.

236
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,590
Who told you we were having dinner?

237
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,560
We'll go straight back to the campus.

238
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,800
Go back on your own

239
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
and take care.

240
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,530
Your senior have to go.

241
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,600
Bye-bye.

242
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,070
I want to read it.

243
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,100
I want to read it, too.

244
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,770
Wang Lunye,

245
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,030
why did you hit Zhu Panpan?

246
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,140
I didn't.

247
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,870
Here, Zhu Panpan, you read it.

248
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,120
Why are obnoxious people

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,170
so alike?

250
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,050
Does it hurt?

251
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,490
A bit.

252
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,690
What do we have for dinner?

253
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,360
The shrimp pot,

254
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,680
beef pot and lamb pot here

255
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,860
are all good.

256
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,660
There are also various choices.

257
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,330
Have a look.

258
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:38,930
I don't have to,

259
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,270
as long as it's chosen by you, it has to be good.

260
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,650
Let's order.

261
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,490
You go ahead.

262
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,080
This is for the e-bike.

263
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,320
It's not enough,

264
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,660
but I'll pay you back gradually in the future.

265
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,510
The e-bike is a gift from me.

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
Besides,

267
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,390
you bought me a coat before.

268
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
I ruined that garment,

269
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,990
so I was supposed to buy you another one.

270
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,510
Fine, this meal is on me then.

271
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,420
You are treating me?

272
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,820
Then I have to take my time to choose.

273
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,250
Do you have something particularly in mind?

274
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,490
It's up to you.

275
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,380
What are you doing here?

276
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,250
Having dinner with you.

277
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,160
You haven't ordered yet, have you? Here.

278
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Let's have one

279
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,120
Signature Bullfrog Pot.

280
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,130
I don't eat bullfrogs.

281
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,960
Pick another one.

282
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,780
Let's have one

283
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,640
Chicken Pot.

284
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,450
I don't eat chicken, either.

285
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,630
Cut it out.

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,730
You don't pay for it,

287
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,540
so save your opinions.

288
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,910
How about a lamb pot?

289
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
The lamb here

290
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,720
are well-stewed,

291
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,590
so it's easy for you to eat.

292
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,200
OK.

293
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
What about the sides?

294
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,350
I'll add them accordingly.

295
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,940
OK.

296
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,830
-Wait, Xiao Yuhe.
-Waiter.

297
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,340
It's fine if you don't eat bullfrogs,

298
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
but how could it be possible that you don't eat chicken?

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,120
Don't you eat KFC or McDonald's?

300
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,020
I only eat chicken nuggets in squares,

301
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,420
and without skin.

302
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,070
In squares

303
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,210
and without skin.

304
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,160
2 meat buns.

305
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,010
2 grilled squids.

306
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,530
2 pork rolls,

307
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,410
and add 2 fried chicken drumsticks.

308
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,120
Forget the fried chicken drumsticks.

309
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,130
Why?

310
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,350
Chicken drumsticks are yummy.

311
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll bring them to Zhu Panpan.

312
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,410
Zhu Panpan only eats

313
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,550
chicken in squares and without skin.

314
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,590
Chicken without skin.

315
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm almost done.

316
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,160
See if you want to add something.

317
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,630
What are you zoning out for?

318
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,160
That's it.

319
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,300
Zhang Li.

320
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,070
Zhang Li?

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,420
He didn't tidy them up again.

322
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,110
Hello, Senior Jiafa.

323
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,490
Hello, Chen.

324
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,220
Are you done with the data?

325
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,500
You need the participants' data tomorrow.

326
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,790
Then I'll sort them out tonight.

327
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
Chengcheng, I really can't go.

328
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,950
For you,

329
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,290
I rode a bike

330
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,740
for nearly half an hour

331
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,990
with the last 2 yuan

332
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,790
left in my Yu'E Bao.

333
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,030
I'm so poor.

334
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,710
I can only ride your e-bike.

335
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,240
I can't walk a bit.

336
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,110
No, I can't.

337
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,820
Cut it out

338
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,350
and get off immediately.

339
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,250
Wang Lunye, I'll say that only...

340
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,780
Let him ride it.

341
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,450
Chengcheng, get on.

342
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,330
The car I ordered is arriving.

343
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,520
My e-bike is brand new,

344
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,400
so be careful.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,290
If there's a chip on it,

346
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:10,970
you'll lose a piece of skin.

347
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:13,710
Gotta go.

348
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,319
Take care.

349
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,540
-Bye-bye.
-Later.

350
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,490
Wait, what's going on?

351
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,250
You left?

352
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,890
You came.

353
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,410
Mister.

354
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,440
Why are you alone today?

355
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,520
Where's the girl from last time?

356
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,510
She's doing experiments.

357
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,610
Mister, how about this?

358
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,830
I won't eat in this time.

359
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,220
Please pack me 2 takeouts.

360
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,900
I'll bring them to her.

361
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,980
Sure.

362
00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:03,400
[The young and ignorant you and me at that time.]

363
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,160
Mister.

364
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,610
Coming.

365
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,300
Have you finished your experiments?

366
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,600
How did you know?

367
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,200
Here you are.

368
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,860
Mister.

369
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,530
Did you make a mistake?

370
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,990
I just came in and haven't ordered yet.

371
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,290
It's not wrong. It's not wrong.

372
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,920
Chen just ordered it for you.

373
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,690
He was just here a moment ago.

374
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know where he is now.

375
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,230
Take care with them.

376
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,090
One with coriander

377
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,840
and one without.

378
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,590
OK, thanks.

379
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,990
Do you listen to crosstalk?

380
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:28,800
Yes.

381
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,880
Bye-bye.

382
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,970
Then,

383
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,720
I gotta go.

384
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,480
Well,

385
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:01,940
good night.

386
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,510
Su Chengcheng.

387
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,150
The day after tomorrow, after finishing the experiments,

388
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,410
there will be a firework show

389
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,500
in the square

390
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,640
outside the east 3rd school building.

391
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,190
Would you like to watch it together?

392
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,880
I

393
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,160
have something to tell you.

394
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,010
Sure.

395
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,800
Then I have to go.

396
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,300
Chengcheng.

397
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,650
Be there or be square.

398
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,250
Xiao Yuhe.

399
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,840
Have mine. Have mine.

400
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,420
In squares

401
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,610
and without skin.

402
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,880
He couldn't have recognized me, could he?

403
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,000
No, it's impossible.

404
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,160
He wouldn't be that smart.

405
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,270
Then why?

406
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:26,650
Xiao.

407
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,930
Let's have some kebabs.

408
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,470
Let's go.

409
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,760
Come here and have a look.

410
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,830
See who this is.

411
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,130
Who's this? What a chubby boy.

412
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,660
This chubby boy is pretty cute.

413
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,560
Is this you?

414
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,670
I was slim when I was little, OK?

415
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,320
Didn't I get chubby

416
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,930
only after meeting you guys?

417
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,500
It's me.

418
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,760
Can you tell?

419
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,200
No.

420
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,350
You two look nothing alike.

421
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,790
This kid is too cute to be you.

422
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,730
That's all, you can go.

423
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,740
Let's go. Let's go.

424
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,360
Count me out.

425
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,390
Come on.

426
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,430
Really, count me out.

427
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,010
Fine, let's go.

428
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,630
It seems that I won't be recognized.

429
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,020
Zhang Rui.

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,730
It's me, Wang Lunye.

431
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,370
Well, I would like to ask you something.

432
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,320
Did you remember that

433
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
in 3rd grade in elementary school,

434
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,030
there was a chubby kid.

435
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,810
Yes, yes.

436
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,000
H-his name's Zhu Panpan.

437
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,630
[Zhenshan Academy]

438
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,410
Su Chengcheng.

439
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,690
I have feelings for you.

440
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,790
Be more sincere.

441
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,140
Be gentler.

442
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,510
Su Chengcheng,

443
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,700
I'm Zhu Panpan.

444
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,230
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

445
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,210
I do!

446
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,840
I've heard it.

447
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Is this for Su Chengcheng?

448
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,500
It isn't.

449
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,110
It is, too.

450
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,840
I bought it for myself.

451
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,820
Impossible.

452
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,130
How can your neck fit in?

453
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,670
Can your neck fit in?

454
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,100
Hello.

455
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,750
Please come this way.

456
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,590
Please follow me.

457
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,950
You are...

458
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,470
this one.

459
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,070
Right?

460
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,080
Just wait in line over here.

461
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,720
This is you, right?

462
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,600
OK, wait in line.

463
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
OK, this.

464
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,950
Everyone, I have something to tell you in advance.

465
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,450
Just before

466
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,680
the experiment begins,

467
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,250
we need everyone to wash their hair.

468
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,150
Because there are oil and grease

469
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,920
on our hair,

470
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,000
which may cause

471
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,910
the EEG electrode impedance to increase

472
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,390
and affect our experimental effect.

473
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,880
After washing your hair,

474
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,320
we hope

475
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,720
you can not use hair styling products

476
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,680
such as hair conditioner

477
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,640
or mousse as well,

478
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,500
because they will also

479
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,460
affect our experimental result.

480
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,580
Thank you for your cooperation.

481
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,160
Did you two

482
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
finish your registration?

483
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,180
Please come this way.

484
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,970
Then the gender...

485
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,680
Please have a look.

486
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,490
It wouldn't be convenient for you to wash your hair like this, right?

487
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,230
Yeah.

488
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,940
Let me help you. This way.

489
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,910
Thank you so much.

490
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,310
It's nothing.

491
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,370
Chengcheng.

492
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,080
After I finish the experiments,

493
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,020
let's meet at the lounge.

494
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,080
OK.

495
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,800
What brings you here?

496
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,570
Xiao Yuhe.

497
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,060
Did we know each other before?

498
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,910
Did we?

499
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,250
Are you my classmate from elementary school?

500
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,770
Forget it.

501
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,130
Su Chengcheng

502
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,040
is also my elementary school classmate after all.

503
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,330
I'll ask her instead.

504
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,500
Wang Lunye.

505
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,800
Wang Lunye.

506
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,090
Zhu Panpan.

507
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,020
Hello, Zhu Panpan.

508
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,910
You are still afraid of snakes and bugs.

509
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,370
What did you just say?

510
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,180
I don't understand.

511
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,390
Chengcheng.

512
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,140
Gu Chen.

513
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,520
I asked you something

514
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,410
on WeChat yesterday.

515
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,480
Did you forget to reply?

516
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,310
I went to sleep early last night,

517
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,970
what's it about?

518
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,440
Here's the thing.

519
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,170
I confessed to Xixi.

520
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,020
Did it turn out well?

521
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,390
No.

522
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,940
She said that

523
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,670
she didn't need anyone to understand her

524
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,330
or take care of her,

525
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,240
and that she was comfortable by herself.

526
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,800
But I feel like

527
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,360
she's not uncomfortable

528
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,210
being with me,

529
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,700
so I want to ask you,

530
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,060
what do you think she really means?

531
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,460
She's comfortable

532
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,200
by herself...

533
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,600
That means she doesn't want to be in a relationship.

534
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,290
Is it because of her ex-boyfriend?

535
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,620
Her ex-boyfriend?

536
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,420
You mean Wang Jiaze?

537
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,250
I've seen that guy.

538
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,200
He doesn't look like

539
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,380
a guy she can't get over.

540
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,110
Even if it's not because she can't get over him,

541
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,160
it may still affect her more or less,

542
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,390
because he hurt her.

543
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,570
What do you mean?

544
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,880
Didn't our lab

545
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,380
do an experiment about negative emotions before?

546
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,830
When designing the experimental paradigm,

547
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,010
everyone was asked to provide

548
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,240
a moment they got hurt the most.

549
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,480
When it was Senior Xixi's turn,

550
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,250
she said that

551
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,780
the moment she got hurt the most

552
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,050
was when her ex-boyfriend told her:

553
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,610
"You're just

554
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,700
an emotionless robot."

555
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,690
Isn't that outrageous?

556
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,520
Do you know what I was like

557
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,060
when I was in a relationship?

558
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,810
I was just

559
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,070
an emotionless robot.

560
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,310
You said you understood me?

561
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,920
But why did Senior Xixi

562
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,100
tell you this?

563
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,630
How could we dare to ask?

564
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,690
Xiao Yuhe did.

565
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,870
Xiao Yuhe.

566
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,380
I have something else to do, gotta go.

567
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,700
Chengcheng.

568
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,920
You've been getting along well

569
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,820
with Senior Xiao.

570
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,840
You're so nosy.

571
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,340
Wang Lunye, cut that out.

572
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,110
Cut that out.

573
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600
What are you doing?

574
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,920
We... are being buddies.

575
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,450
Yeah... we are being buddies.

576
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,170
Right, right.

577
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,480
We are practicing Thai boxing.

578
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,010
Right, right.

579
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,280
Right, Zhu Panpan?

580
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,600
Let's show some moves.

581
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,290
Come on. Come on.

582
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,490
It hurts? Does it hurt?

583
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,120
Is it like this?

584
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,020
Yeah, just like this.

585
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,790
One more time.

586
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,760
One more time. One more time.

587
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,530
Just one more time.

588
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,950
How could I get this one wrong again?

589
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,660
I totally messed up on this exam.

590
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,900
It's already over,

591
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,040
so don't think like that.

592
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,000
Besides, aren't you going to study abroad?

593
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,350
They are going to evaluate  you by your GPA,

594
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,220
so you can make it up

595
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
by doing well

596
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,770
in other subjects.

597
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,120
Come on, let's get something to eat.

598
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:51,870
Xiaomeng.

599
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,330
Our lab

600
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,620
happens to be doing EEG experiments today,

601
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
didn't you say that

602
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,610
you were interested in that area?

603
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,870
Let me take you there to relax a bit.

604
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,530
No, thank you.

605
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,280
Chengcheng.

606
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,140
Why are you in such a hurry

607
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,280
to do EEG experiments?

608
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
Because Xiao Yuhe said

609
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,090
he wanted to take part in

610
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,140
a robot competition,

611
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,360
but Prof. Du wouldn't let him go,

612
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,739
so he agreed

613
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,800
to write a paper on EEG experiments

614
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
before he goes.

615
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,870
Robot competition?

616
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,440
Count me out.

617
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,030
I'm going straight to self-study later.

618
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,139
I'm going with her then.

619
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,239
You two go ahead.

620
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,090
Ying, help me look at this.

621
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,409
Let's go.

622
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,770
You've got something on your mind.

623
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,750
Let's go.

624
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,449
Let's me get this straight.

625
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,370
You mean that Xiao Yuhe and Wang Lunye

626
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,560
used to bump heads,

627
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,170
but they suddenly got along this morning?

628
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,450
It seems that they weren't exactly getting along,

629
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,580
it's like...

630
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,840
I can't put it in words.

631
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,760
It's like

632
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,040
they're hiding something from me.

633
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,740
Do you understand what I mean?

634
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,430
Congratulations, Chengcheng.

635
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,890
Congratulations for what?

636
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,650
According to TV series,

637
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,330
when the male lead and the female lead

638
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,560
are about to get together,

639
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,330
the second male lead will try to take away the female lead.

640
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,360
At that moment,

641
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
those two men will fight for the female lead's favor

642
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,340
without wanting her to find out.

643
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,620
So that means

644
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,910
Wang Lunye and Xiao Yuhe

645
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,370
both have a crush on you, Chengcheng.

646
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,440
You are so lucky

647
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,120
in love.

648
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,920
Share some of your luck with me.

649
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,200
Li Meizi.

650
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,200
How nice.

651
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,670
Do all the men

652
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,780
in your world

653
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,790
have a crush on me?

654
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,230
Have you ever been right

655
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,810
in any of your analyses?

656
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
I don't believe

657
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,410
your nonsense anymore.

658
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,350
It's depicted like this in all idol dramas.

659
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
Idol dramas can only be idol dramas.

660
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,910
I'll use your card for a bit.

661
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,780
Wang Lunye.

662
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,950
Do you have a crush on me?

663
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,400
I...

664
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,840
I do,

665
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,870
but could you

666
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,290
turn on your phone first?

667
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,530
Then turn on the selfie camera.

668
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,170
Take a look.

669
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,170
How could I have a crush on you?

670
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,790
You hag.

671
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,950
Do you want to die?

672
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:49,700
Miss Chengcheng, Miss Chengcheng.

673
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,550
I'll kick you to death.

674
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,480
Idol dramas can only be idol dramas.

675
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,630
Miss Chengcheng,

676
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,780
Miss Chengcheng, wait for me.

677
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,170
Go away.

678
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,750
Don't be mad.

679
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,160
I heard that

680
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,490
you did experiments with Xiao Yuhe today.

681
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,430
Why do you bring him up?

682
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,840
No, no.

683
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,670
I just

684
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,970
want to discuss some

685
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,750
academic topics with him.

686
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,090
Really.

687
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,440
I just got back to school,

688
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,560
so I thought I should know about

689
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,580
my lab.

690
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,490
Then there comes Xiao Yuhe.

691
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,940
More or less, I could know something about him.

692
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,010
Did you remember

693
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,520
a classmate of ours from elementary school

694
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,060
named Zhu Panpan?

695
00:37:59,440 --> 00:37:59,830
What's wrong?

696
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,650
No, I don't.

697
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,440
But hearing that name,

698
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,440
