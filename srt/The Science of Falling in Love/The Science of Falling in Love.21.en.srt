4
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,050
Prof. Du.

5
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,840
Chengcheng was so amazing that

6
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,710
she attracted the attention of those juniors

7
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,729
with a few photos of

8
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,120
the experimental group buildings

9
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,950
and equipment.

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,770
Not at all.

11
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,150
I just hit the point.

12
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,820
What’s more,

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,060
our newly completed experimental group buildings

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,480
are so awesome.

15
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,110
Of course I have to

16
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,030
show them off.

17
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,480
The key point is that

18
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,680
I use the air conditioner

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,620
in our school dormitory

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,710
to lure them.

21
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,430
Prof. Du.

22
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,080
Isn't the communication time

23
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,030
arranged by Foreign Language High School

24
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,800
at eleven o'clock?

25
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,060
Why haven't they arrived yet?

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,690
That's right, Prof. Du.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,300
And

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,510
there are less people from Mingjiang University there.

29
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,890
No way.

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,829
We haven't seen

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,870
a single one of them

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,610
so far.

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:36,950
Right.

34
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,710
How could they have set off

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,329
an hour ago?

36
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,120
If so,

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,770
they must have arrived by now.

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,180
What are you doing?

39
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,720
Why are you still

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,990
trying to look cool at this moment?

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,420
Tell them all about

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,540
our superiority.

43
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,160
Recruit all these top students

44
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
to Mingjiang University.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,820
Okay?

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,390
Okay.

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,440
Hurry up. Come on.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,410
Get on the bus.

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,870
Come on.

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,670
Prof. Hu.

51
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,820
Explain clearly

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Mingjiang University's Enrollment Guide

53
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,980
to them.

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,650
Prof. Wang.

55
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,260
I really didn't expect you

56
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,060
to do like this.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,230
We have agreed

58
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,590
before that

59
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,280
today's enrollment session

60
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,760
should be open and fair.

61
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,200
The most important thing is that

62
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,830
we can't take

63
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,550
the students away

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,829
for private communication.

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,550
Look at

66
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,579
what you are doing now.

67
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,430
This is totally against the rules.

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,030
Prof. Du.

69
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,340
No worries.

70
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,610
Of course I am worried.

71
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,810
We agreed

72
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,550
with the principal that

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,500
we would never take the kids

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,420
away from the session

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,170
for private communication.

76
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,410
But look.

77
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,579
Now they are all in front of the hotel,

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,840
not going anywhere.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,680
How could this be called private communication?

80
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,190
Prof. Wang.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,350
We scholars

82
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,490
should stop

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,250
playing on words,

84
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,790
okay?

85
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,820
It’s a competition.

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,190
I have no choice.

87
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,690
I'll treat you to dinner

88
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,470
when we get back to school.

89
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,640
I’m busy now.

90
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,570
Excuse me.

91
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,860
Everyone.

92
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,460
Mingjiang University is way too arrogant.

93
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,260
It’s clearly a war for talent.

94
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,090
Right.

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,910
If they got all of them...

96
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,500
Prof. Du, look.

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
We have to stop him

98
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,640
and bring them back.

99
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,680
-Prof. Du.
-If you got all of them,

100
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,080
what else can we do?

101
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,590
Everyone, easy.

102
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,670
The kids are all here.

103
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,990
After our communication is over,

104
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,950
you can go ahead,

105
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,560
right?

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,060
It’s all the same.

107
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,500
If we communicate with them

108
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,190
after your communication is over,

109
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,230
the gap would be huge.

110
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,560
What are you doing?

111
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,190
Why haven’t you left?

112
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,880
Why does the bus stop here?

113
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,920
Hello.

114
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,000
I am from the admissions team of Mingjiang University.

115
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,540
I am here to communicate

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,570
with the students in advance.

117
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,930
We’ll leave soon.

118
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,310
No matter what you do,

119
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,480
disorderly parking is prohibited here.

120
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,190
You have disrupted our work order

121
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,550
by parking the bus here.

122
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,510
Drive the bus away now.

123
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,530
Sir.

124
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,420
Don’t worry.

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
Prof. Wang

126
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,980
is a model for others.

127
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,460
He will certainly not trouble you.

128
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,659
Move the bus.

129
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Prof. Wang, set an example.

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,909
Okay?

131
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,040
Move the bus.

132
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,030
Move the bus, Prof. Wang.

133
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,040
Move the bus, sir.

134
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,060
Sir.

135
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,710
What are you doing?

136
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,870
The security said that...

137
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,310
What are you doing?

138
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,030
Are you grabbing people?

139
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,730
Don’t move.

140
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,510
Prof. Du. Prof. Du.

141
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,700
What are you doing?

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,040
I didn't do anything to you.

143
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,510
You are blackmailing me.

144
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,740
I didn’t do anything.

145
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,030
Everyone saw that

146
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,970
I didn't touch him.

147
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,590
You are so unreasonable.

148
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,110
I didn’t do anything.

149
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,470
Move the bus.

150
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,780
How can you be like this?

151
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,110
Look at Prof. Du.

152
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,270
Come on.

153
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,750
I didn’t do anything.

154
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,190
Aren't they Zhang Yichi and Wang Bingrui

155
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,350
whom Du Zhuanjia

156
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,720
told us to fight for?

157
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,070
Why didn't they come to us

158
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,890
and just left?

159
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,060
Excuse me.

160
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,470
Hello.

161
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,300
We are from the admissions team

162
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,550
of Southeast University of Science and Technology.

163
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,510
My name is Su Chengcheng.

164
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,220
Shall we

165
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,090
have a talk?

166
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,790
Sorry.

167
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm not interested in you.

168
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,610
Hi, please take a seat.

169
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,650
What are you laughing at?

170
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,780
I am not.

171
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,830
All talents are like that.

172
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,320
Let’s go.

173
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,990
I talked with Hu Zeyu

174
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,360
in the evening.

175
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,510
He is quite interested

176
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,560
in our school.

177
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,710
Now only Zhang Yichi and Wang Bingrui

178
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,980
are left.

179
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,590
Zhang Yichi and Wang Bingrui

180
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,380
are together.

181
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,360
Just get Zhang Yichi done.

182
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,160
What’s going on?

183
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,640
Before I came here, I really didn't expect

184
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,190
the enrollment to be so intense.

185
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,710
I used to think that

186
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,280
Southeast University of Science and Technology and Mingjiang University

187
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,460
were cold

188
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,140
and arrogant.

189
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,830
I didn't expect them

190
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,540
to be so enthusiastic

191
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,640
and indomitable

192
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,590
in front of straight A students.

193
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,050
That is, people like you.

194
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,870
Why are you laughing?

195
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,820
You are so cute.

196
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,670
I am talking serious.

197
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,070
What to do?

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,840
I think we have reached an impasse

199
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,210
with Mingjiang University.

200
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,550
In fact, everyone knows that

201
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,660
it has no

202
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,070
practical significance,

203
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,390
but no one wants to stop first.

204
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,800
I think Yang Tiantian

205
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,970
is quite suitable for our school.

206
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,480
Tell me what do you want to eat.

207
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,530
I want you to cook for me.

208
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,710
Okay, I'm going to buy ingredients.

209
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,030
What?

210
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,590
You bought them all?

211
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,430
I do have foresight.

212
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,480
Cool.

213
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,780
There are also my favorite carrots.

214
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Takeaway.

215
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,850
Did you order takeaway?

216
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,880
No.

217
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,590
Who’s that?

218
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Hello.

219
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,040
Wang Lunye?

220
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,450
Why are you here?

221
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,789
I came to eat.

222
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,340
Last time I heard Zhu Jiafa say that

223
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,850
Xiao Yuhe is good at cooking.

224
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,360
You didn't ask me to go to team building,

225
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,230
but only called me for physical work.

226
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,910
Seriously.

227
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,840
Why did you go back to Jinjiang

228
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,720
instead of staying at school?

229
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,350
Now that you are here,

230
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,140
why can’t I be here?

231
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,910
Come on.

232
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,980
I am at least

233
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,070
an influential man

234
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,990
in the eyes of others.

235
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,790
And it was the head of our department

236
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,080
who personally sent me

237
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,840
to be a role model

238
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
for the college

239
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,660
and the juniors.

240
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,960
I’m just eating something of you.

241
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,060
Don’t be so mean.

242
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,070
I didn’t eat for nothing.

243
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,230
Is it the one in the Children's Palace?

244
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,900
Of course.

245
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,960
I waited in line for half an hour to buy it.

246
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,950
What about four-fruit soup?

247
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,610
I didn’t buy it.

248
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,070
This of course

249
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,930
has to go with

250
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,700
the four-fruit soup.

251
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,390
You...

252
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,700
I’m going to buy it.

253
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,910
It’s delicious.

254
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,540
Wait for me.

255
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,880
Well done.

256
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,760
Lunye.

257
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,870
What are you doing here?

258
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,290
If there is nothing special,

259
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,340
after eating,

260
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,560
I will get you a taxi to send you back.

261
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,250
I came to see how Su Chengcheng was doing.

262
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,390
I'm worried she has nowhere to go.

263
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,450
Do you think I am here for you?

264
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,280
I am relieved

265
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,120
to see that she’s fine.

266
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,230
In fact, after Su Chengcheng's

267
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,170
parents divorced,

268
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,740
she has not been doing well.

269
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,670
You know that

270
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,190
she doesn't want others

271
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,090
to see another side of her.

272
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,210
So every time

273
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,660
I'm with her,

274
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,560
she's always

275
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,230
happy

276
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,570
and smiling.

277
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,680
Actually,

278
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,790
I hated you at first.

279
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,950
I don't care if you are Zhu Panpan

280
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,410
or Xiao Yuhe.

281
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,060
I really hated you

282
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,910
because both of them

283
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,300
made her upset

284
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,590
and sad.

285
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,920
But I'm not her boyfriend

286
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,950
after all.

287
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm just

288
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,570
her friend,

289
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,270
her childhood friend,

290
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,320
and her family.

291
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,690
I can only keep her company for a while,

292
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,460
not for a lifetime.

293
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,790
So

294
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,780
from now on,

295
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,270
Chengcheng will be left to you.

296
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,210
I hope you can

297
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,050
understand her better.

298
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,620
Just because she doesn't say it

299
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,810
doesn't mean she doesn't care.

300
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,830
I am back.

301
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,310
Come on.

302
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,180
Come on.

303
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,990
Cheers.

304
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,420
What?

305
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,600
-What?
-What’s up?

306
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,550
What?

307
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,870
What?

308
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
What did you say about me just now?

309
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,120
It’s a secret between men.

310
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,870
You must have spoken ill of me.

311
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,210
No, just the reverse.

312
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,150
Let’s eat.

313
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,620
It’s so dark.

314
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,630
What about I

315
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,740
make it through tonight...?

316
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,510
There is no room for you.

317
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,060
No room...

318
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,390
I have a stomachache.

319
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,950
I think I have a stomach bug.

320
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,670
I will take some medicine.

321
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,190
My medicines are all expired.

322
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,380
All expired?

323
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,110
Well...

324
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,350
It’s being later. How about

325
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,080
I stay at your house

326
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,030
for one night?

327
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,100
I got a taxi for you

328
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,390
when I went downstairs.

329
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,310
Just three minutes.

330
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,590
Wait three minutes.

331
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,390
He’ll be here soon.

332
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,710
Go home alone.

333
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,970
Also, well...

334
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,480
You know that

335
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,270
Chengcheng doesn’t dare

336
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,990
to stay alone.

337
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,900
I have to go upstairs to be with her.

338
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,770
The oyster omelet you brought

339
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,630
is delicious.

340
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,430
Really delicious.

341
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,950
All right then.

342
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,770
I’m going upstairs.

343
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,030
You are so considerate.

344
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:04,880
Of course.

345
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,270
Well.

346
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,150
Maybe I'll just stay here tonight.

347
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,530
What about...?

348
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,580
you are back.

349
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,550
What did you say

350
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,120
to Wang Lunye just now?

351
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,190
You would never speak well of me.

352
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,400
Xiao Yuhe, the power is off.

353
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,090
Xiao Yuhe.

354
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,920
Xiao Yuhe.

355
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,080
Xiao Yuhe, the power is off.

356
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,740
Xiao Yuhe.

357
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,130
Xiao Yuhe, where are you?

358
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,930
Xiao Yuhe.

359
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,120
Xiao Yuhe.

360
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,680
Su Chengcheng.

361
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,360
The power is off.

362
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,340
I turned off the lights.

363
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,150
Do you remember the power outage

364
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,310
at your house when we were kids?

365
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,310
I made

366
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,310
a toy flashlight for you.

367
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,300
But that wasn't bright enough.

368
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,620
Then I made this.

369
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,950
Take it with you in the future,

370
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,020
and it will illuminate

371
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,970
all the darkness you are afraid of.

372
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,880
♫No matter how far we go♫

373
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,110
I left later on.

374
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,590
So I had no chance to give it to you.

375

♫We always end up right here♫

376
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,870

Get up.

What’s wrong with you?

431
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,440

Step aside.

438
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,630
Don’t get in my way.

439
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,790
I need to get this done quickly.

440
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,810
The intermediary will come in a while.

441
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,440
What is an intermediary coming?

442
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,250
He  is coming to see the house.

443
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,900
If they like

444
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,870
our house,

445
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,650
let's sell the house

446
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,840
while you're home.

447
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,310
Wait, why didn't you tell me in advance

448
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,190
about such a big deal

449
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,460
as selling the house?

450
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,220
It’s my own house.

451
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,700
Why should I tell you?

452
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,160
Besides, no one is living here.

453
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,690
The older the house, the less valuable it is.

454
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,980
I will be relieved after selling it.

455
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
Wait, I...

456
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,230
Aunt, well...

457
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,810
Selling a house is a big deal.

458
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,350
Why don't you sit down

459
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,340
and have a good chat?

460
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,910
Who are you?

461
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
I am...

462
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,600
Yuhe

463
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,480

464
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,340
good-looking girlfriend.

465
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,430
Hello, aunt.

466
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,830
But as a girl,

467
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,560
you living in a boy's house

468
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,140
will have a bad influence.

469
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,510
Others will laugh at you.

470
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,100
Do you know

471
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,120
where the door is?

472
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,410
I'll wait for you at the cold drink shop downstairs.

473
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,420
You two have a good chat.

474
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,380
I will go looking for you in a while.

475
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,330
Calm down.

476
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,190
Have a good chat.

477
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,350
Go.

478
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,030
Goodbye, aunt.

479
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,290
Be careful. The ground is slippery.

480
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,230
Why didn't you tell me

481
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,990
when you returned to Jinjiang?

482
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,190
I told you to go home and you refused.

483
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,760
Instead, you traveled all the way to live here.

484
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
What do you mean?

485
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,150
Mom, why are you selling the house?

486
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,910
Is it because I went back to Jinjiang

487
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,040
that you have to sell the house?

488
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,540
Shall we talk?

489
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,990
Aren’t we talking?

490
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,900
Shall we have a good chat?

491
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,030
I am talking nicely with you.

492
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,030
I can sell my house

493
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,660
if I want to.

494
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,640
Do I need your consent?

495
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,550
Just get to the point.

496
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,160
You've been thinking about the person

497
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,160
who only gave you your life

498
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,260
but never cared about you

499
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,110
or raised you,

500
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,590
haven't you?

501
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,730
Over the years,

502
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,920
I have moved

503
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,930
and changed cities for you.

504
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,200
I have worked so hard

505
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,370
for so many years

506
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,560
to raise you

507
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,460
[Certificate of Honors]

508
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,640
into an excellent person.

509
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,280
Why should I do this?

510
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,020
Does it make any sense?

511
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,640
Have you ever thought about me?

512
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,950
You never considered

513
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,830
my feelings.

514
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,830
You only think about that person.

515
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,340
Always that person.

516
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,330
These are useless.

517
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,760
All useless.

518
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,510
All useless.

519
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,240
Go ahead.

520
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,230
They are useless.

521
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,590
What did you say?

522
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,980
What did you say?

523
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,550
Say that again.

524
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,490
I said that

525
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,410
they are useless.

526
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,270
I don't know

527
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,110
why you always measured me

528
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,230
and how well you've raised me

529
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,850
by the level of usefulness

530
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,790
for so many years.

531
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,420
Am I just a tool

532
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,590
in your eyes?

533
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,430
If I did a good job in the exam, you were happy.

534
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,270
But if not,

535
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,420
you hit and scolded me.

536
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,390
I am only useful

537
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,500
when I have

538
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,870
received certificates

539
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,080
and trophies

540
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,750
and fulfilled

541
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,080
all your needs.

542
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,220
I can't write with my left hand.

543
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,340
I can't make a mistake.

544
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,870
I can't even

545
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,960
be afraid of the sound

546
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,120
of a balloon exploding.

547
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,060
Because that is a sign

548
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,610
of weakness, incompetence

549
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,980
and uselessness in your eyes.

550
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,470
Mom.

551
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,550
I know you don't want to hear this.

552
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,470
But after all these years,

553
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,800
I want to speak it out.

554
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,510
Mom.

555
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,830
I know you were unreconciled

556
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,750
after you divorced my dad.

557
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
But I don't know why

558
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,710
you always use me

559
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,770
to prove yourself.

560
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,640
Am I just a tool

561
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,680
for you to take revenge on my dad

562
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,890
and demonstrate against him?

563
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,040
I know it's not easy

564
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,840
for you to bring me up.

565
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,350
But sometimes I do wonder

566
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,850
if you really love me.

567
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,760
I never thought of leaving you,

568
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,400
let alone abandoning you

569
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,120
like my dad.

570
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,800
But for so many years,

571
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,090
you are never willing to let yourself go,

572
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,170
nor let me go.

573
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,570
I'm tired.

574
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,200
Mom.

575
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,650
I'm really tired.

576
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,710
When will you

577
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,220
consider my feelings?

578
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,940
These are the things

579
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,970
you want

580
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,100
over the years.

581
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,540
Have you ever asked me

582
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,450
if they were what I wanted?

583
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,020
I don't know

584
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,130
if you still remember this photo.

585
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,830
You haven't smiled

586
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,320
like this for years.

587
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,180
This is my mother

588
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,180
in my heart.

589
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,460
Son.

590
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,780
Sorry.

591
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,510
Son.

592
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,520
Son, don’t leave.

593
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,050
Let’s go.

594
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,180
I can smile.

595
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,650
I can smile.

596
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,090
I can smile.

597
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,030
I can smile.

598
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,290
Just say it when you're sad.

599
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,480
What a strong sense of powerlessness.

600
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,620
I’ve studied for so many years.

601
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,190
I can solve

602
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,260
so many problems in the lab.

603
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,710
But I can't solve

604
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,690
my family’s problem.

605
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,210
Have you discussed with your mom?

606
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,460
We can't talk.

607
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,370
We don’t know how to talk with each other.

608
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,420
This...

609
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,600
It doesn’t seem to be spicy.

610
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,730
Where have you been?

611
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,090
Look.

612
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,110
I’ve waited for you for fifteen minutes.

613
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,230
You can do many questions

614
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,370
during this time.

615
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,540
You know what to do?

616
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,570
That’s enough.

617
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,610
-He’s just a kid.
-It’s OK.

618
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,780
He’s little.

619
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,950
I have to punish him

620
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,150
when he’s a kid.

621
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,240
Or he wouldn’t learn a lesson.

622
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,450
Persuade her.

623
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,480
You are a boy.

624
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,200
You accidentally fell

625
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,470
while walking.

626
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,480
Why are you crying?

627
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,990
It’s you who made yourself fall.

628
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,850
You have only yourself to blame.

629
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,870
Are you a man?

630
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,910
What did I tell you?

631
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,750
You are always crying!

632
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,010
Always crying!

633
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,030
Pick them up.

634
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,230
Pick them up!

635
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,710
I told you to

636
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,280
put these books

637
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,550
in your school bag, right?

638
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,730
I said it.

639
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,060
And you didn’t pack book cover.

640
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,409
Look at your clothes.

641
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,679
It's full of dirt.

642
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,730
I am so busy every day

643
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,639
and I still have to wash your clothes.

644
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,700
Aren't you ashamed to cry?

645
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,270
Why are you crying?

646
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,050
Complete two papers.

647
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,170
No meal.

648
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,290
Take them.

649
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,590
Take them.

650
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,330
Let’s go home.

651
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,070
I'll take you somewhere.

652
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,150
I haven't been here for many years.

653
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,590
How could he be afraid of

654
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,700
the sound of the balloon exploding?

655
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,080
What a coward.

656
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,680
I will beat anyone

657
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,630
who bullies Zhu Panpan again.

658
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,300
Wait.

659
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,220
Get the balloon back.

660
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,750
[End of episode 21]
