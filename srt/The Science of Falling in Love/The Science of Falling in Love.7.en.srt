What a busy day.

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,840
Everyone,

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
listen to me.

7
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,310
I have something to tell you.

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,450
As you know,

9
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,650
our lab has been cooperating

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,160
with the First Affiliated Hospital

Tomorrow

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,890
we will conduct a double check

16
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,390
on a patient.

17
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,510
I personally think that

18
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,070
for many members

19
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,010
in our lab,

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
this is a very good opportunity

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,460
to learn and understand.

22
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,430
So in principle,

23
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,990
it is best not to ask for leave.

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,250

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,360

shall we?

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,180

The recovery of the patient

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
goes well,

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
and there is basically no rejection.

38
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,460
That’s good.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,680
That’s good.

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,810
Today we are here

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,970
mainly to review

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,820
the patient's recovery.

43

In addition, several media

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,660
have been inviting interviews.

45
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,780
Ms. Chen, to be honest,

46
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,210
I am a little nervous today,

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
because all the exoskeletons

48
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,630

49
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,820
have to be controlled

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,530
by his own brain nerves.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,710
Hope everything goes well.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Take it easy.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,730
-Please.
- Please.

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:35,870
Please.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,720
Okay.

57
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,490
Step one, motor imagery.

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,770
Grandpa.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,480
Visualize in your mind

60
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,650
which leg to take first

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,760
and how to get to

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
the edge of the table.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,490
Very good.

64

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,100

70
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,870
Right.

71
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,600
No worries.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,750
Take it easy. Slow down.

73
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,790
No worries. Slow down.

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,540
Great.

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,150
Record it.

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,900
I’ve had it, grandpa.

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,710
Record additional actions.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,370
I have something to say.

79

All of you can see that

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,830
today's result

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,070
is a success

82

and everyone is happy about it.

83
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,250
But

84
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,610
I don't want to talk about that.

85
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,300
Instead, what I want to say

86
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,510
is the hardships in the process.

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,500
This patient

88
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,750
had completely

89
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,460
lost his motor skills

90
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,380
due to a stroke last year.

91
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,040
It put a lot of pressure

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,400
on him psychologically.

93
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,540
Not to mention

94
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,470
cooperating with the experiment,

95
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,800
he even rejected

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
the most basic communication

97
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,440
with others.

98
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,580
But as you can see today,

99
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,120
his mood

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,190
has changed dramatically

101
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,240
since being fitted

102
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,620
with our exoskeleton.

103
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,880
He also had

104
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,370
a humorous interaction

105
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,950
with Xiao Yuhe today.

106
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,420
Right?

107
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,120
That’s all.

108
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,400
Let’s invite Xiao Yuhe,

109
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,410
the technical backbone,

110
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
to introduce you

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,190
the technical details.

112
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,650
Okay?

113
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,210
In fact,

114
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,990
as you can see,

115
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,930
although grandpa hasn’t fully recovered,

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,960
he can control the exoskeleton

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,010
to do some simple body movements

118
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,630
through nerve signals.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
Drinking soy milk and eating fried dough sticks

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,200
is no problem for him.

121
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,770
For paralyzed patients,

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,520
this is something

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,990
that is unimaginable.

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,820
Senior Xiao is so great.

125
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,300
Alright.

126
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,530
Your turn.

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,360
The biggest technical difficulty

128
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,659
we encountered in this project

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
was to correlate neuronal activity patterns

130
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,760
with motor intentions

131
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
to form specific trigger signals.

132
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,070
The process of

133
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,310
controlling the required exoskeleton

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,890
according to the signal requires the patient

135
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,470
to carry out certain training in the early stage.

136
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,030
Yes, because of this,

137
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,180
we continued to optimize it,

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,180
and finally developed

139
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,800
a brain-like artificial intelligence decoder.

140
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,540
Through virtual reality training,

141
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
it has achieved

142
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,159
more accurate manipulation.

143
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,460
That's why grandpa

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,010
can operate so freely today.

145
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,570
Right.

146
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,150
At present, the number of paralyzed people

147
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,370
caused by stroke,

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,810
brain and spinal cord injury in the world

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
has reached nearly 100 million people.

150
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,490
There are 20 to 30 million

151
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,360
in our country,

152
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,520
and the data is still rising.

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,330
In the future,

154
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,730
our system and equipment

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,400
will be further

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,070
iterated and updated

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,210
to solve more

158
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,160
clinical problems,

159
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,370
help patients

160
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,190
rebuild their behavioral

161
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
and language functions,

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,040
and improve their quality of life.

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
As an extension of human senses,

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,170
the value of science

165
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,720
is to give those who need it

166
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,460
a promise that

167
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,730
they can

168
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,890
live a better life.

169
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,559
I didn't expect our major

170
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,159
to be so amazing.

171
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,530
Of course.

172
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,350
Although our major is difficult,

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,870
it is of great use.

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
That’s why Xiao

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,650
is usually so strict with us.

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Next time I will take you

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
to see those kids with autism.

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,730
They also adopted

There are also nice places.

355
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,010
Right?

356
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,200
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

357
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:48,610
Go.

358
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,300
Let’s go.

359
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,960
He can wear these shoes

360
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,520
during sports

361
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,440
or leisure.

362
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,080
Quite versatile.

363
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,860
So nice.

364
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,010
It’s really nice.

365
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,220
Good.

366
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,160
Stand up and walk around

367
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,860
to see if it’s comfortable.

368
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,530
It's really pretty,

369
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,570
and it matches your outfit very well.

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,660
Hello.

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,900
We want both pairs of shoes

372
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,570
we tried on.

373
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,970
Aunt, I have enough shoes.

374
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,720
You don’t need to buy for me.

375
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,640
Chengcheng.

376
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,010
Your dad

377
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,080
likes to keep everything

378
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,300
in his heart.

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,660
Although he doesn't often contact you,

380
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,000
he always

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,310
misses you

382
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,440
and often talks about you.

383
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,620
Try to understand him,

384
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,480
and don't blame him.

385
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,620
Aunt, I see.

386
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,440
I will keep in touch with my dad more often.

387
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,890
Good girl.

388
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,990
Nice.

389
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,840
And this.

390
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,890
Beef with cilantro.

391
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:15,900
Okay.

392
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,150
- That’s it. - Okay.

393
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,810
Are you done picking?

394
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Have you ordered food?

395
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,290
Yes.

396
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
All your favorite.

397
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
Chengcheng, what a coincidence.

398
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,810
Senior Jiafa.

399
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
Dad, let me introduce.

400
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
This is Zhu Jiafa,

401
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,890
a doctoral senior in our laboratory.

402
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,600
Hello, uncle.

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,830
-Hello.
-These are my families.

404
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,750
Hello, aunt.

405
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,010
- Hello.
- Aunt looks so young.

406
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,790
If you didn't tell me,

407
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,090
I'd think she’s your sister.

408
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,450
What a coincidence.

409
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,540
Dad, these are the seniors

410
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,650
of my laboratory.

411
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,130
This is Xiao Yuhe.

412
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,480
This is Liu Dongmao.

413
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,260
Hello, uncle.

414
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,670
The demands on our laboratory are high.

415
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,440
I certainly wouldn't be able to stay

416
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,080
without them

417
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,990
taking care of me.

418
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,320
Not at all.

419
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,560
Let me invite you to lunch.

420
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
No need, uncle.

421
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,350
That table is almost cleared.

422
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:00,920
Maybe next time.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,620
Bye, uncle.

424
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,330
Bye, uncle.

425
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,660
Here.

426
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,090
Chengcheng's favorite dish,

427
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,890
beef with cilantro.

428
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,030
Chengcheng.

429
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,820
I remember you don't eat cilantro.

430
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,950
Right.

431
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,210
It is your younger brother
who likes cilantro best.

432
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,150
Look at me.

433
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,870
Come on.

434
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,360
Here, chopsticks.

435
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,950
Chengcheng.

436
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,440
Sorry.

437
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,310
Nothing.

438
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,510
Let’s eat.

439
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,700
So delicious.

440
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,650
The meat looks good.

441
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,730
Here.

442
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,880
Thank you.

443
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,550
Dongmao.

444
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,870
Your plate.

445
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,750
[Xiao Junlan]

446
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,920
Hello, more seasoning.

447
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Your seasoning, please.

448
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,260
Thank you.

449
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,160
You are welcome.

450
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,910
In the past few years,

451
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,270
Dr. Zhang from the School of Computer Science

452
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,610
and the three of us came here together during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

453
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,420
Look.

454
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,120
Since he had a girlfriend,

455
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,970
let alone the Mid-Autumn Festival,

456
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,240
we haven't seen him in any festival.

457
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,710
By the way, Yuhe.

458
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,780
Aren’t you a local?

459
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,970
Why do you seldom

460
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,880
go home?

461
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,760
It’s Mid-Autumn Festival today.

462
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,610
My parents separated

463
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,830
when I was a kid.

464
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,370
I don't like festivals,

465
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,720
so I don't often come back.

466
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,250
I understand.

467
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,970
But it’s after all the Mid-Autumn Festival,

468
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,620
you have to be with your family,

469
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,090
right?

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,140
And you can talk everything

471
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,390
with your family.

472
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,880
Right.

473
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,550
How about we have something to drink?

474
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,200
Sure.

475
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,820
To celebrate the festival.

476
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,530
What do you want?

477
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,770
Mineral water.

478
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,900
The same to me.

479
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,670
Waiter.

480
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,160
Two mineral water

481
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,680
and one iced Coke.

482
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,130
A signature durian mango flavour.

483
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,000
Okay.

484
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,560
And a Mango Sago.

485
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,230
Okay.

486
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,140
What do you want?

487
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,220
Your brother is cute, isn’t he?

488
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,130
How are you at school?

489
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,460
Good.

490
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,730
Are you short of money?

491
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,900
Not at all.

492
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,720
By the way,

493
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
are you graduating from college next year?

494
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,050
I'm just a sophomore this year, dad.

495
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,230
What's wrong with me today?

496
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,170
Take it to buy something you like.

497
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,640
Now no one gives cash.

498
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,290
All transfers are made online.

499
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,850
Your aunt

500
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,580
will check my transfer records.

501
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,950
I'm sorry for you.

502
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,440
Grandpa Liu.

503
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,840
Yuhe is back.

504
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,750
Grandpa Huang.

505
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,130
Yuhe, long time no see.

506
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,770
Go ahead.

507
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,890
Sure.

508
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,320
Let’s continue.

509
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
Look at you.

510
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,100
Granny Guan.

511
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,950
Yuhe is back.

512
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,870
You are getting more and more handsome.

513
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,150
You finally learned it,

514
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
but why did you forget everything

515
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,380
in the exam today?

516
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,890
Yuhe is back.

517
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,270
Aunt.

518
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,840
Can't you

519
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,320
learn more from Yuhe?

520
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,860
When Yuhe was young,

521
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,630
his mother never worried about him.

522
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:29,910
It’s okay.

523
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,240
Step by step.

524
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,400
Mom, I’m back.

525
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,580
You are back.

526
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,120
The meal is almost ready.

527
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,080
I am preparing a soup.

528
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
I will go back to my room.

529
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,060
I made chicken soup for you.

530
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,180
I didn't put any salt in it.

531
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,090
But I think

532
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,240
it is a bit fishy without salt.

533
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,570
Let me add some soup.

534
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,210
I don't like chicken soup with salt.

535
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,120
I know.

536
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,570
But it’s fishy

537
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,370
without salt.

538
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,420
Add some.

539
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,300
Try this.

540
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,250
Mom, where is

541
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,180
our family photo?

542
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,810
I felt that

543
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,010
some of the furnishings in our house

544
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,580
were quite old,

545
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,050
and they would be a nuisance,

546
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,330
so I

547
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,010
threw them all away.

548
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,750
Indeed.

549
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,570
But I don't feel like

550
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,890
a photo is a nuisance.

551
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,060
And

552
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,990
you shouldn't deal with my items

553
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,470
without my permission.

554
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,080
Eat first.

555
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,420
Let’s talk after the meal.

556
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,100
I’ve had enough, mom.

557
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,800
Tell me

558
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,810
where did you throw it.

559
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,270
What do you mean?

560
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
Are you trying to get it back?

561
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,110
You care so much about your dad,

562
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,530
but he left you at home

563
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
and went abroad by himself.

564
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,990
Think about it.

565
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,210
I have been busy

566
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,210
working for you

567
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,040
since you were a child,

568
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,330
raising you up.

569
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,650
Have you

570
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,560
considered my feelings

571
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:43,680
during the years

572
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,620
when that photo

573
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,480
was kept at home?

574
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,350
I have something to do in the lab.

575
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,040
I’m leaving.

576
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,550
Mom, what you threw away

577
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,060
was a photo of our family,

578
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,710
not just that of my dad.

579
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:00,980
Chengcheng.

580
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,810
Don’t you need me to send you back?

581
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,370
No need, dad.

582
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,900
It is very convenient to take a taxi here,

583
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
and it is not far from the school.

584
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,240
You can get on the expressway

585
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,880
directly from here.

586
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,470
Very convenient.

587
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,070
I see.

588
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,580
Take it, Chengcheng.

589
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,690
Let’s not be like this.

590
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,890
I’m really not short of money.

591
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,910
Look, aunt bought me

592
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,040
a lot of things already.

593
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,410
That's enough for me.

594
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,730
You don't have to be so embarrassed

595
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,440
because of me.

596
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,080
Your brother is coming.

597
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,080
Here you are.

598
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,320
Chengcheng.

599
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,220
You should have a few days left

600
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,340
on your vacation.

601
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,690
Don't you want to hang out with us?

602
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,360
It's boring

603
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,210
to be alone in school.

604
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,900
I’m not going, aunt.

605
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,290
I...

606
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,130
Anything in school?

607
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,260
I haven’t

608
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,640
finished my homework.

609
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,370
So I want to catch up

610
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,420
during the holidays.

611
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,920
Alright.

612
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,980
That’s fine.

613
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,960
Come home next time you have a holiday.

614
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,030
I'll cook something delicious for you.

615
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,530
Okay.

616
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,920
Say goodbye to your sister.

617
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,010
Bye.

618
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,850
Get in the car.

619
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,260
Keep in touch.

620
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,949
Take a seat.

621
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,639
The bus is dangling and dangerous.

622
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,449
You will fall down.

623
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,210
-No.
-Stand firm.

624
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,260
Take a seat.

625
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,420
So naughty.

626
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,790
I want to eat McDonald's tonight.

627
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,820
McDonald's again?

628
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,570
You are so fat!

629
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,210
Look at you.

630
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,880
Am I?

631
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,060
No?

632
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,650
What a fatty.

633
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,280
You…Listen.

634
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,500
If you get ninety-five points in the English test,

635
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,020
[Dad]

636
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I will take you to McDonald's.

637
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,460
Okay, deal.

638
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,240
Deal.

639
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,660
Pinky promise.

640
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,010
You know

641
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,640
your mom well.

642
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,030
I really worry about

643
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,050
you living with her.

644
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
I have already processed your documents

645
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,190
for going abroad.

646
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,390
Think about it.

647
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,900
How about going abroad with me?

648
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,870
I have decided to stay here.

649
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,370
Alright.

650
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,040
You have grown up.

651
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,450
I understand

652
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,660
you have your own ideas.

653
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,880
If you encounter any difficulties in the future,

654
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,050
let me know anytime,

655
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,570
and I will make it back to see you.

656
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,500
Dad, don't worry about that.

657
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I’ve made

658
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,480
a good friend at school.

659
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,160
Her name is Su Chengcheng.

660
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,470
She is very nice to me.

661
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
Whenever I meet difficulties,

662
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,210
she will help me.

663
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,460
Really?

664
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,880
You kid!

665
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,080
Are you finally willing

666
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,930
to be friends with your classmates?

667
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,130
But you have to study hard.

668
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,240
I am leaving.

669
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,710
I bought you

670
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,610
a new mobile phone.

671
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,030
Remember to call me.

672
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,140
Okay.

673
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,790
Chengcheng doesn't like cilantro.

674
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,680
Dad will help you pick up

675
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,840
all the cilantro,

676
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,570
okay?

677
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,120
Okay!

678
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
Smile.

679
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,790
What are you doing?

680
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,480
Hold on.

681
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,190
I'm going to see Chengcheng.

682
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,250
It’s late. Don’t go in.

683
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,130
Look at you.

684
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,830
Why are you so drunk every day?

685
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,740
Just take a look.

686
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,900
What are you doing, Su Zhiqiang?

687
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,020
Chengcheng.

688
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,910
My good girl.

689
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,130
She looks so much like me.

690
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,930
My baby!

691
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,530
Enough.

692
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,580
Leave.

693
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,280
Get out.

694
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,150
Get out.

695
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,800
No way.

696
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,740
What else do you want?

697
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,640
I’m giving a present to my daughter.

698
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,070
Get out.

699
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,220
Her favorite.

700
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,580
Chengcheng, I love you.

701
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,330
I love you.

702
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,100
Chengcheng.

703
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,450
Enough.

704
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,010
Leave.

705
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,360
