I'm Xiao Yuhe.

She didn't answer the phone

45
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,640
or text back.

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,620
Did she text you back?

47
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,300
No.

48
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,630
I sent her many messages.

49
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,540
But she didn’t reply any.

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,630
Let's go out and find her.

51
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay, let’s go.

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,770
Let’s go.

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
You are finally back.

54
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,170
Where have you been?

55
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,060
Are you okay?

56
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,159
What happened?

57
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,980
Just now Ying

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,760
called the counselor.

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Didn't Xiao Yuhe

60
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,300
explain clearly about

61
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,510
being reported for cheating?

62
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,570
Why are you looking like this?

63
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,320
If Xiao Yuhe

64
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,330
didn't explain clearly,

65
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,580
we'll explain it for you later.

66
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,600
No worries.

67
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,460
Chengcheng, why are you giggling?

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200
A new necklace?

69
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,240
Kind of out of fashion.

70
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,780
No way!

71
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,570
Are you...

72
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,180
Are you together?

73
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,270
You confirmed the relationship?

74
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,750
Lovers?

75
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,480
Nothing would

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
happen to you again, right?

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,140
Are you two really together?

78
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,500
Great!

79
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,460
She’s falling in love!

80
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,360
Let me see.

81
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,590
It’s nice.

82
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,410
Quite fashionable.

83
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,940
Right, he’s a science geek.

84
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,880
It’s understandable.

85
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,950
As long as you like it.

86
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,200
Great!

87
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,310
She’s finally in love.

88
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,750
Amazing!

89
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,410
It's like

90
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,250
I'm the one in love.

91
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,270
What’s wrong with you?

92
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,400
Why are you groaning?

93
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,700
Today in the lab...

94
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,880
Do you think the hair grower

95
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,280
I bought a few days ago is working?

96
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,020
Why do I feel that the hairline

97
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,120
is still receding?

98
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:47,930
What happened in the lab?

99
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Su Chengcheng and I...

100
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,440
How about

101
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,430
I go to a plastic surgery center

102
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,080
for hair transplantation?

103
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,320
The volume of hair from the back

104
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,590
could be transplanted to the top of my head.

105
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,090
Right?

106
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,510
Be careful of losing the hair in the back.

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,240
Look at you!

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,060
What happened to Su Chengcheng?

109
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,410
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,000
All right.

111
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,810
The journal

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,980
has just contacted me.

113
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,540
They said that the feedback after the revision

114
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,920
of the paper was very good.

115
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,840
They will arrange the first trial as soon as possible.

116
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,130
If this paper

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,390
can be successfully published,

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,630

119
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,370

122
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,320
I’m in charge of the lab.

123
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,780
This is what I should do.

124
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,840
I am leaving.

125
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,890
Hold on.

126
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,240
First of all,

127
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,170
I want to commend you.

128
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,190
That you think so

129
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,800
shows that you are

130
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,360
a responsible person.

131
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,600
Secondly, I think

132
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,980
you can be more daring

133
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
and take bigger steps

134
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,610
for some things.

135
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,150
For example,

136
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,320
Musk.

137
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,200
I think

138
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,169
you should ask

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,820
everyone in the lab

140
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,060
to participate in

141
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,520

Why are you looking at me?

My main concern is that

145
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,730
you are about to start racing.

146
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,350
Time is imminent and the task is heavy.

147
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,280
Let everyone join in.

148
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,780
Really?

149
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,500
Thank you, Prof. Du.

Win a champion for the lab.

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,370
Zhu, go there.

176
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,380
Why do you keep asking me to change seats?

177
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,360
Just sit there.

178
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,670
Chengcheng.

179
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,240
Chengcheng.

180
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,930
Sleeping against the window

181
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,920
is prone to cervical spine misalignment.

182
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,940
And an air conditioner is on top of your head,

183
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,960
which makes you easy to catch a cold.

184
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,150
The angle and heat

185
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,220
of my shoulder is just right.

186
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,120
Would you like

187
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,560
to try?

188
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,630
Thank you.

189
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,020
Xiao Yuhe.

190
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,850
Have you ever tried a carousel?

191
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,490
I think

192
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,290
it would be quite romantic

193
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,460
for us to play it.

194
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,700
Shall we

195
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,900
try it?

196
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,150
Shall we?

197
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,480
Where have you been?

198
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,580
I see everyone wearing it.

199
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,690
So I bought a pair.

200
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,430
Boonie Bears are good brothers.

201
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,680
Why did you buy it?

202
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,470
Let’s walk around.

203
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,560

-Thank you.
-Take your time.

252
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,320
Let’s take it first.

253
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,810
This is

254
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,520
the longest roller coaster in the country,

255
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,320
with a total length of 1,758 meters

256
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,710
and a top speed of

257
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,150
180 kilometers per hour.

258
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,690
Any idea?

259
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Senior Xiao.

260
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,490
Are you afraid?

261
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,660
If so,

262
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,560
don’t force yourself.

263
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,590
Somebody needs to keep an eye on the clothes anyway.

264
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,990
Let senior Dongmao try with Chengcheng.

265
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,010
I am afraid?

266
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,450
I'm only worried that

267
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,300
the acceleration of its vertical descent

268
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,560
is not fast enough!

269
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,000
Are you okay?

270
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,870
Yes.

271
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm just checking

272
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,390
our restraints.

273
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,010
I am worried that we will be thrown out

274
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,950
at the highest point.

275
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,450
Of course,

276
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,310
if you are afraid,

277
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,140
grab my hand.

278
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,670
Here.

279
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,560
I’m afraid.

280
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,370
I know.

281
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,650
Here we are.

282
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,490
Once again.

283
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,890
Dongmao.

284
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,620
I can’t make it anymore.

285
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,110
What’s wrong with you?

286
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,890
Nothing.

287
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
I'm just still thinking about

288
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,860
centrifugal force and acceleration.

289
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,150
Are you feeling sick?

290
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,540
Not at all.

291
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,110
I won't spit in front of you.

292
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
Your milk tea is ready.

293
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,170
Thank you.

294
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,910
Let’s go together next.

295
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,220
Okay.

296
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,440
One for you.

297
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,840
My lucky color today

298
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,100
is orange.

299
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,980
What a strange person.

300
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,090
Won’t you drink any?

301
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,470
I’ll go get another one.

302
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,850
No need.

303
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,320
Let’s drink it together.

304
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,440
What’s wrong with you?

305
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,060
Here.

306
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,370
Take it.

307
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,150
Okay.

308
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,410
Let’s change a place.

309
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,480
Come on. Here.

310
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,400
Coming.

311
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,440
Let’s go over there.

312
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,630
Let's go this way.

313
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,180
It feels good.

314
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,810
Let me.

315
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,470
So comfortable.

316
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,090
Prof. Du did spend a lot

317
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,370
this time.

318
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,000
Why don't you praise my choice?

319
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,540
We'll be staying here tonight.

320
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
I booked five tents.

321
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,340
Let me see.

322
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,590
Xiao and Gu Chen.

323
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,460
One for the two of you.

324
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,820
Xixi and Chengcheng.

325
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,420
One for the two of you.

326
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,490
One for Jiafa and me.

327
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,510
The remaining two

328
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,330
are up to you to decide.

329
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,410
No.

330
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,830
Xixi and I will live in one tent.

331
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,110
Hold on.

332
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,180
You called her Xixi?

333
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,120
What’s going on?

334
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,010
Because she is my girlfriend.

335
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait for me.

336
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,740
Then…What about you?

337
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:17,940
Let’s go.

338
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,660
Don't follow me all the time,

339
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,160
okay?

340
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,770
I don’t want that.

341
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,170
Yiran.

342
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,050
Yiran.

343
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,640
What?

344
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,630
I am right next to you.

345
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,860
If you are afraid of the dark at night,

346
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,470
just let me know.

347
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,370
No need.

348
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,460
Yiran.

349
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,420
I will choose this one.

350
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,930
What do you want for dinner?

351
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,670
I will eat whatever you eat.

352
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,300
It is said that couples

353
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,780
have mutual affinity, right?

354
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,850
I’d like to see

355
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,370
if you couples

356
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,720
can pick out

357
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,350
which of these four dishes

358
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,720
was cooked by the other party.

359
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,140
Okay, now.

360
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,710
Xiao, Xixi, Yiran and Jiafa.

361
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,440
The four of you

362
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,930
pick up your own ingredients

363
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,980
and cook in the kitchen.

364
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,860
The rest of us, go.

365
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,610
Start.

366
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,160
Come on!

367
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,230
The test begins.

368
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,060
This is made by Xixi.

369
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,240
Xixi.

370
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
You put more cilantro than salad.

371
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,750
Is it that obvious?

372
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,170
[Pan]

373
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,310
Omurice is made by Xiao Yuhe.

374
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,020
Junior Chengcheng, are you sure?

375
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,160
I’m sure.

376
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,770
No way.

377
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,210
It is impossible for senior Yuhe

378
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,580
to make such an ugly omurice.

379
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,260
I did it.

380
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,030
But

381
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,510
it's really ugly.

382
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,210
Pan?

383
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,260
Xiao.

384
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,810
Why did you write a “Pan”

385
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,960
on the omurice?

386
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,610
Because I want everyone

387
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,810
to challenge a new height bravely.

388
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,990
Because your nickname is Zhu Panpan.

389
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,620
Another one.

390
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,320
No way.

391
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,080
No way!

392
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,670
Go ahead.

393
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,780
Based on my knowledge

394
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,510
of someone over the years,

395
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,310
it is absolutely impossible

396
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,920
for Zhu Jiafa

397
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,950
to make this bowl of instant noodles.

398
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,370
He is usually so stingy that

399
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,570
it is impossible to put so many ingredients.

400
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,820
Right.

401
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
Look at the

402
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,150
scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

403
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,460
We can even see the eggshells.

404
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,520
I made the scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

405
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,720
Take it or leave it.

406
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,610
Yiran.

407
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,140
The scrambled eggs with tomatoes

408
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,290
is so well cooked.

409
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,570
The eggshells have...

410
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,280
There is...

411
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,270
It tastes good.

412
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,140
Delicious.

413
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,700
Amazing, senior Zhang Li.

414
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,060
You are so good at flattery.

415
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,480
He’s trying so hard.

416
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,960
Have fun.

417
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,550
Look at these.

418
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,150
So interesting.

419
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,040
There is a hillside nearby

420
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
with a particularly nice view.

421
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,650
Would you like to take a look?

422
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,780
Remember the romance experiment

423
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,200
we did last time?

424
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
I think if the location

425
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,640
is changed to here,

426
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,800
it will be suitable for

427
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,950
monitoring the response of the brain area.

428
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,500
If romance

429
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,460
is a function of atmosphere,

430
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,220
how can we set

431
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,100
the relevant variables?

432
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,900
I think the environment here

433
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,570
is one of them.

434
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,640
It’s quite beautiful here.

435
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,870
I think

436
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,740
when romance comes,

437
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,230
there should be fewer people,

438
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,120
the quieter the better.

439
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,320
The quiet value is also a variable.

440
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,800
Also,

441
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,340
the darker the light,

442
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,190
the better.

443
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,270
And

444
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,260
it has something to do with

445
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,800
the length of time that the two stare at each other in silence.

446
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,220
I think each item

447
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,130
accounts for 20%.

448
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,040
It also depends on the final sum.

449
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,340
Gosh.

450
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,610
Everything here fits.

451
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,310
The atmosphere value is almost 100%.

452
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,580
Here is simply a holy land for kissing.

453
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,360
Gosh.

454
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,430
Give me a girlfriend.

455
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,210
Have you considered

456
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,560
the effect on the atmosphere value

457
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,700
when each factor is very low?

458
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,660
Assuming that

459
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,960
the quiet value is set to x,

460
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,110
the full score is 100 points,

461
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,880
and each factor occupies 20 points.

462
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,350
That is, y is equal to

463
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,650
thirty minus one thousandth of x.

464
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,510
If the formula is drawn as a graph,

465
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,900
when the score is lower than 33 points,

466
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,460
it will be drastically reduced to a negative value.

467
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,450
If the surrounding environment

468
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,000
is quite noisy,

469
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,980
the quiet value

470
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,960
will become negative infinity.

471
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,220
Even if other factors

472
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,900
are full marks,

473
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,890
the atmosphere value

474
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,580
is still negative infinity.

475
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,500
It makes sense.

476
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,220
A pair of three.

477
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,090
Yuhe.

478
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,930
Where is the hillside

479
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,350
you just said?

480
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,170
Let’s go together.

481
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,670
Let’s go.

482
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,910
Yuhe.

483
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,040
Are you going to the romance experiment?

484
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,850
You didn't understand what I meant.

485
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,150
It makes sense.

486
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,080
You are right.

487
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,910
Senior Xiao was reminding us.

488
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,610
What a public display of affection.

489
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,470
I failed.

490
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,790
Chengcheng.

491
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,740
Is the balloon

492
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,560
I bought you today ugly?

493
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,840
Nonsense.

494
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,860
I love it.

495
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,590
That balloon is bigger than everyone else's.

496
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,100
Really?

497
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,270
Wait for me.

498
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,270
Half for you,

499
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,380
half for me.

500
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,880
You’ll always be my best friend.

501
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,010
Boyfriend.

502
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,000
- Does it taste good?
- Does it taste good?

503
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,880
I Love Shiny Green.

504
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,700
You always beat me on purpose.

505
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,920
You are not hiding now?

506
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,480
In fact, I knew it long ago.

507
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,360
Coriander,

508
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,410
and Shiny Green.

509
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,010
You are Shiny Green.

510
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,370
So

511
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,670
I Love Shiny Green.

512
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,570
Actually,

513
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,840
you don't like coriander, do you?

514
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,510
When I am with you,

515
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,350
I can always be myself

516
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,010
at ease,

517
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,000
without deliberate self-disguise,

518
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,640
or trying to be

519
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,030
a competent girlfriend.

520
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,990
So I hope

521
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,230
it's the same

522
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,240
when you're with me.

523
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,230
You don’t have to

524
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,250
deliberately change anything for me.

525
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,480
Just be at ease.

526
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,990
Be at ease?

527
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,870
Then I'll throw out

528
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,940
all the cilantro-flavored

529
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,210
drinks and potato chips

530
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,010
in the lab.

531
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,650
What did you say?

532
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,140
I'm going to throw them all away.

533
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,670
Say that again.

534
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,450
Don’t you want me to be at ease?

535
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,910
Who loves Shiny Green the most?

536
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,810
You liar.

537
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,650
My mobile is out of battery.

538
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,770
I'm going to borrow a power bank from senior.

539
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,300
Senior.

540
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,600
Gosh.

541
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,130
Sorry.

542
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,140
Let’s go.

543
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,570
Shall we continue?

544
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,990
So awkward.

545
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,530
Just now I almost

546
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,580
saw them...

547
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,780
It's a pity that

548
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,489
we are not on the top of the mountain

549
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,500
and cannot see the complete night sky.

550
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,159
The ambiance value is a bit lacking.

551
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,320
The atmosphere value will soon reach 100 points.

552
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:48,820
[Suitability of light and dark: 20 points, staring at each other no less than 30 seconds: 20 points]

553
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:48,820
[Beautiful environment: 20 points, quiet value: 20 points, few onlookers: 20 points]

554
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:48,820
[Atmosphere value: 100 points]

555
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,250
[End of episode 19]

556
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,870
[Time for bonus scene]

557
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,950
Kissing is not

558
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,240
an easy thing to do.

559
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,660
It really needs atmosphere.

560
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,650
Although the so-called atmosphere

561
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,010
is not something that

562
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,060
really exists,

563
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,390
It’s quite influential.

564
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,000
What exactly

565
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,340
determines the level of the atmosphere value?

566
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,950
After our research, we found that

567
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,570
five factors determine

568
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,830
the level of the atmosphere value,

569
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
and they are the beauty of the surrounding environment,

570
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,300
the degree of quietness, the degree of shading,

571
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,220
the number of onlookers

572
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,560
and the duration of time the subjects

573
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,220
stare at each other in silence.

574
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,250
So today we chose

575
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,660
the most beautiful and quiet place in our school,

576
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,450
where the atmosphere value

577
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,570
is at the top,

578
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,920
for the kissing experiment.

579
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,220
We will

580
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,490
randomly select two

581
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,820
of the eight of us

582
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,430
for a total of twenty-eight

583
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,140
kissing experiments.

584
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,670
Wrong timing.

585
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,110
[Atmosphere value]

586
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,640
It seems that our experiment is right.

587
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,160
The atmosphere here is really good.

588
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,050
It's beautiful

589
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,210
and quiet.

590
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,260
Only you and me.

591
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,240
Well.

592
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,540
Let’s get started.

593
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,760
Su Chengcheng, where are you?

594
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,900
Su Chengcheng.

595
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,080
Where are you, Su Chengcheng?

596
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,720
Su Chengcheng.

597
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,090
Su Chengcheng.

598
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,630
Su Chengcheng, where are you?

599
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,330
Su Chengcheng.

600
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,910
Never mind.

601
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,780
After he leaves,

602
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,880
the atmosphere value will be restored.

603
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
Let’s try it again.

604
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,320
Hey, I’m hungry.

605
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm going to lock the door.

606
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,090
Well.

607
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,890
Once the atmosphere is interrupted,

608
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,170
it is hard to recover.

609
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,570
That’s all for the experiment.

610
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,460
No way.

611
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,340
I want to leave

612
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,150
a wonderful memory.

613
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,160
Let's change to another place then.

614
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,780
I promise you that

615
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,880
I will definitely give you a kiss

616
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,360
with the highest theoretical value.

617
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,290
I will surprise you.
