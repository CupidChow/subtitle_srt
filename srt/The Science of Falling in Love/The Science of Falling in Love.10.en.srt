Why can't our lab

11
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,760
do experiments

like this?

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,260
I'm glad that

15
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,430
you could come this time.

for this experiment.

26
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,260
Alright, please have a seat.

27
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,310
We'll begin shortly.

28
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,710
I don't want to go inside.

29
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,260
Don't go inside if you don't want to.

30
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,079
Don't make it hard to yourself.

31
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,980
Come on, let's eat something instead.

32
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,460
No, those people are already here.

33
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,760
Besides, they started this experiment

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,550
because of me,

35
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,120
so it's not nice if I don't show up.

36
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,760
It's fine.

37
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm with you.

38
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,720
I'll see

39
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,540
what Xiao Yuhe can say.

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Chengcheng, Meizi,

43
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,519

Everyone is almost here.

Now, our sharing session

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,700
has officially begun.

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
The theme

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,210
of our sharing session is

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,760
exploring the differences in the perception of romance

56
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,860
between men and women.

57
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,110
The reporter of our sharing session

58
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,550
is Xiao Yuhe.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,180
Next,

60
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,830
let's welcome Xiao Yuhe

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,330
to give us a detailed introduction.

62
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,070
Greetings, I'm Xiao Yuhe.

63
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,150
What is romance?

64
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,880
It always comes hand in hand with love,

65
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,560
and it's a part of love.

66
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,930
However, there is still

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,640
no definitive theory or answer

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
as to how to define romance up to now.

69
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,860
Romance has a cognitive component

70
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,610
[The Study of Gender Difference in the Perception of Romance - Relevant Studies]

71
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,710
and when it comes to cognitive processing,

72
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,800
there are differences in the activation modes of brain regions

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,770
between men and women.

74
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,790
This experiment

75
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,240
mainly measures

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,810
the brain region responses of male and female students

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,930
in the experimental group

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,540
to the same romantic event of

79
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,550
watching a sunset,

80
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,700
in order to compare and see

81
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,020
if there are differences

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,490
in how men and women perceive romance.

83
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,060
As you can see,

84
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,990
the main activated region of male students

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
is the cognitive processing region;

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,420
the main activated regions of female students

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,659
are the emotion region

88
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,930
and reward region.

89
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,540
This is consistent with

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,820
the theoretical results

91
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,880
of previous studies.

92
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,400
Peers and teachers, if you have any questions,

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,470
we can discuss them.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,220
Look,

95
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,110
in the same atmosphere experiment,

96
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,620
the brain region responses of other students

97
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,780
were quite normal,

98
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,840
but why were Yuhe's and Chengcheng's

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,400
brain region responses

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,450
activated so much?

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,080
It's mainly because Xiao

102
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,570
is under Chengcheng's control.

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,200
Let me tell you two.

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,090
The reason why

105
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,280
my brain region responses are so strong

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,050
is because of the situation.

107
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,110
Romantic sunsets

108
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,620
are due to a particular situation,

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
not a particular object.

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,060
Do you understand?

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,290
Do you understand?

112

When you have feelings for someone,

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,890
you will not only have brain region responses,

114
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,830
but also

115
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,220
peripheral nerve excitation manifestations

116
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,220
such as increased norepinephrine,

117

rapid heartbeat,

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,010
and blushing,

119

as shown in the figure.

How come you don't know her?

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,810
She's the girl

129
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,450
who confessed to Xiao Yuhe.

130
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,440
I put the results in the wrong place.

131
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:07,980
Wait a minute.

132
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,960
It shouldn't be showing this.

133
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,050
See how smitten this girl is.

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,170
How shameful.

135
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah.

Didn't you say that you have feelings for me?

139
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,370
You just happen to

140
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,450
have all the data

we need for this experiment.

These data

144
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,870
can't directly indicate

145
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,660
that I have feelings for her.

146
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,010
Xiao Yuhe, can you cut it out?

147
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,120
Intense exercise,

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,180
excessive mental stress,

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,370
and hyperthyroidism

150
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,400
can all result in

151
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,230
heart racing.

152
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
There are also many reasons

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,730
why a person may blush.

154
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,630
A person with high blood pressure

155
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,020
will have an enlarged heart

156
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,580
and increased myocardial contraction power,

157
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,870
which will cause blood vessels in the head to expand and become congested.

158
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,770
However, none of these can prove that

159
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,700
a person has feelings for another person.

160
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,200
Chengcheng, talk to him about this in private.

161
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,409
I've said that

162
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,970
it's because the program went wrong.

163

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,360
I suggest you figure out

167
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,810
what is the spotlight effect.

168
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,020
There's always a kind of people

169
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,230
who see themselves

170
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,420
as the center of everything,

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,360
which in common parlance is called

172
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,660
self-righteousness

173
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,110
and self-absorption.

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,500
Xiao Yuhe.

177
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,650
You went too far.

178
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,600
Du Zhuanjia.

179
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,150
I find your sharing session

180
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,190
quite interesting.

181
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,590
It looks like a fight

182
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,530
between a young couple.

183
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,460
Right?

184
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,450
Let's have one in the future.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,169
OK. OK.

186
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,810
I really didn't think that...

187
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
I've never thought that

188
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,550
you and Su Chengcheng

189
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,780
would have said this kind of thing

190
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,120
on such a serious

191
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,540
academic sharing session.

192
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,210
I completely lost face

193
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,550
because of you two.

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,190
What do I need face for?

195
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
I don't have face.

196
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,510
I don't have face anymore.

197
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
Seeing me not have a face anymore,

198
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,520
how come you have no reaction

199
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,120
at all?

200
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,840
See,

201
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
since Su Chengcheng

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,750
came to this lab,

203
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,880
there hasn't been one day that you can be considered normal.

204
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,690
Let me tell you.

205
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,490
Soon

206
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,690
our lab

207
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,580
will have a mid-term assessment,

208
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,490
and if Su Chengcheng

209
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,000
fails this assessment,

210
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,780
she still

211
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,210
has to go back to where she came from.

212
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,420
Prof. Du,

213
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,280
since Su Chengcheng

214
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,240
came to our lab,

215
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,680
if it is not because of

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,460
cleaning

217
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
and moving the equipment,

218
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,110
she has done

219
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,980
all the basic work.

220
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,000
She has her own ideas

221
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,300
about scientific research,

222
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,730
and her thinking is clear and logical.

223
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
As you can see, what she said just now

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,240
is closely reasoned and well argued,

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
and she is the one

226
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,590
who communicates the best with Jianming in our lab.

227
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,550
If she doesn't pass

228
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,230
the mid-term assessment,

229
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,460
her creative credit will be gone.

230
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,160
Then let it be gone.

231
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,010
Wh-who can she blame?

232
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,360
It is she who doesn't pass the assessment,

233
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,950
right?

234
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,930
Look,

235
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,400
I have to clarify to you

236
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,380
about this part.

237
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,160
I don't have a problem with her,

238
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,940
and I'm not

239
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,840
deliberately against her.

240
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,870
It's just one thing.

241
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,620
I'm worried that she'll affect you.

242
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,030
I've had enough, you know.

243
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,400
Meizi,

244
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,170
why did he act like this?

245
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,560
He kept changing his attitude.

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,160
I really have no idea

247
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,850
what he's thinking.

248
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,100
He certainly wasn't like this a few days ago.

249
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,710
No.

250
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,440
I can't let you suffer silently from this.

251
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,360
Come with me, let's ask him.

252
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,430
Forget it.

253
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,810
I don't want to have too much contact with him.

254
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,160
From now on,

255
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
we can just be ordinary friends.

256
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,260
I decide to apply for a different lab.

257
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,170
They are all so handsome.

258
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,720
Yeah.

259
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,820
Boys have to play basketball.

260
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,290
Let's ask him

261
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,090
for his contact information later.

262
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,180
What's the matter?

263
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,030
That e-bike.

264
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
If I hadn't bought that coat,

265
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,590
that e-bike would have been mine.

266
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,800
Now, the coat was thrown away by him,

267
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,850
my money is gone,

268
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,590
and I don't have the e-bike, either.

269
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,490
Meizi, I have nothing.

270
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,600
Don't look at it.

271
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,220
It won't be yours no matter how hard you look at it.

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,480
It's fate.

273
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,850
Let's go.

274
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,810
Save some money.

275
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,800
Stop looking.

276
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,030
It hurts more if you look.

277
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,230
Let's go.

278
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
E-bike.

279
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,660
My dear e-bike.

280
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
This is the study

281
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,160
of the experimental brain-computer interface

282
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,060
in rodents

283
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,230
and primates

284
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,570
that our research group submitted earlier.

285
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,970
Didn't you have high expectations for her?

286
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,290
Now that we have the review comments,

287
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,830
share some of them with her

288
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,330
and have her revised the paper.

289
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,150
Let me admire

290
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,600
what she has learned

291
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,950
this half-semester.

292
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,750
Prof. Du,

293
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,690
the deadline for revising this paper

294
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,740
is so imminent

295
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,710
that even I have to hurry,

296
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,220
and the task is so heavy.

297
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,260
But she's only an undergraduate.

298
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,040
How about

299
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,740
letting her cleanse the data instead?

300
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,860
If she does a good job,

301
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,560
let her pass the mid-term assessment.

302
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,050
You said data cleansing?

303
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,030
You see,

304
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,550
this seems like

305
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,130
a pretty basic job,

306
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,380
but actually,

307
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,280
it's a hard nut to crack.

308
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,150
Fine.

309
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,480
Let her do it.

310
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,450
Got it.

311
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,610
But let me make it clear to you.

312
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,880
I'll check it tomorrow morning.

313
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
If she fails,

314
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,620
then it only means one thing:

315
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,250
she's not suitable

316
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,290
to stay in our lab.

317
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,140
No problem.

318
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,190
Thank you, Prof. Du.

319
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:12,990
Su Chengcheng,

320
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,080
this is the paper

321
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
that the research group did before,

322
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,280
we got the comments from the reviewers

323
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,930
and there are some data that need to be cleansed.

324
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,540
You get it done

325
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,680
and give it to me tomorrow morning at 7:15.

326
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm sorry,

327
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,280
but I don't have time today.

328
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,150
I have to finish the assignment

329
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,830
given by the advisor.

330
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,640
This is a project of the research group,

331
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,690
if you don't do it, you won't get the credit.

332
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,060
It's up to you.

333
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,700
Come to me if you face any difficulties.

334
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,390
What a cheapskate.

335
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,160
You're just mad at me because

336
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,020
I embarrassed you.

337
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,770
If you want me to leave, just say it.

338
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,410
Don't be a hypocrite.

339
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,050
Put the data inside it

340
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,120
into a computer for analysis.

341
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,950
Give them to me tomorrow morning.

342
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,560
Data cleansing takes

343
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,500
at least 8 to 9 hours.

344
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,750
Data analysis should be adjusted

345
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,490
every three hours.

346
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
Do all of these need to be given to you

347
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,850
at 7:15 tomorrow morning?

Hello, Doctor Luo?

I would like to ask

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,240
how my brother is doing now.

357
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,780
He has had some mood swings again recently,

358
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,560
but they are under control,

359
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,420
so he doesn't need to increase his dosage.

360
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,780
He is still maintaining his daily dose of

361

0.4 mg of Alprazolam

As for your transfer to another lab,

then increase your ability.

521
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,130
Have a try.

522
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,880
Is it good?

523
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,150
Just have a try.

524
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,430
Have you heard about it?

525
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,160
Everybody knows it.

526
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,720
What is Su Chengcheng thinking?

527
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,770
Well,

528
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,170
with her grades,

529
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,620
she would laugh in her dreams

530
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,620
because

531
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,830
she got into our lab, right?

532
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,520
What's she thinking

533
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,160
to make a fuss?

534
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,850
She's fussing about transferring to another lab no matter what.

535
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,400
Didn't she get into the lab

536
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,750
because she wanted to be in a relationship with Senior Yuhe

537
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,690
in the first place?

538
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,040
Now they are having such a cold war.

539
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,250
She just couldn't stay here anymore.

540
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,880
This is so delicious.

541
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,340
Could you lend me your courseware?

542
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
I didn't do my homework.

543
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,680
I'll get it to you later.

544
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,540
Thanks.

545
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,230
It's OK, Chengcheng.

546
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,490
It's fine if you can't find another lab.

547
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,630
Well, so, don't you get credit

548
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,060
for writing a thesis too?

549
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,340
We have Ying.

550
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,850
You'll be fine.

551
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,340
Ying needs to work both on her study

552
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,220
and her part-time job.

553
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,910
I can't ask her for this.

554
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,090
Hello?

555
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,250
Senior Yiran?

556
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,620
Greetings.

557
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,400
Chengcheng.

558
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,470
I know a professor

559
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,650
named Jiang Songrui,

560
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,560
and it seems that

561
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
his lab is still open for applying.

562
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,290
Are you sure?

563
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,950
I have time,

564
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,080
I'll go there immediately to check.

565
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,440
Thank you, Senior Yiran.

566
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,360
What is it about?

567
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,690
I've found a lab!

568
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,580
Really?

569
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,970
Let's go. Let's go.

570
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,800
Chengcheng.

571
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,920
Where are you going?

572
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,220
Senior Dongmao,

573
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,530
didn't I say that I wanted to transfer to another lab?

574
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,110
Then Senior Yiran told me that

575
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,520
there was a nice Prof. Jiang

576
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,740
in our school,

577
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,290
whose name is...

578
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,680
Jiang Songrui.

579
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,230
Right.

580
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,620
She said that his lab was still open for applying,

581
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,460
so I should hurry and ask.

582
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,960
I have to go,

583
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,610
Senior Dongmao, bye-bye.

584
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:47,700
Bye-bye.

585
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,920
Jiang Songrui?

586
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,300
You are certainly welcome to come to our lab

587
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,660
if you want to.

588
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,040
As long as

589
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,190
you gain your current lab's approval,

590
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,650
you can come over whenever you want.

591
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,620
Really?

592
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,730
Prof. Jiang, are you really willing to accept me?

593
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,720
Of course. Of course.

594
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,500
Cross the brazier;

595
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,250
tend to good and avoid evil;

596
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,070
turn the disaster into a bless;

597
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,580
get away from the evil;

598
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,680
be flourish and prosperous.

599
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,490
What are you doing?

600
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,380
Chengcheng.

601
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,370
You are really down on your luck recently.

602
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,600
However,

603
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,150
the conditions of our dorm are limited,

604
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,660
so we can only set up a brazier for you

605
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,200
to step over

606
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,900
to get rid of your bad luck.

607
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,410
How about it?

608
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,370
What did Prof. Jiang say?

609
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,740
Sisters.

610
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,310
I

611
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
can transfer to another lab.

612
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,330
It really works!

613
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,890
Aren't you happy?

614
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,560
We are!

615
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,780
This brazier can help you

616
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,500
tend to good and avoid evil;

617
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,430
-turn the disaster into a bliss;
-Bless.

618
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,190
get away from the evil;

619
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,540
be flourish and prosperous.

620
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:42,920
Hello, Dongmao.

621
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,130
Yuhe.

622
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,590
Chengcheng is going to

623
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,780
transfer to Jiang Songrui's lab.

624
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,550
OK, I see.

625
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,940
Next.

626
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,050
Dazhuang,

627
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,540
save the data for me.

628
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:08,980
OK.

629
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,880
Prof. Du, I've already contacted

630
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,720
another laboratory,

631
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
if there's no problem

632
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
with my application form...

633
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,430
There's no problem at all.

634
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:29,700
See,

635
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,430
I've already signed it for you.

636
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,610
Thank you, Prof. Du.

637
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,540
Prof. Du,

638
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,190
I apologize for what happened

639
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,210
at the sharing session earlier.

640
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,740
Because of me,

641
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,930
The lab was under

642
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,110
an adverse impact.

643
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,010
I am so sorry for that.

644
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,720
I also learned a lot

645
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,990
in our lab.

646
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,100
In the future, no matter where I go,

647
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,490
I will remember all of this.

648
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,510
Nobody is a saint.

649
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,650
Besides, you're still young,

650
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,210
so it's normal for you

651
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,980
to make mistakes.

652
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,510
It's fine as long as you correct them in the future.

653
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,270
I hope that

654
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,730
when you enter a new environment,

655
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,500
you will be able to adapt to its pace soon.

656
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,840
Of course, what I hope most of all is that

657
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,640
you will become an accomplished person

658
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,380
in the future.

659
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,210
Alright?

660
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,770
In addition,

661
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,380
after all,

662
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,820
you have been doing experiments with Xiao Yuhe

663
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,520
this whole time,

664
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,750
so communicate with him before you go,

665
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,390
OK?

666
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,190
OK.

667
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,980
You can go now.

668
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,570
Thank you, Prof. Du.

669
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,700
♫Su San left Hongdong Town♫

670
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,570
Su San left Hongdong Town.

671
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,110
You can have this bunny.

672
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,080
Thank you, Chengcheng.

673
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,500
Why do you give me a bunny all of a sudden?

674
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,810
I'll transfer to another lab tomorrow,

675
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,840
and I won't be coming here anymore.

676
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,489
You can keep it as a memento.

677
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,130
Wait,

678
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,500
you are transferring to another lab?

679
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,070
Where are you transferring to?

680
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,760
I

681
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,600
may transfer to...

682
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,540
Wait, Xiao. She...

683
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,620
I'll talk to you later.

684
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,150
I have to transfer to another lab.

685
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,199
Please sign here.

686
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,020
I can't.

687
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,770
Prof. Du has approved it.

688
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,480
I don't.

689
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,750
I don't care if you approve it or not.

690
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,800
Hello, Prof. Jiang.

691
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
I've asked Prof. Du,

692
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,660
and I can go there immediately.

693
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Chengcheng,

694
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,850
something

695
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,140
has come up in the lab,

696
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,740
so I'm afraid I can't let you come over.

697
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,580
Your lab is quite good,

698
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,600
you should stay there

699
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,230
and do your best.

700
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,600
Why?

701
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,550
Didn't we settle this yesterday?

702
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,630
Chengcheng,

703
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,110
it's normal for young people to have conflicts.

704
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,970
Don't do things out of spite.

705
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,390
If you have disagreements,

706
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,180
talk it with Yuhe nicely.

707
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,620
I'm sure communication can solve your problems.

708
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,790
Xiao Yuhe, what you've interfered with is none of your business.

709
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
It's better for you

710
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,910
to stay in our lab.

711
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,750
Our lab...

712
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,690
Wait.

713
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,400
Chengcheng.

714
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,180
What's going on here?

715
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,600
Xiao?

716
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,090
It's so nice of you

717
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,580
to do the cleaning for me.

718
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,940
Are you alright?

719
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,450
What's the matter?

720
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,320
Li Meizi.

721
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,990
What in the world do you think

722
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,440
Xiao Yuhe is thinking?

723
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,630
Why won't Xiao Yuhe

724
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,260
let me leave?

725
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,710
Where else can I go

726
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,090
if he won't let me?

727
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,210
Grandpa,

728
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,020
your clothes is pretty special.

729
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:19,930
Yeah,

730
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,770
I found it in the trash can

731
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,550
beside the women's dorm.

732
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,740
Could it be

733
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:26,920
that you like it?

734
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,270
I can sell it to you if you like it.

735
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,010
200 yuan.

736
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,020
I'm fine, grandpa.

737
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,450
Thank you.

738
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,150
Take it if you like it.

739
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,200
150 yuan. 150 yuan.

740
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,800
Grandpa, I am really fine.

741
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,080
100 yuan. 100 yuan. 100 yuan.

742
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,190
100 yuan.

743
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,550
50 yuan.

744
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,600
I can go for 50.

745
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,780
Give me some credit for my effort.

746
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,800
More or less, just give me some credit for my effort.

747
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,420
Don't run.

748
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,240
Stop running.

749
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,670
Senior Xixi.

750
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,460
Good morning.

751
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,890
Morning.

752
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,040
Did you need my help carrying them?

753
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:18,980
I'm fine.

754
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,460
Thanks.

755
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,750
You go first.

756
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,090
You go first.

757
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,360
You go first.

758
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,430
OK.

759
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:40,990
I'll go first.

760
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,920
Which floor are you on?

761
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,840
The same as me.

762
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,190
How's your wound from last time?

763
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,610
It almost heals.

764
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,180
This is for you.

765
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,930
Consider it as recompense.

766
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,190
Thanks.

767
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,600
Senior Xixi, do you like to eat

768
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,400
coriander-flavored chips?

769
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,080
There are even coriander-flavored chips?

770
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,060
I've got a phone call.

771
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,520
Hello?

772
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,290
Hello.

773
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,390
I want Su Chengcheng

774
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,080
to be in your group.

775
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,290
Help her improve for me.

776
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:48,920
Don't we have

777
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,750
the project

778
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,270
from NSFC?

779
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,890
Let her join in as well.

780
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,950
She can also get credits from it.

781
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,410
Why do I have to help you?

782
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,650
How about this?

783
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,430
I'll personally analyze

784
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,480
all your lab data

785
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,060
of this semester for you.

786
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,790
Also,

787
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,140
haven't you always wanted

788
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,070
a mouse automatic rearing system

789
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,010
with facial recognition function?

790
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,990
I'm almost done with that one, too.

791
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,290
I'll personally do the maintenance

792
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,450
in the future as well.

793
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,630
Then

794
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,540
why do you want to help her?

795
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,210
Because I have feelings for her.

796
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:29,860
Thanks.
