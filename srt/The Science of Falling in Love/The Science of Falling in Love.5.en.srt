00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,170
and low-key girl.

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,610
How can you have bread for breakfast?

182
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,260
It’s bad for your health.

183
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,780
Insufficient protein intake

184
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,130
can lead to malnutrition.

185
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,600
This is the tofu jelly from the second canteen.

186
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,050
Freshly made, with a long aftertaste,

187
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,000
well-received, and the supply exceeds the demand.

188
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,450
I

189
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,850
also prepared

190
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
various seasonings for you.

191
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,110
Whether you want it

192
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
sweet or savory,

193
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,460
your requirement will be satisfied.

194
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,190
Take a try.

195
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,300
Junior Chengcheng.

196
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,830
You scare me

197
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,970
like this.

198
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,340
Prof. Du asked everyone

199
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,980
to vote on whether I can stay

200
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,330
this Friday.

201
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,700
After thinking about it,

202
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,870
I feel that the possibility

203
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,370
of me staying

204
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,490
is really slim.

205
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,250
So I decided to change tack.

206
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,990
I want to do better

207
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,820
for seniors

208
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,370
and leave a good impression.

209
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,900
In this way, my chances of success

210
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,180
may be a little higher.

211
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,480
My current slogan

212
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,250
is Humble Su Online Services.

213
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,020
Do you think it will work?

214
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,330
Chengcheng.

215
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,920
It's okay to do good.

216
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,570
But you don’t have to

217
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,320
be humble.

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,500
With me here,

219
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,050
what are you afraid of?

220
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,510
I will definitely vote for you.

221
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,790
It's useless for you alone to vote for me.

222
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,150
There are so many people in the laboratory.

223
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,210
You have one vote.

224
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,660
Although there are quite a few people

225
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,330
in the laboratory,

226
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,000
only these nine people

227
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,790
generally participate in the voting.

228
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,990
As long as you get more than half of the votes,

229
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,110
you can stay.

230
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,340
Me.

231
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,470
Dongmao.

232
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,510
Zhang Li.

233
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,450
Xiang Hui.

234
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,330
Dazhuang.

235
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,990
As long as I can get

236
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,810
these five votes for you,

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,310
you can stay.

238
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,970
You are really

239
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,520
my true friend.

240
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,050
Now what I am your true friend,

241
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,490
could you grant me

242
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,630
a little wish?

243
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,780
What wish?

244
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,510
Send me Xiao's video.

245
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,790
Now I can finally

246
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,990
appreciate it with ease.

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,640
What are you watching?

248
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,740
I...

249
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,530
We are talking about learning.

250
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,450
Show me.

251
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,090
It’s none of your business.

252
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,660
It's almost time to vote.

253
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,950
What should I do?

254
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,890
You have to work hard

255
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,140
to find your own value.

256
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,750
Chengcheng.

257
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,240
If you have nothing to do today,

258
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,220
go to the monkey house

259
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,530
to collect some data for Prof. Du.

260
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,250
This is the experiment code.

261
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,380
Just follow it.

262
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,310
There are monkeys in our lab?

263
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
Of course.

264
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,070
The neurons of monkeys

265
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,170
are very similar to those

266
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,700
of human beings,

267
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,360
so the research objects

268
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,170
are always monkeys.

269
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:32,960
Okay.

270
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:35,870
By the way,

271
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,930
The monkey in the laboratory

272
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,650
is named Jianming,

273
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,870
very smart and lively.

274
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,540
Be careful

275
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,690
when you come into contact

276
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,550
with it.

277
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,230
-Okay.
-Remember to ask me

278
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,900
if you have any question.

279
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,540
Okay.

280
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,260
Here comes

281
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,460
the opportunity to show my personal value.

282
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,460
She will not fall in love with you.

283
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,640
Hello.

284
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,530
Are you Jianming?

285
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,100
You can even stand up.

286
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,470
Hello, Jianming.

287
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,470
My name is Su Chengcheng.

288
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,980
So cute.

289
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,020
What are you doing?

290
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,290
Watching cartoons?

291
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:35,930
Is it fun?

292
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Have a banana.

293
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,140
How can you snatch the key?

294
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,040
Senior Jiafa.

295
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,880
I haven't been here for a few days,

296
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,270
and there is a newcomer in our lab?

297
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,620
An undergraduate junior.

298
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,930
Why does our lab

299
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,250
accept undergraduates?

300
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,890
Does she have good grades?

301
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,280
Not really.

302
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,450
Then why?

303
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,690
She confessed to Xiao.

304
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,360
And Xiao

305
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,320
recruited her to the lab.

306
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,370
Really?

307
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,850
Does senior Xiao like her?

308
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,240
I don’t understand.

309
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,030
It’s complicated.

310
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,640
I’m not good at this.

311
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,950
Xiao.

312
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,000
Data.

313
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,310
Thanks.

314
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,220
Senior.

315
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,010
These are the medical records

316
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,430
I collected in the First Affiliated Hospital

317
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,750
in the past few days.

318
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,849
Take a look.

319
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,480
By the way,

320
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,760
I got my thesis review comments.

321
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,260
But I still don't understand

322
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,079
some places,

323
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,660
and I don't know

324
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,859
if my understanding is correct.

325
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,660
Could you

326
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,619
take a look for me?

327
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,660
Okay.

328
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,599
Thank you, senior.

329
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,869
I'll email you in a moment.

330
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,350
Anything else?

331
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,210
I heard that you recruited

332
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,540
a new undergraduate junior.

333
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,340
Why didn’t I see her?

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Well...

335
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,780
I sent her to the monkey house.

336
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,760
I’m in charge

337
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,760
of the work

338
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,850
in the monkey house.

339
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,630
She wasn’t trained,

340
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,140
so she can’t make it at all.

341
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,660
I think she's smart.

342
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,140
If she is inexperienced, help her more.

343
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,770
Okay.

344
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,220
I’m going to help her.

345
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,210
Dongmao.

346
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,560
How could you send her directly

347
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,930
to the monkey house?

348
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,370
Well, I...

349
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,120
I saw she had nothing to do,

350
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,570
so I let her go.

351
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,740
Jianming.

352
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,050
Let me tell you

353
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,940
one last time.

354
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,180
Spit out

355
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,140
the key now.

356
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,790
Listen.

357
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,560
I also have a bad temper.

358
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
If you give me the key,

359
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,490
we'll be even.

360
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:01,700
Here.

361
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,800
Are you Su Chengcheng?

362
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,680
How could you

363
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,770
let Jianming out?

364
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,250
Senior.

365
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,260
It was Jianming

366
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,590
who snatched the key in my basket

367
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,500
and came out by himself,

368
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,060
not me.

369
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,150
Sorry, senior.

370
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,740
Su Chengcheng.

371
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,050
Now

372
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,150
put Jianming inside.

373
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,500
I’m working on it.

374
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,100
Senior.

375
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,030
Go back.

376
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,790
Go back.

377
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,000
Get in.

378
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,610
It hits me, so I’m afraid.

379
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,680
What’s this?

380
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,500
Screw.

381
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,630
Bingo.

382
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
It’s a screw.

383
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,810
And

384
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,020
it's a screw coming out

385
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,300
of poor Jianming's mouth.

386
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,370
It’s okay that

387
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,080
you didn’t do a good job.

388
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
But how can you cause Jianming

389
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,900
to eat the screw?

390
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,090
Listen.

391
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,810
Fortunately, he spit it out.

392
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,430
If not,

393
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,420
do you know how serious

394
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,800
the consequences would be?

395
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,540
Do you know

396
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,580
how much energy

397
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,150
and effort

398
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,710
it takes

399
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,500
to raise an experimental monkey?

400
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,100
Sorry, professor.

401
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,300
I didn’t do it on purpose.

402
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,110
I don't know why Jianming

403
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,050
suddenly reached out

404
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,330
and took the key away.

405
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,150
Chengcheng.

406
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,300
You got me wrong.

407
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,930
I didn't call you here

408
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,580
to listen to your explanation.

409
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,420
We're about to vote for you.

410
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,530
You better be mentally prepared

411
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,680
and conduct yourself well.

412
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:05,590
Xixi.

413
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,370
Senior Xixi.

414
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,770
Would you like some coffee?

415
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,380
There is a new coffee shop

416
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,500
near the school,

417
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,820
and the pour-over coffee there tastes good.

418
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,050
I packed one for you.

419
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,000
Would you like to try it?

420
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,450
I don’t drink coffee, thank you.

421
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,960
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,620
I bought sandwiches and milk.

423
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,160
If you want Chinese food, I have tofu jelly.

424
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:28,960
I’ve had breakfast.

425
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,080
Xixi.

426
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,270
Prof. Du said that this Friday,

427
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,710
the members in the lab will vote on

428
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,260
whether I can stay.

429
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,660
Could you vote for me?

430
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,900
No, no, no.

431
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,380
Don't go there.

432
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,740
Go ahead

433
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,420
after the hairball passes.

434
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,130
Sorry.

435
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,830
This one.

436
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,350
Yes.

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,220
There is

438
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,840
a special effect prop below.

439
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,940
Let me.

440
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,250
You have to grasp the core,

441
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,180
find out the key,

442
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,030
and figure out the changes

443
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,060
on the board.

444
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,850
And you can pass easily.

445
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,460
Look, here is the prop.

446
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,580
Pass!

447
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,000
Sorry.

448
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,050
I didn’t do it on purpose.

449
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,040
I won’t do this again.

450
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,570
I’m leaving.

451
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,480
I won't bother you anymore.

452
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,190
I will vote for you.

453
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,470
Really?

454
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,800
Thank you, senior.

455
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,780
Do you need any more help?

456
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,380
Su Chengcheng.

457
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,340
How many people

458
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,280
have you shown my videos to?

459
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,140
Take a guess?

460
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,890
Senior Zhang Li.

461
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,220
I bought one milk tea

462
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,120
and got one free.

463
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,140
Try if it tastes good.

464
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,350
-Okay.
-I will open it for you.

465
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:02,850
Thank you.

466
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,280
Xiao, Prof. Du is looking for you.

467
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,770
I...

468
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,290
Drink less milk tea.

469
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,280
It's too sweet.

470
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,270
It's sugar-free.

471
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,200
I'd better go get a cup of coffee.

472
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,770
Good.

473
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,780
After the algorithm iteration this time,

474
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,060
the recognition accuracy rate

475
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,440
has increased by more than 20%.

476
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,970
The editors of several core journals

477
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,390
are asking me.

478
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,620
Sort it out

479
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,450
and send it as soon as possible.

480
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay, I see.

481
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,350
Xiao Yuhe.

482
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,930
I watched the video

483
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,480
of you falling.

484
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,640
Is your waist okay?

485
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,790
I’m fine.

486
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,500
My waist is fine.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,420
Has anything

488
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,380
happened recently?

489
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,270
No, nothing.

490
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,090
All going well.

491
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,010
Are you sure?

492
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,500
Yes.

493
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,530
Prof. Du, I will leave you alone.

494
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,280
Hold on.

495
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,260
[Pain-relieving Patch]

496
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,010
Here you are,

497
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,400
Take it.

498
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,330
How about I apply it
for you now?

499
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,520
No need.

500
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,300
I’m leaving.

501
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,810
It’s okay.

502
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,200
No need.

503
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,590
I...

504
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,730
I have two tickets

505
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,810
for the weekend premiere.

506
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,610
Would you like

507
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,420
to watch with me?

508
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,380
How is it?

509
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,500
No problem.

510
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,530
Seize the opportunity

511
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,930
while there are few people now.

512
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:51,930
Go.

513
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,250
Come on.

514
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,330
Senior Xixi.

515
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,440
What’s up?

516
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,340
Well, I know

517
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,270
you like science fiction films.

518
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,500
I have two tickets

519
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,880
for the weekend premiere.

520
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,610
Would you like to...?

521
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,960
Would you like to watch it with your friend?

522
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:22,700
Thank you.

523
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,620
But I have an appointment
for the weekend.

524
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,510
All right.

525
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,900
It's not that I couldn't say it.

526
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,840
I did it on purpose.

527
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,170
Of the many boys

528
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,440
who have confessed to senior Xixi before,

529
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,730
which one has succeeded?

530
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,050
I did so

531
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,650
to preserve a sliver of possibility.

532
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:46,700
In this way,

533
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,850
the chance of success will be greater.

534
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,910
I mean it.

535
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,740
Those boys who confessed to her before

536
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,110
were all blacklisted.

537
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,140
To confess directly is to court death.

538
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,900
Stop chatting.

539
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,190
The class will begin.

540
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,420
Time to study.

541
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,340
Let’s see today’s key points.

542
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,760
Write these down in the notebook.

543
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,730
Prof. Du.

544
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,950
You scared me.

545
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Why looking at me?

546
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,380
What are you looking at?

547
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,710
I'm watching Su Chengcheng.

548
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,790
Doesn't she

549
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,170
realize it?

550
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,090
She’s making a lot of noise

551
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,290
in the lab,

552
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,680
which greatly affected

553
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,040
other students.

554
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,960
I think it’s fine.

555
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,150
Nonsense!

556
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,940
Obviously she has nothing to do.

557
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,130
Well.

558
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,060
Ask her to go to the Equipment Center

559
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,300
and bring over

560
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,730
the newly arrived mouse padding.

561
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,430
The mouse padding is quite heavy.

562
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,320
She can’t make it alone.

563
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,300
Well.

564
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,150
I’ll go with her.

565
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,310
What do you mean?

566
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,510
Don’t you have any code

567
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,960
or thesis to write?

568
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,050
Do you also have nothing to do?

569
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,520
It’s okay.

570
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,820
Let me know if you have nothing to do.

571
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,430
I have many things

572
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,020
to arrange for you.

573
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,150
Why is there one copy less?

574
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,450
So weird.

575
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,500
I missed one copy.

576
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,700
[Receipt and Loan System of Experimental Teaching Instruments]

577
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,230
Take a good look.

578
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,580
The school stipulates that

579
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,470
to borrows these experimental instruments,

580
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,680
the units of the school

581
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,970
have to fill in

582
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,450
the instrument loan application form.

583
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,290
And the form

584
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,720
should be with the signature

585
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,660
and seal of the person in charge of the unit.

586
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,540
Professor, please make an exception

587
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,640
in my favour.

588
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,220
I will definitely send it to you.

589
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,620
I promise to

590
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,870
send the sealed form today.

591
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,340
I’m begging you.

592
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,450
It's no use begging me.

593
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,950
Without a seal,

594
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,700
how can I know

595
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,620
if you are impersonating?

596
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,220
Right?

597
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,090
If anything happened,

598
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,620
who would take the responsibility?

599
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,530
Come in.

600
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,770
I'm really not impersonating, professor.

601
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:03,930
-Xiao.
-Prof. Tao.

602
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,840
I’d like to borrow a spectrum analyzer.

603
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,930
Spectrum analyzer?

604
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,140
Okay, wait a minute.

605
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,930
Thank you.

606
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,090
-You are welcome.
-Let me.

607
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:20,810
Okay.

608
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:21,990
Thank you, Prof. Tao.

609
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,700
You are welcome.

610
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,380
Professor.

611
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,640
He has

612
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,050
no application form,

613
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,170
let alone signature

614
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,860
and seal.

615
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,180
Why did you give it to him so casually?

616
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,260
Xiao has been in our school

617
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,130
for many years.

618
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,820
He has borrowed instruments

619
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,780
so many times.

620
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,670
Everyone knows him.

621
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,500
By the way, Xiao.

622
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,580
Her procedures

623
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,500
are not complete.

624
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,060
But

625
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,300
she said you are from the same lab.

626
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,300
Do you know her?

627
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,550
Yes.

628
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,600
-We are from the same lab.
-Not quite familiar.

629
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,060
No wonder I have never seen her.

630
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,500
I will go get the padding for you.

631
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,330
Hold on.

632
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,200
Thank you, professor.

633
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,820
Thank you.

634
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,010
Padding weighs a lot.

635
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,130
You are also going back to the lab.

636
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:01,910
Do me a favor.

637
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,370
Then delete the video.

638
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,210
No.

639
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,610
Bye.

640
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,090
There are more.

641
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,010
Seriously?

642
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,200
The last two packs.

643
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,460
All your padding.

644
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,240
It must be heavy.

645
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:50,840
How about this?

646
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,980
Delete the video.

647
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,130
I'll take care of the rest for you.

648
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,020
Why should I

649
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,820
delete the precious video?

650
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,550
I don’t need you.

651
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,410
How about I give you one-on-one tutoring

652
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,110
to ensure your smooth graduation?

653
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,540
One on one?

654
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,620
If I study with you,

655
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,250
I might as well not graduate.

656
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,640
Sir.

657
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,180
Sir.

658
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Your tricycle...

659
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,250
Beauty.

660
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,170
Senior.

661
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,250
Thank you for revising the paper

662
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,140
for me yesterday.

663
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,450
Never mind.

664
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,760
Senior.

665
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,160
Anything I can do for you?

666
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,420
How about I

667
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,720
check the electrode caps for you?

668
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,970
We’ll have

669
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,050
a lab class today.

670
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,250
Su Chengcheng has finished

671
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,580
checking the electrode cap.

672
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,670
Senior Dongmao.

673
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,170
I really envy junior Chengcheng.

674
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,090
She has only been here for a few days

675
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,780
and she has integrated into the group.

676
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,450
I heard that

677
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,990
she insisted on entering our lab

678
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,450
because she wanted to fall in love.

679
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,140
She confessed her love to senior Xiao

680
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,270
after meeting him

681
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,730
only a few times.

682
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,020
Girls nowadays

683
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,190
are more and more

684
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,180
open minded.

685
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,650
I asked Su Chengcheng

686
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,330
to come to the lab.

687
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,990
It's not that she wanted to come herself.

688
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,600
Don’t look at me like this!

689
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,860
Chengcheng.

690
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,400
Did you go get the mouse padding?

691
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,540
Come on.

692
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,480
I'll help you carry them upstairs.

693
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,420
Great.

694
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,600
I was struggling how to move them upstairs.

695
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,860
Take the big one.

696
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,580
I'll take care of the two little ones.

697
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay.

698
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,730
Gu Chen, thank you today

699
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,810
for doing me a great favor.

700
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,830
I'll treat you to milk tea another day.

701
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,090
Okay, deal.

702
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
I’m going back.

703
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,699
Sure, take care.

704
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,340
Bye.

705
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,880
Bye.

706
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,420
Senior Jiafa is so handsome.

707
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,590
Three wheels

708
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,060
are smoother than two.

709
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,290
Where did you borrow it from?

710
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:55,980
I borrowed it

711
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,060
from the scrap collector.

712
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,810
Just charge it up

713
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,810
when we're done.

714
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,930
Junior Chengcheng.

715
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,770
I really admire

716
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,340
your core skill to survive

717
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,690
from a desperate situation every time.

718
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,550
Not at all.

719
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,220
Senior.

720
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,060
You look so good here.

721
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,500
I’ll take a picture of you.

722
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,120
Come on.

723
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,050
Senior Jiafa.

724
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,160
Give others a chance.

725
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,020
Let me try.

726
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,780
Come on.

727
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,700
I’d also like to try.

728
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,930
You first.

729
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,670
Let me.

730
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,370
Come on.

731
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,480
I’ll take a picture for you.

732
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,620
I’m also coming.

733
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,340
I will try.

734
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,420
Take a group photo.

735
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,730
Come on.

736
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,590
Senior, would you like to come over

737
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,390
and take a photo together?

738
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,260
Come on, get on.

739
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,580
Okay, come here.

740
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,140
Su Chengcheng.

741
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,410
Not only do you not work yourself,

742
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,540
but you also affect others.

743
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,780
No wonder senior Xiao is so tired of you.

744
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,730
The stuff for the monkey terrarium

745
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,440
has arrived.

746
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,330
Pick it up on the tricycle.

747
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,070
Okay, I see.

748
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,180
Anything else?

749
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,860
No.

750
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,870
Senior.

751
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,660
What?

752
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,230
I have something to tell you.

753
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,540
You...

754
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,200
Stay away from me.

755
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,030
No, you...

756
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,760
What are you doing?

757
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,020
You got chocolate on your teeth

758
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,720
and it's dark now.

759
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,580
I didn’t mean it.

760
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,330
It was she who asked me to stand away.

761
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,280
Chengcheng.

762
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,960
Chengcheng.

763
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,200
Take another photo for us.

764
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,640
Ready.

765
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,270
One, two, three.

766
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,850
Are you going to return the equipment?

767
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
It’s so heavy.

768
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,220
How about I let Su Chengcheng

769
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,060
go with you?

770
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,260
I look so ugly.

771
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,680
Look for it.

772
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,180
Look for it.

773
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,340
Look for the photo I took just now.

774
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,510
Much better looking than yourself.

775
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,450
No way! Look.

776
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,500
Look at the legs.

777
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,380
No need.

778
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,230
So powerful.

779
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,030
I am so pissed off.

780
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,210
Hello, Musk.

781
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,910
Hello, Xiao Yuhe.

782
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,820
Scan starts.

783
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,250
[Eat instant noodles]

784
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,160
Scan is over.

785
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,060
Musk.

786
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,620
Why can Su Chengcheng

787
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,810
gather a large group of people

788
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,930
no matter what she does?

789
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,550
She has been like this since she was a child.

790
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,700
But she's so cute

791
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,850
like this.

792
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,060
Chengcheng, good for you.

793
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,380
Our lab has been discussing you

794
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,110
all the morning.

795
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,330
The photos of you riding a tricycle

796
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,820
went viral all over the school.

797
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,100
Li Meizi.

798
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,090
They

799
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,490
only saw my outward beauty,

800
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,010
but they didn't see the tears behind.

801
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,200
Let’s go.

802
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,190
Let’s go.

803
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,050
Come on.

804
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,500
So dark.

805
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,190
Why are the street lights

806
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,070
all off today?

807
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,540
They must be broken.

808
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,320
Slow down. Watch your steps.

809
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,680
Isn’t this...?

810
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,370
He seemed to be deliberately

811
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,170
lighting the way for us.

812
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,420
How could he

813
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,350
light the way for me?

814
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,980
He wished

815
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,290
I would stumble in the dark.

816
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,000
Look, we gave way

817
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,980
but he didn't leave.

818
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,180
Are you two made peace?

819
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,130
How come?

820
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,480
Don’t look back.

821
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,840
Stop looking back.

822
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,200
No worries.

823
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,540
Why are you walking so fast.

824
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,700
Look.

825
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,270
He is lighting the way for us.
