That’s it.

7
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm not very comfortable wearing this.

8
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,650
I'd better change it.

9
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,890
No.

10
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,980
You would be wrong

11
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,520
to think so.

12
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,340
An important occasion

13
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,360
like an amusement park

14
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,500
calls for

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,660
such a delicate dress.

16
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,190
Don't run around.

17
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,730
This makes you appear quiet and sweet.

18

Furthermore,

19
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,210
due to its small size,

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,300
you have to

21
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,300
eat very little.

22
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,690
This will help you lose weight

23

Isn’t it good?

What you said

29

seems to

30
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,090
make sense.

31

Of course.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,930
I've been terrified of this since I was little.

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,020
I don't want to go in.

68

Yes.

70
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,730
When a person is in danger,

71
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,780
his heart beats faster

72
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,930
and he will be short of breath involuntarily.

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,909
This reaction

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,300
is the same as throbbing.

75
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,280
According to the Two-Factor Theory of Emotions,

76
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,020
people mistake this feeling

77
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,920
for throbbing.

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,900
You like me?

180
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,360
When you like someone,

181
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,170
the ventral tegmental area and caudate nucleus area

182
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,950
of the midbrain area

183
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,000
will be activated,

184
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,180
and the blood oxygen concentration

185
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,480
near the two areas will increase significantly,

186
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,660
which will be clearly displayed

187
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,650
on the image.

188
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,080
But nothing happens

189
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,270
to your image.

190
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,290
My mood

191
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,480
was greatly disturbed just now.

192
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,820
So I think

193
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,300
the test result is inaccurate.

194
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,270
I don't understand

195
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,940
why you insist on me

196
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,360
proving that I like you.

197
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,220
Isn't love

198
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,190
a subjective feeling?

199
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,450
I am the subject of this matter.

200
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,610
Only I have the right

201
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,340
to say whether

202
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,980
I like you or not.

203
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,340
Human beings are creatures

204
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,260
that are easily deceived by their own subjectivity.

205
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,610
Fear and throbbing

206
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,250
are the same in physical expression.

207
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,220
It is only from different interpretation perspectives

208
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,510
that there are different interpretations.

209
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,680
Human feelings are not reliable.

210
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,900
And the experimental results

211
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,720
have proved that

212
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,710
you don't like me at all.

213
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,770
Why are you playing tricks on me

214
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,570
all day?

215
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,460
If you don't like me,

216
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,900
just reject me.

217
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,300
Why did you ask me

218
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,980
to come to the lab

219
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,930
for the experiment?

220
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,220
Am I your guinea pig?

221
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
It's okay if you think so.

222
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,940
The main focus of this lab

223
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,250
is human emotion.

224
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
Didn't you say you like me?

225
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:58,990
This is just enough

226
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,860
to meet all the data

227
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,200
we need for this experiment.

228
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,650
Okay.

229
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,370
It turns out that

230
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,280
people cannot step on clouds.

231
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,120
The moment the water vapor dissipates,

232
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,670
one will fall from the high altitude of fantasy

233
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,150
to the cold ground

234
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
of reality.

235
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,130
Happy in love!

236
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,280
Didn't you go on a date?

237
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,860
Did you go to the bathhouse instead?

238
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,660
Cheng.

239
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,470
What happened to you?

240
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,410
I was fooled.

241
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,670
Fooled?

242
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,690
He didn't want to

243
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,940
be with me at all.

244
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,200
The date

245
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,580
and amusement park

246
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,410
were designed to trick me

247
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,450
into experimenting.

248
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,810
I’m just a guinea pig,

249
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,740
a living tool man.

250
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,740
What?

251
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,050
Xiao Yuhe

252
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,150
went too far.

253
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,300
You have been so unlucky lately.

254
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,940
You’d better

255
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,380
step over the brazier

256
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,060
to get rid of bad luck.

257
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,680
I’m going for it.

258
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,180
Save it. Sit down.

259
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,670
Cheng.

260
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,820
I still find this

261
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,470
a bit odd.

262
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,380
There are so many people

263
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,620
in our school who like him.

264
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,410
Why did he ask you to be his tool man?

265
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,720
How would I know?

266
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,690
Maybe it's our horoscopes that don't match.

267
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,490
Do I look

268
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,640
particularly deceitful?

269
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Kind of.

270
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,740
My head hurts now

271
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,860
just thinking of

272
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,100
Xiao Yuhe's name.

273
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,080
Cheng.

274
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,730
You don't know Xiao Yuhe well.

275
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,900
Take it as if

276
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,350
you have seen his true colors clearly this time.

277
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,280
It’s good.

278
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,910
Musk.

279
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,350
Recognize my emotions.

280
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,570
Scanning starts.

281
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,620
Age.

282
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,740
Twenty-one years old.

283
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,730
Gender.

284
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,500
Male.

285
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,920
The emotions identified

286
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,870
are concern

287
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,770
and sadness.

288
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,430
Are you broken?

289
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
How could I be in this mood?

290
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,270
Because you habitually

291
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,950
deny your fragility

292
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,300
and cannot be aware of

293
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,110
your care and sadness,

294
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,690
you can't realize

295
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,300
your true feelings at all.

296
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
No way.

297
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,330
Don't I know

298
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,240
how I feel?

299
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,860
Then tell me

300
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,650
why I am sad.

301
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,840
I have no idea.

302
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,190
But I know

303
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,300
it's a good choice

304
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,140
to eat your favorite food

305
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,060
when you're sad.

306
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,250
It’s for you.

307
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,170
I know a way to

308
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,020
make french fries super tasty.

309
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,250
Take a try.

310
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,810
You have to dip the fries

311
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,950
in the ice cream

312
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,880
while they are freshly made and hot.

313
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,380
How is it?

314
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,040
Does it taste good?

315
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,700
I didn't lie to you, did I?

316
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,660
I eat this every time

317
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,070
I'm unhappy.

318
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm happy after eating it.

319
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,220
This is something I invented myself.

320
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm too smart.

321
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,150
I admire myself so much.

322
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,540
Would you like to see anything?

323
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,600
What?

324
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,330
What’s this?

325
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:54,990
A robot.

326
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,850
I've seen it in the cartoon.

327
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,660
It is powerful

328
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,420
and can fight.

329
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,230
But this one is different

330
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,900
from the one in the cartoon.

331
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,910
It doesn’t fight,

332
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,100
but is a companion robot.

333
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,870
It can analyze human emotions

334
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,760
and communicate like a human.

335
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,060
I will definitely make it

336
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,400
when I grow up.

337
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,750
Make it?

338
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,050
The cartoon says that

339
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,260
robots are hard to make.

340
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,780
Why would you make it in the future?

341
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,210
Because I have been

342
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,200
playing alone all the time.

343
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,090
It is my good friend I drew.

344
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,760
At that time I thought

345
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,910
it would be better

346
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,400
if it wasn't on paper.

347
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,250
If it becomes true,

348
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
it can accompany me

349
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,550
and more people.

350
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,130
So cool.

351
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,170
It's your friend,

352
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,410
and it's also mine, right?

353
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,620
May I draw one too?

354
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,580
Of course.

355
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,250
Sorry.

356
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,310
My mom won't let me use my left hand.

357
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,970
Never mind.

358
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,400
Just use your left hand.

359
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,340
That’s it.

360
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,590
I'll be your mirror.

361
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,680
Forget it.

362
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,120
I figured it out.

363
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,020
So soon?

364
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,580
Women

365
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,500
don't have to waste their emotions

366
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,370
on this kind of man.

367
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,820
In order to repay

368
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,480
your love for me,

369
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,780
I decided to

370
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,590
be liberal of my money

371
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,780
and treat you to McDonald's today.

372
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,320
Tell me

373
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,320
what you want to eat.

374
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm going to

375
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,280
change my hairstyle,

376
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,230
get changed

377
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,410
and go on a date with you.

378
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,530
So soon.

379
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,280
Women

380
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,020
are all fickle.

381
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,500
Cheng, why didn’t you

382
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,410
order takeout?

383
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,920
But asked us out at night?

384
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,090
You don’t understand.

385
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,660
McDonald's delivery fee

386
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,330
is nine yuan,

387
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,920
and you can't order cones.

388
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,400
Right.

389
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,720
Let’s go.

390
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,450
Are you in a bad mood?

391
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,640
No.

392
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,450
Stop pretending in front of me.

393
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,970
Every time you're in a bad mood,

394
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,250
you eat chips with ice cream.

395
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,820
What a strange habit.

396
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,700
Is it so delicious?

397
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,050
How was your experiment

398
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,570
with Cheng?

399
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,980
Why do you have to let her

400
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,830
experiment with you

401
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,470
and prove that she doesn't like you?

402
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,680
Because what she said is unbelievable.

403
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,290
The experiment also verified this conclusion.

404
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,750
So what are you going to do next?

405
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,770
Hello, your cone is ready.

406
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,700
Okay, thanks.

407
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,140
You are welcome.

408
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,650
Take your time.

409
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,320
Let’s go.

410
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,450
Let’s go.

411
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,370
Excuse me.

412
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,230
Let me clean it up.

413
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,000
Sorry, aunt.

414
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:25,930
Wait.

415
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,050
Obviously he didn’t watch out

416
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,080
and hit me.

417
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,620
Why should I leave?

418
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,900
Su Chengcheng.

419
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,870
What are you going to do?

420
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,300
What are you going to do?

421
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,530
Senior Xiao.

422
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,790
Why are you back?

423
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,040
I just thought about it carefully.

424
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,170
Judging from the trajectory

425
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,500
of the two of us colliding,

426
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,770
it was you who hit me.

427
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,170
But I am generous.

428
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,050
I decided to share the loss with you.

429
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,730
Just now we bought four cones,

430
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,680
two large fries,

431
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,820
eight spicy chicken wings

432
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,020
and three chicken nuggets.

433
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,570
And...

434
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,140
What else?

435
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,100
Two pineapple pies.

436
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,990
Two pineapple pies.

437
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,730
A total of 121 yuan.

438
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,110
You only need to

439
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,650
give me 60 yuan.

440
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,790
Thank you.

441
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,850
Let’s go.

442
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,330
Hello, your order is ready.

443
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,590
There are four cones left, please hold on.

444
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,120
Okay.

445
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,580
Hello.

446
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,060
Hello.

447
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,100
I want a copy of

448
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,740
what the girl ordered just now.

449
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,170
Let me check.

450
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,720
Hold on.

451
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,940
She ordered four cones,

452
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,540
two large fries,

453
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,380
eight spicy chicken wings

454
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,710
three chicken nuggets and two pineapple pies.

455
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,420
Please confirm.

456
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:52,980
No problem.

457
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,750
Okay, wait a minute.

458
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
Okay, your meal is ready.

459
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,490
Thank you.

460
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,390
You are welcome.

461
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,930
For Cheng?

462
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,170
For Jiafa.

463
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:16,740
Wait.

464
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,860
Jiafa can’t eat

465
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,680
four cones.

466
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,280
Man.

467
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,300
Add more chilli, sir.

468
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,720
Okay.

469
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,510
No cilantro.

470
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,310
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

471
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,490
Cheng.

472
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,530
I think Xiao Yuhe is nice.

473
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,090
Today you asked him to transfer the money,

474
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,710
and he did

475
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
without saying a word.

476
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,660
Exactly.

477
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,380
I also don't think

478
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,570
he is as bad as you say.

479
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,100
Right.

480
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,340
But

481
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,370
it was his mistake.

482
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,090
Ying is right.

483
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,540
You two,

484
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,930
don't be fooled by his appearance.

485
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,860
That's camouflage.

486
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,070
Hold on.

487
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,900
Sixteen yuan for four cones.

488
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,200
Twenty-two yuan for two large fries.

489
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,040
Fifty-six point five.

490
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,090
Three point five.

491
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,770
I overcharged him 3.5 yuan.

492
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,490
No way!

493
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,420
I overcharged him 3.5 yuan.

494
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:08,900
Will he think that

495
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,700
I deliberately asked him

496
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,970
for 3.5 yuan more?

497
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:11,910
Maybe.

498
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,670
Perhaps.

499
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,860
What to do?

500
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,960
How about I transfer the money to him now?

501
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,490
It’s been so long.

502
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,710
It would be awkward.

503
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,750
I agree.

504
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,020
It’s originally a request for justice.

505
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,380
Why did it become like this?

506
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,700
Why did it become like this?

507
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,890
Musk.

508
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,890
I don’t understand.

509
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,400
I played a trick on her

510
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,610
in the shootout and the haunted house.

511
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,170
I also bumped on the speed bump

512
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,580
while riding an electric car.

513
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,140
I thought it would relieve my anger.

514
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,570
But

515
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,510
when I think that

516
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,580
she can't recognize me,

517
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,210
and even forget Zhu Panpan,

518
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,570
I feel upset.

519
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,090
But seeing her unhappy

520
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,590
makes me feel uncomfortable.

521
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,940
Sorry.

522
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,250
I don't know how to comfort you

523
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,290
because I have no idea of

524
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,880
what happened to you back then.

525
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,670
Think about it.

526
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,140
Would you like to go abroad with me?

527
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,760
I have decided to stay here.

528
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,800
When we were kids,

529
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
we always cared about promises.

530
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,420
But I soon discovered that...

531
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,610
I am leaving.

532
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,150
promises are actually made to be broken.

533
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,330
Even the closest people

534
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,640
will abandon you by surprise.

535
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,010
Since then,

536
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,920
I have borne the weight

537
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,030
of my mother's life alone,

538
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,100
and I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't breathe.

539
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,470
I built a high wall in my heart

540
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,540
to keep everyone out,

541
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,950
leaving only myself in my world.

542
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,430
I made a life plan

543
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,340
and pressed the accelerator button for myself.

544
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,330
In this way, I became a weirdo

545
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,870
in the eyes of my peers.

546
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,770
No one could enter my world,

547
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,120
and I didn't need them.

548
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,670
Professor.

549
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,510
Not everyone likes to make friends.

550
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,280
If he doesn't like to talk, he doesn't have to.

551
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,980
Until I met Su Chengcheng.

552
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,449
Don't you understand yet?

553
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,489
She opened a window in my high wall.

554
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,850
What’s  this?

555
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,960
Take a look and you’ll know.

556
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,610
So many...

557
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,719
One, two, seven, eight,

558
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,860
sixteen.

559
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,929
Really sixteen.

560
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,170
Where did you buy it?

561
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,360
I also want one set.

562
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,780
I have no idea.

563
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,659
It was a gift from my dad

564
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,380
when I was a kid.

565
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,949
You must like it very much.

566
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,280
What a cool gift.

567
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,190
I give you

568
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,850
the most precious gift.

569
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,980
Take this and you're

570
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,820
my best friend.

571
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,750
And I

572
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,750
used all my courage

573
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,860
to make an agreement with her to be good friends for a lifetime.

574
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,800
I even

575
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,220
changed my life plan for her.

576
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,080
But maybe

577
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,620
we all have the courage to make a promise,

578
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,580
but not necessarily the ability

579
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,900
to keep it.

580
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,100
Son.

581
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,380
The results of Mathematical Olympiad came out.

582
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,570
You got the first place in the exam.

583
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,210
You did a good job.

584
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,970
Really good.

585
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,840
A school in Haicheng

586
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,220
has contacted me.

587
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,340
They want you to skip a grade

588
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,120
and go to junior high.

589
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,520
And the school also promised

590
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,350
to give you a scholarship.

591
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,460
It is a great opportunity.

592
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,070
Change your last name

593
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,500
to mine.

594
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,570
I've already thought of a name for you.

595
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,890
Xiao Yuhe.

596
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,930
What do you think?

597
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,530
I won’t change my name.

598
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,580
I contacted the teacher

599
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,580
to report with you.

600
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,230
I don't want to change my name, skip a grade,

601
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,180
or transfer to another school.

602
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,350
Mom, I don't want to transfer to another school.

603
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,350
I want to stay here.

604
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,460
This is the first time

605
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,580
I have made a decision for myself.

606
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,280
At that moment,

607
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,740
I felt like

608
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,850
I was a valiant knight,

609
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,600
fighting the whole world

610
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,290
to protect the precious treasure.

611
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,240
But soon I found out that

612
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,510
the agreement to be a good friend for a lifetime

613
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,870
that was extremely precious to me

614
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,650
was so cheap

615
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,490
with Su Chengcheng.

616
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,900
Here, let’s go.

617
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,420
Hello, everyone.

618
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,910
This is our new classmate.

619
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,670
His name is Xiao Yuhe.

620
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,660
I hid back to my high wall,

621
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,360
but I felt something

622
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,600
I had never felt before...

623
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,560
Help him if you can.

624
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,720
Loneliness.

625
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,810
Sit there.

626
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,250
I left quietly

627
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,700
without saying goodbye to her.

628
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,380
Today’s topic

629
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,380
is mainly about...

630
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,540
I continued to

631
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,980
execute my life plan

632
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,520
as meticulously as a robot.

633
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,260
I have always followed my mother's arrangement,

634
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,960
including

635
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,430
writing with my right hand.

636
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,150
e and f.

637
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,650
Now it’s needed

638
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,620
the value

639
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,800
of b.

640
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,900
a plus d equals to b.

641
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,140
But there seems to be another me

642
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,940
who can't help but think of her.

643
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,430
Will she remember me?

644
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,550
Will she be mad at me

645
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,560
for leaving without saying goodbye?

646
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Will she make an appointment with others

647
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,200
to be good friends for a lifetime

648
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,160
as easily as before?

649
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,010
No.

650
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,590
I can't think about her.

651
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,430
I have always been the best student.

652
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,360
I will always remember

653
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,160
this lesson.

654
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,190
Don't trust Su Chengcheng.

655
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,590
I didn't expect

656
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,100
to meet her again that day.

657
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,920
She is still as risible as before,

658
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,720
like a sun.

659
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,710
At that moment,

660
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,820
I forgot the warnings to myself

661
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,730
for so many years.

662
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,470
I approached her with trepidation,

663
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
guessing her first words

664
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,790
after our reunion.

665
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,360
Watch out.

666
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,960
Are you okay?

667
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,470
Yes.

668
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,430
I didn't expect that the way she looked at me

669
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,220
was completely like looking at a stranger.

670
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,280
We are almost there.

671
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,210
Let's go to the back door.

672
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,380
So many people.

673
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,730
It turned out that

674
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,860
her appearance was just to

675
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,160
prove that truth again.

676
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,510
Never trust Su Chengcheng.
