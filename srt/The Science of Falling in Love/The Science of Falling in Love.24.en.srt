[Episode 24]

4
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,370
I want to

5
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,560
build my own team

6
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,030
and enter the BCI Competition.

7
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,490
Do you need anything from me?

8
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,670
Ying.

9
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,450
I respect that

10
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,050
you have your own standpoint.

11
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
But the reason I believe in Xiao Yuhe

12
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,240
is because I know

13
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
what kind of person he is.

14
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,980
He won't be so impulsive

15
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,100
to hurt others.

16
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,350
Isn't the video

17
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,730
the most direct evidence?

18
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,890
You're right.

19
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,610
Video is

20
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,590
the most direct evidence.

21
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,380
In that year's competition,

22
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,920
Xiao Yuhe never touched the robot,

23
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,580
so it was impossible for him

24
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,440
to replace the components.

25
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
I didn't come to you and tell you this

26
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,110
to prove anything.

27
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,190
I did this only because you are Ying.

28
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,830
Isn't this Musk's code

29
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,920
that was tampered with before?

30
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,250
Why did Lin Ying send this?

31
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
She's not going to expose

32
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,659
who did this, is she?

33
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,830
But where did she get the clue?

34
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,610
Sorry, everyone.

35
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,500
I am the one

36
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,010
who changed the code

37
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,030
and caused the accident to happen.

38
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,490
It is because

39
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,760
I was impulsive and ignorant

40
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,090
that all the bad things

41
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,580
happened afterwards.

42
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,450
I will explain everything

43
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,810
to the organizing committee

44
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,670
and withdraw from the competition

45
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,960
in the hope to exchange for the team's

46
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,490
qualification to re-enter the competition.

47
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,010
I am sorry.

48
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,470
Lin Ying.

49
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,510
You are really talented.

50
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,180
Join my team next year.

51
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,490
I will definitely

52
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,270
enter the competition next year,

53
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,700
but by then

54
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,400
my brother and I

55
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,520
will probably be your biggest rivals.

56
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,040
Is Lin You still making robots?

57
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,050
Did you figure it out a long time ago?

58
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,090
You siblings like to

59
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,880
add the same suffixes when writing code.

60
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,180
I realized it afterwards.

61
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,560
Back then,

62
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,190
thank you for taking full responsibility of everything

63
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,350
for my brother.

64
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,620
He really was

65
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,350
so competitive

66
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,170
that he touched the robots

67
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,410
before the competition.

68
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,880
If you hadn't

69
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,090
stepped in,

70
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,160
based on his personality,

71
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,400
I couldn't have imagined

72
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,600
what terrible things would have happened

73
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,580
in the end.

74
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,670
What has passed is not important.

75
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,010
Tell your brother that

76
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,400
it's time to play games with me.

77
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,610
This is important.

78
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,890
Goodbye.

79
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,540
I understand that when you face the girl you like,

80
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,770
you get nervous

81
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
and are afraid to approach her.

82
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,660
But Zhang Li, please keep in mind

83
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,680
that you are a great person.

84
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,900
So please be confident

85
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,510
when facing Zhao Yiran,

86
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
although she always acts like

87
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,350
she's giving you the cold shoulder.

88
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,850
Yiran,

89
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll be extra nice to you.

90
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,610
Who asks you to be nice to me?

91
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,860
Don't follow me.

92
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Musk. Musk.

93
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,120
When

94
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,670
the girl you like sends you a message

95
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,620
asking if you are there,

96
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,490
how should you answer it?

97
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,840
If you have low EQ,

98
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,010
tell her: yes.

99
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
If you have high EQ,

100
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,230
call her without hesitation.

101
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,580
What...

102
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,430
Move, move.

103
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,450
Musk.

104
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,400
Why did girls

105
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,720
only reply to me with "LOL"

106
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,040
after I told them jokes?

107
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,260
LOL.

108
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,350
Don't make the mistake of thinking you're funny,

109
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,770
when they say "LOL" it means they really have nothing else to say.

110
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,700
Everyone.

111
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,280
I have something to tell you.

112
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,170
Someone sent an anonymous letter

113
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,060
to the organizing committee

114
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,160
confirming that

115
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,890
the competition accident 3 years ago

116
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,850
had nothing to do with

117
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,310
Xiao Yuhe.

118
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,120
That's great.

119
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,310
The organizing committee also

120
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,180
sent out an investigation team immediately.

121
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,910
After careful examination

122
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,700
and with reference to the analysis of previous data,

123
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,240
the accident with Musk

124
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,100
was purely accidental.

125
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
The research and development of Musk

126
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,570
is of great value.

127
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,940
Now the conclusion is:

128
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,060
Mr. Xiao Yuhe,

129
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,320
you are a qualified contestant.

130
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,420
Our qualification for the final round

131
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,650
has been reinstated.

132
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Great.

133
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,890
How about

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,920
we dine out

135
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,830
and celebrate tonight?

136
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,790
Dine out. Dine out.

137
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,430
Sure.

138
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Prof. Du, come with us.

139
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,230
I have several

140
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,200
senior students

141
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,180
whose theses have some problems.

142
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,230
I need to help them with the revision.

143
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,650
So I can’t go with you.

144
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,430
Prof. Du.

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,990
Thank you.

146
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,330
Don't drink too much.

147
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,760
Prof. Du, thank you so much.

148
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,030
Prof. Du, goodbye.

149
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,510
Let us carouse.

150
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,910
Yes, yes.

151
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,950
Yes, yes.

152
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,000
Emotions identified.

153
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,670
Happy. Excited. Delightful.

154
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,030
Coming. Coming.

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,390
Thank you, senior.

156
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,340
Our last 2 dishes.

157
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,770
This restaurant is too popular that

158
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,110
all the waiters are totally up to their necks.

159
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,300
Chengcheng, how about some alcohol?

160
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,750
Sure.

161
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,190
Come on.

162
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,600
Fill me a full shot.

163
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,200
Just give her a little.

164
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,630
That's enough.

165
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,250
Thank you for your effort.

166
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,890
Guys.

167
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm the oldest among us,

168
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,640
so let me do a toast.

169
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,490
I'm going to apply for a patent

170
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
as soon as the competition is over.

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,450
I hope to graduate this year

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,930
and successfully find a good job.

173
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,400
Good.

174
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,510
Then I'll go to the competition site

175
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,920
and meet Ph.D. Advisor Li,

176
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,210
and I'll ask him to accept me as an apprentice.

177
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,090
Good. Good.

178
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm content with what I have now.

179
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll choose brain-computer interface

180
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,730
as my future research direction.

181
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,470
I want to become the most enviable couple

182
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,510
with Xixi.

183
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,950
For the following competition,

184
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,060
I hope everyone will put personal safety

185
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,730
before winning.

186
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,820
Good. Good.

187
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,900
I hope to find

188
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,080
a good-looking boyfriend

189
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,640
like Senior Xiao

190
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,440
at the competition site in the future.

191
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,500
In your dreams.

192
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,840
In my dreams?

193
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,470
OK.

194
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,430
Then I hope everyone's wish

195
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,110
will come true without a hitch.

196
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,710
Come on. Come on.

197
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Cheers.

198
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,680
What do you want?

199
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,780
Yuhe.

200
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,710
Don't go too far.

201
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,500
Yeah.

202
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,640
It's too much.

203
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,220
Then I'll make a toast.

204
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,910
Thank you for

205
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,380
your continuous support.

206
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,090
And we are going to win

207
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,400
for sure.

208
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,410
Keep going.

209
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,570
Working hard.

210
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,110
For the competition.

211
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,840
Go! Go! Go!

212
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,550
Just do it.

213
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,540
Come on.

214
00:14:59,630 --> 00:14:59,990
Cheers.

215
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,420
Have a try on these prunes.

216
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,640
There is a good story behind them.

217
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,140
They were given to me by Gu Chen.

218
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,880
He made a pun out of it.

219
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,070
Alright,

220
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,610
no more nonsense.

221
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,600
Today we, Room 306,

222
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,200
are having

223
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,820
our one and only biggest meeting of all time.

224
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,440
Why?

225
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,750
Because our Miss Su Chengcheng

226
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,230
is going to have a competition tomorrow.

227
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,520
So the whole Room 306 wishes you

228
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,080
success in advance!

229
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,460
Thanks.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,450
Cheers.

231
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,910
You look like you're drinking erguotou.

232
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
I'm drinking orange juice with momentum.

233
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,240
Everyone,

234
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,210
do you have other plans?

235
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,000
You go first.

236
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,560
OK.

237
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,490
I'll be honest with you.

238
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,990
I just hope my comic

239
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,290
can get published successfully.

240
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,010
How's that?

241
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,220
As for me...

242
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,650
I just want to get a direct admission for postgraduate.

243
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,380
Forget it. Forget it.

244
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,900
Even if I don't get that,

245
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
I can definitely get in with my own grades.

246
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,370
What a humblebrag.

247
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,599
Then I hope my brother and I

248
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,829
can successfully enter

249
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,440
next year's BCI Competition.

250
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,589
You will.

251
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,690
What about you?

252
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,880
My wish is for

253
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,810
all your wishes

254
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,920
to come true.

255
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,510
You said it so melodramatically

256
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,780
that I almost cried.

257
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,440
Cheers.

258
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
[Final Round]

259
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
[National College Students' BCI Competition]

260
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,380
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,460
Welcome to

262
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,960

BCI Competition.

265
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,750
Today, we will determine

266
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,250
who will take first, second, and third place

267
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,280
on this stage

268
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,680
in a live defense.

269
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,760
We hope that

270
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,950
all of our contestants

271
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,630
will showcase themselves today

272
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,440
and demonstrate the charm of the brain-computer interface.

273
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,680
Alright. Our competition

274
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,360
officially begins.

275
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,110
Let's welcome the first team of contestants.

276
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,410
How did your team come up with

277
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,810
the idea for the app

278
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
"Order All You Want"?

279
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
If people have our app…

280
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,400
This idea is good.

281
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,400
It's practical.

282
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,800
By analyzing their physiological data

283
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,190
such as brainwaves,

284
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,580
we can know exactly

285
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,070
what they want to eat.

286
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,680
Thank you.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,120
This one is great.

288
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,840
OK.

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,170
The first team gained 92 points.

290
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,910
[Score of "Order All You Want"]

291
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,410
Thank you.

292
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,190
What's so special

293
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,460
about your Brainwave Sleep Eye Mask?

294
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,940
Our eye mask

295
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
can use AI to compose music

296
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,160
based on the user's

297
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,660
real-time brainwaves

298
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,720
and create the most appropriate music

299
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,700
to help them fall asleep.

300
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,590
The second team gained 95 points.

301
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,950
Next, let's welcome the contestants of Southeast University of Science and Technology

302
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,600
to introduce their work.

303
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,080
Come on, it's us.

304
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,780
Go for it. Go for it.

305
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,110
Hello, everyone.

306
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,730
I am Xiao Yuhe,

307
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,650
the representative contestant of Southeast University of Science and Technology.

308
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,390
Hello, everyone.

309
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,970
I am Su Chengcheng,

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,460
the representative contestant of Southeast University of Science and Technology.

311
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,120
Although the organizing committee

312
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,330
has accepted your appeal,

313
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,230
as a product

314
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,330
that had a malfunction before,

315
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,830
we, the organizing committee,

316
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
feel it is still necessary

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,080
for your team to give an explanation

318
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,960
of the cause of the incident.

319
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,860
Musk malfunctioned

320
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,370
during the preliminary round,

321
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,450
and I would like to

322
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
apologize to everyone here.

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,440
However,

324
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,180
this also gave us

325
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,370
a great insight.

326
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,420
An insight?

327
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,310
Are you justifying

328
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,450
your previous malfunctions?

329
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,880
3 years ago, you smashed robots.

330
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,160
Did that give you any insight?

331
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,240
How can an emotionally unstable person

332
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,340
make

333
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,330
a good Caretaker Robot?

334
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,280
Do you think it's easy

335
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,200
to make Emotion Robots?

336
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,670
Your Emotional Escort Robot

337
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,020
didn't comfort people, but offended them instead.

338
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,470
What a rare sight.

339
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,450
Xiao Yuhe.

340
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,930
I heard that you have mental disorders.

341
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,070
Are you sure

342
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,080
there is no problem

343
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,980
with the Emotional Escort Robot you made?

344
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,160
Son.

345
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,450
Son.

346
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,520
Son.

347
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,720
Cheer up.

348
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,990
You are the best.

349
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,260
I will answer the journalists' questions first.

350
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,780
It's true that my personality

351
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,040
has deficiencies.

352
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,800
It's hard for me

353
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,870
to directly express

354
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,100
my true feelings.

355
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,770
I don't even know

356
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,440
if I'm happy

357
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,860
or sad.

358
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,530
If I like something

359
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,870
or hate it.

360
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,780
I know it clearly

361
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,770
that this problem is rooted

362
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,260
in the environment I grew up in.

363
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,370
During my adolescence,

364
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,570
I was not allowed to

365
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,640
express my emotions or feelings

366
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,820
too much.

367
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,850
Being too excited was not allowed;

368
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,470
Being too sad was not allowed;

369
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,840
Being too timid was not allowed;

370
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,030
Being too weak was not allowed;

371
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,260
I was told that

372
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,380
these emotions

373
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,530
were worthless.

374
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,420
It was not until I was an adult that I realized

375
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,490
how much damage

376
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,570
repressing these feelings had done to me.

377
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,480
Growing up in such an environment

378
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,050
made me realize

379
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
how important

380
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,520
an Emotional Caretaker Robot is

381
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,360
to a person who yearns for solicitude,

382
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,910
care,

383
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,230
and kindness.

384
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,740
I used to think that

385
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,420
I was the only lonely person

386
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,730
in the world.

387
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,150
As I gradually grew up,

388
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,620
I met more and more people,

389
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,540
and experienced more and more complicated matters,

390
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,640
then I realized that

391
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,970
I'm not the only lonely person

392
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,660
in the world.

393
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,210
As long as we live on this planet,

394
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,530
we are all lonely.

395
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,030
The people in the middle

396
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,320
are my lab mates.

397
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,560
It is because

398
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,160
they were with me

399
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,040
that I was able to complete

400
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,040
this project, Musk.

401
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,020
One day,

402
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,830
when I saw them

403
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,280
tell Musk some things

404
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,170
they couldn't share with anyone else,

405
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,250
I realized that

406
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,090
deep down,

407
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,240
everyone has their own secrets.

408
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,920
Today, they are willing to share

409
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,930
their secrets with us,

410
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,700
and they'll show us personally that

411
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,080
we all need

412
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,000
a confidant that we can talk to,

413
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,210
about something

414
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,330
we can't let others know,

415
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,070
nor are willing to share with others.

416
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,430
Hello, Musk.

417
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,290
I am Zhu Jiafa.

418
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,130
I've been studying for almost 30 years

419
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,530
since I came into this world,

420
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,490
and this year I'll finally graduate

421
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,570
and join society.

422
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,600
To be honest, I am a little panicked.

423
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,150
But it's time.

424
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,860
Actually,

425
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,440
there is one question

426
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,490
I would like to ask you the most.

427
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,330
I can't ask Yuhe or Dongmao

428
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,510
because they don't have any EQ.

429
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,980
Well, Chengcheng's roommate,

430
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,200
whose name is Li Meizi.

431
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,380
I've only seen her a few times,

432
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:53,820
but

433
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,330
I think she's really cute.

434
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,910
If you like her, you have to tell her.

435
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,870
Do you really want to be

436
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,160
another Xiao Yuhe?

437
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,230
Take actions, young man.

438
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,570
What about...

439
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,360
what about our promise to stay single together?

440
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,660
Musk.

441
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,510
Actually,

442
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,280
I quite envy

443
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,420
every one of them.

444
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,210
Because they all

445
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,210
seem to know what they want to do.

446
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,140
Unlike them,

447
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,890
I don't know

448
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,490
what I'm going to do in the future.

449
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,890
At the time, my parents chose this major for me

450
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,530
and said that it would be easy for me to find a job after graduation.

451
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,650
In fact, up to now,

452
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,000
I still don't know

453
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,230
if I like this major or not.

454
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,450
Handsome boy,

455
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,140
you don't need to envy others,

456
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,430
because everyone

457
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,950
is an independent and excellent individual.

458
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,640
Musk,

459
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,060
I met Ph.D. Advisor Li today.

460
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,040
I don't know

461
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,150
if he is interested in me.

462
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,510
But if he isn't,

463
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,970
then it might be a good thing as well.

464
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,520
My mother called me yesterday

465
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,940
and told me that she wanted me to come back home

466
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,000
and take the civil service exam.

467
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,250
She said the doctoral scholarship

468
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,100
is not much.

469
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,230
Because we can't afford

470
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,460
to buy a house in Haicheng.

471
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,470
I also don't have enough money to get married.

472
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,330
Musk, what do you think?

473
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,980
Money is not

474
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,550
a measure of one's success.

475
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,390
Do what you love

476
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,740
and follow your heart.

477
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,870
Musk.

478
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,050
I want to tell you something in secret.

479
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,930
It's about Zhang Li.

480
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,620
Although he is kind of simple and honest,

481
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,480
but I think he is also cute.

482
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,740
My God.

483
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,880
What am I thinking?

484
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,310
Musk,

485
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,650
am I intimidating?

486
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,070
Why do people always look like

487
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,420
they are scared of me?

488
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,980
In fact, I would also like to

489
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,250
mingle with everyone,

490
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,220
such as joking

491
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,410
and playing with them.

492
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,170
But I'm also afraid.

493
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,880
What if I speak too seriously

494
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,750
and cause an awkward silence?

495
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,590
Won't that be embarrassing?

496
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,470
Sometimes I quite envy Chengcheng.

497
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,260
She's silly,

498
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,800
but

499
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,980
she's also simple

500
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,780
and straightforward.

501
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,910
I hope there is someone

502
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,240
who can always protect her.

503
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,670
Just be a capricious little girl.

504
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,690
Don't grow up.

505
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,150
Growing up is terrible.

506
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,540
Musk.

507
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,900
I am Gu Chen.

508
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,730
I want to do research with Xixi

509
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,040
after I graduate.

510
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,750
So I want to

511
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,250
help her professionally.

512
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,190
So lately I have been staying up late to study.

513
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,350
Isn't that ridiculous?

514
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,530
The pressure of love

515
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,110
has become the pressure of academic study;

516
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,960
the pressure of academic study

517
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,440
is also my pressure of love.

518
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,440
Even if I can't catch up with her professionally,

519
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
I won't hold her back.

520
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,990
Musk, I can do it, right?

521
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,250
Hello, Musk.

522
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,860
I am Wang Lunye.

523
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,320
People call me Mr. Lunye.

524
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,720
I don't know

525
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,820
why they call me that,

526
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,790
Maybe because

527
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,630
my unique handsomeness

528
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,250
and charisma.

529
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,700
Say, I originally came back this time

530
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,350
to find Chengcheng...

531
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,140
my Miss Chengcheng to talk about our good old times.

532
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,390
How could I expect a guy

533
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,050
named Xiao Panpan to jump out of nowhere?

534
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,070
Do you know how upset I was?

535
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,220
The two of them are lovey-dovey one moment

536
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,290
and ignore each other the next,

537
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,420
which annoys me

538
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,270
a lot.

539
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,090
I'm going to go abroad.

540
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,020
Again.

541
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,820
I finally got to know

542
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,590
these good friends,

543
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,000
and I'm going to miss them.

544
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,180
In fact,

545
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,640
come to think of it,

546
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,720
I've been making Musk

547
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,860
for 11 years.

548
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,150
I remember that when I was 10,

549
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,750
Su Chengcheng and I

550
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,850
drew the draft of Musk together.

551
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,320
Then,

552
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,810
there were

553
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,800
some misunderstanding between us,

554
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,930
so we parted ways.

555
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,440
But one day,

556
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,470
I felt very lonely

557
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,060
and I wanted to talk to someone,

558
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,190
but I couldn't find anyone.

559
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,660
That was when I made up my mind

560
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,210
that I had to make Musk a reality.

561
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
At least when I wanted to talk,

562
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,880
someone would listen to me talk;

563
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,850
when I wanted to complain,

564
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,820
someone would listen to me complain.

565
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,850
Later I found out that

566
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,880
everyone

567
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,640
needs a confidant

568
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,820
like this.

569
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,670
Musk is made based on

570
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,220
Miss Su Chengcheng.

571
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,000
She is a good listener

572
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,020
and is good at enlightening others.

573
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,900
I believe that

574
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,990
she can influence

575
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,320
more people like me.

576
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,990
As

577
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,160
an Emotional Escort Robot,

578
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,310
Musk

579
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,110
will be

580
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,160
our most loyal companion.

581
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,260
Finally, I would also like to say that

582
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,230
everyone

583
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,130
should cherish

584
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,450
their friends, partners,

585
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,190
and also families.

586
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,760
Because only when they are around you

587
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,480
can you feel

588
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,170
alive

589
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,620
and the hope of living.

590
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,350
Thank you.

591
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,090
Come to catch me.

592
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,230
Got you.

593
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,300
Wait for me.

594
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,320
Hurry up.

595
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,870
Zhu Panpan, slow down.

596
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,640
Didn't I say I had a surprise for you?

597
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,870
Close your eyes.

598
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,830
3, 2, 1.

599
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:58,740
Look up.

600
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,190
You still remember?

601
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,550
Of course I do.
