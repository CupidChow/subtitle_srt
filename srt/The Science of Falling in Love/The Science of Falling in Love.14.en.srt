4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,060
Wait here for a bit.

5
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,780
I'll make you some medicine.

6
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,310
What did you two just say?

7
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,620
It' none of your business.

8
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,370
Could it be that you like him?

9
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,710
It' none of your business.

10
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,400
I'll make you some medicine, wait here.

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,860
I...

12
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,770
Go ahead.

13
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,560
I'll take care of him.

14
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm a bit hungry, do you have anything to eat?

15
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,329
Well...

16
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,210
Why does my stomach hurt, or is it because I'm hungry?

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,880
Hoe about you bring it over for me?

18
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,030
It hurts.

19
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,380
How about... how about you feed it to me?

20
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,640
Slow down.

21
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,740
There really is something wrong

22
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,570
with your friend,

23
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,850
you should have him checked thoroughly.

24
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,280
See you in the afternoon at the mall.

25
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,120
Su Chengcheng.

26
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,650
He picked on me.

27
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,170
You are crazy.

28
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,050
Why would he pick on you all of a sudden?

29
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,090
He's jealous.

30
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,320
He's jealous that I'm handsome.

31
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,510
He's jealous that I get along well with you.

32
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
Does your stomachache

33
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,800
infect your brain as well?

34
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,100
How could you spill them

35
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,870
all over the place?

36
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,660
Take your medicine.

37
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,690
D-do I really have to?

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,750
I'm feeling better.

39
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,670
It's not bitter. Take it.

40
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,550
Do I have to?

41
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,430
How old are you?

42
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,409
Are you scared of taking medicine?

43
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,230
I... I'm having a stomachache.

44
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,960
I'll go to the restroom.

45
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,430
Anipop.

46
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,570
Have you finished your thesis?

47
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,270
Have you done playing with your frogs?

48
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,660
Senior Xixi, where is the meal you promised me?

49
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
How could Yuhe take so long

50
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,960
to give away an e-bike?

51
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,630
It's been so long and he hasn't given it away.

52
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,650
Don't worry about it for him.

53
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,570
But I just saw that Xiao

54
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,830
seems to be sending the keys

55
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,010
directly to Su Chengcheng.

56
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,570
Is he going to confess?

57
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,860
Nice.

58
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,470
What a great idea.

59
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:55,880
Confess?

60
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,420
How treacherous.

61
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,660
Wang Lunye, are you pretending to be sick?

62
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,520
Chengcheng,

63
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,390
do I look like

64
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,310
that kind of person

65
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,050
who jokes about their own health?

66
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,480
Your good friend is feeling better,

67
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,910
shouldn't you feel happy for him?

68
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,900
You better are.

69
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,700
How about hanging out with me this afternoon?

70
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm busy.

71
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,460
It's just hanging out, nothing else.

72
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,390
Besides, I haven't bought a lot of stuff.

73
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm not available this afternoon.

74
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,220
Not available?

75
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,180
Do you have a date with someone?

76
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,600
It couldn't be

77
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,810
Xiao Yuhe, the person you hate the most, could it?

78
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,970
It's none of your business.

79
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you hiding something from me?

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,530
You are too nosy.

81
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,680
Do you even have

82
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,730
such a pretty girl in our lab?

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,090
Shut up.

84
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,370
Will you introduce her to me?

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,840
Shut up.

86
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,190
That is my senior, Zhang Xixi.

87
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,150
Hello, Xixi.

88
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,350
Hello, I'm Wang Lunye.

89
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,900
Are you from our lab?

90
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,620
No, no, I'm not.

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,370
Your belt is loosened.

92
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,730
It is?

93
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,700
Are you nuts?

94
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,880
W-wait for me!

95
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,760
Senior Xixi, Chengcheng.

96
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,230
Where are you going?

97
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,950
Gu Chen.

98
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,240
Who is this handsome guy?

99
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
This is my class monitor, Gu Chen.

100
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,940
This is my childhood friend, Wang Lunye.

101
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,900
He's from the lab next door.

102
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,270
Hello.

103
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,970
Hello. Hello.

104
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,030
Chengcheng's childhood friend

105
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,100
does have a personality, too.

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Let's go together.

107
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:16,920
Let's go.

108
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

109
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,990
Gu Chen, why are you back?

110
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,730
I helped Senior Xixi

111
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,620
solve a minor problem,

112
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,789
so she's treating me.

113
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,510
How's your Anipop

114
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,450
going?

115
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,750
I'm near Level 1314.

116
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,340
More than 1300 levels? Man.

117
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,280
Aren't you persistent?

118
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,990
There's always

119
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,040
someone competing with me in the game,

120
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,310
so I've reached such a high level

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,380
without realizing.

122
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,590
It's still awesome.

123
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,700
People with your intelligence

124
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,870
can't play such puzzle games.

125
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,690
Can you play?

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,790
How is it going?

127
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,450
Is Wang Lunye OK?

128
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,390
I don't know if he's OK,

129
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,150
but I had a pretty hard time

130
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,480
this morning.

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,080
He and Xiao Yuhe

132
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,740
haven't taken a single break since they saw each other.

133
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,710
I don't know

134
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,890
if they were arch-enemies in their last life.

135
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,870
Wang Lunye said this, too.

136
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,700
He said that

137
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,100
Xiao Yuhe was his arch-enemy.

138
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,670
I'll wait for you

139
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,720
at the entrance of the mall.

140
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,630
Chengcheng.

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,610
Have you ever thought about

142
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,410
what you would have done

143
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,290
if you and Xiao Yuhe had kissed for real?

144
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,630
I have no idea.

145
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
Then, have you ever thought that

146
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,430
if Xiao Yuhe's repeated invitations

147
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
to hang out

148
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,300
are not just

149
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,650
for clarification,

150
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,520
but also seeking for a further relationship?

151
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,220
I have no idea.

152
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,490
Are you sure we'll eat at this place?

153
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,330
Yeah.

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,540
Their wontons are particularly good.

155
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,750
You've got to try them when they arrive.

156
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,380
They're delicious.

157
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,670
Thank you for the topic.

158
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:34,970
I was deeply inspired

159
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,230
by that idea,

160
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,820
and the experiment also proved that

161
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
it's efficient.

162
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,590
I'm glad that I could help.

163
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,990
Since your topic went well,

164
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,200
let's

165
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,020
celebrate

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
with a toast.

167
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,100
You came prepared.

168
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

169
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
L-let it be this way.

170
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,670
Here, kids,

171
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,910
your wontons are ready.

172
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,370
Thank you.

173
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Thank you, mister.

174
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,300
Mister,

175
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,730
please give me a bit more coriander.

176
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,380
Sure.

177
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,730
OK, Thank you.

178
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,810
Here you are.

179
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,730
Knock yourself out.

180
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,800
Thank you.

181
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,580
I'll put more in yours.

182
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,120
Let's dig in.

183
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,920
Where are we going later?

184
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,380
To a place worth looking forward to.

185
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,850
A place worth looking forward to?

186
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,360
What a coincidence.

187
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,680
You didn't expect me, right?

188
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,540
Weren't your friend

189
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,840
feeling unwell earlier?

190
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,950
Why is he coming, too?

191
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,150
He?

192
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,480
Who knows?

193
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
Senior Xiao, aren't you just hanging out?

194
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,180
It won't hurt if I tag along.

195
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,590
I just don't want you to tag along.

196
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,190
Or

197
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,140
did you prepare something special?

198
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,250
Chengcheng.

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
There's a newly opened milk tea store ahead.

200
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,060
I've heard that their milk tea is really good.

201
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,300
Let's have a try.

202
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,060
Let's go.

Senior Xiao.

206
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,450
Are you sure this is the place?

207
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,390
Is this the 10 years old newly opened store

208
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,280
that you talked about?

209

Wang Lunye.

211

If you don't want to have its milk tea,

212
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,910
get lost.

213
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,740
I'll leave. I'll...

214
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,950
Let's go.

215
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,780
Hello,

216
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,050
what would you like to order?

217
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,160
I'd like to have the gold osmanthus milk tea with taro balls.

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,750
It's full of ingredients you like.

219
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,410
Your boyfriend has a really good taste.

220
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,850
This is our new product,

221
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,420
but

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,250
there's only one cup left.

223

224

We'll have that.

225
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,090
Would you like to share?

226
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,550
This is the newly opened milk tea shop

227
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
in this mall.

228
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,340
It definitely tastes better than yours.

229
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,690
Remember to transfer me the fee.

230
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,640
This is the last cup of this shop,

231
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,300
go ahead.

and I've joined their membership.

How about I take you there and have a look?

249
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,750
What newly opened

250
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,720

251
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,630
Maybe it's another

252
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,760
10 years old store.

253
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,010
What do you want?

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,140
You...

255
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,220
I'll have some fresh air.

257

Can you stop following me?

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,190
What do you mean I'm following you?

259
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,150
It's not your store after all.

260
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,670
I just want to tell you.

261
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,900
Do you feel uncomfortable

262
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,870
because you failed to give something to someone?

263
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,099
What do you mean?

264
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,119
I don't mean anything.

265
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,780
I've already told Chengcheng

266
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,550
that I'll buy her a new e-bike later.

267
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,130
You'll buy it for her?

268
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,470
My dad is rich.

269
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,270
When he gives me back my card,

270
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,430
I can buy it for her.

271
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,270
You spend your family's money.

272
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,450
What a parasite.

273
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,730
How about this?

274
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,950
Let's compete on the VR roller coaster,

275
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,020
and the loser leaves.

276
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,810
This is it?

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,130
Come on.

278
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,670
You'll sit in front me. Let's go.

279
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,310
Who's afraid of you?

280
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,000
If you feel afraid,

281
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,980
just hurry and get off.

282
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,370
I won't laugh at you.

283
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,430
Senior,

284
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,000
where is Wang Lunye?

285
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,260
He's playing games inside.

286
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,030
He's so concentrated.

287
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,630
Chengcheng.

288
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,850
Let's have a walk.

289
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,740
There's something I want to tell you.

290
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:43,890
OK.

291
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,550
What if Xiao Yuhe's repeated invitations

292
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,710
to hang out

293
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,430
are not just

294
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,760
for clarification,

295
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,620
but also for seeking a further relationship?

296
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,280
I rode your bike

297
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,610
down to your dorm

298
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,870
the other day

299
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,220
and found that

300
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,000
your bike was falling apart,

301
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,470
so I've picked an e-bike

302
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,450
for you.

303
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,790
It doesn't have

304
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,970
a brushless DC electric motor from Bosch,

305
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,160
its power doesn't reach 1001

306
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
to 1500 watts,

307
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,140
and its speed is definitely less than

308
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,420
45 kilometers per hour,

309
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,300
but they said

310
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,720
all the girls would like it.

311
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,210
Did you

312
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,650
pick an e-bike specifically for me?

313
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,090
We should hurry and go there.

314
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,700
Senior,

315
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,470
I also have something to tell you.

316
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,530
Let's talk while sitting down.

317
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,110
That day,

318
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,820
I... I mean the day I was drunk.

319
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,140
That day,

320
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,940
the alcohol went to my head and I was a bit impulsive,

321
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,530
so I did something irrational.

322
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,610
Did we kiss?

323
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,520
But we

324
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,590
have to check the e-bike now.

325
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,140
Or else the store is going to close.

326
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,120
It closes at 9.

327
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,460
Check the e-bike?

328
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,610
Because that e-bike is important to you.

329
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,390
It's not important to me.

330
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,050
It is.

331
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,630
Your bike is falling apart,

332
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,710
and you can't ride it anymore.

333
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,830
Chengcheng.

334
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,920
Su Chengcheng.

335
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,980
Why are you upset?

336
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,480
Chengcheng.

337
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,330
That store is over there.

338
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,920
See?

339
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm awesome.

340
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,390
W-wait.

341
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,150
Wait, where is that guy?

342
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,900
Didn't you go on a date?

343
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,090
What's wrong?

344
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,380
Li Meizi.

345
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,340
Xiao Yuhe hasn't changed a bit.

346
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,880
He's exactly the same as before.

347
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,160
He's spouting nonsense.

348
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm speechless.

349
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,170
You are the only one I've seen

350
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,890
who can turn a date

351
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,960
into an adventure.

352
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,550
Am I incompatible with the word

353
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,230
"date"?

354
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,440
Why am I unlucky every time?

355
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,510
Have you ever heard of this song?

356
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,250
Under the bridge in front of the door,

357
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,790
there are a pack of ducks swimming by.

358
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,080
Let's hurry up and count them,

359
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,710
2, 4, 6, 7, 8.

360
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,040
Alone, alone.

361
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,420
Forever alone.

362
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
Quack, quack.

363
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,190
No, from now on it changes to

364
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,780
a song about loneliness,

365
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,240
just for the lonely you.

366
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,170
Alone, alone.

367
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,190
Quack, quack.

368
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,980
I'm so speechless.

369
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,100
I'm so speechless.

370
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,070
Are you not satisfied with

371
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,130
its color,

372
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,900
its capacity,

373
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,080
or its power?

374
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,130
You can tell me,

375
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
and I can pick another one.

376
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,470
Isn't that simple?

377
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,610
Why are you mad?

378
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,310
Well, do you need to use the bathroom?

379
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,350
If not, I'll take a shower.

380
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
Let me ask you something.

381
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,560
Shoot.

382
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,800
Do you think...

383
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,860
Forget it, keep scratching.

384
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,260
Don't use my rubbing bath towel.

385
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,910
Here comes the coriander,

386
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,320
knock yourselves out.

387
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,920
Thank you.

388
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,260
Come on, I'll put more in yours.

389
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
Let's celebrate with a toast.

390
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,390
Why are today's chips all coriander-flavored?

391
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,110
They were all purchased by Gu Chen.

392
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,940
Senior Xixi, good night.

393
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,500
Good night.

394
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,670
She added a moon.

395
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Parentheses, equal sign, then it's done.

396
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,970
Senior, you are so amazing.

397
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,590
No wonder you are the recommended postgraduate

398
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,090
as the top one in your major.

399
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,810
By the way,

400
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,050
is it really difficult to become a recommended postgraduate?

401
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,180
It mainly depends on your grade.

402
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,020
GPA certainly is the most important thing,

403
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,320
but there is another

404
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,370
important content of inspection:

405
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,640
your score rankings of individual subjects.

406
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,380
You have to be consistently

407
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,240
in the top third of the class.

408
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,800
So it seems that major exams and individual subject rankings

409
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,690
are just as important.

410
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,560
Of course they are.

411
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,040
Right, Xiaomeng,

412
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,210
aren't you going to study abroad?

413
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,450
Why are you interested in

414
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,120
postgraduate recommendation all of a sudden?

415
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,360
I just want to know more about it.

416
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,260
It can share the risk

417
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,090
and add another string to my bow.

418
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,630
Alright.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,910
What else don't you know how to do?

420
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,940
This one.

421
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:40,990
Look,

422
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,170
separately from...

423
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,710
Why does this exam preparation

424
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,960
feels like a new class preparation?

425
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,390
Is this my book?

426
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,350
Why can't I recognize

427
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,120
any of these key points?

428
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,850
Li Meizi, I think

429
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,950
maybe we have

430
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,160
completely grasped all these key points,

431
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,910
but we don't know it ourselves.

432
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,210
Let's

433
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,750
pick random key points for each other to recite

434
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,980
and write down the one's we don't know,

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,750
then when Xiaomeng comes,

436
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,270
we can just ask her.

437
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,850
It's quicker this way.

438
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,460
You are so brilliant.

439
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,160
Let's do it.

440
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,670
What's the definition of

441
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,140
a two-dimensional random variable?

442
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,700
Set E

443
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,120
as a random experiment,

444
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,080
whose sample space...

445
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,870
Look.

446
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,000
Aren't you shameful?

447
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,560
Yes, I am.

448
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,750
Just now you were so arrogant.

449
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,550
Chengcheng.

450
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,500
Meizi.

451
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,560
I'm speechless.

452
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,690
Help me.

453
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,120
Finish reciting this.

454
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,950
Have you finished it?

455
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,470
Don't you know how to recite it?

456
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,390
Aren't I testing you?

457
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,850
Let me see.

458
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,940
How can you prepare for the test like this?

459
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,110
Even I won't have the mind to study

460
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,420
if I review like this.

461
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,080
Didn't we get a handout earlier?

462
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,870
Let's prepare with the handout,

463
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,740
and it won't be that hard.

464
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,650
What handout?

465
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,630
-Why don't I know about it?
-Why don't I know about it?

466
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,730
-Can you stop mimicking me?
-Can you stop mimicking me?

467
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,620
Look.

468
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,920
[Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics]

469
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,250
Have we gotten this handout?

470
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,720
H-how...

471
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,080
How could I don't have this book?

472
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,670
It couldn't be that we've lost it, could it?

473
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,000
How could that be possible?

474
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,820
If we really lost it,

475
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,820
how could we have lost it together?

476
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,630
Could it be that the two of us

477
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,280
had never collected it in the first place?

478
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,030
Didn't you two

479
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,300
reply in the group chat?

480
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,990
Meizi said that

481
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,300
Chengcheng would collect hers as well.

482
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,390
I collected them?

483
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,560
I remember.

484
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,840
I went to the dentist that day.

485
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,600
I asked you to collect it for me.

486
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,910
The day you went to the dentist...

487
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,830
I collected them.

488
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,640
After getting them...

489
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,810
I went to the lab.

490
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:29,960
What a coincidence.

491
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,730
Don't...

492
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,160
be mad because of

493
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,740
the e-bike.

494
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,320
Who's mad because of

495
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,950
the e-bike?

496
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,340
Why are you still talking about the e-bike?

497
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,470
How about this?

498
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,030
Let's go back there later

499
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,960
and pick a new one.

500
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,450
I don't want your e-bike.

501
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,670
I don't want to hang out with you, either.

502
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,800
I'm going to study hard.

503
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,030
Don't contact me before the exam.

504
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,260
I-I won't contact you, either.

505
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,720
What about another model?

506
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,610
Look at this formula.

507
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
These 2 results are both wrong.

508
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,350
You should convert it again.

509
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,230
OK, got it.

510
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,270
Chengcheng.

511
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,750
What are you looking for?

512
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,180
That handout of

513
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,230
Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics.

514
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,500
With a yellow cover.

515
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,850
Why are these all blue-covered?

516
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
Are there 2 copies?

517
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,990
It's these two books, right?

518
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,280
I didn't pay attention.

519
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,050
These are two of my quite important books,

520
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,710
how could you use them to r-raise up your computer?

521
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,450
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

522
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,640
A-are you going to

523
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,680
have your mid-term exam soon?

524
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,100
I had a perfect score in probability theory back then.

525
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
As a token of my apology,

526
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,560
how about I pass on a few tips

527
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,930
for reviewing?

528
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,840
The first tip is

529
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,490
[The Yawning Learning Method]

530
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,720
the yawning learning method.

531
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,660
Relevant studies have shown that

532
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,480
yawning can reduce brain temperature,

533
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,360
thereby activating brain activity,

534
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,180
so as to achieve

535
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,930
twice the result with half the effort in reviewing.

536
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,710
The suspending on horizontal bar method.

537
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,430
[The Suspending on Horizontal Bar Method]

538
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,620
It can enhance cardiorespiratory function,

539
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,230
accelerate metabolism

540
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,430
and promote blood circulation.

541
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,420
It is definitely the best choice

542
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,350
for pre-exam reviewing.

543
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,700
The scribbling method.

544
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,210
[The Scribbling Method]

545
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,740
This is my ultimate weapon.

546
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,470
Scribble out everything you've reviewed

547
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,110
on every page

548
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,720
to burn your bridges

549
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,070
and force yourself

550
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,850
to remember everything.

551
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,940
I'm sorry.

552
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,070
Use mine.

553
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,860
It's fine. I can go upstairs and get mine.

554
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,100
Gu Chen.

555
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,060
Gu Chen. Wait.

556
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,920
Then

557
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,670
directly construct it successfully.

558
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,390
Then

559
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,910
this yellow area and blue area.

560
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,490
Then make it...

561
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:48,870
That's right.

562
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,870
Chengcheng.

563
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,680
What's up?

564
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,010
Did my reviewing tips

565
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,730
work?

566
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,890
Senior Jiafa,

567
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,560
what's wrong with your methods?

568
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,440
I've tried every one of them,

569
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,210
but none of them worked.

570
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,990
It's impossible.

571
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,950
Back then,

572
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,980
I used exactly these methods

573
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,760
and got the perfect score.

574
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Chengcheng.

575
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,630
Don't listen to

576
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,510
Jiafa's nonsense.

577
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,270
He used to be

578
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:11,890
a member of the

579
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,630
IMO Chinese team,

580
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,770
can you compare with him?

581
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,870
But, I...

582
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,860
Senior Jiafa,

583
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,090
why didn't you say that earlier?

584
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,030
I've scribbled out my entire handout.

585
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,960
It's impossible to use anymore.

586
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,720
If I fail,

587
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,700
I'll never forgive you.

588
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,640
You are doomed.

589
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,640
What should I do?

590
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,230
The handout of probability theory.

591
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,760
I meant well, right?

592
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,060
I...

593
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,050
Sure, you meant well,

594
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,710
-but you...
-Come on.

595
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,560
You've never thought about

596
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,360
the difference between her capacity and your capacity, right?

597
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,100
Dude.

598
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,430
You were one of the members of IMO Chinese team,

599
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,740
and she's only an undergraduate.

600
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,960
How could your methods work?

601
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,260
What's the matter?

602
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
Du Zhuanjia has told me.

603
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,680
Why did you

604
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,670
let Gu Chen get into my group?

605
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,800
Because he has a solid theoretical foundation

606
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,030
and is interested in biological experiments.

607
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,790
He can help you as well.

608
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Are you sure it's not for

609
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,340
letting Su Chengcheng get into your group instead?

610
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,909
Was this...

611
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,520
your idea

612
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,610
or Gu Chen's idea?

613
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,739
Gu Chen's.

614
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,530
Why are you here?

615
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,900
Senior Xiao told me that

616
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,390
the group switching process had been completed.

617
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,410
He wanted Chengcheng to be switched with me as soon as possible,

618
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,460
and I wanted to learn as much as I could

619
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,630
to master it sooner,

620
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,550
so I came.

621
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:19,890
OK.

622
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,300
It broke again.

623
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,790
It won't stop breaking.

624
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,670
I've got one.

625
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,550
Do you take a hair tie with you when you go out every day?

626
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,300
Just in case.

627
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,590
Greetings.

628
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,560
Do you have the handout of Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics?

629
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,390
Please stand by, I'll check it for you.

630
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,850
We have one copy remained.

631
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,020
Thank you.
