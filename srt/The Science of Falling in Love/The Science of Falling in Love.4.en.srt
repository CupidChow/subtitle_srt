4
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,920
Aunt, small steamed buns, please.

5
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, wait a moment.

6
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,250
Aunt, small steamed buns, please.

7
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,540
You're late.

8
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,500
The last small steamed buns

9
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,960
have been sold out.

10
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,970
Aunt,

11
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,400
give him these small steamed buns.

12
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,190
Pay by my card.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,250
I miscalculated last night.

14
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,620
It should be 56.5 yuan.

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,030
I overcharged you by 3.5 yuan.

16
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,700
These small steamed buns are 5 yuan.

17
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,510
1.5 yuan is my compensation to you.

18
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,300
Never mind.

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,829
It’s okay.

20
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,250
Okay, thank you.

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,350
He really took it.

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,329
Have something else.

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,590
Chengcheng,

24
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,730
come and join us.

25
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,320
Let's go to the lab after eating.

26
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,990
No need, Senior Jiafa.

27
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm afraid if I sit there to eat,

28
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,460
I'll choke.

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,250
Yuhe,

30
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,990
how did you get

31
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,660
the small steamed bun?

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,500
It's hard to buy.

33
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,440
Have one.

34
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,570
Okay.

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,720
Delicious.

36
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,410
Thank you.

37
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,920
Chengcheng, did you buy this?

38
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,460
You two are pretty close.

39
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,340
Chengcheng, next time

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,180
help me buy one cage, okay?

41
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,050
What's wrong?

42
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,480
Senior Jiafa,

43
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,120
I won't go to the lab today.

44
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,420
Please ask for a leave

45
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,100
with Du Zhuanjia for me.

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,340
Ask for a leave?

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,329
How long?

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,840
Until 2024.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
2024?

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,250
Why?

51
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,690
Because

52
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,700
there is someone in our lab

53
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,860
who is really annoying.

54
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,890
I get annoyed when I see him.

55
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,540
In 2024,

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,960
he will graduate.

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,100
After he graduates,

58
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,000
I can go there.

59
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,030
In 2024,

60
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,480
someone will graduate, too.

61
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,850
In 2024,

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,779
if someone gets accepted to graduate school again,

63
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,250
I'll be in school again.

64
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,810
Zhu, eat more.

65
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,820
Okay.

66
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,740
I suggest you keep up with

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,170
the college's requirements for postgraduate recommendation every year.

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,740
Considering that

69
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,830
less than 20% of biomedical engineering students

70
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,860
have guaranteed postgraduate education

71
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,580
in the past five years,

72
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,790
and your current performance trend,

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,940
your chances of getting postgraduate recommendation are so small

74
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,210
that can be ignored.

75
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,159
Eat more.

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,380
Bye bye.

77
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,640
How dare you humiliate me?

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,970
He humiliated me.

79
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,640
Eat more.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,970
The enemy is too strong.

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,650
Eat.

82
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,310
Jiafa,

83
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,130
it's all this time,

84
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,020
where's Chengcheng?

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,710
She took a leave of absence.

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,020
Leave?

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,330
What's she doing?

88
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,300
She said there is a very annoying person

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
in our lab.

90
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,200
She'll come back

91
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,200
after that person graduates in 2024.

92
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,270
You'll graduate in 2024, won't you?

93
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,800
You're the one that Chengcheng hates?

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,780
Go away.

95
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm very close to Chengcheng.

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,740
Don't talk nonsense.

97
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,790
Want some coffee?

98
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,660
Yes, thank you.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,600
Yuhe,

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,670
when will you graduate?

101
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,500
Yuhe,

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,550
the code keeps reporting errors.

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Why are there Chinese characters? Su Chengcheng?

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,850
Why are you typing

105
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,380
Chengcheng's name?

106
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,340
I don't think she's serious.

107
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,040
She hasn't come for so long.

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,820
There's

109
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,820
no one to clean the lab.

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,450
Yes.

111
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,140
Xiao Yuhe is right.

112
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,260
You…You, sit down.

113
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,060
Keep typing your code.

114
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,970
Can any of you tell me

115
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,420
why Su Chengcheng

116
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,330
still hasn't appeared

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,470
by this time?

118
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,700
Prof…Prof. Du,

119
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,570
I….

120
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,870
She asked me to ask you for leave this morning.

121
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,820
I forgot to tell you.

122
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,800
Then there are two problems.

123
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,900
First of all,

124
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,120
you should eat more walnuts

125
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,480
to replenish your brain,

126
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,800
which is good for improving your memory.

127
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,320
Second,

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,830
about Su Chengcheng.

129
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,580
How long does she have to ask for leave?

130
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,510
Where is her written request for leave?

131
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,830
What is the reason?

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,090
Who approved it?

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,409
I'm curious about these questions.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
I…I just

135
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,840
passed it on for her.

136
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,770
Well, you passed it on blindly.

137
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,200
You can't pass it on without a note.

138
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,490
You can only pass it on with a note.

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't keep saying yes.

140
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:53,860
Stop it.

141
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,150
Get in touch with her.

142
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,080
Tell her that

143
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,470
if she doesn't show up tomorrow,

144
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,680
never come again.

145
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,330
Okay.

146
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,670
I have a meeting and I have to go.

147
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,750
Goodbye, Prof. Du.

148
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,640
Yuhe, use your phone

149
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,820
to send her a message.

150
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,770
I don't need to go to the lab.

151
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,020
Why am I more unhappy than

152
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,860
going to the lab?

153
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,659
Prof. Du asks you

154
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,090
to come to the lab tomorrow.

155
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,890
Reply as soon as you see the message.

156
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,600
Why doesn't she reply to me?

157
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,080
It's her business to reply or not,

158
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,570
and it's her business

159
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,800
to graduate.

160
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,340
I’d better send her another message.

161
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,820
Yuhe,

162
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,170
why did Chengcheng block you?

163
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,930
[The message was sent, but was rejected.]

164
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,390
Don't you have a cell phone?

165
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,320
Must use my phone?

166
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,990
I'm afraid you didn't have breakfast,

167
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,450
so I went to Xueyuan Street

168
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,990
and bought your favorite small wontons.

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,419
I told the boss

170
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,140
to add more cilantro and no scallions.

171
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,260
Eat it now.

172
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,950
Xixi,

173
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,640
Xixi, don't be like this.

174
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,820
I really have nothing to do

175
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,540
with that girl.

176
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,060
I just regard her as my junior sister.

177
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,050
She misunderstood herself.

178
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,410
I didn't expect her to pour milk tea on you.

179
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,300
Xixi,

180
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,180
are we going to break up

181
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,000
because of this little thing?

182
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,240
I apologize to you, okay?

183
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,850
I...

184
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,930
Don't touch me.

185
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,590
Yes, I am sorry to you.

186
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
I got too close to my junior

187
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,960
But aren't you wrong about this?

188
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
What's so great about you?

189
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,020
Why do you always act like

190
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,020
you're cold

191
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,970
and superior?

192
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,990
Did you ever value our relationship?

193
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,560
Are you never sad?

194
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,820
I’ve just

195
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,500
eaten with her a few times

196
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,260
and watched a few movies with her.

197
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,790
It's all because

198
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,620
you don't spend time with me.

199
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,580
I didn't do anything wrong.

200
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,140
Are you done?

201
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,280
I was wrong.

202
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,610
My biggest mistake is that

203
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,450
I shouldn't be with you,

204
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,490
a robot

205
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,060
with no feelings.

206
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,860
I told you

207
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,190
not to spend too much money.

208
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,270
I prepared it with care,

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,340
and didn’t spend much money.

210
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,820
My biggest mistake is that

211
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,610
I shouldn't be with you,

212
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,620
a robot

213
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,210
with no feelings.

214
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,380
Can you hurry up?

215
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,120
I have to go to work.

216
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,780
Sorry.

217
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,020
I forgot my bus pass.

218
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,740
You can use your cell phone.

219
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,810
Cell phone, cell phone.

220
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,670
Where's my cell phone?

221
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,510
Cell phone.

222
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,740
Have you seen my cell phone?

223
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,320
I lost my phone.

224
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,230
I lost my phone.

225
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,420
Besides,

226
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,090
she’s good at singing.

227
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,760
Sorry to bother you.

228
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,370
Where are you going?

229
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,820
This is

230
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,020
my rice with shredded pork and green pepper, right?

231
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,150
Your sister is

232
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,890
starving to death.

233
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,380
It's really not enough for you.

234
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,990
Li Meizi,

235
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,030
after today,

236
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,490
I understand a truth.

237
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,100
What truth?

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,870
It's good not to go to the lab for a while,

239
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,440
and it will be always good not to go there.

240
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,050
What was I thinking before?

241
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,660
I got up early

242
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,500
and go to the lab every day.

243
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,660
I was crazy.

244
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,120
What's wrong with your hair?

245
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,180
Is it the standard for watching crosstalk?

246
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,460
Oh no, I forgot.

247
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm dying my hair

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,780
Tell me again.

249
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,940
What color did you dye it?

250
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,160
Dusty pink.

251
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,350
It's not dusty pink,

252
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,780
but dull Barbie pink.

253
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,440
The color I bought is obviously dusty pink.

254
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,300
Why did Taobao shopkeeper cheat me?

255
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,500
What are you doing?

256
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,580
Before anyone sees

257
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,970
my big bright head,

258
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,860
I'll buy hair dye cream

259
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,620
to dye it back.

260
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,740
Then you should pray that

261
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,390
your hair dye cream will arrive soon.

262
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,950
Otherwise

263
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,340
your big head

264
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,030
is destined to be seen.

265
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,310
I’m socially dead.

266
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,700
Whose little fairy

267
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,270
just came out of the fairy castle?

268
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,500
So beautiful.

269
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,820
Just laugh at me.

270
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,460
You've been found out.

271
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,900
Enough.

272
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,340
That's enough.

273
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,970
I helped the counselor record the scores before.

274
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,230
He just sent me the transcript.

275
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,400
Do you want to see it?

276
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,620
Do you want to see it?

277
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,970
Amazing!

278
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,350
Let me take a look.

279
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,410
Then let me take a look.

280
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,380
Here it is.

281
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,850
I'm 30th.

282
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm 31th.

283
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,270
We are sisters,

284
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,510
heart to heart.

285
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,010
Why are your grades so high?

286
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,790
You two are really impressive.

287
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,090
I’m not good.

288
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,020
Ying and Gu Chen are really good.

289
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,600
There's another thing you two should know.

290
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,760
Just now, Xiaomeng and I went to the college building

291
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,790
and heard the counselor say that

292
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,380
the innovation credit

293
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,580
is really important this time.

294
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,590
So if you

295
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,430
don't pass

296
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,580
the final lab test,

297
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,700
then you may

298
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,620
have to publish a paper in a core journal

299
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,540
to get your diploma.

300
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,990
So come on, you two!

301
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,120
Really?

302
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,780
Why is it so strict?

303
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,760
Yes.

304
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,620
So we have to

305
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,990
stay in the lab

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,360
and take innovation credits.

307
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,580
Why do I

308
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,690
have a bad feeling about this?

309
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,250
Did you hear that

310
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,290
today's class is taught

311
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,109
by our senior sister,

312
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,170
Zhang Xixi.

313
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,700
Zhang Xixi?

314
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,210
I haven't heard of her.

315
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,460
You haven’t heard of Zhang Xixi?

316
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,430
She’s very famous.

317
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,930
If she's willing to enter the competition,

318
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,859
she'll be the prettiest in our school.

319
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,160
She's so pretty,

320
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,960
sweet

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,540
and cool.

322
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,850
I remember, it's her.

323
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,440
Pretty, right?

324
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,130
But she doesn't seem to be a good person.

325
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,380
She’s a mistress.

326
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,260
That man's girlfriend

327
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,290
came to her

328
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,300
and poured milk tea on her.

329
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,910
Really?

330
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:46,860
Is it online?

331
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,460
Let me have a look.

332
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,310
[Zhang Xixi]

333
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,550
Hello, my name is Zhang Xixi.

334
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
I'm a second year PhD student.

335
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,140
I'm your senior sister.

336
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,660
I will lead you

337
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,380
to complete the physiology experiment class

338
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,220
this semester.

339
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,580
Today we are going to

340
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,540
master

341
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,820
the basic use of

342
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,660
BL-410 biological signal processing system

343
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,220
and the preparation of

344
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,380
toad sciatic nerve gastrocnemius specimen.

345
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,480
Are you clear?

346
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
Okay, next, take a look at

347
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,820
the experimental equipment on hand

348
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,800
and the operation precautions.

349
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,560
I'll hand out the toads.

350
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,030
Don't be afraid.

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,070
It won't hurt you.

352
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,950
Boy,

353
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,850
come and help.

354
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,810
It’s okay.

355
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,770
Senior Xixi is so cool.

356
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,230
Goodbye, Senior Xixi.

357
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,010
Bye, see you next week.

358
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,370
Bye, Senior Xixi.

359
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:43,950
Bye bye.

360
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,320
Remember to review.

361
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,820
Okay.

362
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,880
Sister, I'm leaving too.

363
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,620
Gu Cheng.

364
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,730
Thank you.

365
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,140
You're welcome. Actually, today I...

366
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,700
See you next week.

367
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,140
How about this?

368
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,910
If the number of popcorn chicken left

369
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,210
is even,

370
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,320
I will go back.

371
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,360
If it's odd,

372
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,310
I won't go back.

373
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,890
One,

374
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,020
two,

375
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,180
three,

376
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,130
four,

377
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,540
five.

378
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,790
If this is an even number,

379
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,760
I won't go back.

380
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,070
If it's odd, I won't go back.

381
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,370
All right.

382
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,140
If you really don't want to go back,

383
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,950
then don't go back.

384
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
Don't worry about the paper,

385
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,280
I'll take you to publish it.

386
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,930
Ying, you're so kind to me.

387
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,050
Drink it.

388
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,380
I just thought about it.

389
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,900
I'd better go back.

390
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,340
It's hard enough for you

391
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,620
to write your own paper.

392
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,300
If you take me to write,

393
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,500
I'll hold you back.

394
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,590
My lab is a top lab.

395
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
Many people

396
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,900
can't even get in.

397
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,890
What do I have to be dissatisfied with?

398
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,780
If I can't,

399
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
when I can't stay any longer,

400
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,220
I'll come back to you.

401
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,740
Then you take me.

402
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,380
I'll go back tomorrow.

403
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,450
I don't believe that

404
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,260
there is a place

405
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,060
where I can't stay.

406
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,760
Sisters,

407
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,770
let's eat!

408
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,520
Okay.

409
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh no. What should I do with my hair?

410
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,820
If I go back,

411
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,050
Xiao Yuhe will laugh at me.

412
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,680
No one. Safe. Let's go.

413
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,350
Well,

414
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,780
you just come to a laboratory,

415
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,060
do you have to

416
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,890
use me as a shield?

417
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,040
Of course.

418
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,180
If I run into the person

419
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,170
I don't want to see,

420
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,330
I'll be embarrassed.

421
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,130
What's wrong?

422
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,020
I tried my best.

423
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,440
Are you going to be an actor?

424
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,920
Come with me to the office.

425
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,450
What do you mean?

426
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,030
Who gave you the leave?

427
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,720
Who granted you the leave?

428
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,330
You come if you want to,

429
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,860
and don’t come if you don't want to.

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,820
You are disorganized and undisciplined!

431
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,920
How can you do that?

432
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,540
I've never had a student like you

433
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,630
in all my teaching years.

434
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,440
No, Prof. Du.

435
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,110
I think I've dyed my hair bad.

436
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,500
If I came to the lab,

437
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,850
it would be a bad influence.

438
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,310
So I didn't...

439
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,250
So what?

440
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,900
Are you having fun

441
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,530
telling me this useless thing?

442
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,790
You are a student.

443
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,050
Why did you dye your hair?

444
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,940
Hurry up and dye it back!

445
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,280
Of course,

446
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,590
I can't control you anymore.

447
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,290
Soon,

448
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,220
I will organize  students

449
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,930
to vote for you.

450
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:42,960
When the time comes,

451
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,300
just go

452
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,140
wherever you should go.

453
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,380
I

454
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,690
just tell you

455
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,440
in advance today.

456
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,660
You

457
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,900
prepare yourself.

458
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,040
Prof. Du...

459
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,480
Besides,

460
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,980
This is the assignment.

461
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,150
There are seven questions in total.

462
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,700
You got four wrong.

463
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,310
I've told you before that

464
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,510
I will never change my principles.

465
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
No matter in class

466
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,240
or in the lab,

467
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,140
as long as you don't pass the exam,

468
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,290
you won't

469
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,330
pass with me.

470
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,620
Take them all back and rewrite them.

471
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,710
Submit it to me tomorrow morning.

472
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,850
Take it!

473
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,380
Xiao Yuhe?

474
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,520
What are you doing?

475
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,210
I...

476
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,750
Do you believe me that I’m cleaning the window?

477
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,270
Of course I believe what you say.

478
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,480
Don't be angry.

479
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,180
Xiao...

480
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,030
Chengcheng,

481
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,980
you've dyed your hair

482
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,180
so brightly!

483
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,070
You can really do whatever you want

484
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,600
with a lot of hair.

485
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,800
What's wrong, Chengcheng?

486
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,770
Are you worried about anything?

487
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,460
I probably can't

488
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,630
stay in the lab anymore.

489
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,900
Prof. Du said that

490
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,100
he would let  students in the lab

491
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,050
vote me out

492
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,980
this week.

493
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,830
He also said that I did a poor job in

494
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,740
mold electricity,

495
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,490
and asked me to rewrite it.

496
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,640
But I really don't know how to do it.

497
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,340
It's just mold electricity.

498
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,930
After school,

499
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,070
I'll help you make up for it.

500
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,390
And about the voting,

501
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,060
I’ll help you find a way.

502
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,260
Not bad.

503
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,280
The questions you got wrong are basic.

504
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,490
If you really don't know how to do it,

505
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,450
you can come to me.

506
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,120
Thank you.

507
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,820
No need.

508
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,290
Yuhe,

509
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,850
you'll definitely vote for Chengcheng, right?

510
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,750
No need.

511
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,710
I can't afford

512
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,650
scholar-lord Xiao's vote.

513
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,020
There are electrode caps in the lab

514
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,390
that were used yesterday.

515
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,940
You weren't here yesterday,

516
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,730
so no one cleaned it up.

517
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,380
Clean it up before you leave today.

518
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,740
I have to finish the homework that

519
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,130
assigned to me by Prof. Du today.

520
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Can I wash some first

521
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
and the rest

522
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,960
tomorrow?

523
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,400
No.

524
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,720
You scared me.

525
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,690
Xiao Yuhe!

526
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,380
Okay,

527
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,390
you and Ying start first.

528
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll be right there.

529
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,670
This bike looks familiar.

530
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,940
You took me over speed bump.

531
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,690
This wheel also took me, right?

532
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,510
Aren’t you great...

533
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,960
Why is it stuck?

534
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,860
This damn bike.

535
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,970
Why is it bullying

536
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,880
like its owner?

537
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,810
Do you need help?

538
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,380
Not yet.

539
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,380
I can do it myself.

540
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,440
It was your car that hit me.

541
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,340
I have nothing to do with it.

542
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,940
Are you okay?

543
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:22,930
Do you care about me?

544
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,910
I'm talking about the bike.

545
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,960
I knew you wouldn't be so kind.

546
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,230
Good night, Senior Xiao.

547
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,620
Watch out for the chains.

548
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,050
Yes, yes, yes!

549
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,050
I finally finished correcting the questions!

550
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,910
Thank you, Ying.

551
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,480
Are you done?

552
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,060
I’m just writing the second question.

553
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,739
I still have so many more.

554
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,239
What should I do?

555
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,460
I can't finish it.

556
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,350
Bro,

557
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,330
I've been here since 6:00, okay?

558
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,290
It's your fault for not coming earlier.

559
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,780
Xiao Yuhe.

560
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,219
All right, all right.

561
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,389
Don't hold it in. Don't hold it in.

562
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,380
Has Xiao Yuhe offended you again?

563
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,900
He never stops.

564
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,800
Then...

565
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,280
Sorry.

566
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,520
Then let's go?

567
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,690
Let's go.

568
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,230
Time is running out.

569
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,960
Sorry.

570
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm so miserable.

571
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,460
What's going on here?

572
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,900
Don't come to class

573
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,990
at the right time in the future.

574
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,850
After you come at the right time,

575
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,770
you’ll have to adjust.

576
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,130
After you adjust,

577
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,770
I'll have already finished two key points.

578
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,550
What can you listen to then?

579
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,500
It's almost time.

580
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,800
Let's start the class.

581
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,470
From now on,

582
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,970
everyone who enters the classroom

583
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,910
is late.

584
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,720
Deduct the usual...

585
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,270
Prof....

586
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,310
Are you boxing?

587
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,780
Su Chengcheng, you're late.

588
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,580
No, Prof..

589
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,460
There are still a few seconds left.

590
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:46,830
Look.

591
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,080
Before the class,

592
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,520
let's talk about this assignment!

593
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,990
I’ve taught you

594
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
all the contents

595
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,190
in class before.

596
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,190
When the questions diverge,

597
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,830
mistakes abound.

598
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,210
You still didn't

599
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,820
pay attention in class.

600
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,110
This is the foundation of the foundation!

601
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,740
Everyone,

602
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,950
if you can't master them,

603
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,070
how can you enter the practical stage?

604
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,290
Add a mock test after class today.

605
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,960
Record it in the usual score.

606
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,930
Prof. Du.

607
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,870
Have you done the module?

608
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,660
Yes.

609
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm waiting for you to come to the lab this afternoon

610
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,840
to show you.

611
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,060
Good.

612
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,060
I have a quiz

613
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,860
for my undergraduates later.

614
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,980
Come to invigilate the exam if you are free.

615
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,290
I... I...

616
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:17,980
I...

617
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,140
I think I have a small bug

618
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,290
that I need to fix.

619
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,620
Prof. Du,

620
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,950
can you find someone else?

621
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,490
What's wrong with you?

622
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,760
Such a simple little task.

623
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,420
When it comes to you,

624
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,910
there are bugs...

625
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,300
At your level,

626
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,070
how can you graduate?

627
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:29,830
No, I...

628
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,900
Have it your way.

629
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,900
Or just find someone

630
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,440
to invigilate the exam for you.

631
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:41,960
Dongmao,

632
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,860
are you busy later?

633
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,700
I still have a bunch of models that

634
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,010
haven't been adjusted with Yuhe.

635
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,570
Well,

636
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,660
I can’t.

637
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,750
Li.

638
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,710
Senior Jiafa,

639
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,920
I have a sudden attack of gastroenteritis.

640
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,330
I need to go to the toilet first.

641
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,440
Too fake.

642
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,730
The toilet is over there.

643
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,850
I'm done with mine.

644
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,360
Why don't I go for you?

645
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,950
Really?

646
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,140
Which class?

647
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,590
Biomedical engineering class 2.

648
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,760
Isn't that Su Chengcheng's class?

649
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,280
Xiao,

650
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
you're not going, are you?

651
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,270
Put your books away now.

652
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,870
Let's start the exam.

653
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,300
Have a good exam.
