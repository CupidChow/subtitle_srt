5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,470
Dear audience.

6
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,100
Here is the preliminary round

7
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,770
of the 6th

8
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,520
National College Students' BCI Competition.

9
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,550
Everyone knows that

10
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,160
it’s a science and technology project selection activity

11
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,720
for college students

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,040
across the country.

13
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,080
It is a great honor that

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,100
this year's competition

15
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,320
will be held in Haicheng.

16
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,930
The competition is divided into two stages,

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
the preliminary round and the final round,

18
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,139
and lasts for two weeks.

19
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,230
You can see that

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,330
the participating teams

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,800
are entering the venue one after another.

22
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,640
Everyone seems

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,700
excited.

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,970
Let’s wish them

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,190
every success.

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,329
From Haicheng reporter.

27
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,980
Come on.

28
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,500
We...

29
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,430
Good.

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:22,890
Shall we

31
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,610
shout slogans?

32
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,180
No need.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,350
We have Yuhe doing programming

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,220
and Chengcheng doing training.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
A perfect match is working together.

36
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,450
The key is our machinery...

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,840
Indeed.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,230
Let’s shout.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,590
Come on. Let’s do it.

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,640
Louder.

41
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,030
Three, two, one.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,730
Come on.

Prof. Du.

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,310
Look at you.

46
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,180
The competition is about to begin.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,100
How are you getting ready?

48
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,860
No problem.

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,280
What about you?

50
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,640
-Everything’s fine.
-All right.

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,740
I’m looking forward to your excellent performance.

52
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,550
Okay?

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,000
I will go over there.

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,380
Sure.

55
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,850
Come on.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,360
Come on.

Southeast University of Science and Technology.

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,970
It’s your turn to sign in.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,430
Okay.

60
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:12,770
This way.

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,780
Accept an interview one by one.

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,090
No problem.

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,970
This is Tongtong's mother.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,710
Check with her

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,620
about the competition process.

66
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,530
Here’s the thing.

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,079
We will

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,940
briefly introduce Musk

69
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,750
on the spot,

70
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,500
and then make a video connection.

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,230
Next,

72
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,060
We will carry out a simple interaction

73
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,640
between Tongtong

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,020
and the emotional escort robot Musk.

75
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,160
As you know,

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,670
this is the case

77
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,500
with children with autism,

78
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,860
who have severe social impairments.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm worried that

80
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,650
she won't be able to

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,980
complete the interaction.

82
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,190
Don’t worry.

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,550
The main function

84
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,420
of our robot

85
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,530
is emotional comfort.

86
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,970
It automatically recognizes

87
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,040
your child's emotions

88
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,160
before encouraging her

89
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,079
to engage in positive interactions.

90
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,590
If Musk can be

91
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,030
released in the market

92
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,120
one day in the future,

93
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,170
it can help more children

94
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,430
like Tongtong.

95
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,650
Welcome to

96
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,710
the 6th National College Students'

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,310
BCI Competition.

98
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,340
Next is

99
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,120
the preliminary round.

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,510
The content

101
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,760
is a ten-minute product demonstration.

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,440
The judges will score from two aspects

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,140
of innovation and practicality

104
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,080
based on the contestants'

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,150
on-site demonstrations

106
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,480
and the project proposals submitted by the teams.

107
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,470
Next,

108
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,490
all contestants

109
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,390
please come on stage one by one.

110
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,409
Is Xixi

111
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
ready for it?

112
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,659
Yes.

113
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,010
We all have the fear of reciting full text.

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,610
You may think that

115
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,100
everything will be fine after graduation.

116
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,950
But let me tell you.

117
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,580
After you work,

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,000
you will find that

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,860
sometimes you are

120
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,909
overwhelmed.

121
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,210
You may always be forgetful.

122
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,070
Now

123
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,220
here comes Number One Scholar Memory Cap.

124
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,360
Scientific research shows that

125
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,070
it can effectively

126
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,750
improve memory by 10%

127
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,460
and concentration

128
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,150
by 58%,

129
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,810
thus

130
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,200
making your work and study

131
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,180
more effective.

132
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:06,770
Thank you.

133
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,760
I think

134
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,760
you may get one.

135
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,090
Piss off.

136
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,300
I don’t need it at all.

137
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,850
Virtual reality technology

138
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,610
has advanced by leaps and bounds

139
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
in recent years.

140
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,360
All human beings have worked together

141
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,300
to build a metaverse

142
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,000
that is more colorful than the real world.

143
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,360
We have now mastered

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,220
a new technology.

145
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,860
Qiyu Brain Computer Interface VR.

146
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,650
Looks good.

147
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,800
It seems to be interesting.

148
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,460
We non-inductively collected

149
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
physiological data

150
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,580
through a circle of flexible electrode sensors

151
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,720
in front of the forehead,

152
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,200
combined with a psychological

153
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,270
-three-dimensional emotional model of PAD.
-It fits me well.

154
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,580
It recognizes...

155
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,810
It’s quite competitive.

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,250
Are you confident to beat them?

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,380
-Yes.
-All moods and emotions.

158
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,780
Thank you.

159
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,390
Bravo!

160
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,270
By the way, junior.

161
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,310
I think you can

162
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,730
use this.

163
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Right, we are on the same page.

164
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,730
It suits you.

165
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,640
Next, let’s welcome

the representative of Southeast University of Science and Technology.

167
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,250
Listen, Xiao Yuhe.

168
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Make no mistake.

169
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,960
Try your best.

170
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,020
Hello, everyone.

171
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,020
I am Xiao Yuhe

172
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,040
representative of Southeast University of Science and Technology.

173
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,380

[Emotional Escort Robot]

175
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,120
let me introduce to you

176
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,840
the emotional escort robot

177
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,170
Musk

178
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:26,830
independently developed by our team.

179
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,340

Hello, Tongtong.

222

My name is Musk.

May I be your friend?

224
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,940
I can imitate the sounds of many animals.

225
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,060
Listen.

226
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,580
This is the sound of a kitten.

227
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,240
This is the sound of a pony.

228
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,790
I can also imitate the sound of a lamb.

229

The sound of a duckling.

230

232
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,360
You are my best friend.

Tongtong.

242
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,620
Why don't you shake my hand?

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,300
Are you afraid to shake my hand?

244
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,270
You are a coward.

245

What’s going on?

248
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
How dare you compete

249
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,300

250
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,080
What a nonsense.

251
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,730
Close the door.

252

We are very aware that

256
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,010
due to this accident,

257
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,530

Sorry.

260
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,440
Sorry.

Prof. Du.

262
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,220
At first, we have rejected

263
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,800
your qualification for this competition.

264
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,500
It was you who submitted

265
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,690
the application summary over and over again,

266
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,980
and Professor Chen Xiaorong

267
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,740
personally made sure,

268
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,460
so the organizing committee agreed.

269
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,370
Look,

270
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:21,830
after the accident,

271
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,880
I kept receiving

272
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,680
messages of accountability.

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
I have to explain to the parents

274
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,770
and the organizing committee.

275
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,580
Yes, right.

276
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,030
Right.

277
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,100
You need an explanation.

278
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,140
We will

279
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,720
fully obey

280
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,900
any punishment imposed on us

281
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,120
by the organizing committee.

282
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,460
And also

283
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,540
we will summarize the cause

284
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,900
of the accident in text

285
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,620
as soon as possible

286
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,670
and report to the organizing committee in details,

287
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,890
is that okay?

288
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,010
Get it done soon.

289
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay.

290
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,740
-Sure.
-Go back and wait for the notification.

291
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,800
Prof. Du didn't say that

292
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,970
our qualifications

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,110
were rejected.

294
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,300
The impact of fright on the kid

295
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,590
is indeed big.

296
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,170
But

297
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,560
I think it's

298
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,010
due to technical flaws.

299
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,470
The organizing committee is exaggerating.

300
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,050
Who knows why Director Zhang

301
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,790
is angry.

302
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,520
It’s normal that he’s angry.

303
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,370
The scale of the competition is large,

304
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,620
and there are various

305
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,450
media reports.

306
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,650
The impact is definitely

307
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,330
more serious than we imagined.

308
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,570
What’s the problem?

309
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,430
In fact, I always think that

310
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,490
we shouldn’t have

311
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,590
let Su Chengcheng, an undergraduate,

312
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,170
train Musk.

313
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,060
Could it be that there is

314
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,180
something wrong with the training?

315
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,490
It's not a question of training.

316
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,920
But her character

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,250
is really not suitable

318
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,080
for training Musk.

319
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,930
If there is no problem with the training,

320
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,890
what else could go wrong?

321
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
I haven't figured it out yet.

322
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,960
What do you mean?

323
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,770
You mean

324
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,450
you have a clue right now?

325
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
I haven't figured it out.

326
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,480
Wait.

327
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,090
It's not about whether

328
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,150
you have thought it through or not.

329
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,620
You have to tell us the problem.

330
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,670
If you don't tell us,

331
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,710
how can we solve it?

332
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,460
I've already said

333
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,090
I haven't figured it out yet.

334
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,010
Now that I am still confused,

335
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,960
how can I tell you

336
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,470
how to solve it?

337
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,950
No.

338
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,070
You have to tell us the problem.

339
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,150
We are a team.

340
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,050
We should

341
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
solve the problem together.

342
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,260
I’d like to tell you.

343
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,610
But I can only

344
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,470
make it

345
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,880
after I figure it out myself.

346
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,200
You are now our captain.

347
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
Tell us the problem.

348
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,920
And let’s solve it together.

349
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,980
This is not something

350
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,010
you can solve by yourself.

351
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,380
But I haven't figured it out yet.

352
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,290
Do you understand?

353
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,070
Do you understand?

354
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,660
Don’t...

355
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,600
I haven't figured it out yet.

356
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,670
I mean that

357
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,650
don’t think about it yourself.

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,120
Let’s solve

359
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,540
the problem together.

360
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,760
I can’t say it.

361
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
Why not?

362
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,690
Speak it out.

363
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,240
It’s not time to

364
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,510
be immersed in love.

365
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,650
Why am I immersed in love?

366
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,010
Your state is not right.

367
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,310
You know?

368
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,220
What’s wrong with me?

369
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,960
Dongmao.

370
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,550
After what happened,

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
we haven't visited

372
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,670
the kid yet.

373
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,080
Let's go

374
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
apologize to Tongtong.

375
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,610
Dongmao.

376
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,240
Give Yuhe some time.

377
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,310
He'll figure it out.

378
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:19,880
Chengcheng.

379
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,830
Senior.

380
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,620
Well...

381
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,660
Are Xixi and the others all right?

382
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,850
She went to the hospital with Gu Chen.

383
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,710
I just called her.

384
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,250
Don’t worry.

385
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,920
Okay.

386
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,140
We are going to see the kid.

387
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,300
Senior Xiao.

388
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,050
Don’t be angry with Dongmao.

389
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,680
He’s doing this for our good,

390
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,070
and for Musk’s good.

391
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,930
Is there really something wrong

392
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,180
with my training?

393
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,460
If so,

394
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,530
you don't have to cover for me.

395
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,910
Someone hacked into my computer.

396
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,210
Someone hacked into your computer?

397
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,850
When did you find out?

398
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,540
I checked the modification log.

399
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
Someone uploaded a new piece of code

400
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,210
with my account

401
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,350
that modifies Musk's

402
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,210
mapping response.

403
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,380
Coincidentally, the monitoring line

404
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,790
was unexpectedly powered off that night,

405
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,300
and there was no monitoring information.

406
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,400
Why didn't you tell them

407
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,590
just now?

408
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,950
How could I tell them?

409
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,580
Everyone here

410
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,930
is involved in Musk's design.

411
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,900
I'm not sure who did that.

412
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:00,770
If I say it,

413
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,470
it will only cause unwarranted suspicion

414
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,480
and distrust among them.

415
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,230
Since they are all involved

416
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,290
in Musk's design,

417
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,060
there is no reason

418
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,839
for them to do so.

419
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,609
Does anyone know

420
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,619
your account password?

421
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,920
What’s your account password?

422
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,010
Let's deduce

423
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,609
and determine a range.

424
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,910
Let's see who can guess it.

425
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,079
It's the date you confessed to me.

426
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,760
2022906?

427
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,720
0906.

428
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,940
0906.

429
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,610
This is the code.

430
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
It was changed

431
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,270
the night we had dinner together.

432
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,480
That night...

433
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,250
Be gentle.

434
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,260
The wound hasn't healed yet.

435
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,390
What if it gets worse?

436
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,990
Time is so imminent.

437
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,270
I am responsible for

438
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,410
the collection of information.

439
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,410
Let me help you.

440
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,340
I will collect the information.

441
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,970
Just tell me how to do it.

442
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,050
I will be your hand.

443
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,520
Take it. The temperature is just right.

444
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,550
Be reliable.

445
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,880
If I am not reliable, how can I be with you?

446
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,750
I seemed to be the last

447
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,990
to leave the lab

448
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,040
the night of the dinner together.

449
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,090
Does anyone know

450
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,100
your account password?

451
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,180
What’s your account password?

452
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,310
Let's deduce.

453
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,710
It's the date you confessed to me.

454
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,280
No.

455
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,020
I wasn’t the last one to leave.

456
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,630
Coffee.

457
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,410
No, thanks, Ying.

458
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,810
We're having a group dinner in a while.

459
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,610
Have you had anything?

460
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:40,800
Not yet.

461
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,410
Then come with us.

462
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,130
I will tell them.

463
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:42,920
Sure.

464
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,310
Let me tell them.

465
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,720
Good for you, Chengcheng.

466
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,900
I was worried before about

467
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,180
you joining our lab.

468
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,860
Now you are familiar with them.

469
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,370
You joined the lab

470
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,890
at about the same time

471
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,270
as you confessed to Xiao Yuhe, right?

472
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,110
Yes.

473
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,250
It was September

474
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,050
when we first started school.

475
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,890
You all finished choosing a lab,

476
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,590
only I didn't.

477
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,580
After I confessed with him,

478
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,350
I entered Brain and Intelligence.

479
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,320
What’s the date?

480
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,470
September 6th.

481
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:10,880
Right.

482
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,970
The next day was Meizi's birthday.

483
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,850
If it was Ying who did it,

484
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,680
why would she do this?

485
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,820
Chengcheng.

486
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,630
You don't know Xiao Yuhe well.

487
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,650
You saw his true colors

488
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,190
this time.

489
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,680
If you really don't want to go back,

490
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,500
just don't.

491
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,090
You don't have to worry about the thesis.

492
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,880
I will send it for you.

493
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,530
Because Xiao Yuhe said that

494
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,360
he was going to participate

495
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,410
in a robot competition.

496
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,240
A robot competition?

497
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,130
Meizi.

498
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,430
Do you know where Ying has been?

499
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,330
At this time...

500
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,300
She should be at gym.

501
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:22,970
What’s wrong?

502
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,860
Ying.

503
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,770
The code.

504
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,840
Yes.

505
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,260
I changed the code.

506
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,660
Why?

507
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,620
Because I hate Xiao Yuhe.

508
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,660
Stop it.

509
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,710
Calm down.

510
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,460
Enough, stop it.

511
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,090
Let go.

512
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,620
What are you doing?

513
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,810
Calm down.

514
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,860
Stop it.

515
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,860
It’s the video of that year's game.

516
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,280
My brother and Xiao Yuhe

517
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,500
were very good friends back then.

518
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,200
They participated in

519
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,380
this robot competition together

520
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,620
three years ago.

521
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,690
At the scene of the game,

522
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,750
something went wrong with the robot.

523
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,890
A staff member was injured

524
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,070
and the game was interrupted.

525
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,260
Why did Xiao Yuhe

526
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,420
smash the robot?

527
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,060
Because the reason

528
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,610
their robot broke down

529
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,310
lied in that someone moved

530
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,550
parts of the robot before the competition.

531
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,630
And that was

532
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,120
Xiao Yuhe.

533
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,690
If the organizing committee

534
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,800
found out about

535
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,710
what Xiao Yuhe did,

536
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,570
he might not only withdraw the competition,

537
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,020
but even risked being banned for life.

538
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,370
In order to protect himself,

539
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,740
he simply smashed the robot,

540
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,610
making it impossible for everyone

541
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,770
to continue participating in the competition.

542
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,950
My brother

543
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,180
was very fond of robots back then.

544
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,210
He was a senior in high school

545
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,930
when he participated in the competition.

546
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,060
He put almost

547
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,470
all his energy

548
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,980
into the competition at that time.

549
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,250
For him,

550
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,000
this competition is more important

551
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
than the college entrance examination.

552
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,200
The loss of this competition

553
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,350
hit my brother hard.

554
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,420
In the end, he was only

555
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,010
admitted to

556
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
a very ordinary university.

557
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,200
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

558
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,660
But my brother

559
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,430
is a very smart

560
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
and talented person.

561
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,950
Do you know

562
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,030
why I came to this school?

563
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,630
It's really not because of

564
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,740
what I told you at the beginning

565
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,820
that it's close to my home.

566
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,500
It's because this is the place

567
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,710
my brother

568
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,610
wanted to come to the most.

569
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,460
I didn’t mean to hurt you.

570
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,060
But I hate Xiao Yuhe.

573

These comments are too much.

574
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,850
Were they there?

575
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,390
They are all standing

576
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,380
on the moral high ground.

577
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:20,900
No way.

578
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,790
I have to post to clarify.

579
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,140
Seeing is believing.

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,130
These news uploaded the video.

581
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,750
If we want to refute,

582
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,190
we need real evidence.

583
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,390
Just posting doesn't work.

584
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,220
The top priority now

585
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,860
is to find out the truth.

586
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,310
Then let’s clarify

587
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,560
the specific cause of the accident.

588
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,090
But...

And...

594
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,140
It should no longer

595
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,650
behave strangely now.

596
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,600
The program problem is solved.

597
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,550
But we lack training samples.

598
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,890
We have to go on.

599
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,140
Just get to the point.

600
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,010
You should read the news

601
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,350
on the Internet.

602
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,400
Everyone is worried about you.

603
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,550
But if

604
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,600
we don't find an opportunity

605
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,760
to clarify now,

606
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,250
the situation

607
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,290
will become more and more serious.

608
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,000
Besides...

609
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,760
Everyone now wants to

610
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,530
dig out the truth of the matter.

611
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,320
How about we just

612
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,070
keep going in the direction

613
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,710
of the log changing to figure it out now?

614
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,730
No need.

615
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,380
Zhu.

616
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,640
You don’t have to

617
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,230
keep digging it.

618
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,810
I will make it clear to the organizing committee.

619
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,580
If there is any punishment,

620
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,880
I will bear it alone

621
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,030
and try to prevent you from being suspended.

622
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,080
Chengcheng.

623
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,290
So early.

624
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,830
Pancakes for Xiao Yuhe?

625
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,260
Well...

626
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,670
Is Xiao Yuhe okay?

627
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,240
What happened to him?

628
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,900
Well, there is news

629
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,660
on the Internet

630
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,110
about his previous game.

Anyway, I believe in Xiao Yuhe.

636

It tastes good.

637
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,170
Would you like some?

638
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,980
It’s for you.

639
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:52,940
I bought you two.

640
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,180
I believe in you.

641
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,880
So Director Zhang said before

642
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,440
that our qualification was rejected

643
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:09,900
because of the competition

644
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,800
that year?

645
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,870
I dragged everyone down.

646
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,330
Later,

647
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,920
the dean came forward to make sure,

648
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,890
and we were eligible for the competition.

649
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,280
What happened this time

650
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,140
has nothing to do with you.

651
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,620
I know who changed the code.

652
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,450
It's Lin Ying.

653
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,450
How do you know?

654
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,120
She is Lin You's younger sister.

655
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,000
After you left that day,

656
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,720
I checked that code

657
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,400
again and again.

658
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,430
The first person I thought of

659
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,070
was Lin You.

660
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,950
But then I thought

661
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,160
it was impossible for Lin You

662
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,150
to appear in the lab.

663
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,760
I asked Chang'an

664
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,760
for the code written by Lin Ying.

665
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,180
After comparing,

666
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,790
I found that it was Lin Ying.

667
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,950
Both of them write the codes

668
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,970
with the same suffix symbol.

669
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,130
Were there any misunderstandings

670
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,320
between you and them back then?

671
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,400
I'll explain it to you

672
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,430
in due time.

673
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,510
My only concern now

674
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,290
is that

675
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,340
we haven’t learned about

676
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:41,890
the final decision of the organizing committee.

677
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,510
I’m afraid that they will question

678
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,520
my eligibility.

679
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,770
Prof. Du is trying

680
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,730
to solve

681
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,460
the technical problems.

682
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,840
It would be fine.

683
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,600
But now the influence of public opinion

684
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,280
is overwhelming.

685
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,350
If I hinder everyone

686
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,150
from participating in the competition,

687
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,430
I will withdraw voluntarily.

688
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,720
You have been preparing for so long.

689
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,640
Why should you quit?

690
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,590
What to do?

691
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,150
Robot Championship.

692
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,850
This game

693
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,510
is Brainstorm vs. Black Bull.

694
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Right.

695
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,469
Roller vs. Cross steering.

696
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,010
But we can see

697
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,219
the shape of the two robots...

698
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,000
How did it break its arm

699
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,780
at the beginning?

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,510
It’s kind of dangerous.

701
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,270
They usually focused on defense,

702
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,030
why were they so aggressive

703
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,860
when it came to the finals?

704
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,030
They suddenly took such a big risk

705
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,000
in the final to change tactics.

706
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,780
It does not like the same person.

707
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,290
Not like the same person...

708
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,940
Prof. Du.

709
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,230
I found out that

710
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,660
you always work day and night.

711
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,550
The organizing committee

712
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,980
just informed us to

713
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,850
get ready

714
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,840
to be disqualified.

715
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,850
Prof. Du.

716
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,510
Didn't we appeal?

717
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,260
And we explained

718
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,980
to the organizing committee that

719
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,410
it was a procedural error.

720
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,790
We appealed

721
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,270
at primera hora.

722
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,880
And the organizing committee

723
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,150
made it clear that

724
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,030
there is absolutely no problem

725
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,120
with our product.

726
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,520
But currently,

727
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,880
the title attractors

728
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,210
and self-media

729
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,050
without moral bottom line

730
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,560
have fermented

731
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,690
this matter

732
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,900
on the Internet.

733
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,850
So we are under the pressure

734
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,070
of public opinion.

735
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,140
But I did my best

736
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,500
on the organizing committee side.

737
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,840
I understand.

738
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,080
Since the organizing committee

739
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,040
thinks that Musk is fine,

740
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,540
they are only worried about

741
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,700
public opinion on the Internet.

742
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,650
I've read about it.

743
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,730
The target is basically me.

744
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,040
How about this?

745
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,100
Tell the organizing committee that

746
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,940
I’ll withdraw from the competition

747
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,690
and let my team continue

748
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,600
with Musk.

749
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,680
Do me a favor.

750
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,440
Okay.

751
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,220
I’ll think about it.

752
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,190
But remember to

753
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,670
alternate work

754
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,600
with rest.

755
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:11,880
I am leaving.

756
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,490
This round of the Robot Championship

757
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,310
is a Lower Hook

758
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,680
vs. Strangling Nightmare.

759
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,830
Horizontal rotation vs. vertical rotation.

760
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,450
At the beginning,

761
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,780
Strangling Nightmare rushed over.

762
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,100
Both sides have no intention

763
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:51,830
of defending at all.

764
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,800
Horizontal rotation vs. vertical rotation.

765
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,980
The two groups...

766
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,520
A critical strike out of sudden.

767
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,320
Dear audience.

768
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:00,900
Hello.

769
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,100
This is the live broadcast

770
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,730
of Robot Championship.

771
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,550
I got it!

772
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,490
Xiaomeng's words just now

773
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,320
made me wonder

774
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,120
if it's possible that

775
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,990
their tactics have changed so much

776
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,190
because the tactics

777
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,850
were not formulated

778
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,690
by Xiao Yuhe at all?

779
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,510
So just now

780
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,970
I checked all the previous videos

781
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,790
related to the game.

782
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,700
And then I found this.

783
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,620
