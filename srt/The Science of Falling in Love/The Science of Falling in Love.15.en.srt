[Episode 15]

4
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,640
How are you doing with your review?

5
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,509
Do you want any help from me?

6
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
This is the experimental data

7
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,530
supplemented several times recently.

8
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,080
Take a look.

9
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,700
The sample source is too single

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
to support the final conclusion.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,340
We have no choice.

12
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,329
Recruitment information

13
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,350
was sent by the school.

14
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,160
The subjects are

15
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,550
students from several nearby schools,

16
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,660
whose age and educational background

17
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,770
are similar.

18
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,020
Such data

19
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,079
are difficult to convince reviewers.

20
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,210
We have to expand our search.

21
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,260
But our fee

22
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,180
is too low.

23
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,420
The experiment

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,130
wastes time and energy,

25
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,620
and requires two days

26
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,210
of coming to school in the morning and evening.

27
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,850
There is still a lot of data

28
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,910
to sort out.

29
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,350
There are only a few days left until submission.

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,290
Can we make it?

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,140
Let me think about it.

32
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,340
There is always someone

33
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,410
against me in the game.

34
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,740
Gu Chen.

35
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,910
What’s wrong, senior?

36
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,899
Are you

37
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,120
deliberately approaching me?

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,620
Yes.

39
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,500
I am

40
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,650
just your senior.

41
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,060
I hope you

42
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,310
don't try to treat me well in the future,

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,570
understand?

44
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,380
Please.

45
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
Look for it again, okay?

46
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,030
Please check it for me.

47
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,740
The lecture notes

48
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,650
are really important to me.

49
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,650
We have to get them.

50
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,330
Hey.

51
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,010
I've just told you

52
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,409
and checked it for you.

53
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,620
The lecture notes

54
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,670
are really out of stock.

55
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,650
What to do?

56
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,910
How about we borrow it from someone else

57
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,630
and make a copy?

58
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,710
Hold on.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,940
I have lecture notes on probability theory

60
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,660
that I have used before.

61
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,510
Where are you?

62
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,470
I'll send it to you later.

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,180
Do you know Liu Dongmao,

64
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,250
the senior of my lab?

65
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,740
The one who’s tall, wearing glasses

66
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,490
and with fair skin.

67
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,060
Yes, what’s up?

68
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,660
He said

69
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,760
he has lecture notes

70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,690
that were used before.

71
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,720
He will send it to us in a while.

72
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,620
Really?

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,340
Great!

74
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,270
Why are you here?

75
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,360
To send you the lecture notes.

76
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
Why is it you?

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,650
It’s raining so heavily.

78
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,170
Liu Dongmao was too lazy to come,

79
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,610
so he sent me here.

80
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,550
Thank you.

81
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,810
You are welcome.

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Are you still angry?

83
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,090
No.

84
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,360
Why should I be angry?

85
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,490
I feel

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,070
you are down.

87
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,780
I'm in high spirits.

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Everything’s fine.

89
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,770
Look at my smile.

90
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,990
Alright.

91
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,450
It’s raining hard.

92
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,350
Your umbrella is too small.

93
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,080
Use mine.

94
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,130
Take care on the rainy day.

95
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,270
The road is slippery.

96
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Why is he here?

97
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,070
You scared me.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your umbrella is broken,

99
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,960
so you got a bigger one?

100
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,980
No.

101
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,560
He said

102
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,410
the rain is heavy

103
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,950
and my umbrella is small.

104
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,130
The road is slippery.

105
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,790
He asked us to watch out.

106
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,330
Not us, but you.

107
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,860
Come on.

108
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,120
How could he...?

109
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,340
He thinks that my head is too big

110
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,100
to fit in the small umbrella.

111
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,430
Senior Xixi.

112
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,780
Your umbrella.

113
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
I forgot to give it back to you.

114
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,070
Never mind.

115
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,240
I don’t need it.

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,190
Keep it yourself.

117
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,170
Hold on.

118
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,890
How about together?

119
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,880
It’s on my way.

120
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,420
Let’s go.

121
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,250
By the way,

122
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,760
why is Chengcheng so nervous

123
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,770
about taking a probability theory test?

124
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,540
Don’t you know?

125
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,670
Their professor is Prof. Wang.

126
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,050
Prof...?

127
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,250
Prof. Wang?

128
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,790
That Prof. Wang

129
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,770
who often fails students

130
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,610
like Prof. Du?

131
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,890
Yes, that’s him.

132
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,680
He’s quite cruel.

133
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,750
Just one wrong step...

134
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,650
Don’t make it everywhere.

135
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,180
I will clean it up.

136
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,380
Just one wrong step and all points will be deducted.

137
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,820
Indeed.

138
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,290
If it were me, I would be nervous too.

139
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,730
I can’t make it either.

140
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,810
Enjoy yourself.

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,640
I'm going to take a shower.

142
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,150
Okay.

143
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,180
I’ll watch it in my room then.

144
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,180
Chengcheng.

145
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,610
You are really my life saver.

146
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,530
This is not a note at all,

147
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,550
but the light of my life.

148
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,100
My gosh.

149
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,860
Chengcheng.

150
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,570
What’s written here?

151
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,960
No way.

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,180
Is it because of the rain?

153
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,550
I can’t see it clearly.

154
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,130
No!

155
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
That's the point.

156
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,680
Twenty points.

157
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,560
What if it appears in this test?

158
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,030
The difference between

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,030
forty and sixty points lies in this question.

160
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,760
Let me see.

161
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,250
Isn't this

162
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,790
from senior Dongmao?

163
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,980
Just give him a call

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,540
and ask.

165
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,750
No worries.

166
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,550
[Su Chengcheng]

167
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,740
Senior Dongmao.

168
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,170
Do you have time now?

169
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,170
There is a place on the note

170
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,030
that can't be seen clearly

171
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,020
after being soaked in water.

172
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,780
Could you explain it to me?

173
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,240
Hello?

174
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,230
See you in the study room

175
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,920
on the third floor of the Teaching School in a while.

176
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,740
What did he say?

177
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,910
Senior Dongmao wasn’t there.

178
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,490
Someone else picked it up.

179
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,170
What?

180
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,610
Go downstairs.

181
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,110
I will explain that to you face to face.

182
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,140
Why should I

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
listen to you?

184
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,280
If you want to explain it to me,

185
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,790
please send me a message.

186
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,550

187
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,390
We're counting on you.

188
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,520
Please go.

189
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,800

190
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,010
Hello.

191
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,010

192

I...

194
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,760
Go!

195
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,750
Your clothes are wet.

196
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,710
The same to you.

197
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Remember to take cold medicine

198
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,330
after going upstairs.

199
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,250
Do you remember what I said?

200
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,220
Don't try to treat me well.

201
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,290
I’m not trying to do this.

202
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,260
I just can't help

203
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,160
but want to do something for you.

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,580
Because...

205
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,670
I like you.

206
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,620
You like me?

207
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,640
Do you know me?

208
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,600
Yes.

209
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,060
You look cold and domineering,

210
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,620
but you are actually

211
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,820
gentler and kinder than anyone else.

212
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,460
I am different from

213
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,880
those boys who chased you before.

214
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,100
I am serious about getting to know you.

215
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,660
Because I want you to be

216
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,550
the most comfortable

217
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,230
and at ease

218
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,320
when you are with me.

219
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,270
Anything else?

220
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,780
Is that all you know

221
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,470
about me?

222
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,560
If you know me,

223
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,290
you should know that

224
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,520
I am most at ease when I am alone.

225
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,090
Do you know what I’m like

226
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,680
when in love?

227
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm just

228
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,740
an emotionless robot.

229
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,950
You said you know me well?

230
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,390
Don’t get over yourself.

231
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,750
Gu Chen.

232
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,940
The second question is to figure out

233
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,440
which of the three factories

234
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,230
the defective product came from.

235
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,220
It

236
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,750
can be calculated

237
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,820
by Bayesian formula.

238
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,100
Through the steps,

239
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,970
we can get that

240
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,700
the defective rate of the three companies

241
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,880
is 0.24,

242
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,150
0.64

243
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,100
and 0.12 respectively.

244
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,740
It can be seen that

245
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
the defective product

246
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,300
is most likely to be from

247
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,440
the second factory.

248
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,160
Did I make myself clear?

249
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,310
Hold on.

250
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,730
Okay.

251
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,830
What are you doing?

252
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,430
The knowledge of probability theory

253
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
is not difficult,

254
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,860
but very complicated.

255
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
It will be very difficult

256
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,390
if you study alone.

257
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,790
I think you're likely to fail.

258
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,310
So I will stay here

259
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,800
and explain to you the knowledge points.

260
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,810
Are you humiliating me?

261
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,849
Am I a fool?

262
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,230
If I study alone,

263
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,200
I will definitely fail the subject?

264
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,680
I didn’t mean that.

265
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,990
Just let me try.

266
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,900
I have nothing to lose anyway.

267
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,180

I am very afraid that

I will be abandoned by you

Hello, sir.

354
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,860
Last time you said to pick up the e-bike,

355
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,540
but you never came.

356
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,280
When is it convenient for you?

357
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,260
I’ll be there in a while.

358
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,490
Print out the poster.

359
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,290
See you at the gate of school.

360
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,660
Zhang Li.

361
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,320
Get the banner done.

362
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,150
No photos.

363
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,440
Me again?

364
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,770
You look handsome like an idol.

365
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,280
He’s right.

366
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,720
I’m right!

367
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,860
I passed! I passed!

368
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,120
This is my first pass this semester.

369
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,610
We have to thank

370
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,120
senior Dongmao.

371
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,540
Don’t worry.

372
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,460
I’ll order him a grande one.

373
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,960
Hello.

374
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,020
I’d like a grande

375
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,140
Si Ji Chun oolong milk tea.

376
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,800
Okay.

377
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,740
And a trenta one

378
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,710
with

379
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,990
taro balls,

380
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,440
nata de coco,

381
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,950
pudding and red beans.

382
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,300
- Thank you.
- Great!

383
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,490
Su Chengcheng.

384
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,520
Could you buy one

385
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,570
for your best friend too?

386
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,280
Just a tall one will be enough.

387
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,210
Don’t you have money?

388
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,780
My money...

389
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,330
Here’s the thing.

390
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,120
The fashion brand I follow has new arrivals.

391
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,530
I bought a hat for 748 yuan.

392
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,950
My life has become extremely difficult.

393
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,030
So

394
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,940
my balance is down to two yuan.

395
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,390
Hello.

396
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,960
I want a cup of

397
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,270
mango tea with ice cream.

398
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,770
Okay.

399
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,160
With red pomelo.

400
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,910
Trenta.

401
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,100
Enough?

402
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,500
Take it and piss off.

403
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,730
Okay.

404
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,300
Senior Dongmao.

405
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,420
Milk tea for you.

406
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,150
Thank you.

407
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,410
Thank you for your notes.

408
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,340
It saved me and Li Meizi,

409
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,340
otherwise we would be doomed.

410
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,930
Thank you?

411
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,120
What lecture notes?

412
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,220
The lecture notes on probability theory.

413
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,760
This...

414
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:28,970
Well...

415
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,360
It’s not mine.

416
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
It’s yours.

417
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,760
Xiao Yuhe said that it’s yours.

418
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,880
Isn't this Xiao's handwriting?

419
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,300
Did he

420
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,520
make it specially for you?

421
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,600
There are few annotations

422
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,170
in his notes.

423
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,100
The two of us...

424
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,990
[Thank you, senior]

425
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,560
Senior.

426
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,090
Put it on.

427
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,350
Then give the coat to him.

428
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,020
It's been so long,

429
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,730
and you still haven't given it to her?

430
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,420
How about you

431
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,330
give it to me?

432
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:55,990
What are you doing?

433
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,180
Don't you know how heavy you are?

434
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,330
What if you break it?

435
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,290
Man, it’s an e-bike.

436
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,410
How can I break it?

437
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,080
How about you

438
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,040
polish it up, decal it,

439
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,040
and put it in a museum?

440
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,220
Yuhe.

441
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,780
You’ve changed.

442
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,210
Pick one for me.

443
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,620
Hurry up.

444
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,340
Hold on.

445
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,410
How can I understand girls' minds?

446
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,650
Choose one yourself.

447
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,930
I’ll see if they’re done.

448
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,760
Bye.

449
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,020
It’s so ugly.

450
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,790
How come?

451
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,690
It’s nice.

452
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,060
I also think so.

453
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,060
The article is really well written.

454
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,900
As expected of Xixi.

455
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,530
Have you read to the end?

456
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,750
Your name appears in the acknowledgement.

457
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,230
Really?

458
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,540
I didn’t notice that.

459
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,500
Are you

460
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,050
particularly interested

461
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,840
in this research?

462
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,560
I often see you

463
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,290
in the experimental area.

464
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,330
Yes, I am interested in it.

465
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,740
Great.

466
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,810
We’ll recruit subjects in the afternoon.

467
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,550
Come with us.

468
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,220
Senior, I have something to do.

469
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,680
If there is any other work,

470
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,250
let me know.

471
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,160
I have to go.

472
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,060
Senior.

473
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
What are you doing?

474
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,700
This is the e-bike

475
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,390
I wanted to give you that day

476
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,250
when I invited you to go shopping.

477
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,690
But I

478
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,110
pissed you off that day.

479
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,250
My bad.

480
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,050
I hope you will be more comfortable

481
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,780
in and out of class in the future.

482
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,850
Besides...

483
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,130
Xiao.

484
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,530
Let’s go.

485
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,170
Well.

486
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,520
Let's go to the print shop

487
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,680
for the banner.

488
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,360
Aren’t you going for that?

489
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,850
Let’s go.

490
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,370
What were you trying to say just now?

491
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,840
I just wanted to say that

492
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,420
that day...

493
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,860
Yuhe.

494
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,390
Nothing.

495
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,590
Take this.

496
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,050
And stickers.

497
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,890
Post whatever you want.

498
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,270
Wear the safety helmet.

499
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,080
I’m leaving.

500
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,260
You know what?

501
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,820
I checked that

502
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,980
the range of this model is 120 kilometers.

503
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,660
This is the latest model.

504
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,150
Really? Let me see.

505
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,790
Su Chengcheng.

506
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,590
So nice.

507
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,100
Lucky you.

508
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,510
So

509
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,250
Xiao Yuhe asked you

510
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,250
out for shopping that day

511
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,710
because he cared about you

512
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,570
and wanted to buy you an e-bike?

513
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,560
But you left

514
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,700
in anger.

515
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,500
Not only do you not understand

516
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,440
his feelings,

517
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,670
but you also feel that

518
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,120
he is inexplicable.

519
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,570
Because

520
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,550
he didn't answer

521
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,830
my question directly.

522
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,910
Instead, has always been worried

523
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,179
about the e-bike.

524
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,690
That’s why I am a bit of angry.

525
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,810
Stop.

526
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,690
More than a bit.

527
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,040
Xiao Yuhe

528
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,469
