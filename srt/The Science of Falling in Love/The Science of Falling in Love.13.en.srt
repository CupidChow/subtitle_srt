4
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,470
What happened last night?

5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,200
How did I get back to the dormitory?

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,570
Did Xiao Yuhe send me back?

7
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,820
You woke up.

8
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,270
You scared me.

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,930
How was...

10
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,930
yesterday?

11
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,950
What do you mean?

12
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,250
Seriously?

13
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,370
Don’t you remember?

14
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,810
Watch this.

15
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,060
I'm blind.

16
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,780
Yesterday

17
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,320
you climbed the wall

18
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,470
in front of the security guards
of our school.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
The two security guards

20
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,800
failed to drag you together.

21
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,000
Everyone admires...

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,320
Don't light my eyes.

23
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,550
How great you are.

24
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,030
This door is locked.

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,390
Let's go through another door.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,640
No!

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,990
I'm going to go through this door.

28
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,550
The other doors are too far away.

29
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,980
You can't get in since it's locked.

30
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,470
I have a good idea.

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:36,970
What are you going to do?

32
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,740
Watch your head.

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,590
Don’t move.

34
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,510
I’ll drag you out.

35
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,870
Save me.

36
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,960
Don’t move. I’ll drag you out.

37
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,980
I am stuck.

38
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,450
My gosh.

39
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,480
I lost my head.

40
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,450
My gosh.

41
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,550
One, two, three.

42
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,970
You... Easy.

43
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,030
One, two, three.

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,240
Don’t!

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,100
The head is okay.

46
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,940
Still there.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,900
Let’s go.

48
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
The brave Chengcheng isn’t afraid of difficulties.

49
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,130
Here.

50
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,070
I’d like to fly.

51
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,480
There are security guards.

52
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,480
Open the door.

53
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,790
Don't hold me back.

54
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,790
You’ll fall.

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,260
What are you doing?

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,180
Come down.

57
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,070
The security guards are coming. Let’s go.

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,750
What are you doing?

59
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,630
Don't light my eyes.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,430
I can’t open my eyes. I'm going blind.

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,510
The security guards are coming.

62
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,980
What are you doing?

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,870
- Don't light my eyes.
- Which department are you from?

64
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,330
Come down.

65
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,060
- I can’t see anything.
- Come down.

66
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,710
Don't light my eyes.

67
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,870
Which department are you from?

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,650
I can't see anymore, don't light my eyes.

69
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,159
Come down.

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,100
Come down.

71
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,230
Come down.

72
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,070
I’m blind.

73
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,510
Come down.

74
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,790
I’m blind.

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,220
Amazing.

76
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,070
Li Meizi.

77
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,190
Your best friend is dying.

78
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,340
I can't stay

79
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,710
in this school anymore.

80
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,510
What should I do?

81
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,660
What did I do

82
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,870
after I got drunk yesterday?

83
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,060
-Be gentle.
-I can't remember anything.

84
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,460
I won't drink anymore.

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,490
Chengcheng.

86
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't light my eyes.

87
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,230
I can't see anything.

88
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,510
You became popular.

89
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,150
I can't see anything.

90
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,440
Don't light my eyes.

91
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,510
I’m blind.

92
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,310
It’s not me.

93
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,380
Why isn't this you?

94
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,840
It's really not me.

95
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,690
I’m just

96
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,440
Miss Average.

97
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,250
Many people look alike me.

98
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,350
Really?

99
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,910
Isn't the person

100
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,730
next to you Xiao?

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,260
Not him.

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,390
Are you sure?

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,930
Hold on.

104
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,840
Xiao.

105
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Tell me

106
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,010
if it’s you.

107
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,890
I’m blind.

108
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,090
Good for you.

109
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,040
They are now well-known at school.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,390
Su Chengcheng.

111
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,880
I’ll go get water.

112
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,890
Good for you.

113
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,830
She went to the lab for water.

114
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,020
Yuhe, look...

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,200
Have you finished running the data?

116
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,830
Get to work.

117
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,409
I’ll send it to you.

118
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,350
Send it to you.

119
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
Don’t do this.

120
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,310
Chengcheng.

121
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:13,770
Gosh.

122
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,880
How can you recognize me like this?

123
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,150
Amazing.

124
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,270
You...

125
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,020
What are you going to do?

126
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,050
I'm going back to the lab.

127
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,220
Back to the lab?

128
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,590
I...

129
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,180
I'm going to a place far away.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,409
We won’t be on the way.

131
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,960
You should go.

132
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,570
Bye.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,080
Chengcheng.

134
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
Have you fixed your bike chain yet?

135
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,200
Bike chain?

136
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,760
What bike chain?

137
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,310
Didn't you say yesterday that

138
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,670
you spent all the money

139
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,030
you were planning to buy on an e-bike

140
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,830
to buy clothes for Xaio Yuhe,

141
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,840
so now you can only

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,900
ride a broken bike

143
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
with a broken chain?

144
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll take you to fix the bike.

145
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,830
This way you don't have to

146
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,240
ride a broken bike every day.

147
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,470
Stop crying.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,780
Let's take a break before going back.

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,280
Chengcheng.

150
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,410
I heard Gu Chen's voice.

151
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,050
Gu Chen.

152
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,730
How much did Chengcheng drink?

153
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,310
Let me take her back to the dormitory

154
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,140
with you.

155
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:30,880
No need.

156
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,120
Gu Chen, let me tell you.

157
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,539
I have a bicycle.

158
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,510
The chain on my bike

159
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,150
keeps falling off.

160
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,490
I put the chain on it every day.

161
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,910
My hands smell like motor oil.

162
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,770
I mean it.

163
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,270
They smell like motor oil.

164
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,500
Smell.

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,640
-Smell, Gu Chen.
-I will send you back.

166
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,650
Smell, Gu Chen.

167
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,850
Come in.

168
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Prof. Du.

169
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,510
This is my summary and opinion

170
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,420
on these topics.

171
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,580
How do you manage time for this?

172
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,040
Aren't you busy developing Musk

173
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,540
to participate in the competition?

174
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,510
Zhang Xixi has already told me

175
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,770
about the situation of our lab.

176
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,790
I’ll try to

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
publish the results

178
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,550
before the lab review.

179
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,350
Time is so tight.

180
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,260
Is it possible?

181
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,140
No problem.

182
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,210
And I've

183
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,340
contacted

184
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,970
the editors of the magazine.

185
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
It’s fine with them.

186
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,270
Du.

187
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,180
Why didn't you

188
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,630
tell me about this earlier?

189
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,280
Why should I say?

190
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,780
Dongmao is busy looking for a job.

191
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,480
Jiafa is busy writing a thesis.

192
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,180
Each of you

193
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,140
has such a heavy burden.

194
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,640
I don't want this

195
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
to distract you.

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,230
But we are

197
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,310
all part of the lab,

198
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,270
especially me.

199
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,440
These are

200
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,580
our responsibilities.

201
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,070
Right?

202
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,390
I’m leaving if there is nothing else.

203
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,530
Prof. Du.

204
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,260
I hope

205
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,430
you can support me about Musk's affairs

206
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,430
in the future.

207
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,150
Anything’s up?

208
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,420
I heard from senior Zhang Li that

209
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,270
a problem

210
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,360
about signal interference

211
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,560
hinders the progress of your project.

212
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,910
I thought of a way

213
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,670
that might work.

214
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,080
I don't have class in the afternoon,

215
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,610
and school ends early today,

216
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,110
so I am home early.

217
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,580
And I came to discuss with you.

218
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,260
Come in.

219
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,210
Take a seat.

220
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,440
I’ll get you some water.

221
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,810
Do I need to change my shoes?

222
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,690
No.

223
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,990
What are you doing?

224
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,640
That’s it.

225
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,210
Let’s

226
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,600
create a reverse waveform

227
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,270
with the same frequency

228
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,410
on channel 2 of the signal generator.

229
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,870
The waveform

230
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,480
is not used to induce visual stimuli,

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,920
but only used to offset

232
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,760
the interference of channel 1 frequency

233
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,300
to SSVEP equipment.

234
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,200
Good for you, Gu Chen.

235
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,250
I mean

236
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,500
I think this solution

237
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,930
should work.

238
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,190
I will go to the laboratory

239
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,390
to do experiments tomorrow.

240
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,450
It will definitely work.

241
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:51,850
Thank you.

242
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,790
You are welcome, senior.

243
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,240
Why don't you

244
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,670
treat me to a meal?

245
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,390
Okay.

246
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,480
Want some?

247
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,410
Cilantro flavored.

248
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,980
Xiao.

249
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,880
I've known you for so many years

250
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,110
and I've never seen you go shopping.

251
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,140
What happened that day?

252
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,950
Are you here to buy a present

253
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,850
for Chengcheng?

254
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,190
Stop asking.

255
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,100
Or just go back.

256
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,830
No!

257
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,390
Since you asked me here

258
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,120
instead of Dongmao,

259
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,920
it means

260
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,710
you trust my aesthetics.

261
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,840
I will live up to

262
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,460
your trust.

263
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,460
Here we are.

264
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,150
Okay.

265
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,310
For girls

266
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,660
in their twenties,

267
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,950
I recommend this one.

268
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,030
This model

269
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,430
has been selling well lately.

270
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,690
Not only does it look good,

271
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,170
it's also extremely lightweight.

272
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,820
National standard or non-national standard?

273
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,550
Our products are all national standard.

274
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,990
Lead-acid battery or lithium battery?

275
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,360
Well...

276
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,790
The battery capacity is large.

277
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,370
Lead-acid batteries have a small specific volume.

278
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,470
Lithium batteries

279
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,110
are 1.5 times to twice the service life

280
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,100
of lead-acid batteries.

281
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,040
Under the same capacity,

282
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
lithium batteries

283
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,500
are much smaller than lead-acid batteries.

284
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,020
So I only consider lithium batteries.

285
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,870
What about the brakes?

286
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Disc brakes or hub brakes?

287
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,830
Well...

288
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
Is the motor brushed or brushless?

289
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,580
What about tires?

290
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,910
Bias tires, tubeless tires, wire tires

291
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,840
or radial tires?

292
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,600
Well...

293
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
[Recommended]

294
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,840
Sir, look at this.

295
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,070
Seventy-two-watt, twenty-ampere lithium battery.

296
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,270
Bosch brushless motor.

297
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,790
A power of

298
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,180
one thousand to fifteen hundred watts.

299
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,240
The top speed

300
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,700
is forty-five kilometers per hour.

301
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,270
Three-gear power.

302
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,350
Front and rear dual hydraulic shock absorbers.

303
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,090
Thirty liters of built-in storage space.

304
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,320
Steel tubeless tires.

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,560
Braking method

306
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,260
of front and rear disc brakes.

307
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,990
It has a mobile phone software monitoring system,

308
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,520
a dual positioning system

309
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,420
of GPS

310
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,260
and auxiliary GPS.

311
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,780
It perfectly meets all your requirements.

312
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,020
What do you think?

313
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,670
Look at the color scheme, configuration

314
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,350
and power.

315
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,390
Chengcheng will definitely like it.

316
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,800
I think it’s pretty good.

317
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,710
But I think this one

318
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,420
is good.

319
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,760
What’s wrong with you?

320
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,270
Don’t you think it ugly?

321
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,450
If you dare to buy me this one,

322
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,130
you're done.

323
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,230
But he also chose this one.

324
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,660
It must be for himself.

325
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,580
If he bought it for his girlfriend,

326
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,730
she won’t let him go.

327
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,630
I want that one.

328
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,130
Okay, sir. This way.

329
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,470
That one is so fashionable.

330
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,390
This...

331
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,770
You have a good taste.

332
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,860
This is also the best seller

333
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,660
in our store.

334
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:56,980
Just like this.

335
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,100
Air.

336
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:08,910
What are you doing?

337
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,000
I came...

338
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,490
I came to give you back the clothes.

339
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,960
I have something to tell you.

340
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,060
I have something to do.

341
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,800
I have to go.

342
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,390
Come back.

343
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,900
Aren’t you feeling well?

344
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,380
Kind of.

345
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,500
I'll take you to the infirmary.

346
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,280
I’m not going.

347
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,470
Let’s go.

348
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,890
Inflammation of the tonsils.

349
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,350
Body temperature 39.2 degrees.

350
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,620
You have a fever.

351
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,590
After a while,

352
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,430
have an intravenous drip to eliminate inflammation.

353
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,600
I prescribed some medicine for you.

354
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,870
You should be fine

355
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,910
after taking them for a few days.

356
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,660
Give it to me.

357
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,690
Thank you.

358
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,650
Sit here for a while.

359
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
I will go get the medicines and pay the bill.

360
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,190
If anything happens,

361
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,770
send me a message or call me.

362
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,910
Wait for me.

363
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,350
Are you cold?

364
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,160
A bit of.

365
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,210
The liquid is cool,

366
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,520
and even cooler as it enters the bloodstream.

367
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,980
It won't be so cold

368
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,110
if I warm it for you like this.

369
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,670
Thank you.

370
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,520
- I...
- I...

371
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,170
You first.

372
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,290
You first.

373
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,560
Shall we

374
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,930
go shopping tomorrow?

375
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,560
You invited me to go shopping?

376
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,870
Are you free?

377
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,650
Yes.

378
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,090
Okay.

379
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,220
What were you trying to say just now?

380
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,060
I wanted to ask...

381
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,010
Did we really kiss last night?

382
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,280
I...

383
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,120
Su Chengcheng.

384
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,900
Su Chengcheng.

385
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,070
Who is he?

386
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,310
Wang Lunye?

387
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,250
My name is Wang Lunye.

388
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,830
If you become my friend,

389
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,490
you can play with it.

390
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,860
Here you are. Take it for me.

391
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,430
Who is this?

392
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,970
Senior.

393
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,820
This is my childhood friend Wang Lunye.

394
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,000
He is also from our school.

395
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,520
He had studied abroad for a while before

396
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,390
and just came back.

397
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,500
Xiao Yuhe, the senior of my lab.

398
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,430
Xiao Yuhe?

399
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,400
Xiao Yuhe...

400
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,230
This is

401
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,370
the scumbag you told me about earlier.

402
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,110
Can you think

403
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,220
before you speak?

404
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,310
Senior, he’s kind of

405
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,070
straightforward.

406
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,760
Don’t take it seriously.

407
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,270
Calm down.

408
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,200
Who’s straightforward?

409
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,750
He treated you that way before.

410
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,640
Isn't he a scumbag?

411
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,560
Come here.

412
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,400
Cherish life and stay away from scumbags.

413
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,910
Go.

414
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,880
Come over.

415
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,550
What are you doing?

416
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,050
Come over.

417
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,730
Don’t...

418
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,110
Stay away from him.

419
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,090
Slow down.

420
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,420
Give me your bag.

421
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,910
Give it to me.

422
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,310
Chengcheng.

423
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,090
Would you like something to eat?

424
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,020
Thank you.

425
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,270
Thank you for taking care

426
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,510
of Su Chengcheng.

427
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Now that I'm back,

428
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,220
she has nothing to do with you.

429
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,860
What about you...?

430
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Are you cold?

431
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,380
I’ll give you my coat.

432
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,030
Here, take it.

433
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,390
I'm going to pull out the needle.

434
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,020
Don't follow me.

435
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,630
Let me send you back.

436
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,370
What were you trying to say to me just now?

437
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,210
Let's talk on the way back.

438
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,130
Okay.

439
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,150
Thank you.

440
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,140
Chengcheng.

441
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,140
Isn't this your bike?

442
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,200
What are you going to do with it?

443
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,830
It seems that

444
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,150
you have to ride it back.

445
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't ride a bike.

446
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,980
Senior Xiao,

447
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,230
why don’t you try?

448
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,190
How can you not

449
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,150
ride a bicycle?

450
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,330
Look.

451
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,760
This is the latest geared bike.

452
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,340
My dad bought it abroad.

453
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,000
It has nothing to do with you.

454
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,110
You know me?

455
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,260
Why are you pretending?

456
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,940
How can you not

457
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,890
ride a bicycle?

458
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,140
Ride it back for me.

459
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,230
I just got back

460
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,310
from a ten-hour

461
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,390
flight from abroad.

462
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,950
I couldn't eat or sleep well.

463
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,850
I couldn't stretch my legs all the way.

464
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,750
Although I was flying first class,

465
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,490
it was still quite uncomfortable

466
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,660
because my legs were so long.

467
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,630
And when I heard that you are sick,

468
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,260
I rushed over

469
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,110
right after I got off the plane.

470
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740
I’m so tired that

471
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,420
I can’t ride a bicycle.

472
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,980
I can’t make it.

473
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,660
I will ride it.

474
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,870
Hard work for you.

475
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,050
Get on.

476
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,940
The key.

477
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,800
Drive slowly with her.

478
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,270
I don’t need you to remind me.

479
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,990
Senior, I’ll be...

480
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,540
Get on.

481
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:21,930
Shut up.

482
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,510
I’ll be waiting for you downstairs in the dormitory.

483
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
Take your time.

484
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,570
Let’s go.

485
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,130
Okay.

486
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,460
Hurry up.

487
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,230
Come on.

488
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,310
Why in such a hurry?

489
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,650
Your bag.

490
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,340
No worries.

491
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,460
Go.

492
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,590
Okay, no worries.

493
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,740
It’s hard to ride it this way.

494
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,450
Can you ride it?

495
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,030
I have to back it.

496
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,830
Come on.

497
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,560
Let’s go.

498
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,550
What are you doing?

499
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,650
It’s not yours.

500
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,890
Right.

501
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,040
Didn't you say that

502
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,420
you are very bored with Xiao Yuhe?

503
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,470
Why were you in the hospital

504
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,440
with him today?

505
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,620
I wasn’t feeling well.

506
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,810
And I just met him.

507
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,320
As my classmate,

508
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,620
he sends me to the hospital. What’s wrong?

509
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,410
Okay.

510
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,670
Have I met

511
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,140
Xiao Yuhe somewhere?

512
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,750
Why does he look so familiar?

513
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,530
How come?

514
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,430
He had studied

515
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,750
abroad before.

516
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,200
He just came back this summer.

517
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,270
Abroad?

518
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,880
Have I seen him abroad?

519
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,310
Don't you have a cold?

520
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,380
Come on.

521
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,670
Go back to the dormitory.

522
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,660
-What?
-Go to have a rest.

523
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,610
Xiao Yuhe hasn’t arrived yet.

524
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,720
I don’t care about him.

525
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,660
Go, bye! Bye!

526
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,640
Xiao Yuhe is so cool.

527
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,260
Not bad.

528
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,170
You are right.

529
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,820
What are you two doing?

530
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,520
Good for Xiao Yuhe.

531
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,570
He even sent you back.

532
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,990
And you two have been

533
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,870
whispering downstairs for so long.

534
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,530
That's Wang Lunye.

535
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,480
Wang Lunye?

536
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,860
He is back?

537
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,870
What did he eat abroad?

538
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,060
Why does he look

539
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,040
so much handsomer than before?

540
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,650
Su Chengcheng, you're done.

541
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,020
Now that the troublemaker Wang Lunye is back,

542
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,010
it’s even harder for you to fall in love.

543
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,340
What to do?

544
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,950
Xiao Yuhe asked me

545
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,050
to go shopping tomorrow.

546
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,840
-What?
-What?

547
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,790
Chengcheng

548
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,250
didn’t want to wait for you

549
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,810
and went upstairs.

550
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,450
The e-bike

551
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,760
is out of battery.

552
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,500
Please take it back.

553
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,760
Xiao Yuhe didn't ask you to do experiments

554
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,350
and take self-study courses,

555
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,330
but asked you to go shopping?

556
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,890
I don't know why

557
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,380
he asked me to go shopping.

558
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,030
What else did he say?

559
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,480
Nothing special.

560
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,030
But...

561
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,760
But what?

562
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,870
Do you remember that

563
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,070
I was drunk yesterday?

564
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,760
Of course.

565
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,300
The hangover girl

566
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,670
climbed the wall in front of the security guard.

567
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,780
I will never forget it in my life.

568
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,730
No kidding.

569
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,630
Chengcheng, go ahead.

570
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,570
What happened

571
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,790
to you?

572
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,590
Say it.

573
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,270
What happened?

574
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,080
Come on, say it.

575
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,380
We are so curious.

576
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,740
I seem to have kissed Xiao Yuhe.

577
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,580
-What?
-What?

578
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,890
You kissed him?

579
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,510
Su Chengcheng.

580
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,030
So crazy.

581
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,150
What about later?

582
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,460
Tell us.

583
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,940
Then...

584
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,190
I was so drunk that

585
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,300
I was confused.

586
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,550
I’m not so sure

587
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,620
if I kissed him or not.

588
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,500
How could you forget this?

589
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,380
It makes a big difference

590
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,370
whether you kissed him or not.

591
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,960
A great difference.

592
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,860
Did she kiss him or not?

593
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,390
Good for you.

594
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,740
What?

595
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,780
[PhD Student Apartment]

596
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,920
Xiao, you are back.

597
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,390
How is it?

598
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,810
Did you send her the e-bike?

599
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,050
Obviously he didn’t

600
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,490
send it to her successfully.

601
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,760
Chengcheng's bicycle is so broken.

602
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,880
Why didn’t you send it to her?

603
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,120
Exactly.

604
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,270
So slow.

605
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,050
Done.

606
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,120
I failed.

607
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,690
What a failure.

608
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,620
Stop it, or the building will collapse.

609
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,120
No, give me that wrench.

610
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,510
Good for you.

611
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,080
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

612
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,430
You can even open a repair shop.

613
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,180
It’s too broken to be repaired.

614
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,570
Buy a new one.

615
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,870
Stay away from me.

616
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,460
You block my light.

617
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,750
Isn’t it just about money?

618
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,880
I will pay you.

619
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,100
I mean it.

620
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,390
I just came back

621
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,610
and I am totally unfamiliar with this place.

622
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,600
There is a lot to be done.

623
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,850
I wish you could

624
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,330
run errands

625
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
and do chores for me.

626
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,120
And I will pay you.

627
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,960
My noble self-esteem

628
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,810
will not allow me to do so.

629
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,710
Your noble self-esteem?

630
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,760
What about now?

631
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,550
Master.

632
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,350
Do you want me to

633
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,310
heat up the ice-cream in the microwave

634
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,440
for you to eat?

635
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,150
Well.

636
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,880
No need.

637
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,880
I like to eat it iced.

638
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,430
I'll wait for you

639
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,860
downstairs in your dormitory.

640
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,580
Okay.

641
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm done in half an hour.

642
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,280
See you then.

643
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,870
Su Chengcheng.

644
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,610
What?

645
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,600
Get the dipping sauce for me.

646
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,870
Go.

647
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,820
Okay, hold on, sir.

648
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,820
Okay.

649
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,020
What happened to her today?

650
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,420
She is absent-minded when eating.

651
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,130
Is it weird?

652
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,140
It’s quite normal.

653
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,310
Isn't that what

654
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,990
people who’s falling in love do?

655
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,480
Falling in love?

656
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,060
Right.

657
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,270
With whom?

658
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,270
Why don’t I know?

659
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,909
-Of course it’s Xiao Yuhe.
-Xiao...?

660
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,659
You’ve met him before.

661
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,590
How could she

662
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,500
be with Xiao Yuhe?

663
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,980
She even called me before

664
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,790
to slander Xiao Yuhe.

665
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,900
You said it yourself

666
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,790
that it was

667
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,690
before.

668
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,860
Things are different now,

669
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,949
understand?

670
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,949
I feel suffocated

671
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,889
when I see him.

672
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,850
A familiar annoyance

673
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,739
hits me,

674
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,139
like I've been sick of him

675
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,389
for decades.

676
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,920
I don't agree with them being together.

677
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,909
Does your objection

678
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,750
make any sense?

679
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,110
Su Chengcheng

680
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,040
can fall in love

681
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,810
with whomever she wants.

682
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,949
What does this have to do with you?

683
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,300
Why do you care so much about her?

684
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,120
Look at you.

685
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,440
Do you know

686
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,719
why we are so close?

687
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,200
Because you two are childhood friends.

688
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,000
That year,

689
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,130
Chengcheng's parents

690
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,090
had just divorced.

691
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,650
She had nowhere to go.

692
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,210
So I just wanted

693
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,450
to take care of her.

694
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,990
But then something happened

695
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,570
in my family.

696
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,420
Instead, she took care of me.

697
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,980
So from then on,

698
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,900
I regarded Su Chengcheng

699
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,380
as my best friend

700
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,720
in my life.

701
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,260
I don't want her

702
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,980
to be hurt in any way.

703
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,020
Good for you, Mr. Wang.

704
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,890
So affectionate.

705
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,210
Not at all.

706
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,230
Do you like Su Chengcheng?

707
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,640
No way.

708
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,640
She’s just a younger sister

709
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,700
in my heart.

710
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,250
I have to keep an eye on her.

711
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,100
For what?

712
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,060
She's going on a date

713
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,990
tonight.

714
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,750
Maybe after the date

715
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,450
they will be together.

716
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,720
Date?

717
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,020
Date...

718
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,730
It hurts.

719
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,100
It hurts so much.

720
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,460
My stomach hurts so badly.

721
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,910
It hurts.

722
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,540
What’s wrong with you?

723
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,880
What’s wrong with him?

724
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,610
No idea.

725
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,640
My stomach hurts.

726
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,200
Why did you...?

727
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,180
I may have eaten something bad.

728
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,640
I'll take you to the school infirmary.

729
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,760
No, I can’t make it.

730
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,340
It’s so far away.

731
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,550
It hurts so much.

732
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,060
Well...

733
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,510
I will take you back to the dormitory.

734
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,630
No, I will be alone in the dormitory.

735
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,870
They all went out.

736
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:53,980
It hurts.

737
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,040
Wait here.

738
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,940
I'll get you the medicine from the lab.

739
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,730
The lab?

740
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,360
I can make it

741
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,960
to the lab.

742
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,930
I’ll go with you.

743
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,330
It hurts so much.

744
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,910
I have no idea.

745
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,820
I can't cure him.

746
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,570
I’m leaving.

747
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,260
Bye.

748
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,530
Chengcheng, Chengcheng.

749
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,020
Hello.

750
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,130
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

751
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,640
I am the staff of the store.

752
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,980
I’d like to confirm with you

753
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,890
if you will

754
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,670
pick up the e-bike today?

755
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

756
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,830
Okay.

757
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,460
You can come directly

758
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,230
after a while.

759
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,170
Okay, thanks.

760
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,680
Senior, sorry.

761
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,380
Wang Lunye fell ill suddenly.

762
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,510
I have to take care of him.

763
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,710
Let's go shopping for another time, shall we?

764
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,180
Thank you.

765
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,320
Didn't you go on a date?

766
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,210
Did she stand you up?

767
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,340
I have something more important to do,

768
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,030
which is to write papers.

769
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,350
It hurts.

770
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,990
Write papers?

771
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,350
It hurts so much.

772
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,230
Sorry.

773
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,750
Wang Lunye is having a stomachache.

774
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,400
I'll treat you to dinner later.

775
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,340
Never mind.

776
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,180
-Are you free in the afternoon?
-Are you free in the afternoon?

777
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,510
It hurts. Where is the medicine?

778
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,960
Hold on.

779
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,820
It hurts so much.

780
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,540
What did you say?

781
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,310
See you at the mall

782
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,430
at 5:30 in the afternoon.

783
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,270
Come on. Give me the medicine, Chengcheng.

784
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,250
I can’t hold on anymore.

785
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
I’m dying.

786
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,370
Get up.

787
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,190
Hurry up, Chengcheng.

788
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,650
Did you find it?

789
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,230
Let’s go.

790
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,570
I can’t hold on anymore.

791
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,510
I can’t hold on anymore.

792
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,340
So naive.

793
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,180
