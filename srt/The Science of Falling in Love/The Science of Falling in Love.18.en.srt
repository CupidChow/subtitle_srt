4
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,979
What's the matter?

5
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,780
Neither did you pick up your phone

6
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,810
nor reply to your WeChat messages.

7
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,670
Why are you here?

8
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,420
You are not drinking Colas?

9
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,620
Are you really drinking your sorrows away with alcohol?

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,520
Come on.

11
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,540
Are you

12
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,930
not going to forgive him?

13
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,940
I'm not only mad at him,

14
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,930
but I

15
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,410
also don't know how to face him.

16
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,810
I've known Zhu Pan...

17
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,910
I-I've known Xiao Yuhe

18
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,740
since the first grade in elementary school.

19
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,730
Back then,

20
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,940
a lot of kids wanted to play with me,

21
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,640
but I only saw him

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,730
as my best friend.

23
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,030
One day,

24
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,890
he disappeared all of a sudden

25
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,640
and didn't left me a single message.

26
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,970
Then...

27
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,830
then my parents got divorced.

28
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,600
The way how they parted ways

29
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,320
was really like

30
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,910
the way how Zhu Panpan disappeared.

31
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,899
I was in middle school at that time.

32
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,260
One day, I went to my granny's,

33
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,180
and she suddenly told me:

34
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,430
"Your parents are going to get divorced."

35
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,510
After that,

36
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,960
I didn't see them

37
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,310
for a long time.

38
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,800
Sure.

39
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,100
Maybe they were both busy.

40
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,750
Busy with their divorce lawsuit

41
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,160
and busy dealing with

42
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,500
the relationships with their new families.

43
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,050
I didn't even

44
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,690
hear my own parents' divorce

45
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,900
from their own lips,

46
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,900
so from that time on,

47
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,130
I thought

48
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,320
perhaps I was a person

49
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,870
who was destined to be abandoned by others.

50
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,610
Perhaps all people I cared about

51
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,690
would eventually abandon me

52
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,600
and leave me in secret.

53
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,050
This semester

54
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,340
I met Xiao Yuhe again.

55
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,730
I should have recognized him a long time ago.

56
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,280
He knew how to make

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,980
the toy Zhu Panpan had made for me.

58
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,070
He dipped fries with ice cream, too.

59
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,000
The accessory on his bag

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,970
was the robot Zhu Panpan had drawn for me

61
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,110
when we were little.

62
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,010
But Meizi,

63
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,860
I really

64
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,640
didn't want to remember

65
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
anything

66
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,380
related to Zhu Panpan,

67
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,120
so I ignored them all.

68
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,420
Xiao Yuhe didn't tell me, either.

69
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,880
He watched as I confessed to him

70
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,210
and insisted that I prove that I had no feelings for him.

71
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,800
He asked me to do

72
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
all sorts of random

73
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,510
romance experiments with him.

74
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,470
I could have let it slide if we had been strangers.

75
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
But he obviously knew

76
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,880
that I was me.

77
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,880
Why would he do this to me?

78
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,130
Senior Jiafa, I have to go.

79
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:39,840
Bye-bye.

80
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,549
Later, I gotta go, too.

81
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,440
Xixi,

82
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,730
I've got to go.

83
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,460
Won't you leave?

84
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,640
I've got

85
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,160
a batch of urgent experimental data

86
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,170
that needed to be rechecked today.

87
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,610
It's OK.

88
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,140
Dongmao and I can stay up longer.

89
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Maybe

90
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,940
we will be working past 12:00 again tonight.

91
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,870
You guys go ahead.

92
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
We've been pulling out all the stops for 2 or 3 weeks,

93
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,650
so don't exhaust yourselves.

94
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,610
Bye-bye.

95
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,680
Bye-bye, take care on your way back.

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,950
OK.

97
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,210
Dongmao, I've got to go.

98
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,770
Bye-bye.

99
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,120
Bye-bye.

100
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,860
Hello, Musk.

101
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,010
Hello, Xiao Yuhe.

102
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,060
You are unhappy.

103
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,230
No.

104
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,250
I am happy.

105
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,540
You are lying.

106
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,430
You are sad.

107
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,330
Tell me about it,

108
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,050
and I can comfort you.

109
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,790
I can forget that

110
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
she didn't recognize me at first,

111
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,930
but then she even fell in love with me.

112
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,980
I was crossed with her,

113
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,070
so I didn't tell her who I was on purpose.

114
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,820
But later,

115
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,000
I couldn't

116
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,700
tell her.

117
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,860
And more importantly, I didn't know how to tell her.

118
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,590
Tell me, what should I do?

119
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,960
How can I

120
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,140
stop her from being so sad?

121
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,880
I can't comfort you.

122
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,170
Information overload.

123
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,520
Overload.

124
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,080
Dear owners, greetings.

125
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,260
Elevator No.1 is temporarily out of order

[Fuxin Jiayuan Property's Group]

127
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,710
and will be repaired at 12:00 sharp tonight.

128
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,880
Please do not

129
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,870
take the elevator.

130
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,890
We are deeply sorry

131
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,700
for the inconvenience.

132
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:00,820
Hello,

133
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,710
Senior Dongmao.

134
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,960
Gu Chen.

135
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,950
Are you still in the lab?

136
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,400
Yeah.

137
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,420
Is Senior Xixi there, too?

138
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,690
She left.

139
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,310
She left? When did she leave?

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,540
About half an hour ago.

141
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,510
She's been gone for half an hour?

142
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,780
OK.

143
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,120
I see.

144
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,280
Hello.

145
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,240
Hello.

146
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,530
Senior Xixi, where are you?

147
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,710
I'm in the elevator.

148
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,530
The signal here is weak.

149
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,950
Senior Xixi?

150
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,270
Hello?

151
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,640
Is anyone there?

152
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,080
Xixi?

153
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:23,820
Xixi.

154
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,200
Sorry, the number you have dialed...

155
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,140
Hello?

156
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,150
Is anyone there?

157
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,310
I have claus...

158
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,170
I have claustro...

159
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,100
claustrophobia.

160
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,560
Xixi.

161
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,060
Xixi.

162
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,810
Xixi.

163
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,470
Xixi.

164
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,350

Xixi.

167
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,800
Xixi.

168
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,860
Xixi.

169
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,210
Gu Chen.

170
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,490
Gu Chen.

Gu Chen.

173
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,480
Gu Chen!

174
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,680
Gu Chen!

175
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,440
Xixi?

176
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,870
Xixi, are you down there?

177

Don't go.

Gu Chen.

185
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,120
Xixi, are you in there? Xixi?

I am.

I am.

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,490
I am.

189
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,520
Listen, Xixi.

190
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,570
Don't be afraid.

191
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,720
I'll find someone

192
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,430
to open the elevator door for you.

193
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,830
Wait for me, OK?

194
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,970
OK.

195
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,030
OK, I'll wait for you.

196
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,360
What took you so long?

197
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,570
Are you alright? You can come out now.

198
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,070
We're fine.

199
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:53,950
Thank you, mister.

[LAB of Brain - Our Lab Mice Have Given Birth]

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,170
Prof. Du,

202
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,280
my foot injury recrudesces again,

203
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,930
may I take a day off?

204
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,390
OK.

Hello?

207
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,850
Mr. Liu.

208
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,500
What?

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:37,840
Li Meizi.

210
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,580
Is Su Chengcheng in there?

211
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,950
Chengcheng was reported for cheating

212
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,470
and was called by the counselor for a talk.

213
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,230
I was about to

214
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,910
send her notes to her

215
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,730
and help explain the situation.

216
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,640
Leave it to me.

217
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,340
I'll take care of it.

218
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,190
Chengcheng.

219
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,690
Don't feel stressed.

220
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,150
I believe you.

221
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,280
But someone did report

222
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,950
this problem,

223
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,790
so according to my work process,

224
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,610
I do have to talk to you about it.

225
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
Mr. Liu, I understand that it's your work,

226
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,060
but I really didn't cheat.

227
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,920
If you don't believe me,

228
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
we can check the surveillance video of that day.

229
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,800
During the exam,

230
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,730
I didn't check cheat sheets,

231
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,510
or talk to anyone

232
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,440
at all,

233
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,080
let alone

234
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,110
pass any kind of information.

235
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,140
I've checked it.

236
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,900
It's true that you didn't do anything

237
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,010
to violate examination discipline.

238
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,680
But you did improve a lot

239
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,890
on this exam,

240
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,240
which may have left some students

241
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,340
with doubts.

242
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
I improved a lot

243
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,440
because I really

244
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,820
spent a lot of time to prepare.

245
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,480
If everyone

246
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,550
still doesn't believe me,

247
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,720
then prepare a test

248
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,880
with the same difficulty,

249
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,710
and I'll take it again.

250
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,650
It's you, Yuhe.

251

252

Greetings.

253

I came to give Su Chengcheng

254
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,160
her preparation notes for the probability theory exam.

255
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,710

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,100

257
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
and I was with her the whole time since she started studying.

258
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,390
I can testify for her.

259
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,410

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,850
when you get to study with such a good senior.

268
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,540
Keep up the good work.

Mr. Liu, we've got to go.

Mr. Liu, I've got to go.

273
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,980
OK, bye.

coming to back me up today.

What on earth is going on between you and Su Chengcheng?

It's between the two of us,

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,920
so don't bother with it.

306
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,250
This is the robot

307
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,300
you always wanted to make when you were little.

308
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,150
How did you know about that?

309
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,970
After you left back then,

310
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,710
Su Chengcheng had been drawing it every day.

311
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,770
I was confused

312
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,880
and asked her

313
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,210
why she was into it.

314
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,920
Later did I learn that

315
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,900
it was because you liked it.

316
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,530
You told her

317
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,090
you wanted to build it when you grew up.

318
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,750
She has remembered me all along.

319
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,920
Did you forget

320
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,870
your childhood email address?

321
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,580
What email address?

322
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
The one school registered for everyone

323
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,060
when we were in elementary school.

324
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
Check it when you get back.

Zhu Panpan,

326
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,910
today I bought the freeze pop

327
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,240
that we used to eat together again.

328
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Where in the world are you?

329
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,990
Do you still eat freeze pops?

330
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,700
Zhu Panpan,

331
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,290
today I got my tooth pulled out.

332
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,180
The granny in the neighbourhood said that

333
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,180
if you threw the tooth on the roof,

334
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,690
your wish would come true.

335
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,000
I wished for

336
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,460
you to come back.

337
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,270
Zhu Panpan,

338
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,160
the math teacher

339
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,750
explained how to solve a competition question to us today.

340
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,500
It would have been nice if you had been there,

341
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,550
because you definitely would have shown me how to do it.

342
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,140
Zhu Panpan,

343
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,050
the subjects in middle school are so hard,

344
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,090
the sticks aren't helping anymore.

345
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,400
You've never replied to

346
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,070
any of my emails.

347
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,860
I wrote you a few letters,

348
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,130
but I don't know where to send them.

349
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,040
Zhu Panpan,

350
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,530
I saw a person

351
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,530
who looked really like you today,

352
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,560
but when I looked back,

353
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,290
I found  out that it wasn't you.

354
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,000
How disappointing.

355
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,020
Zhu Panpan,

356
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,640
I'm in college now.

357
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,600
How about you?

358
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,210
You should be in college too, right?

359
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,770
I don't know where you are studying now.

360
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,350
I was enrolled at Southeast Science and Technology University

361
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,750
and I am majoring in biomedical engineering.

362
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,820
It's a hard major.

363
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,540
I have a lot of classes every day

364
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,080
and a ton of homework, too.

365
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,440
Zhu Panpan,

366
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,190
let me tell you a secret.

367
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,780
Today

368
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,340
I confessed to a person.

369
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,850
His name is Xiao Yuhe.

370
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,630
I don't know why,

371
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,930
but it reminds me of you

372
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,050
every time I see him

373
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,550
for no reason.

374
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,290
Chengcheng,

375
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,830
just put the data on my table.

376
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,690
Thank you so much.

377
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,990
Also,

378
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,720
could you send me the electronic file of the application list

379
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,840
through email?

380
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,030
Su Chengcheng,

381
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,020
greetings.

382
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,480
It's been a long time.

383
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
I still eat freeze pops.

384
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,010
It reminds me of you

385
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,660
every time I eat them.

386
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,970
Su Chengcheng,

387
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,120
this is a question

388
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,910
about counting squares.

389
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,780
First make a 3 times 3 pattern

390
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,480
of a checkerboard.

391
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,930
Then count the squares with 1 as its side length,

392
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,730
then count the...

393
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,240
So the result is 14.

394
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,100
Su Chengcheng,

395
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,120
you can send your letters

396
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,700
to this address.

397
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,040
Xinglin Street, Chengxi District, Haicheng City.

398
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,630
Hello, Su Chengcheng.

399
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,570
I'm studying at Southeast Science and Technology University too,

400
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,070
and I'm also majoring in biomedical engineering.

401
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,520
But

402
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm already a first-year doctoral student.

403
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,090
Let me tell you a secret as well.

404
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,650
Recently,

405
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,100
I have a crush on a girl.

406
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,170
Her name is

407
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,530
Su Chengcheng.

408
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,940
Hello.

409
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,630
Hello.

410
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,290
Hello.

411
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,760
You are Su Chengcheng, right?

412
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,800
My name is Musk,

413
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,280
and I have something to show you.

414
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,950
Musk,

415
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,310
I came across

416
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,260
Su Chengcheng on the bus today.

417
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,880
After all these years,

418
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,910
I've imagined countless times

419
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,370
how we would meet again.

420
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,920
She might ask，

421
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,050
"Zhu Panpan,

422
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,730
why did you leave without saying goodbye?"

423
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,900
I might ask，

424
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,660
"Chengcheng,

425
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,570
how have you been these years?

426
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,030
Did you miss me?

427
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,270
Have you made new friends?"

428
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,310
Maybe

429
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,630
we'd just stare at each other in silence

430
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,150
and not be able to say anything.

431
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,400
But when I saw her today,

432
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,150
I wasn't thinking about anything.

433
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,900
My mind was blank.

434
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,440
I walked through the crowd and approached her,

435
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,390
but she didn't seem to recognize me.

436
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,630
Watch it.

437
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,550
Musk.

438
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,380
Su Chengcheng confessed to me today.

439
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,730
She seemed to

440
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,920
have completely forgotten about Zhu Panpan.

441
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,830
To be honest,

442
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,830
when I saw her confessing to me

443
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,140
with those big eyes

444
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
and a smitten expression,

445
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,790
I felt really angry.

446
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,110
Revenge like this

447
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,540
doesn't feel good at all.

448
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,690
But seeing her upset

449
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,300
makes my heart hurt, too.

450
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,630
What a fall.

451
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,260
It hurts so much.

452
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,830
But it was kind of funny today.

453
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,330
Su Chengcheng had dyed her hair pink.

454
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,980
I checked the name

455
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,920
and it's pretty professional.

456
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,530
It's called

457
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,440
Barbiecore.

458
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,400
It's so cool.

459
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,960
Recently, I celebrated

460
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,820
Mid-Autumn Festival with her.

461
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,420
We climbed a mountain together,

462
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,120
enjoyed the moon together,

463
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,240
and also ate moon cakes together.

464
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,510
When I‘m with her,

465
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,960
I can't stop having fantasies about my future.

466
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,199
In my fantasies,

467
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,150
my future is all about her.

468
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,060
I want to

469
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,159
dive into deep oceans with her;

470
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,469
feel the beach breeze with her;

471
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,699
ride bikes with her;

472
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,730
shop at the farmer's market with her.

473
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,850
I want to be with her all the time.

474
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,320
But I don't know

475
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,820
if I'm in her fantasies

476
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,870
when she imagines her future.

477
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,120
Musk,

478
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,679
Wang Lunye has already figured out that

479
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,639
I'm Zhu Panpan,

480
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,080
but Su Chengheng hasn't.

481
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,630
I was ready

482
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,360
to confess my feelings to her,

483
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,950
but I don't know what to do

484
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,750
after this incident.

485
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,020
Tell me,

486
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,440
if I tell her

487
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,330
I'm Zhu Panpan,

488
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,320
will she

489
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,240
continue to push me away

490
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,970
like we were little?

491
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,060
I'm afraid.

492
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,820
I'm afraid

493
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,580
to bring the weak Zhu Panpan

494
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,930
in front of her;

495
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm afraid to let her see

496
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,130
the timid Zhu Panpan again.

497
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,510
Technically I'm not afraid.

498
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,190
I just don't want to lose her.

499
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,810
I understand the reasons,

500
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,800
but I still feel wronged.

501
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,980
Su Chengcheng,

502
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,310
I'm Zhu Panpan.

503
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,560
♫The more we get together,♫

504
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,020
♫Together, together.♫

505
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,200
I finally realize

506
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,100
how stupid it is

507
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,900
♫The more we get together,♫

508
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,890
to leave you without saying goodbye

509
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,050
because of a childhood misunderstanding.

510
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,330
♫The happier we'll be.♫

511
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,270
I finally realize that

512
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,960
♫For your friends are my friends,♫

513
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,830
no matter who I am

514
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,260
or where I am,

515
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,090
I will still miss you.

516
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,470
♫And my friends are your friends.♫

517
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,090
I want to meet you,

518
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,350
I want to see you giggling at me,

519
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,960
♫The more we get together,♫

520

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,430
