4
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,630
Does it work?

5
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,380
No way. It can’t be cleaned.

6
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,160
Sorry, Chengcheng.

7
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,340
It’s my fault.

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,430
I wish I had gone earlier.

9
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,290
In the way,

10
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,360
that girl wouldn’t have mixed the clothes

11
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,470
and dyed the coat.

12
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,290
It’s my fault.

13
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,730
It’s okay, Meizi.

14
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,720
No one would expect that.

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,020
Worst case scenario,

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll buy him another one.

17
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,740
Why can’t I find it?

18
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,900
How is it?

19
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,410
Did you find it?

20
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,820
Eighteen thousand? So expensive!

21
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,700
The coat is sold out.

22
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,450
I can't buy it anywhere.

23
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,710
What are you going to do?

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,090
I'll try my luck

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,170
looking for other dealers.

26
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,220
But

27
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,230
even if you find one,

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,920
it costs eighteen thousand

29
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,230
and we can’t afford it.

30
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,920
I saved some money.

31
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,670
I will buy him

32
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,550
the clothes first.

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,430
Hey.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,230
That's what you pay for the battery cart.

35
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,470
If you buy the coat,

36
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,590
you can't even afford the engine.

37
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,660
Why are you still laughing?

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,430
Why don't you ask Xiao Yuhe

39
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,480
if he accepts another one?

40
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,670
No way.

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
I've soiled

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,630
his coat,

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,310
and I buy him another style?

44
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,060
It doesn’t make sense.

45
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,340
I’ll take my time to save money for the e-bike.

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,310
No worries.

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
To express my apologies,

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,020
your lunch will be left to me from now on.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,750
I can still afford the meals in canteen.

50
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,400
Eat something.

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,160
And you’ll have the strength to save money for the engine.

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,670
You broken bicycle.

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,330
I will replace you sooner or later.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,400
Come on!

55

58
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,380
What a bicycle.

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,620
The chain fell off.

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,030
And even the seat is broken.

61
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,610
Do you need any help?

62
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,090
Let’s go.

63

Hurry up.

64

This...

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:53,960
You...

66
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,550
Your coat is of this brand.

67
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,990
Yes.

Do you like this brand too?

69
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,320
Where did you buy it?

70
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,300
I am familiar with a salesman.

71
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,340
And I bought it in his store.

72
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,540
You...

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,970
What’s up?

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,350
Do you remember

75
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,300
this one?

76
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,860
This one...

77
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,000
This is last year's co-branded item.

78
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,890
It should be out of sale by now.

79

80

this is for men.

82
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,330
Are you going to buy it as a gift?

83
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,570
No.

84
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,150
Senior Xiao's coat

85
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,230
was accidentally stained by me.

87

88
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,130
Let’s do this.

89

go to their store

91

to see if there are any new arrivals.

92

Shall we go together

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,020
after I finish the experiment in the afternoon?

94
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,450
Maybe it will hit the shelf again.

95
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,380
Sure.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,320
Okay.

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,540
Then tell me after you finish the experiment.

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,000

very unhappy now.

As for the coat...

105
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,980
I’ll tell him after I get a new one.

Good news for you.

You don't have to work this afternoon.

At the request of the dean,

110
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,770
we’ll do a romance experiment in the afternoon.

111
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,340
Really?

112
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,830
Gosh!

113
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,830
Because

we're going to do the romance experiment

115
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,510
on the rooftop.

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,950
By observing a romantic scene

117
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,430
such as sunset,

118
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,590
we will explore

119
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,250
cognitive factors

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
and gender differences in romance.

121

But

122

we singles

124

for you to warm up in advance.

130

The experiment

131
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:56,830
requires you to wear

132
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,870
portable physiological equipment

133
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,600
to monitor various vital signs

134
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,440
and explore the meaning of romance.

135
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,560
To put it simply,

136
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,530
it is to touch the head,

137
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,270
lift the chin and roll up the sleeves,

138
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,760
which are common interactions among couples.

139
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,840
That is to say,

140
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,110
if both parties in the experiment

141
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,420
can feel romance,

142

their vital signs

143
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,050
will change significantly.

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,950
Senior, your heart beats so fast.

179
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,680
Your heart beats fast too.

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,420
What's wrong with your voice?

181
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,510
I think Dongmao's experiment

182
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,240
is very good.

183
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,590
Both of our sample data

184
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,660
have intuitive changes.

185
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,310
[Xiao Yuhe, Su Chengcheng]

186
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,480
Let's move on.

187
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,540
Let's move on to the next test.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,970
Senior, what do you think

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,520
is the point of

190
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,510
rolling up each other's sleeves

191
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
from behind?

192
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,880
Previously, a paper

193
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,290
mentioned that

194
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,950
a height difference of 23 centimeters

195
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,590
is the most ideal.

196
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,860
I think

197
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,230
there should be

198
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,020
an academic point of view.

199
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,710
Let's get started.

200
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,740
As expected,

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,630
the closer two people are,

202
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,020
the faster the heart rate will be.

203
00:11:59,290 --> 00:11:59,890
Su Chengcheng.

204
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,290
Your heart beats so fast.

205
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,290
The same to you.

206
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,610
Not as fast as you.

207
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,560
What does this mean?

208
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,520
Why are you laughing?

209
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,280
Nothing.

210
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,470
Senior Jiafa

211
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,820
secretly told me a way just now,

212
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,870
the one super close.

213
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,670
Do you dare to try?

214
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,160
What’s the way?

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,180
Do you dare?

216
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,670
Of course I do.

217
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,460
Hold this position for now.

218
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,490
The longer the time,

219
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,480
the more data we can get.

220
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,230
Senior.

221
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,170
If anything’s on your mind,

222
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,470
just let me know.

223
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,510
If you are willing to...

224
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Besides,

225
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,410
we can

226
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,150
fly the paper plane again.

227
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,030
Okay.

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,940
Chengcheng.

229
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,880
Gu Chen.

230
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,120
What are you...?

231
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,500
Why are you here?

232
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,850
Right...

233
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,610
Senior.

234
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,260
I have something to do this afternoon.

235
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,980
Our experiment is finished.

236
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,050
Should I leave now?

237
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,760
Okay.

238
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,570
Bye, senior.

239
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,520
Sir.

240
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,820
Here you are.

241
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,690
This way.

242
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,470
Perfect timing.

243
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,130
It just arrived.

244
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,780
And I kept it for you.

245
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,220
Wrap it up and send it to him.

246
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,560
The two of you

247
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,740
are really close.

248
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,930
There is no need to send it.

249
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,700
He’s

250
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,980
right inside.

251
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,400
Go take a look.

252
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,750
Okay, I am going.

253
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,110
Okay.

254
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:25,730
Lin You.

255
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,340
We haven't been in touch for so long.

256
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,090
How are you doing?

257
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,920
Stop sending me these discs.

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,130
I can afford them myself.

259
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,260
I checked it out that

260
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,410
it is a limited edition,

261
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,700
and was so popular at that time

262
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,010
that it was sold out long ago.

263
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,640
Will other stores have it in stock?

264
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,810
Could you get the stock for me?

265
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,900
Other stores

266
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,330
probably don't have it either.

267
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,860
What about other models?

268
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,330
If you really want to buy,

269
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,350
there is indeed one more.

270
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,980
But that one is a misprint.

271
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,630
The pocket lining

272
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
is supposed to be gray,

273
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,330
but that of that one is yellow.

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,320
That’s why

275
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,300
it wasn’t for external sales.

276
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,660
I don't know if you mind or not.

277
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,640
I don't mind.

278
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,290
Could you

279
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,890
show it to me?

280
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,400
Okay.

281
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,740
That’s it.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,420
I was planning to

283
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,580
keep it for myself.

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,590
Since you like it so much,

285
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,720
I will sell it to you at the original price.

286
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,940
The original price?

287
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,700
See if it's the right size.

288
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,590
I don't know if it’s the right size for him.

289
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,650
How about I try it for you?

290
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,250
I should be about the same size

291
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,940
as senior Xiao.

292
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,900
Please take a look.

293
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,690
No need.

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,150
Sir.

295
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,250
Sir, take a look.

296
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,319
We have now...

297
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,430
Your clothes.

298
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,230
Thank you.

299
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,400
Excuse me.

300
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,820
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,610
Pharmacy?

302
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,050
Go out and turn left.

303
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:38,940
Okay.

304
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,140
Are you going to the pharmacy?

305
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,610
I will go with you.

306
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,590
Take your time.

307
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,960
Thank you.

308
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,440
Hello.

309
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,490
Is there any anti-allergic medicine?

310
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,430
Pouen allergy.

311
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,120
Hold on.

312
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,420
Okay.

313
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,040
Are you allergic?

314
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,310
No.

315
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,070
I’m buying it for someone else.

316
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,450
Chengcheng.

317
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,020
I really envy

318
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,750
your lab.

319
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,460
Good atmosphere.

320
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,340
And I am also particularly interested

321
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,320
in the research direction.

322
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,910
It's a pity that

323
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,440
I didn't know it

324
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,930
when I chose the laboratory before.

325
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,070
If only

326
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,920
I could join your lab.

327
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,420
I’m going to the lab in a while.

328
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,230
Go with me.

329
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,150
Take this opportunity

330
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,930
to get to know

331
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,660
each other.

332
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,890
What if you have the opportunity

333
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,690
to join us in the future?

334
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,330
Great.

335
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,750
Let me buy something to eat for them.

336
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,770
Milk tea.

337
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,840
Everyone loves it.

338
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,840
I'll take you

339
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,560
to a shop I frequent later.

340
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,250
Hello, your medicine.

341
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,960
Take one tablet once a day.

342
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,250
Okay, thanks.

343
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,830
You are welcome.

344
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,600
Check out there, right?

345
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,230
Yes, over there.

346
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,880
Okay, thank you.

347
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,350
Senior Dongmao.

348
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,990
This is Gu Chen, the monitor of our class.

349
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,140
Hello.

350
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,710
Hello, senior.

351
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,440
He likes our lab very much

352
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,660
and wants to find an opportunity

353
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,550
to join us,

354
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,650
so he came to get to know everyone

355
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,470
in advance.

356
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,540
Senior, milk tea for you.

357
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,000
For us?

358
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,630
You are so considerate.

359
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,880
Thank you.

360
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,510
Put it here.

361
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,050
Dongmao.

362
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,830
I’m kind of busy.

363
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,340
Show Gu

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,360
around our lab.

365
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,650
No problem. Let’s go.

366
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,650
This way.

367
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,270
Let me briefly introduce

368
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,010
our lab to you.

369
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,820
Senior.

370
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,700
Since you are allergic to pollen,

371
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
I bought some anti-allergic medicines for you.

372
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,170
Thank you.

373
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,290
Nothing.

374
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,100
Well.

375
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,230
Remember to take it.

376
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,780
Chengcheng.

377
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,080
I will take a look around

378
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,790
with senior Dongmao.

379
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,380
Okay.

380
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,530
I’ll show him around.

381
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,380
Okay.

382
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,240
Remember to take it.

383
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,690
Okay.

384
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,740
Block the light.

385
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,810
Senior Xixi.

386
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,790
I bought the milk tea.

387
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,750
On the table outside.

388
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,830
Would you like one?

389
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,400
I don't drink milk tea.

390
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,270
Don’t you?

391
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,500
I have a question.

392
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,630
Why do I

393
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,590
keep running into you recently?

394
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,350
Quite a coincidence.

395
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,390
Well, senior Xixi.

396
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,800
Chengcheng is my friend.

397
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,490
Maybe the reason you keep running into me

398
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,150
is because

399
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,130
I always come to her.

400
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm here now

401
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,180
because

402
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,320
everyone has gone to the main building.

403
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,590
They asked me here to call you.

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,680
Senior.

405
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,350
Have you misunderstood something?

406
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,580
What do you mean?

407
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,180
It is indeed time.

408
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,240
So soon.

409
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,950
How time flies.

410
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,310
Follow the process.

411
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,550
Okay.

412
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,630
Otherwise the error may be...

413
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,910
It’s almost time. Let’s go.

414
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,510
Senior.

415
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,610
Where is senior Xiao?

416
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,410
He seems to be busy

417
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,390
in the lab.

418
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,560
It’s okay. I ordered some food.

419
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,250
I’ll ask him to bring it over.

420
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,920
Senior.

421
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,510
I will stay

422
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,670
and do senior Xiao a favor.

423
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,440
No problem.

424
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,110
Senior Jiafa.

425
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,720
I’ll also stay

426
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,670
to help senior Xiao.

427
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,230
Since you really want to help,

428
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,990
help me with this.

429
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,540
Thank you, junior Yiran.

430
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,930
Zhang Li, Dongmao.

431
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,040
Let’s go first.

432
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,630
Okay.

433
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,220
Let’s go.

434
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,910
Senior.

435
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,990
Why don't you rest for a while?

436
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,820
Take the milk tea.

437
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,350
It doesn't taste good when the ice melts.

438
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,340
No need.

439
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,140
I had two Americano's

440
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,080
in this morning.

441
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,310
People should not consume

442
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,020
more than 400 mg

443
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,960
of caffeine per day.

444
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,490
Thank you.

445
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,370
Okay.

446
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,910
Then take mine.

447
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,880
This is herbal jelly

448
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,750
with coconut milk,

449
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,530
decaffeinated.

450
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,650
I have to work first.

451
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,940
Senior.

452
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,980
Take this.

453
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,200
The coat you gave me before

454
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,660
was accidentally

455
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,120
damaged by me.

456
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,600
So I bought you a new one.

457
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,970
It’s just a piece of clothing.

458
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,050
Not a big deal.

459
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,370
Let me tell you.

460
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,900
That coat of yours

461
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,850
is sold out,

462
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
so I can't buy it anymore.

463
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,260
Although this one is a misprint,

464
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,640
its model and everything else

465
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,770
are the same as yours.

466
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,790
It's just that the color

467
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,320
of the pocket lining is different.

468
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm really sorry

469
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,850
for accidentally

470
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,660
staining your coat.

471
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,960
But I asked many stores

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and failed to find it.

473
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,400
It was Gu Chen

474
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,750
who asked his friend

475
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,540
to find the only store with it.

476
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,610
The two of us

477
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,560
went to many places...

478
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,620
What is the relationship

479
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,740
between you and Gu Chen?

480
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,430
Nothing special.

481
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,600
He is the monitor of our class.

482
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,770
So he helps me

483
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,460
in many things.

484
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,510
He’s your monitor

485
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,080
and he always helps you.

486
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,610
Then give the coat to him.

487
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,850
What do you mean?

488
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,920
I gave you back the coat.

489
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,280
If you want to throw it away,

490
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,890
as you wish.

491
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,570
Hello.

492
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,590
Is this the lab

493
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,170
of Zhu Jiafa?

494
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,300
Here comes his takeaway.

495
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,480
Yes, give it to me.

496
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,530
Hold on.

497
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,550
There is more.

498
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,710
You’d better

499
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,640
ask someone for help.

500
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,070
I’m afraid you can’t take it all yourself.

501
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,540
Never mind.

502
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,020
I can totally manage it myself.

503
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,540
I just accidentally dropped it.

504
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,960
It’s not my fault.

505
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,610
Why are you angry?

506
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,640
Since it fell on the ground,

507
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,720
just pick it up.

508
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,300
[Thank you, senior]

509
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,620
I...

510
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,840
Get on.

511
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,500
Hurry up.

512
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,540
Where did you get the robot?

513
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,670
I made it by myself.

514
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,130
I have a friend

515
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,850
who also likes robots.

516
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,540
I found that

517
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,270
you have many similarities.

518
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,200
Who’s that?

519
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,570
None of your business.

520
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,370
Yuhe.

521
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,950
The sun was almost setting.

522
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,990
Why are you here so late?

523
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,510
Yuhe.

524
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,740
Why are you carrying Chengcheng behind your back?

525
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,460
I accidentally

526
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,680
sprained my ankle downstairs.

527
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,650
He just

528
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,350
-helped me to...
-Zhu.

529
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,630
Take these.

530

00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,630
to the new girl

703
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,730
in your lab,

704
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,360
who’s also called Su Chengcheng.

705
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,220
Is she

706
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,340
the same one in your elementary school?

707
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,520
Why did you get in touch with her again?

708
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,220
Have you forgotten that

709
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,850
you even changed your life plan

710
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,110
and refuted me for her?

711
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,030
But she had a new friend

712
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,450
the next day.

713
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,270
You were crying alone under the quilt.

714
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,630
Why didn’t you

715
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,870
learn any lesson from it?

716
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,420
I've told you so much.

717
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,630
Are you listening?

718
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,140
Xiao Yuhe.

719
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,290
Xiao Yuhe.

720
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,810
Senior.

721
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,530
Shouldn't junior Chengcheng be the one who likes you?

722
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,540
Why is your data changing

723
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,310
so obviously?

724
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,510
Could it be that

725
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,010
you two are in love with each other?

726
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,850
It’s so obvious.

727
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,640
Heart rate fluctuations involve

728
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,970
both environmental and physical factors.

729
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,230
These statistics

730
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,300
can't directly mean that

731
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,930
I like her.

732
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,470
Senior.

733
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,500
Chengcheng is at the door.

734
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,890
I'll go to work.

735
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,600
Su Chengcheng.

736
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,670
Xiao Yuhe doesn't like you at all.

737
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,530
Stop being self-sentimental.
