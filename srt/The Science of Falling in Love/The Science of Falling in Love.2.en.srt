our new classmate

Zhu Panpan again.

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,329
Let's give him a big hand.

15
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,910
Do you like

16
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,000
your new classmate?

17
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,990
Yes!

18
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,829
But,

19
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,780
since Zhu Panpan

20
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,510
is new in our class,

21
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,100
he is still unfamiliar with everyone,

22
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,990
so

23
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,620
he seldom speaks.

24
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,450
Can we give him a hand?

25
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,060
How about we

26
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,340
take the initiative to make friends with him

27
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:41,950
and encourage him to speak more?

But you got a 99.

118
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,200
How is that blown?

119
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,970
You are first in our class!

120
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,430
Look.

121
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,900
There is one point deducted,

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,390
so it's not a 100.

123
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,230
But I only got 74 .

124
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,350
Don't be afraid.

125

Auntie, it's so yummy.

130
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,610
Can I have another bowl of rice?

131
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,860
Yes.

132
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,430
Of course.

133
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,480
Would you like some more?

134
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,880
No more, thanks.

135
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,710
Auntie.

136
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,670
If my mom can

137
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,710
cook such delicious food,

138
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,320

Eat this.

141
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,880
Mom,

142
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,930
I'd like another bowl, too.

143
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:29,920
OK,

144
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,880
give me the bowl.

145
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,410
Auntie, Zhu Panpan is so smart!

146
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,030
Why?

147
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,960
Our last exam is very difficult,

148
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,310
but he's the only one that

149
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,590
got a 90 plus.

150
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,520
Really?

151
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,070
His score is about a dozen points higher

152
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,620
than the second place.

153
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,190
Our teacher always tells us

154
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,240
to follow his example.

155
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,110
Auntie, you are such a good mother

156
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,910
that you've educated Zhu Panpan to be so outstanding.

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,380
And you cook such delicious food.

158
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Are you a fairy?

159
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,160
You are the little fairy.

160
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,720
If you like the food,

161
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,100
come and enjoy it anytime you want.

162
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,100
I've never seen Panpan

163
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,430
have the second bowl of rice before.

164
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,250
Because of you,

165
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,640
he has started to enjoy eating.

166
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,150
Here.

167
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,520
Have some meat.

168
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,020
Want some more, Panpan?

169
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,190
Eat this.

170
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,360
Thanks.

171
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,990
Don't play with Zhu Panpan.

172
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes, I agree.

173
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,590
He's so strange.

174
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,820
No wonder he has no friends.

175
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,000
Zhu Panpan, would you like my popsicle?

176
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,960
One half for you and another half for me.

177
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,090
What's the next line?

178
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,030
Oh, right.

179
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,400
One half for you and another half for me.

180
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,590
You are my best friend

181
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,880
forever.

182
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,250
Let's go to the same senior high school

183
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,690
and college in the future,

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,390
so that we'll be together forever.

185
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,460
Thank you, Su Chengcheng.

186
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,830
Take the most valued thing of mine

187
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,420
as a gift.

188
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,750
Then you are my best friend

189
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,560
forever, too.

190
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,960
Cheers.

191
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,770
Do you still remember

192
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,980
your best friends' names in childhood?

193
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,850
Wang Lunye.

194
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,090
Yuhang.

195
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,320
Beibei.

196
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:08,830
Mengmeng.

197
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,990
And many others.

198
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,590
Is that all?

199
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,330
You don't know them, anyway.

200
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,070
That's all.

201
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,480
I like you.

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,110
Repeat.

203
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,110
I like you.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,320
No,

205
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,880
you don't like me at all.

206
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,690
- I mean…
- Don't move.

207
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,440
The device is expensive.

208
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,590
How do you want me to prove that

209
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,150
I like you?

210
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,830
Now that you've joined our lab

211
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,100
and become a member of our research group,

212
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,470
we should use scientific methods

213
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,920
to prove it.

214
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,760
Like, do experiments.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,650
Do experiments

216
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,670
to prove I like you?

217
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,330
Yes.

218
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,950
Ms. Chen.

219
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,860
That's a valuable discussion.

220
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,310
The research topic of emotion brain-computer interface

221
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,490
is also about that.

222
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,740
How about

223
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,620
you

224
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,940
[Head of Southeast Sci-Tech University Brain and Intelligence Lab]

225
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,940
[Chen Yourong]

226
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,980
design a simple experiment

227
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,830
to see

228
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,390
whether it's possible to

229
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,630
tell whether one is into another

230
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,670
through external indications?

231
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,310
Let's make it the theme

232
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,580
of our next sharing session.

233
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,830
I've always believed that

234
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,460
there are only two results of a declaration of love.

235
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,300
Yes or no.

236
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,550
I didn't see the third one coming:

237
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,950
do experiments.

238
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,350
But before the so-called

239
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,740
love experiment,

240
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,240
I have to…

241
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,930
Chengcheng,

242
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,470
your task for today

243
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,880
is to clean the lab.

244
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,770
It's so messy.

245
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,200
Don't say that,

246
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,640
Chengcheng.

247
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,220
Do you have any idea

248
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,910
how many valuable achievements

249
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,700
are born from the mess?

250
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,180
You only see the mess

251
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,110
without noticing

252
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,460
the serious meaning behind it.

253
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,040
Yes, of course.

254
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,610
Oh right, Chengcheng.

255
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,520
It is imperative

256
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,710
to put on the lab-gown

257
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,620
before entering the lab.

258
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,770
OK.

259
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,040
I almost forgot these.

260
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,480
Chengcheng,

261
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,230
it's cleaned

262
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,110
all by yourself?

263
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,250
Is it up to standard?

264
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,770
Yes, of course.

265
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,590
It's beyond the standard.

266
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,950
Good job.

267
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,540
It…

268
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,220
Is also cleaned by me.

269
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,070
Neat, isn't it?

270
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,490
What?

271
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,200
Well,

272
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,110
have you seen

273
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,090
the oranges on the desk?

274
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,810
Oh, those.

275
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,380
They were thrown away.

276
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,390
Thrown away?

277
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,330
What?

278
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,310
They've gone bad.

279
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,710
They were used to practice suturing

280
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,710
by our senior,

281
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,360
and now you threw them away.

282
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,530
If she asks,

283
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,390
do not mention me.

284
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,590
I've never been here.

285
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,660
Jiafa.

286
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,710
Chengcheng.

287
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,930
Good luck.

288
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,060
Is she so terrifying?

289
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,150
I'm screwed.

290
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,250
These two

291
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,030
should do.

292
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,160
There you go.

293
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,550
Miss,

294
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,050
can I use your phone?

295
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,470
Robbery!

296
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,580
S… Stop!

297
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,300
Catch...

298
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,700
Stop him!

299
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,040
Robbery!

300
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,619
You! Stop!

301
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,339
Stop!

302
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,060
Robbery!

303
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,000
Stop!

304
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,280
Stop him!

305
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,990
Stop!

306
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,349
Catch him!

307
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,270
Stop!

308
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,200
Robbery!

309
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,260
Stop!

310
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,220
Freeze!

311
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,350
Thank you.

312
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,910
You want to use my phone, huh?

313
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,510
Where's my phone?

314
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,270
Give it back.

315
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,140
Where's it?

316
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,550
Tell me!

317
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,470
Where's it?

318
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,140
Come on,

319
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,050
use your head.

320
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,150
Clumsy as you, you think

321
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,150
you can get out of this?

322
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,110
How dare you.

323
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,710
Where's my phone?

324
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,720
Tell me!

325
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,860
Where is it?

326
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,860
There are only several pockets.

327
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,070
Here it is.

328
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,860
Thanks.

329
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,570
Use your head.

330
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,130
Don't move.

331
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,020
He's yours.

332
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,330
OK,

333
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,090
we'll have him.

334
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,500
Thanks for your help.

335
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,590
Chengcheng.

336
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,790
- Get up.
- Did you get your things back?

337
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,630
Yes.

338
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,510
They are brought by you?

339
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,080
Thank you.

340
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,130
It's not a big deal.

341
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,930
Thank you!

342
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,060
Goodbye!

343
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,310
She's so cool,

344
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,210
isn't she?

345
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,380
He's Gu Chen, our monitor.

346
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,810
He's very nice,

347
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,690
always with a mysterious smile.

348
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,300
Zhu Jiafa,

349
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,870
where are my oranges?

350
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,670
It's her?

351
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,920
Senior Xixi.

352
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,310
What a coincidence!

353
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,880
Oranges?

354
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,670
What oranges?

355
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,980
Those two you use to

356
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,770

I did a lot of research

last night.

522

To tell

523
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,030
whether one is into another

524
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,160
through physiological data

525
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,100
is a one-way experiment.

526
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,990
When you are into someone,

527
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,990
your heart beats faster,

528
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,350
you have a higher blood oxygen level,

529
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,670
and produce more hormones.

530
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,190
But we can't jump to the conclusion

531
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,550
that one is into another

532
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,990
based on

533
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,230
these simple changes.

534
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,000
So

535
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,220
even if

536
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,350
all my experimental data

537
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,000
meet the requirements,

538
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,660
I still can't prove I'm into you.

539
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,600
You are making me prove

540
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,670
something that cannot be proved.

541
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,960
Seems you really did a lot of research.

542
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,990
It is impossible to prove

543
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,980
whether one is into another.

544
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,510
What do you mean?

545
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,470
You are in favor of me?

546
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,280
We can't prove whether one is into another,

[Likes proving experiments]

549
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,630
but we can observe it.

550
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,070
In 2003,

551
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,910
Helen Fisher and her lab members

552
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,270
scanned the brains of 17 couples

553
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,420
through MRI

554
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,070
and found apparent activation

555
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,470
in the ventral tegmentum and caudate nucleus

556
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,390
of the midbrain

557
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,540
when they looked at

558
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,720
the photos of their partners.

559
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,110
And the more they love each other,

560
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,350
the more active

561
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,940
the two areas are.

562
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,150
So through observation on

563
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,550
the two areas

564
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,620
we can tell whether

565
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,950
one is into the other.

566
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,630
We need to redo the experiment.

567
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,120
Again?

568
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,390
When we were

569
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,630
doing the NIR brain function imaging,

570
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,950
the ventral tegmentum

571
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,270
and caudate nucleus of your midbrain were not activated.

572
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,970
You explained

573
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,110
it was due to the ambience in the lab,

574
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,750
so we can cultivate the ambience

575
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,630
between us before

576
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,030
the next data collection.

577
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,910
What do you mean?

578
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,860
I mean going on a date,

579
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,110
doing something

580
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,860
common for couples

581
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,290
to get us closer

582
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,150
so that

583
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,950
the relative functional areas

584
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,950
in your brain

585
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,150
will be fully activated

586
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,350
when doing the NIR imaging.

587
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,460
A date…

588
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,030
You can decide

589
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,710
the places you want to go

590
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,580
and the things you want to do.

591
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,410
Just let me know when you have decided.

592
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,810
OK.

593
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,490
My friends,

594
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,900
he asked me out.

595
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,300
On his own initiative.

596
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,650
Have you decided where to go?

597
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,670
I did some research.

598
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,010
Red Brick Art Museum will do.

599
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,660
There will be

600
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,480
an installation art exhibition recently.

601
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,430
It'll be nice

602
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,630
to sit

603
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,150
in the coffee shop nearby

604
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,110
after seeing the exhibition.

605
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,620
You are good.

606
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,830
You really did a lot of research.

607
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,460
That hurts.

611
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,330
The assignment of physics should be handed in tomorrow.

612
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,800
And the time for the English test is also fixed.

613
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,710
Only you two didn't reply in the class group.

614
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,970
Oh God, stop, don't mention it.

615
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,230
Didn't we just finish the internship

616
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,310
of Electronic Technology

617
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,450
of the second semester of the freshman year?

618
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,700
And we handed in the assignments

619
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,730
of Mathematic Statistics and biology a few days ago.

620
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,000
I feel like I'm in Grade 12.

621
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,180
I can't believe that.

622
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,270
We are

623
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,630
paying the tuition for one person,

624
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,800
having a curriculum for two people,

625
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,170
and doing assignments for four people.

626
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,040
One minute there are assignments and exams,

627
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,420
and the next there are experiments in the lab.

628
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,890
I'm exhausted.

629
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,740
But speaking of the lab,

630
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,080
Chengcheng,

631
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,150
the Brain and Intelligence Lab you picked

632
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,800
is a national key subject.

633
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,180
It's a good opportunity.

634
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,790
Come on.

635
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,220
All the members in my team are talented

636
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,680
except me.

637
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,050
Tell you what,

638
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,070
there's a horrible senior

639
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,640
in our lab...

640
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,270
How come such a pretty face like you

641
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,700
is so brazen?

642
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,470
You will be over any boy you like,

643
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,620
won't you?

644
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,160
Who do you think you are to pursue Wang Jiaze?

645
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,930
How dare she?

646
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,630
Stop being mad.

647
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,020
Calm yourself down.

648
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,310
Will she think it was me

649
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,160
who gave the cup to her?

650
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,090
What should I do?

651
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,800
What should I do?

652
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,520
Chengcheng.

653
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,460
Give it to her.

654
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,630
- I don't dare.
- Talk to her.

655
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,449
Talk to her.

656
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,540
Just go!

657
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,040
Senior.

658
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:27,920
Um…

659
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,239
- There's some tissue.
- Don't follow me.

660
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,389
Jiafa.

661
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,380
OK, I'm on my way.

662
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,300
I just heard that

663
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,460
you joined our lab

664
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,980
all for

665
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,110
dating Xiao Yuhe.

666
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,240
I don't understand.

667
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,240
Do you think this lab

668
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,540
is suitable for you to date someone

669
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,830
or

670
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,190
you feel like dating someone

671
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,680
once you enter the lab?

672
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,050
Why don't you speak?

673
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,360
You think I'm giving you a hard time?

674
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,980
Do not distract him.

675
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,260
Do you know

676
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,390
how much hope we have placed

677
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,780
on Xiao Yuhe?

678
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,080
Do you know

679
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,010
how precious

680
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,170
his time for experiment is?

681
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,440
Stop doing that.

682
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,780
Is there anything else?

683
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,510
You can go then.

684
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,170
Goodbye, sir.

685
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,530
Su Chengcheng,

686
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,110
have you decided on the location for the experiment?

687
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,590
I have so many things to do

688
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,630
that I haven't decided.

689
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,840
Then leave it to me.

690
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,350
I'll let you know when I have decided.

691
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,380
No wonder he's

692
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,550
a curve wrecker.

693
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,760
Cultivating ambience

694
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,200
to get closer,

695
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,170
monitoring the physiological data and brain movements.

696
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,110
Just admit you are into her.

697
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,080
Why does it have to be so roundabout?

698
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:55,670
Right?

699
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,060
Into me?

700
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,660
Are you sure?

701
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,670
It's natural for a man

702
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,560
to be indirect

703
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,830
in his confession

704
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,890
of love.

705
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,520
Chengcheng.

706
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,440
Have you decided

707
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:07,970
where you are going on a date?

708
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,410
No, I haven't.

709
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,390
Bro Ying,

710
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,400
where are you going?

711
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,030
The course Prof. Du teaches is a little difficult.

712
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,590
I've borrowed

713
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,710
the notes of a senior

714
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,850
and plan to preview the lessons.

715
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,110
I'll go with you.

716
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,390
I plan to preview, too.

717
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,560
Can I borrow the notes?

718
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,520
Sure.

719
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,660
How diligent.

720
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,990
It's so late and they still work hard.

721
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,030
Where were we?

722
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,170
Your date.

723
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,680
Ask him!

724
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,110
You need to know where is the date

725
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,200
and what to wear.

726
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,450
I'll look impatient if so.

727
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,530
The place of the date is the amusement park.

728
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,550
I'll see you out of your dorm

729
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,500
at 2:00 PM tomorrow.

730
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,770
[Dormitory of PhD students]

731
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,480
Su Chengcheng!

732
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,510
Su Chengcheng!

733
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,770
Zhu Panpan!

734
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,200
Zhu Panpan!

735
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,330
I'm here.

736
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,680
Come.

737
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,460
Come here.

738
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,510
Zhu Panpan,

739
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,770
I'm here!

740
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,860
Su Chengcheng!
