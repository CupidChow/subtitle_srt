4
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,320
Su Chengcheng

5
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,170
has been in our lab

6
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,289
for a while

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,240
since the beginning of the school year.

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,640
Today

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,310
according to

10
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,250
the practice of our lab,

11
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,390
we will

12
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,430
decide

13
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,070
whether she can continue to stay

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,280
by voting.

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,590
Didn't you say there would only be nine people?

16
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,110
Pass them on.

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,430
Are the five votes of you still working?

18
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,390
There are so many people.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,670
We usually only have nine.

20
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,950
I don't know what's going on today, either.

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,430
Then with so many people here, what should I do?

22
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,350
It's fine. It's fine.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,990
Su Chengcheng.

24
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,470
How can you still think of whispering

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,990
at this moment?

26
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,010
Is this funny to you?

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,400
No.

28
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,160
How about this?

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,260
Please come to the front.

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,350
Just stand there.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,170
When I'm counting the votes,

32
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,250
you write them down.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,030
The voting officially begins.

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,400
All the votes are collected.

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,829
Now, I'll startthe counting.

36
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,670
The first one is

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,100
dissen…

38
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,340
Affirmative.

39
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,270
Su Chengcheng has her own thinking,

40
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,079
and can complete her assignment on time.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,329
She does not follow others blindly,

42
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,400
and she's also a good gamer.

43
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,710
The second one is affirmative.

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,690
Su Chengcheng is kind

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,930
and lively.

46
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,010
She can often liven up

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,530
the atmosphere of the lab

48
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,330
and cheer everyone up.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,910
In my opinion,

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,480
we come to the lab

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,940
to study

52
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,839
and to complete our projects.

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,029
We are not here to party,

54
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,030
so what kind of atmosphere do we need to liven up?

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,980
And what kind of mood do we need to be cheered up?

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,130
It's a dissenting vote. A dissenting vote.

57
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,740
All Su Chengcheng thinks is romance.

58
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,310
Her motivation to come to the lab is not pure.

59
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,230
She only thinks about relationships,

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,740
and she's not capable,

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,150
so she's not suitable to stay in Brain and Intelligence.

62
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,070
Affirmative. Dissenting. Dissenting.

63
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,820
Affirmative. Dissenting.

64
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,870
Su Chengcheng doesn't know

65
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,600
how to use many of the instruments.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,100
OK.

67
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,530
We've finished counting.

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,430
Let's see the results.

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,200
It's a tie.

70
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,060
Prof. Du, it's a tie.

71
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,110
Well.

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,640
How about you

73
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,520
make an exception and let me stay

74
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,510
for a couple of days so you can observe my performance?

75
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,090
Well...

76
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,790
How come you are so late?

77
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,830
Is Xiao Yuhe

78
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,400
the only one who hasn't voted yet?

79
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,120
How about this?

80
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,870
Let's leave

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,390
the casting vote to Xiao Yuhe.

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,260
Xiao Yuhe.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Tell us.

84
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,400
Do you agree with Su Chengcheng to stay

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,420
or leave?

86
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,120
Prof. Du.

87
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,090
I'll leave.

88
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,580
You don't have to ask him.

89
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,520
Why are you leaving?

90
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,760
What's the problem?

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,240
You have to carry everything through to the end.

92
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,050
This isn't the end yet, is it?

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,980
And Xiao Yuhe hasn't said anything, right?

94
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,040
Stand up right

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
and listen to what Xiao Yuhe has to say.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,250
Go ahead.

97
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,990
I agree with her to stay.

98
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,480
So that's an affirmative vote, right?

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,740
You are affirmative...

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,980
Well, there has to be a reason.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,650
Tell us your reasons.

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
It is true that

103
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,550
her researching skills are not up to standard

104
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,200
by objective standards.

105
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,570
However, she is only an undergraduate student

106
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,850
and is still in the process of learning the fundamentals.

107
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,350
The specific competencies

108
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,430
can be developed later.

109
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,190
What I

110
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,630
value more

111
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,930
is her underlying driving mechanism,

112
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,050
such as self-doubt, self-iteration,

113
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,310
and curiosity,

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,950
which was demonstrated

115
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,909
when doing the romance experiment

116
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,010
with me.

117
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,630
Besides, when I asked her

118
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,510
to clean the electrode caps,

119
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,770
she not only cleaned it

120
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,590
but also sorted

121
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,430
all the relevant equipment.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Moreover,

123
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,370
she's quite patient with Jianming.

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,270
Patience is the most important quality in researching.

125
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,660
So I decide to let her stay.

126
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,710
The result is out.

127
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,210
The meeting is over.

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,570
I want a cup of bubble tea with half sugar.

129
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,159
OK.

130
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,050
3, 2, 1.

131
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,340
♫A secret has made a decision.♫

132
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,110

142

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,990

144
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,900

147
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,900
♫Yes OK. Yes OK. Let's go.♫

148
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,480
Cheers.

149
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,010
Now this is the only difficult point,

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
I think that for the students to grasp it now, it's…

151
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,920
Come in.

152
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,220
Ms. Chen,

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
you've come back from the academic conference?

154
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,930
Yes.

155
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,720
Prof. Du, these are the papers you asked for.

156
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,150
Then I'll leave.

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,970
Wait.

158
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,630
I have something to talk with you.

159
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,120
Tell me.

160
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,350
Why did you let

161
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,890
Su Chengcheng stay?

162
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,160
I said my reasons earlier.

163
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,000
You call those reasons?

164
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,550
If feeding the monkey well

165
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,530
counts as a sign of competence,

166
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,540
then, according to your logic,

167
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,070
we should recruit more zoo keepers

168
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,830
for our lab

169
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,080
in the future.

170
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,030
I'm fine with that.

171
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,940
It's up to you.

172
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,080
Go, go, go. Hurry and leave.

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,170
Ms. Chen,

174
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm having a headache over this.

175
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,660
I found that

176
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,350
since he met Su Chengcheng,

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,350
he's become abnormal.

178
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
He is getting stupider every day.

179
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,480
He stood just like he did a moment ago.

180
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,300
Just like this.

181
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,940
Su Chengcheng?

182
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,520
Is she pretty?

183
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,440
No, she isn't.

184
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,910
No, wait,

185
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,150
Ms. Chen,

186
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,430
what did you just say?

187
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,150
I asked you if she's pretty.

188
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,220
You've met her.

189
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,230
She's the girl

190
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,510
who did the romance experiment

191
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,050
with Xiao Yuhe.

192
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,750
She's that girl.

193
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,240
Yes.

194
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,190
I think she's pretty.

195
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,610
Then this romance experiment

196
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,460
is getting interesting.

197
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,430
Chengcheng.

198
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,750
Say, why did Xiao Yuhe

199
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,030
vote for you to stay

200
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,770
in the end?

201
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,400
How shouldI know?

202
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,270
His mind is so difficult to guess.

203
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,430
Say,

204
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,910
could it be that

205
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,930
he still sees me as a tool

206
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,990
and is secretly

207
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,130
trying to do that experiment again?

208
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,910
Then ask him.

209
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,370
I don't want to.

210
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,400
Look,

211
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,910
you have to stay in this lab

212
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,260
at least until finishing your graduation project in your senior year, right?

213
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,400
You have to get along with him

214
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,240
for such a long time.

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,830
I think that for a lot of things,

216
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,640
it's better to ask him for clarification.

217
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,630
I'm with Xiaomeng.

218
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,360
You should ask him.

219
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,440
Ask him.

220
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,680
No.

221
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,870
Ask him.

222
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,050
To get things clear.

223
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,100
Do it.

224
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,140
Do it. Do it.

225
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,580
[Xiao Yuhe]

226
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,070
Why did you want me

227
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,870
to stay in the lab?

228
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,950
Do you

229
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,230
have other experiments to do

230
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,230
and want me to

231
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,030
continue being your subject?

232
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,410
He replied.

233
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,020
What did he say?

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,600
Let me see.

235
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,980
He recalled it.

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,200
What did he say?

237
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,350
"No."

238
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,730
Just a message with two letters?

239
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,390
What's the point of recalling it?

240
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,740
He's typing.

241
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,110
See what he sent.

242
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,870
"No."

243
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,040
What does this mean?

244
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,930
Beats me.

245
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,300
Told you.

246
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,140
His mind is hard to guess.

247
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,140
Chengcheng.

248
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,270
Maybe Xiao Yuhe doesn't hate you.

249
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,820
Then, how about we watch a movie

250
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,660
after dinner?

251
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,460
You bet.

252
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,020
As long as you are happy.

253
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,370
Great.

254
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,680
Our Jiaze is great.

255
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,320
Senior Jiaze.

256
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,020
You are...?

257
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,190
Senior Jiaze.

258
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,890
You don't remember me?

259
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
I asked you

260
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,950
several questions

261
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,390
in your last forum,

262
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,670
and you answered them all at that time.

263
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,560
Don't mention it.

264
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,500
Just a piece of cake.

265
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,250
They were a piece of cake for you,

266
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,900
but for me,

267
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,310
your answers have enlightened me a lot.

268
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,210
I've been trying to find an opportunity

269
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,710
to thank you

270
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,630
but haven't found one yet.

271
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
I just bought a cup of milk tea,

272
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,910
which I haven't opened yet,

273
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,310
and I've heard that it's a hit on the Internet.

274
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,080
If you don't mind,

275
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,980
I will give it to you.

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,500
No, no, you don't have to.

277
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,930
-Just take it.
-Really, you don't have to.

278
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,670
Senior Jiaze, you...

279
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,790
You...

280
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,180
What have you done?

281
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,560
I...

282
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,960
Senior Jiaze, I'm sorry, I...

283
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,860
-I... I didn't mean it, I...
-Tissue papers, do you have tissue papers?

284
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,660
I don't.

285
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,160
Do you have any?

286
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
-Me... Me either.
-What’s wrong with you.

287
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm really sorry, I...

288
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,980
I've got a class.

289
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,750
I have to go.

290
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,230
Senior Jiaze, please get some tissue papers and clean it with them.

291
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

292
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,630
What's the problem with this guy?

293
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,570
Let's go.

294
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,670
Let's head to that restroom

295
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,400
-and clean it up.
-What’s wrong?

296
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,480
Why does he always have trouble with milk tea?

297
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,050
Why is he so annoying?

298
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,530
So disgusting.

299
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,430
Don't let me see him again.

300
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,960
Yeah.

301
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,030
You look so clean and nice,

302
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,400
but why are you so obnoxious?

303
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,550
When you see a guy you like,

304
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,690
will you just try to get close to him?

305
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,540
I have modified

306
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,040
this source code remotely,

307
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,910
please check again.

308
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,450
OK.

309
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,380
Why are you playing games all day?

310
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,650
What do you think about Su Chengcheng?

311
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,620
What do you mean?

312
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,890
I think she's nice.

313
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,900
Haven't I already said that

314
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,250
although her scientific research ability is not strong,

315
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,750
what I value

316
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,980
is her underlying ability?

317
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,950
I think she's nice,

318
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,310
because she plays games for me in the morning.

319
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,310
What are you talking about?

320
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,570
See, Anipop

321
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,650
seems easy,

322
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,690
but

323
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,180
even if you understand its algorithm,

324
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,150
you'll never know

325
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,670
what critter

326
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,640
it will drop next.

327
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,840
It's full of surprise.

328
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,960
I think that

329
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,900
Su Chengcheng

330
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,700
is a surprise like it.

331
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,960
But maybe she's the kind of surprise that makes you happy.

332
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,430
You.

333
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,130
Senior Yuhe,

334
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,510
it seems that

335
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,760
this part still has problems.

336
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,690
It keeps popping weird letters.

337
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,790
OK.

338
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,400
I'll go to the lab and take a look.

339
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,040
OK.

340
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,440
Unbelievable.

341
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,680
Let me tell you, you can't trust

342
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,980
Xie Xiaomeng's words entirely.

343
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,700
Xiao Yuhe has something wrong

344
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,060
with this part of his,

345
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,860
and you can't interpret him

346
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,260
with the logic of normal people.

347
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,950
Chengcheng, I'm looking for you.

348
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,030
Ms. Chen said that

349
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,609
there was a mission for you.

350
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,250
Ms. Chen

351
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,520
has a mission

352
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,790
for me?

353
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:12,760
By the way,

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,460
she asked you to go with Xiao Yuhe.

355
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,310
Your senior

356
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,859
has to come with me for an urgent meeting

357
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,530
and the family baby-sitter is off today,

358
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,640
so the kids are unattended.

359
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,130
This important task

360
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,260
is entrusted to  two of you

361
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,510
and I believe that you will do a good job.

362
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:43,880
Thank you.

363
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,110
Let's switch places.

364
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,240
Ms. Chen.

365
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,210
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

366
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,450
but I still

367
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,160
can't figure out

368
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,450
one thing.

369
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,510
Go ahead.

370
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,620
Why did you

371
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,440
have to assign

372
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,030
this mission to them

373
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,630
and insist that Su Chengcheng

374
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,600
go with him?

375
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,430
I think that you are kind of wasting

376
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,100
Xiao Yuhe's time.

377
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,370
In my opinion,

378
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,140
Xiao Yuhe's time for experiments

379
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,090
is quite precious.

380
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,670
Du,

381
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,920
have you ever heard of assists?

382
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,290
In soccer.

383
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,300
Volley ball.

384
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,070
Basketball?

385
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,220
Du, really?

386
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,510
H-how come you know nothing about

387
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,910
the modern pop cultures?

388
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,500
What's that?

389
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,920
You really know nothing?

390
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,900
See, Du.

391
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,900
When you have time,

392
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,020
you should talk more

393
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,990
with young people.

394
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,510
You can't

395
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,390
fall behind the times.

396
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,070
Yuhe,

397
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,630
thank you so much for today.

398
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,110
I've just been informed by Ms. Chen

399
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,520
that we'll be leaving for Shanghai on a business trip immediately.

400
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
The kids' father

401
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,830
has to work late today

402
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,990
and won't be back until after 10,

403
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,030
so I'll have to ask you

404
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,720
to take care of them for a little while.

405
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,340
Their father will come to pick them up as soon as he gets off work.

406
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,020
OK, senior.

407
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,270
Senior, don't worry.

408
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,800
It's fine.

409
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,550
You can count on us

410
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,440
to take good care of the kids.

411
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,160
That's great.

412
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,960
There are their cups,

413
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,100
snacks,

414
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,350
and some toys in here.

415
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,700
Got it.

416
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,150
I really have to go.

417
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,470
I'll leave Dali and Xiaoli in your hands.

418
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:45,860
OK.

419
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,410
OK, I'll go.

420
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,100
I have to pack my luggage.

421
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,710
Bye-bye.

422
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,900
Contact me if you have any questions.

423
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,510
-Alright?
-OK.

424
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,770
Good. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

425
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,720
The basic score is 10.

426
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,550
3 combos. 3 times 10.

427
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,020
The base is N.

428
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,340
The multiplier is M.

429
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,030
Hello?

430
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,230
The door won't open?

431
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,350
Please wait a minute.

432
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,050
I'll go downstairs and get it immediately.

433
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,530
Hello, your takeout.

434
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

435
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

436
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,660
Senior Xixi?

437
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,310
Gu Chen, why are you here?

438
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,480
I'm...

439
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,400
Take care on your way out.

440
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,550
You look so pretty.

441
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,860
Let's pick a hair clip.

442
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,310
Isn't the watermelon hair clip pretty?

443
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,230
Dali, how about we give your little sister

444
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,390
this watermelon hair clip?

445
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,900
It's ugly.

446
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,440
The watermelon hair clip is lame.

447
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,890
Mom always gives me

448
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,020
the strawberry hair clip.

449
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,080
Is it lame?

450
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,060
We don't have any strawberry hair clips,

451
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,370
so let's just use this watermelon one.

452
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,100
It's so pretty.

453
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,130
I don't want the watermelon.

454
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,290
I want the strawberry.

455
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,710
How about we pick another one?

456
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,980
What's so ugly about this one?

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,190
Isn't it pretty? Here.

458
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,800
I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it.

459
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,290
She doesn't want it.

460
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,950
The watermelon hair clip is beautiful.

461
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,730
It looks best on Brother Xiao Yuhe.

462
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,600
Ask him to try it on.

463
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,950
Right.

464
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,720
Why don't you try it on?

465
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,690
It's just for coaxing the kid.

466
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,010
See how pretty it is.

467
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,020
Do you want it?

468
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,110
If you don't,

469
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,920
I'll give it to him.

470
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,880
No, I want the watermelon hair clip.

471
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm the prettiest one wearing it.

472
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,430
You're the prettiest one wearing it.

473
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,430
Then hurry and give it back to us.

474
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,750
Here you are.

475
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,560
Give it back to us.

476
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,460
Let's wear it now

477
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,160
so no one can snatch it from us.

478
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,830
Boring.

479
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,780
Let me see.

480
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,500
You are the prettiest one wearing it.

481
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,050
You look so good.

482
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,220
A Rubik's Cube.

483
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,710
Let's wear another one on this side.

484
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,050
It's done.

485
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,570
Brother,

486
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,360
can you teach me?

487
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,260
Of course.

488
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,840
Wash your hands.

489
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,910
Wash your hands and make the gifts.

490
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,630
Have you made up your mind

491
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,440
on what to make for your mom?

492
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,610
Senior Yuhe,

493
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,300
the model we made before

494
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,410
has been reporting data errors.

495
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,810
Could you go there and take a look?

496
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,520
I need to go, call me if you need anything.

497
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,070
OK.

498
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,500
This hand is clean.

499
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,030
Both of the paws are clean.

500
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,830
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

501
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,800
Done. All clean.

502
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,940
Come with your big brother.

503
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,740
Dali.

504
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,970
Dali?

505
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,590
Ms. Chen is the only one

506
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,550
who knows the password of her office.

507
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,710
The problem is that she and our senior

508
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,970
have gone to a confidential meeting in Shanghai

509
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,370
and are on the plane right now,

510
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,130
so we can't reach her by phone.

511
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,770
I think it will be a few more hours

512
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,110
before we can get through to her.

513
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,220
It's so dark. I'm afraid of the dark.

514
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,720
Chengcheng, where are you going?

515
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,950
Dali, don't cry.

516
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,560
Dali, don't cry.

517
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,210
I'll find a way to get you out.

518
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,290
Come on, Dongmao, move a bit.

519
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,030
No.

520
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,950
It's too dangerous for a kid

521
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,390
to be alone in there.

522
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,210
I'll remove the door.

523
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,660
Let me see.

524
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,440
Wait, do you know the password?

525
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,600
I have a rough idea

526
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,960
of the pattern of Ms. Chen's password setting.

527
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,410
Well,

528
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,500
if you make three wrong entries,

529
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,590
it will automatically lock from the inside.

530
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,590
But we have to try, right?

531
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,710
Go ahead, go ahead.

532
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,980
It's so dark. I'm afraid of the dark.

533
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,110
Don't be afraid. Miss Chengcheng is coming.

534
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,150
It's unlocked.

535
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,190
Come here, Dali.

536
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,460
It's alright now.

537
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,370
The windows in this room are sealed.

538
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,400
There's none.

539
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,270
I just wanted to take this

540
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,930
as a gift for Mom.

541
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,790
It's fine. It's fine.

542
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,250
Chengcheng.

543
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,130
Don't look down. Don't look down.

544
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,790
Yuhe is coming.

545
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,940
No, no, no.

546
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,550
No, no, no.

547
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,430
Yuhe is coming to save you.

548
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,070
Yuhe is here.

549
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:57,930
Come here.

550
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,360
It's too high.

551
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,310
I haven't noticed it when coming.

552
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,280
Now I can't get across.

553
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,430
D-don't stand on the edge.

554
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,200
-It's too dangerous.
-Come over, I'll catch you.

555
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,110
Hey, Yuhe.

556
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,320
How about you two come down first and then hug?

557
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,960
Be careful. Be careful.

558
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,190
Come here, be slow.

559
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,590
Be slow. Be slow.

560
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,100
It's all my fault today.

561
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,970
I didn't keep an eye on Dali.

562
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,230
I let him stay by himself in that small dark room

563
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,210
for such a long time.

564
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,990
He must be scared.

565
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,630
Aren't you quick to step up

566
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,390
and protect them?

567
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,690
You have done well.

568
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,940
Let me make them a gift.

569
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,470
I'll give it to them when they wake up.

570
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,190
How did you know

571
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,130
I want to draw a flashlight?

572
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,090
How come you know how to make this?

573
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,990
I've read about it

574
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,580
in a magazine before.

575
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
What magazine?

576
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,050
Only a few people know how to make this.

577
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,150
It's been a long time.

578
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,850
I don't remember.

579
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,410
Could it be that someone has taught you how to do it?

580
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,900
Have we met before?

581
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,390
Haven't you said that

582
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,700
if you ever met me before,

583
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,880
you definitely would have recognized me?

584
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,420
I'm sure we never met before.

585
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,390
This toy

586
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,550
is called the Amazing Flashlight.

587
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,830
It's made by this mister.

588
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,900
See,

589
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,470
put in this flashlight,

590
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,040
and the light will come out.

591
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,820
I played with this too when I was little.

592
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,630
It's yours.

593
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,640
Quick.

594
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,470
-Dali, you take it.
-Hold it.

595
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,380
Then you'll not be afraid of the dark.

596
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,910
Thank you, miss.

597
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,940
Thank you for your effort today.

598
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,690
It's fine.

599
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,380
We like them a lot as well.

600
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,050
Mr. Xiao Yuhe.

601
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,620
This is for you and Miss Chengcheng.

602
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,510
Thanks.

603
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,760
Thank you.

604
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,510
Alright.

605
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
Say goodbye to the mister and miss.

606
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:49,890
Let's go home.

607
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:50,990
Bye-bye.

608
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,670
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

609
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,430
Bye-bye.

610
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,520
Thank you. Thank you. Let's go.

611
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,600
Senior, there's a cut on your hand.

612
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,280
If you say that later,

613
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,020
it will heal.

614
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,150
Thank you for voting me

615
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,060
today.

616
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,590
Don't mention it.

617
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,480
Why did you let me stay?

618
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,950
Haven't I said this

619
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,750
when voting?

620
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,480
You have strong emotional perception

621
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,600
and fair technical skills,

622
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,000
which will be useful in future work.

623
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,860
You complemented me.

624
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,140
Take this.

625
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,230
You have the most credit today.

626
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,950
Thank you for your effort.

627
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,400
Su Chengcheng. Su Chengcheng.

628
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,850
Zhu Panpan, is that you?

629
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,590
Zhu Panpan?

630
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,780
Yes, it's me.

631
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:37,969
Su Chengcheng,

632
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,070
why is your homeso dark?

633
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,070
Dad has suddenly fallen ill

634
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,880
and Mom is taking him to the hospital.

635
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,230
Now the power is out.

636
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,219
It's dark here. I'm scared.

637
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,230
How did you know

638
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,130
I want to draw a flashlight?

639
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,010
I've read about it

640
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,659
in a magazine before.

641
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,820
I was afraid of the dark

642
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,310
when I was a kid,

643
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,560
and he conjured up the Amazing Flashlight.

644
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,310
It lights up. It really does.

645
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,490
It's amazing.

646
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,170
It lit up my room,

647
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,150
and also my life.

648
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,930

690
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,470
Miss,

691
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,800
why didn't Zhu Panpan come to school today?

692
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,640
Zhu Panpan?

693
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,870
He has transferred to another school

694
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,980
to study elsewhere.

695
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,220
He has transferred to another school?

696
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,030
Why didn't he tell me

697
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,430
about such a big thing?

698
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,470
I ran to his house

699
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,340
and wanted to ask him.

700
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,230
But I found that

701
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,520
it was already empty.

702
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,670
Zhu Panpan. Zhu Panpan.

703
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,440
Zhu Panpan.

704
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,070
Zhu Panpan.

705
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,250
Zhu Panpan.

706
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,480
Zhu Panpan, are you still home?

707
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,300
Zhu Panpan.

708
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,390
Zhu Panpan.

709
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,980
Zhu Panpan.

710
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,230
Zhu Panpan, are you home?

711
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,980
Zhu Panpan.

712
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,530
Zhu Panpan, come out.

713
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,880
Zhu Panpan. Zhu Panpan.

714
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,970
Zhu Panpan. Get out.

715
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,250
Zhu Panpan. Hurry and get out.

716
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,840
Zhu Panpan.

717
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,490
Zhu Panpan.

718
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,040
Hurry up and get out.

719
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,800
Su Chengcheng. It's already late.

720
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,310
Let's go home.

721
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:48,950
No.

722
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,620
Zhu Panpan will definitely come back.

723
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,880
I'm going to show him

724
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,170
my sticks.

725
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,160
Su Chengcheng, don't cry.

726
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,370
Zhu Panpan left without telling you.

727
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,270
He didn't see you as his friend at all.

728
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,440
Maybe

729
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,860
he just had something

730
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,980
that took him away temporarily for a few days;

731
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,460
maybe

732
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,790
he was delayed by something

733
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,020
on the way back;

734
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,940
maybe...

735
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,160
Although he left without saying goodbye,

736
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,480
I didn't give up.

737
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,890
I kept writing emails to him,

738
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,910
expecting

739
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,580
to hear from him one day.

740
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,370
But after all these years have passed,

741
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,120
those emails all went unanswered.

742
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,250
I finally had to come to terms with that

743
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,300
all those years of missing

744
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,100
were just a one-man show for me.

745
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,380
Those fond memories of the past

746
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,650
had become evidence of my naivety.

747
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,070
So I decided to

748
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,820
delete them all.

749
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,910
It's as if forgetting Zhu Panpan

750
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,510
could erase myself

751
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,640
that was afraid of loneliness.

752
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,740
This is for you.

753
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,430
Take it and you'll also be

754
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,950
my best, best friend.

755
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,860
Zhu Panpan, is that you?

756
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,860
Yes, it's me.
