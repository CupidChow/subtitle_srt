In 1905, Japan forced Korea
to sign the Eulsa Treaty,

2
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:17,591
which abolished its diplomatic rights
and established a resident-general.

3
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:19,967
The treaty nominally turned Korea
into a protectorate,

4
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:25,944
but in fact it lost its sovereignty
and became a Japanese colony.

5
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,296
Some Koreans resisted,
unable to contain their fury,

6
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:33,343

or taking up armed struggle.

00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:30,236
When you arrive at Dalian Port,
go to the store on the second floor.

176
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:34,240
Tell the owner you came from Vladivostok,
and he'll give you a gun.

177
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:37,899
Did you write to your families?

178
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,840
When the operation's over,

179
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,986
go to the Daedong
Gazette office in Vladivostok.

180
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,990
Mr. Choi Jae Hyung will wait for you there.

181
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,977
I wish you luck.

182
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:21,036
They weren't dressed
like first-class passengers.

183
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,790
And I heard them speak Korean.

184
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,087
My hometown...

185
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:34,924
Must have been 20 years
since my mother died.

186
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:37,369
Oh my.

187
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,372
Then who'd you write to?

188
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,712
A secret wife and child?

189
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:49,459
I wish that were true.

190
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:56,446
To live with a pretty wife and a child...

191
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,073
Would fate allow it?

192
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:03,592
You can change your
luck, but not your fate.

193
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:08,686
I'm not meant to have a family.

194
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:10,355
Even so,

195
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:17,717
a man must find a good
partner and start a family.

196
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,499
Right.

197
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,712
Is that why you abandoned your family
to come here?

198
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:29,110
You got me there. I'm ashamed to admit it.

199
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,277
But what can I do?

200
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,683
This is our fate.

201
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:53,350
Are you Japanese?

202
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:54,351
Yes.

203
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,311
Your IDs?

204
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,674
Where'd you come from?

205
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,887
- From Fengtian.
- I'm asking him.

206
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:43,831
Answer me.

207
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,354
Where'd you come from?

208
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:49,893
We're together. We all came from Fengtian.

209
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:53,577
Oda Gonnosuke.

210
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,342
What is your destination?
Your age and profession?

211
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Come here.

212
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:43,614
This way! Quickly!

213
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,782
You go ahead.

214
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:47,033
Go!

215
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:48,785
Over here!

216
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,455
Clear the way!

217
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:59,421
They planned to assassinate
His Excellency Ito at Dalian Port.

218
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,324
- Koreans?
- Yes, they're all Koreans.

219
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:06,138
Ahn Jung Geun is said to be among them.

220
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,096
- Ahn Jung Geun?
- Yes, sir.

221
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,723
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:28,584
[Vladivostok, Russia]

223
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:27,259
Speak of the devil. Look who's here.

224
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,494
What are you doing here?

225
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,747
Have a seat, Comrade Ahn.

226
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:40,827
Must have been through hell.

227
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:42,788
I'm so sorry.

228
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:48,321
Have comrades Woo and Kim arrived?

229
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,783
Not yet. Haven't heard from them either.

230
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,856
I had to evade the Japanese soldiers.

231
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,842
Are you hurt?

232
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:27,418
I'm fine. What about Comrade Woo?

233
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,337
Haven't heard from him.

234
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:36,260
That's enough for the reunion,
let's plan our next move.

235
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:41,864
Ito will board in Lushun,
travel through Dalian and Fengtian,

236
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:45,921
and arrive in Changchun on the 25th.

237
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,723
And he will make another transfer here.

238
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,625
In Changchun?

239
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:53,026
Changchun is the last station.

240
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:55,301
From Lushun to Changchun
is the Japanese railway,

241
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:59,226
and the one from Changchun to Harbin
belongs to Russia.

242
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:05,274
Because the width of the railways is different,
a special train will be sent from Russia.

243
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,909
Then he'll arrive here
in Harbin on the 26th.

244
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,621
Yes, in a week.

245
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,873
Good.

246
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,246
We'll take him out in Harbin.

247
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,165
What are you doing?

248
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:25,339
As far as I'm aware,
Ahn is the leader of this operation.

249
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,923
Look, Comrade Kim.

250
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,165
Jung Geun has already
been exposed to the enemy.

251
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:36,743
You really think he is fit
to be leading this operation?

252
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:40,608
Lee has a point there.

253
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:44,279
Chang Sup should be
in charge of the operation now.

254
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:49,058
Ahn, what do you think?

255
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,725
I understand.

256
00:33:57,163 --> 00:34:01,667
Thank you for saying that.
My heart is more at ease.

257
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:06,900
Also, there's something
I'd like you to take care of.

258
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,428
Find us explosives.

259
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:18,264
You may be one hell of a shot,

260
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,627
but it'll be impossible to kill Ito
with just a gun.

261
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,088
Isn't that right?

262
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,032
Find us those explosives,

263
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,540
I'll finish Ito with my own hands.

264
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,181
[7 days before the operation]

265
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:38,327
[Lushun, China]

266
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,939
It is an honor to accompany you to Harbin.

267
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,334
I heard there was an incident.

268
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,671
My apologies.

269
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:51,049
One of the most capable officers
of the Kanto Provincial government

270
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,923
is investigating the matter.

271
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:56,791
Who is after me?

272
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,974
We are looking into it.

273
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:03,980
And we have heightened
our security just in case.

274
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:08,607
We've also canceled the greeting event
at Harbin Station.

275
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,734
It would be better if you
arrived unannounced.

276
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:16,724
No. We'll hold the event as planned.

277
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:17,725
Sir?

278
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:26,042
Opting out of these events
is exactly what these men want from me.

279
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:30,040
We will proceed as planned.

280
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,729
Yamada.

281
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,148
Yes, Your Excellency?

282
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,204
You know why I've always been skeptical
about annexing Korea?

283
00:35:42,812 --> 00:35:50,812
For centuries, the nation of Korea has been
ruled by foolish kings and corrupt scholars.

284
00:35:56,227 --> 00:36:02,023
But Korea's common people
are the most troublesome.

285
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,149
Even for a nation that's
given them nothing,

286
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,029
in times of national crisis,
they wield a strange power.

287
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,635
300 years ago,

288
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,267
Hideyoshi's invasion was stopped by men
who volunteered to fight for the nation.

289
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:30,775
The same is happening today in Manchuria.

290
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:41,077
We have poured so much money into Korea.

291
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:51,587
But the grassroots
are still hostile towards Japan.

292
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:58,239
I'm not sure what to do.

293
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:03,264
300 years ago, there
was Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

294
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,935
I'm not sure such a
hero lives today in Korea.

295
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,765
Thank you, ma'am. I
won't forget your kindness.

296
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,768
Follow me.

297
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,347
Let's stay here for now.

298
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:53,522
And keep this place a
secret from our comrades.

299
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:59,597
Vladivostok may be on Russian soil, but
the Japanese have eyes all over the place.

300
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,835
And don't be too let down
about Chang Sup being the leader.

301
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:13,209
You think Woo is okay?

302
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,628
Let's wait.

303
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,191
Wait just a bit longer.

304
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,055
How will you get the explosives?

305
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:33,397
I think we need the help of Ms. Gong.

306
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:35,636
Ms. Gong...

307
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:40,527
Yes, I heard she had connections
with Chinese warlords.

308
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,902
Might not be so hard after all.

309
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,491
Have you seen her recently?

310
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,952
Not since three years ago.

311
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:52,206
That's when she lost her husband.

312
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,835
You fought with him in Musan, correct?

313
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,713
She fought alongside us too.

314
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:04,803
If it weren't for her, even more
comrades would have lost their lives.

315
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:10,292
We should've at least secured his body.

316
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:28,660
I've heard news about
you from time to time.

317
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:32,497
You were in Yanchihe.

318
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,375
The wind's been taking me here and there.

319
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,868
I'm sure you're here for a reason.

320
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,247
I need enough explosives
to destroy a train car.

321
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:49,556
It's difficult to find that
much in Vladivostok.

322
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:52,680
I'll need a few days.

323
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:55,603
There's no time.

324
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:03,028
Then tomorrow, come
with me to Sangmok Village.

325
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:07,408
Comrade Park Jeom Chul is there.

326
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,438
Jeom Chul is here?

327
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,997
He's become a bandit now.

328
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,044
Our agents say it's a small
newspaper company in Vladivostok.

329
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,629
The newspaper was launched
by a Korean named Choi Jae Hyung,

330
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,424
but he is of Russian nationality,
so we must be cautious.

331
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,744
Vladivostok is ruled by Russia,
so to move on anti-Japanese forces,

332
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:31,540
we need the Russians' cooperation.

333
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:35,199
What is this newspaper called?

334
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,285
The Daedong Gazette.

335
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:41,507
When you land in Vladivostok,
cooperate with the Russian army.

336
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,718
Very well, sir.

337
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,703
I'm off the booze.

338
00:40:56,557 --> 00:41:00,920
You've given up alcohol?
Like a dog would give up eating shit.

339
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:07,175
When we finally get our independence,
I'll have a drink with you.

340
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,520
You think we'll survive that long?

341
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:30,526
If I go first,

342
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:37,498
pour a glass on my grave.

343
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,420
I doubt I'll live any longer.

344
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,257
Have a drink.

345
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,733
- Woo, you're alive.
- Ahn?

346
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,864
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

347
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,073
Just starving.

348
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,077
Let's get something to eat first.

349
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,422
Why do you still look
like you've seen a ghost?

350
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:29,717
Don't make this weird.

351
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,974
That hit the spot.

352
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:42,311
But what are you doing here, Lee?

353
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:46,191
Lee will be in charge of this operation
from this point on.

354
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:48,442
What?

355
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,665
I gotta say,

356
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:53,114
I don't know how I feel about that.

357
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,242
It's already decided.

358
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:58,120
But Comrade Ahn started this.

359
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:03,707
He should be the one to see it through.

360
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:07,821
I wouldn't be here if he could.

361
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:12,968
That's fine and all,
but where on earth have you been?

362
00:43:18,057 --> 00:43:20,308
Don't get me started.

363
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,187
I took the wrong train.

364
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,342
I meant to take the train to Vladivostok
at Caijiagou Station,

365
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:32,345
but I ended up on a train to Changchun.

366
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,723
So I ran a bit late.

367
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,825
Can't believe you survived.

368
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:41,642
What the...

369
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,417
What's that supposed to mean?

370
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:49,587
Woo, you must be tired.
You should get some rest.

371
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:52,337
Show him to his room, Kim.

372
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,007
All right.

373
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,165
Let's go, then.

374
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,282
Kim, let's have a drink before turning in.

375
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:06,147
Aren't you tired?

376
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:10,995
I'll need a drink to fall asleep.

377
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:20,200
Let's leave Woo out of this operation.

378
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,244
What do you mean?

379
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:25,723
Do you really think we can trust Woo?

380
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:29,669
You don't think he's become a spy, do you?

381
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,863
Don't you think the Japanese
could have caught him on the run?

382
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,410
Let's not jump to conclusions.

383
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,767
Listen, Chang Sup.

384
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:50,357
Don't go throwing around wild accusations
without a shred of evidence.

385
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,523
The same naivety led you
to free the enemy commander.

386
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:57,026
Listen, Jung Geun.

387
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:04,314
The independence
movement is not child's play.

388
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:05,648
Grow up.

389
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,960
What do you two think?

390
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,865
If Woo is out, I'm out too.

391
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,534
Ahn Jung Geun!

392
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:21,769
Don't let your feelings
interfere with the operation.

393
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:29,270
If you can't trust your comrades,
this operation will never succeed.

394
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:32,861
Kim.

395
00:45:36,184 --> 00:45:38,160
You think we'll get our independence?

396
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,453
If Japan writes history,
no one will remember us.

397
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:00,135
We gotta punch above our weight.

398
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,392
Even if I die, I want my name to live on.

399
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,206
You're an ambitious one, aren't you, Kim?

400
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,068
Are you not?

401
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:22,489
I don't give a crap about that.

402
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,620
When you're dead, you're dead.
Who cares if anyone remembers us?

403
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,542
Then why fight for independence?

404
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:37,427
When I was young,

405
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,593
all these nobles would
treat me like crap all the time,

406
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:48,350
and I'd always curse the nation,
wishing it'd all go to shit.

407
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,815
But I had no idea that it actually would.

408
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:05,109
Now I wish I'd watched my damn mouth.

409
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,453
Woo.

410
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:14,208
You don't really think
you cursed the country to shit, do you?

411
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,975
Thank you.

412
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,477
What for?

413
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,715
I wouldn't be here sitting with you

414
00:47:37,716 --> 00:47:40,969
if you didn't save my ass
in the Battle of Shinasan.

415
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,560
Would have done the same
for any of our comrades.

416
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,756
I'm still grateful.

417
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:08,180
If that's how you feel,
you can pay me back by saving my life.

418
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,728
I will.

419
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:16,855
You have my word.

420
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,610
I'll save your life one of these days.

00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,328
Any word about the men targeting me?

424
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:37,791
As I've said, sir, Lt. General Mori
is working hard on the investigation.

425
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,293
You haven't caught them?

426
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,130
I'm afraid not.

427
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:48,845
What fools.

428
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:56,477
In my three years here,

429
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:59,296
Korea has seen more development

430
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:03,760
than it ever would have in centuries
under Confucian rule.

431
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:11,702
And they dare attack me?

432
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:37,226
How have you been, Ms. Gong?

433
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,191
Long time no see, Comrade.

434
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:43,649
This is Comrade Kim Sang Hyun.

435
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,344
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Kim Sang Hyun.

436
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:49,277
I've heard a lot about you.

00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:32,193
We'll arrive by early evening tomorrow.

441
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:40,585
Is Jeom Chul really a bandit now?

442
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:47,334
He leads the largest
ring of bandits in Jilin.

443
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:59,261
He was fuming about the plot of land
the Japanese stole from him.

444
00:52:59,262 --> 00:53:01,402
How did he end up a bandit?

445
00:53:02,573 --> 00:53:07,519
I used to look up to the guy.

446
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,023
Long ago, all of this land used to be ours.

447
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,907
So much for that now. There's not
a patch of land we can rest easy on.

448
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:21,660
That's old news.

449
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,415
It's quite chilly, isn't it?

450
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,302
So good to see you.

451
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:32,062
Ito has come to Manchuria.

452
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:35,216
He's here to seal the
deal on the annexation.

453
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:39,497
We couldn't just sit and watch.

454

Speaking of...

455
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:44,992
We need some explosives.

456
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,744
Yes.

457
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:52,332
If you give us enough
to blow up a train car,

458
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,546
I think we can eliminate Ito.

459
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:58,548
Jeom Chul, it's for the independence
of our nation.

460
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,093
You and I...

461
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:07,707
fought alongside...

462
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:15,232

00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:20,528
How many more deaths will it take?

464
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:37,002
It's good to see old comrades.

465
00:55:37,003 --> 00:55:38,963
I feel like a real saint.

466
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,680
Very well.

467
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:53,227
Let's make a bet.

468
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:55,480
So...

469
00:55:56,773 --> 00:56:01,862
this is a game the
Russians call "roulette".

470
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:09,159
You put the gun to your head.

471
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,733
And you and the opponent...

472
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:16,792
take turns pulling the trigger.

473
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:22,047
If you survive roulette,
I'll give you the explosives.

474
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,367
- Jeom Chul...
- What do you think?

475
00:56:26,896 --> 00:56:29,387
Give it a go, Jung Geun.

476
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:30,388
Well?

477
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:34,559
How about you, Woo?

478
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,937
- Well?
- Calm down, Jeom Chul.

479
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:39,982
What about Mr. Meek over here?

480
00:56:45,392 --> 00:56:50,418
I thought you were freedom fighters.
Where are your balls?

00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,458
What a fat load of crap!

482
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:02,713
I'll be damned if you boys succeed.

483
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:09,178
Even my good eye is getting blurry.

00:57:11,058 --> 00:57:12,802
I guess it won't be long...

00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,588

this filthy world anymore.

- Park Jeom Chul, you bastard!

and my brother.

Please give us the explosives.

in Harbin in three days.

Security in Harbin will be airtight.

It'd be easier to strike in Changchun,
where Ito will transfer.

train for Harbin in an hour.

526
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,667
Let's go.

527
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:40,782
Shall we strike now?

528
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:44,537
Wait. I don't see Ahn Jung Geun yet.

529
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,693
- It's an ambush.
- Certainly.

530
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:52,922
I saw it too.

531
01:01:57,025 --> 01:02:00,469
We'll cover you. Take Ms. Gong with you.

532
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,470
Jung Geun.

533
01:02:08,102 --> 01:02:10,062
You started this operation.

534
01:02:21,048 --> 01:02:23,199
I'll strike first.

535
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,951
I'll hit them from the other side.

536
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:27,037
And I'll cover you from above.

537
01:02:27,038 --> 01:02:30,482
Ms. Gong will drive the carriage.
I'll cover you from behind.

538
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:31,650
Very well.

539
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:06,137
Lt. General, we caught one of them.

540
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:56,811
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

541
01:04:56,812 --> 01:05:00,774
Talk, and I'll spare your life.

542
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:02,384
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

543
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:05,555
If you tell us where he
is, we'll spare your life.

544
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:09,117
Morons.

545
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,230
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

546
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:36,410
Don't you remember me?

547
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:44,193
I wanted to kill you,
but Jung Geun spared your life.

548
01:05:46,237 --> 01:05:48,280
I should've killed you then.

549
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:55,955
I'll ask again.

550
01:05:58,082 --> 01:05:59,833
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

551
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:04,754
Ahn Jung Geun...

552
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:07,592
Ahn Jung Geun, Ahn Jung Geun.

553
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:13,805
You just can't stop talking
about Ahn Jung Geun.

554
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:17,142
I know.

555
01:06:18,602 --> 01:06:22,546
You don't give a crap
about Ito's assassination.

556
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:25,215
You just want to catch Ahn Jung Geun.

557
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:29,195
Figures.

558
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,155
You had to beg someone
beneath you for your life.

559
01:06:36,156 --> 01:06:38,325
No wonder you want to kill him.

560
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:44,165
But guess what?

561
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:51,760
Ahn Jung Geun is a thousand times more
virtuous than a piece of shit like you.

562
01:07:00,356 --> 01:07:02,359
So you knew.

563
01:07:10,362 --> 01:07:11,822
You moron.

564
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:37,765
What happened to the others?

565
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,309
They've all scattered.

566
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,851
I think we have a mole.

567
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:49,406
They waited for us to get the explosives
to attack. To catch all of us.

568
01:07:49,407 --> 01:07:50,616
Listen, Jung Geun.

569
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:56,325
Let's cancel this operation
and seek another opportunity.

570
01:07:57,802 --> 01:08:01,037
No, we can't stop now.

571
01:08:01,038 --> 01:08:03,689
With a mole in the midst,
there's no way we can succeed.

572
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,985
We must continue.

573
01:08:07,185 --> 01:08:09,629
Your comrades' lives rest on your decision!

574
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,256
There's no guarantee
Ito will ever return to Manchuria.

575
01:08:12,257 --> 01:08:14,659
You could get all of us killed!

576
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:18,080
We'll have gotten nothing done
if we don't see this through!

577
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:41,870
So many...

578
01:08:48,252 --> 01:08:51,338
So many of our comrades have died.

579
01:08:55,968 --> 01:08:59,722
I'm scared we'll lose even more.

580
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,854
Yes, so call this off.

581
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:09,855
Nobody...

582
01:09:10,923 --> 01:09:13,008
Nobody will point their finger at you.

583
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:24,288
But what about our dead comrades?

584
01:09:34,548 --> 01:09:35,925
Sir.

585
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:45,683
If we don't draw blood,
no one will remember them.

586
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:15,301
[2 days before the operation]

587
01:10:26,992 --> 01:10:29,186
I come from Vladivostok.

588
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:30,395
I'm Kim Seong Baek.

589
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:40,668
[Safe house, Harbin]

590
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,837
What happened to Ahn?

591
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:58,757
- I don't know.
- And the explosives?

592
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:17,274
Change of plans. We're going
to Caijiagou Station, not Harbin.

593
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:19,862
We'll take the train.

594
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:23,157
And Ahn?

595
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,783
Where is he?

596
01:11:27,118 --> 01:11:29,794
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

597
01:11:29,795 --> 01:11:31,791
Listen, Mori.

598
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:38,421
We don't have much to do here.
Harbin is under Russian jurisdiction.

599
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:40,422
And on the day Ito arrives,

600
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:43,426
the Russian Army will swarm
over Harbin Station like bees.

601
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:44,969
That's not enough.

602
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,931
Close every train station he passes
through, and bar any civilian entry.

603
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:53,269
Actually, Ito himself has issued orders
regarding that.

604
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:56,356
All scheduled events
will proceed as planned.

605
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:59,609
Consul, are you certain
those were his orders?

606
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,402
How many times must I say it?

607
01:12:01,403 --> 01:12:06,516
Besides, canceling His Excellency's plans
because of one Korean man?

608
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:09,395
That doesn't make much sense, does it?

609
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:15,959
You planted a mole?

610
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,960
Yes.

611
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:22,507
The Short Finger Alliance...

612
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,511
What was his name again?

613
01:12:27,512 --> 01:12:28,805
Ahn Jung Geun.

614
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:37,814
This isn't just about
catching Ahn Jung Geun.

615
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:40,899
I understand.

616
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,987
We'll be sure to
eliminate the entire group.

617
01:12:53,538 --> 01:12:54,707
They're here.

618
01:13:51,805 --> 01:13:53,057
Which carriage?

619
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,185
Number two.

620
01:14:00,538 --> 01:14:03,274
Ito arrives in Harbin tomorrow.

621
01:14:03,275 --> 01:14:05,902
To succeed, we must find the mole.

622
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:10,336
There will definitely be a meeting.
Did you tell them the location?

623
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:14,264
I told all three the operation
was to take place in Caijiagou.

624
01:14:17,873 --> 01:14:22,127
Let's wait and see which one the mole is.

625
01:17:53,797 --> 01:17:56,382
Are you sure it's at Caijiagou Station?

626
01:17:56,383 --> 01:17:57,383
Yes.

627
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:00,344
And Ahn Jung Geun?

628
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:03,473
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

629
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:24,242
Get him!

630
01:18:24,243 --> 01:18:26,242
Stop or we'll shoot!

631
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,494
Get him!

632
01:19:11,207 --> 01:19:12,750
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

633
01:19:14,168 --> 01:19:15,587
I don't know.

634
01:19:17,047 --> 01:19:20,592
We agreed to meet up in Vladivostok.

635
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,483
Save me.

636
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:40,778
Please.

637
01:19:41,947 --> 01:19:46,200
I'll do whatever you want.

638
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:06,681
Eat.

639
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,103
I said, eat.

640
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:30,995
Taste good?

641
01:20:37,168 --> 01:20:38,420
Then tell me.

642
01:20:41,965 --> 01:20:43,467
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

643
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:49,596
I really don't know. I did as I was told.

644
01:20:49,597 --> 01:20:53,443
It's not my fault you couldn't get him.

645
01:20:56,412 --> 01:20:59,022
Where in Harbin will you meet?

646
01:20:59,023 --> 01:21:02,567
We're to look for a Kim Seong Baek.

647
01:21:02,568 --> 01:21:03,568
Really?

648
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,280
Who is that?

649
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,269
The head of Harbin's Korean Association.

650
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,022
Will all of you meet there?

651
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:19,043
Go to Harbin.

652
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,698
It's not looking good for him.

653
01:21:32,782 --> 01:21:35,559
Will Ahn Jung Geun really go to Harbin?

654
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,337
He will never give up.

655
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:42,592
Go to Harbin and find
out what he's planning.

656
01:21:45,695 --> 01:21:46,947
I will.

657
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:01,089
Eat.

658
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,820
Hey, Kim.

659
01:23:10,863 --> 01:23:12,518
How much longer to Caijiagou?

660
01:23:15,868 --> 01:23:17,287
About an hour.

661
01:23:20,123 --> 01:23:21,708
Where did Ms. Gong go?

662
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:26,212
She got off at Wujia.

663
01:23:28,022 --> 01:23:30,218
She won't take part in this operation.

664
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:37,731
You know, her husband
fought alongside Ahn in Musan.

665
01:23:40,743 --> 01:23:44,229
They never even recovered his body.

666
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,607
After all that,

667
01:23:48,067 --> 01:23:50,403
we can't lose Ms. Gong too, can we?

668
01:24:25,772 --> 01:24:27,398
Did you find the mole?

669
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:31,443
Yes.

670
01:24:33,212 --> 01:24:34,654
Who is it?

671
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,742
Kim Sang Hyun.

672
01:24:40,328 --> 01:24:42,247
What will you do with him?

673
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:47,585
Comrade Woo will deal with him.

674
01:24:49,472 --> 01:24:53,254
[7 hours before the operation]

675
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,077
[Caijiagou station]

676
01:24:55,078 --> 01:24:56,245
Who are they?

677
01:24:58,822 --> 01:25:00,972
Railroad guards.

678
01:25:00,973 --> 01:25:03,667
Russian soldiers take
shifts guarding the place.

679
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,906
Where's Ahn?

680
01:25:05,907 --> 01:25:07,117
Follow me.

681
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:27,332
How did it go?

682
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:30,337
The operation will take place
in Caijiagou instead.

683
01:25:32,022 --> 01:25:33,506
Caijiagou?

684
01:25:33,507 --> 01:25:36,257
It's the transfer point
between the East and South railways.

685
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:41,096
His Excellency's carriage will have to stop
in the railyard for some time.

686
01:25:41,097 --> 01:25:42,639
And Ahn Jung Geun?

687
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,352
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

688
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:46,547
- Is that for certain?
- Yes.

689
01:25:48,563 --> 01:25:50,190
What took you so long?

690
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:57,196
The train was late.
Nothing I can do about it.

691
01:25:57,197 --> 01:25:58,490
Let's go.

692
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,615
Sit.

693
01:27:22,965 --> 01:27:25,492
The special train sent by Russia

694
01:27:25,493 --> 01:27:29,144
departed from Changchun yesterday
with Ito on board.

695
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:34,001
It will arrive here at 6 a.m.

696
01:27:34,002 --> 01:27:37,171
Are you sure the train will stop here?

697
01:27:37,172 --> 01:27:41,407
This is the transfer point
between the East and South railways.

698
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:44,120
So they'll have to stand by
in a double-track facility.

699
01:27:46,347 --> 01:27:48,088
How much time will we have?

700
01:27:59,818 --> 01:28:01,445
Fifteen minutes.

701
01:28:03,197 --> 01:28:07,243
It'll stop for 15 minutes
before it departs for Harbin.

702
01:28:11,334 --> 01:28:13,003
Where is Comrade Ahn?

703
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,246
He'll arrive soon.

704
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:36,354
It holds eight rounds.

705
01:28:36,355 --> 01:28:39,022
But you'll have to get very close.

706
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,405
That puts me within
ten steps of the target.

707
01:28:41,406 --> 01:28:43,076
So escape's not an option.

708
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:47,075
I know.

709
01:28:50,186 --> 01:28:53,454
Go with Kim Sang Hyun to Caijiagou.

710
01:28:53,455 --> 01:28:58,271
For this plan to succeed,
you must be caught by Mori in Caijiagou.

711
01:28:59,628 --> 01:29:01,584
So you'll use me as bait?

712
01:29:02,798 --> 01:29:03,974
Are you up for it?

713
01:29:10,307 --> 01:29:12,225
What about Kim Sang Hyun?

714
01:29:14,393 --> 01:29:15,978
What would you prefer?

715
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,360
Turncoats must be executed.

716
01:29:39,835 --> 01:29:41,795
Kim, why did you do it?

717
01:29:50,597 --> 01:29:53,098
Why would you become a mole?

718
01:30:18,415 --> 01:30:21,127
Is killing Ito going to
get us independence?

719
01:30:22,378 --> 01:30:26,507
If I talk to Mori, I can save you, Woo.

720
01:30:28,133 --> 01:30:30,135
We can get out of here alive, okay?

721
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:35,808
You want to betray our
comrades so we can live?

722
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:39,647
Would you rather we all die?

723
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:43,740
We'll all die like dogs
and nobody will remember us!

724
01:30:53,242 --> 01:30:54,243
Kim Sang Hyun.

725
01:31:00,165 --> 01:31:01,958
Did you forget that I saved you?

726
01:31:06,869 --> 01:31:10,386
You promised to save my life once.

727
01:31:12,137 --> 01:31:14,638
And now you're going to shoot me?

728
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:19,558
Do it.

729
01:31:21,562 --> 01:31:23,188
Do it, goddamn it.

730
01:31:24,398 --> 01:31:26,317
Shoot!

731
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:07,525
They're in the station.

732
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,078
I'm sorry.

733
01:32:22,248 --> 01:32:23,290
I just...

734
01:32:26,585 --> 01:32:28,212
wanted to live.

735
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:49,488
We live in place of our dead comrades.

736
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,863
Never forget that.

737
01:33:39,337 --> 01:33:41,047
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

738
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,842
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

739
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,142
Answer me!

740
01:34:06,077 --> 01:34:07,226
Answer me!

741
01:34:07,227 --> 01:34:08,227
Let go!

742
01:34:12,733 --> 01:34:13,733
Answer me!

743
01:34:19,323 --> 01:34:21,283
Where is Ahn Jung Geun?

744
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:34,005
Harbin.

745
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:40,097
[October 26, 1909, Harbin Station]

746
01:35:24,722 --> 01:35:26,845
When Ito arrives,

747
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:30,951
he'll meet the Russian Finance Minister,
Kokovtsov, on the train.

748
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:41,780
"Long live Korea." How
do you say that in Russian?

749
01:35:43,073 --> 01:35:45,033
Why do you want to know?

750
01:35:47,495 --> 01:35:51,832
Harbin is under Russian jurisdiction,
so I should say it in Russian.

751
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:58,963
"Korea Ura."

752
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:02,427
Korea Ura...

753
01:36:03,968 --> 01:36:05,888
Korea Ura.

754
01:36:08,157 --> 01:36:10,057
Will they understand?

755
01:36:10,058 --> 01:36:11,102
Yes.

756
01:36:11,977 --> 01:36:13,363
They'll understand you.

757
01:36:29,328 --> 01:36:30,872
I guess this is goodbye.

758
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:47,727
Our fallen comrades will help you
from the heavens.

759
01:36:49,432 --> 01:36:50,598
Thank you.

760
01:37:01,818 --> 01:37:04,780
Welcome to Russia, Prime Minister.

761
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:18,241
As I'm sure you're aware,
Harbin used to be Qing territory.

762
01:37:18,252 --> 01:37:24,575
Russia has only ruled
over it briefly. Am I wrong?

763
01:37:34,602 --> 01:37:38,438
And Korea? Whose territory is that?

764
01:37:45,284 --> 01:37:49,658
Whose territory do
you think it will become?

765
01:39:26,922 --> 01:39:27,922
Out of the way!

766
01:40:36,075 --> 01:40:38,367
Korea Ura!

767
01:40:38,368 --> 01:40:41,037
Korea Ura!

768
01:40:41,038 --> 01:40:43,564
Korea Ura!

769
01:40:43,565 --> 01:40:45,400
Korea Ura!

770
01:41:16,323 --> 01:41:17,639
How did it go?

771
01:41:20,535 --> 01:41:21,620
He succeeded.

772
01:41:24,707 --> 01:41:28,377
We must write an article
to let the world know.

773
01:41:32,338 --> 01:41:33,799
What should we open with?

774
01:41:42,975 --> 01:41:44,727
Here's how it'll go.

775
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:51,107
"On October 26, 1909, in Harbin,

776
01:41:51,108 --> 01:41:54,945
Lt. General Ahn Jung Geun
of the Korean Independence Army...

777
01:41:56,634 --> 01:42:01,125
fired a gun at Ito Hirobumi,

778
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:04,955
"exterminating him."

779
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:13,411
[March 26, 1910, Lushun Prison, China]

780
01:44:04,774 --> 01:44:06,484
Where have you been lately?

781
01:44:08,245 --> 01:44:10,496
Wandering here and there.

782
01:44:10,497 --> 01:44:13,458
Did you forget why I
let you go at Caijiagou?

783
01:44:16,378 --> 01:44:20,382
If it weren't for me,
you would have rotted in jail for life.

784
01:44:21,842 --> 01:44:23,093
Don't forget that.

785
01:44:24,218 --> 01:44:25,512
I'll always remember.

786
01:44:28,557 --> 01:44:31,602
And we have a new assignment for you.

787
01:44:35,813 --> 01:44:37,315
Do you know about Kim Ku?

788
01:44:39,618 --> 01:44:41,871
He's a big headache for us.

789
01:44:43,863 --> 01:44:45,365
Your mission...

790
01:44:50,252 --> 01:44:52,462
is to make contact with Kim Ku.

791
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:56,668
Take this.

792
01:45:00,838 --> 01:45:02,132
Take it.

793
01:45:10,598 --> 01:45:15,394
And Woo was released from prison.

794
01:45:15,395 --> 01:45:17,605
He swore to find and kill me.

795
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,527
Have you heard anything?

796
01:45:23,786 --> 01:45:27,415
He's coming to Harbin tomorrow
to meet Choi Jae Hyung.

797
01:45:29,242 --> 01:45:31,495
There's a safe house in Harbin.

798
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,415
What's the address?

799
01:46:27,425 --> 01:46:29,135
We'll let Kim Sang Hyun live.

800
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:35,516
Turncoats must be executed.

801
01:46:35,517 --> 01:46:36,602
Woo.

802
01:46:38,578 --> 01:46:41,397
Give him another chance.

803
01:46:41,398 --> 01:46:45,968
Right now, he's shaking in fear,
but I believe he'll overcome it.

804
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:44,164
The darkness will deepen,
and the wind will blow stronger.

805
01:47:46,045 --> 01:47:48,881
But we must keep the fire burning.

806
01:47:48,882 --> 01:47:51,007
People will gather.

807
01:47:51,008 --> 01:47:53,302
And when people gather,

808
01:47:53,303 --> 01:47:56,765
we will take the light
and walk through the darkness together.

809
01:47:58,808 --> 01:48:04,063
Whatever may confront us,
we will never back down.

810
01:48:05,373 --> 01:48:08,442
If we do not succeed this year,
we will try again the year after.

811
01:48:08,443 --> 01:48:12,610
Whether it takes one, two, ten,
or a hundred more years,

812
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:19,315
we will stop only
when Korea's independence is restored.

813
01:48:19,316 --> 01:48:25,998
By advancing, falling back,
proceeding quickly and then slowly,

814
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:30,797
preparing for tomorrow, the next day,
and all that lies before us,

815
01:48:30,798 --> 01:48:34,260
we will achieve our
goal one day for certain.

816
01:48:36,102 --> 01:48:39,764
We must keep going
until that day is upon us.

817
01:48:39,765 --> 01:48:44,145
Carrying the fire into the darkness.

818
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:57,036
After the death of Ito Hirobumi,

819
01:48:57,037 --> 01:49:02,115
the Japanese rule became
even more violent and oppressive.

820
01:49:02,116 --> 01:49:09,851
However, the Independence fighters
did not give up and fought to the end.

821
01:49:09,852 --> 01:49:15,469
36 years later,
Korea finally regained its independence.
