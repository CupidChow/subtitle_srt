1
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,866
Ayako, hurry up.

2
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:25,926
Stop!

3
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,387
I'm not a burglar.

4
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:29,429
Takako?

5
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:31,682
- Long time no see.
- Why...

6
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:21,857
"Tokorozawa Premium Outlet
New Year's Sale"

7
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,946
"Tokorozawa Outlet Mall

8
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,041
"Timeless Porn Stars"

9
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,044
Miho.

10
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,214
Let's discuss it some other time.

11
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,759
But Kenta...

12
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,345
Don't you want any children?

13
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,473
Sure I do.

14
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,144
We have separate bedrooms because
I come home so late from work.

15
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:04,775
I'm turning 35 next month.

16
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:09,446
I know that.

17
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,744
I'm happy living together
with you like this.

18
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:26,088
Isn't it hot?
I'll turn on the air conditioner.

19
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,429
When will it get cooler again?

20
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,724
Right?

21
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,270
Soon enough, I'm sure.

22
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:50,821
We didn't go anywhere this summer again.

23
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,366
We'll be discussing

24
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,076
the same thing here again

25
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:58,412
next year and the year after that.

26
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:02,165
Just the two of us.

27
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,543
Don't get upset.

28
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:17,723
Come here, Fluffy.

29
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,477
Come here, Fluffy.

30
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,739
Here, for you.

31
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,199
Are you married?

32
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,200
Why?

33
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:38,827
Because the girl...

34
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,746
What about her father?

35
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,289
It doesn't matter.

36
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,459
Of course it matters! Takako!

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,715
We broke up before she was born.

38
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,179
You were gone for 10 years.

39
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,472
What were you doing?

40
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,974
- Working.
- Doing what?

41
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:05,145
I'm going to bed.

42
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:17,449
Ayako, right?
Come here where it's warm.

43
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,662
Ayako.

44
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,165
Oh, it's so cold.
Your hands are freezing.

45
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,272
"From Nakamura"

46
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:32,232
"About your mom.
Don't dwell on it."

47
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,785
This is your mom when she was a baby.

48
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:51,335
She's about your age in this one.

49
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,924
Is he her dad?

50
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:02,220
No, it's someone
who used to help me out.

51
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,099
Where's her dad?

52
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:11,605
There is no dad in this family.

53
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:19,154
Same as me?

54
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,167
Oh, did you draw this?

55
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,294
You're such a good artist.

56
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,713
I'll buy you crayons tomorrow.

57
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:12,916
Do me... Do me from behind.

58
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:19,256
The shape of your finger...

59
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,758
It's weird.

60
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:27,472
This finger looks exactly like my dad's.

61
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,225
Really?

62
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:39,651
I'm the only ugly one among my siblings.

63
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,280
My mom is pretty, too.

64
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,199
Maybe you were conceived from an affair.

65
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,536
I just told you my finger
looks like my dad's.

66
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,873
Oh, then you must have been a mutation.

67
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:58,211
Men are...

68
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:03,759
tired of looking at pretty women
who all look the same.

69
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,722
Look at the camera.

70
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,182
No.

71
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:22,361
You can always quit
if you don't like it.

72
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:35,290
You're not happy with
your current life, are you?

73
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:53,558
I'll think about it.

74
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,353
Great! Call me, then.

75
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:02,609
You'll belong to everyone from now on.

76
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:41,648
Don't worry.

77
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,090
"Job Application:
Do you have a partner?"

78
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,610
Everyone feels uneasy at first.

79
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,529
"Do you like sex?
Do you masturbate?"

80
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:50,365
If I fill this out,

81
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:53,410
will I automatically
be registered as an actress?

82
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:58,290
People applying for this job
have various motives and reasons,

83
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:00,375
so it's natural to feel awkward.

84
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:04,046
Yes.

85
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,636
I'm coming!

86
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,400
Cut! OK!

87
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,902
Good work.

88
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:28,862
Thanks.

89
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,739
- Thanks.
- Good work.

90
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,867
- Hope it didn't hurt.
- No.

91
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,663
I'm fine.

92
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,831
I've got a steel vagina.

93
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,638
Ms. Hashiguchi.

94
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,639
Yes.

95
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,808
This way.

96
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:14,741
Please stand there
and take off your clothes.

97
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,387
There's another actress

98
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,597
who looks out from there

99
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,808
like you were doing.

100
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,163
The view from the roof is better

101
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,457
so she's often up there.

102
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,547
She's from Hokkaido,

103
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,679
and says the buildings look like
dead trees in the wetlands.

104
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,402
I can't give you any lasting reassurance

105
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,031
no matter what I say.

106
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,119
You must have a lot on your mind.

107
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,791
The best way is to go on set and

108
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,669
have everyone see your attractiveness.

109
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,237
I'm coming!

110
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,958
Cut! OK!

111
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,169
Was it all right?

112
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,337
Yes.

113
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:57,547
Thank you.

114
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,770
Someone's phone is ringing!

115
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,729
Is it yours?

116
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,148
Please make sure you turn it off.

117
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:16,984
You should hurry.

118
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,199
Hello?

119
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,867
Are you doing

120
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,078
something you can't tell me about?

121
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,290
Some kind of unspeakable job?

122
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,924
Someone told me.

123
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:46,471
Hello? Ayano?

124
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,764
Hello?

125
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:49,099
Are you listening?

126
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,350
Hello?

127
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:44,071
"The Lowlife"

128
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,365
Here.

129
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,034
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

130
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:35,956
Whoa, it's too strong.

131
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,543
Sure I have bad eyes.
I have a grown granddaughter.

132
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:44,131
She looks a lot like you
when you were younger.

133
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,633
Me? Not Takako?

134
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,928
Well, does it matter either way?

135
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,808
Welcome.

136
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,144
Takako.

137
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:58,603
Do you want something to eat?

138
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,022
No thanks.

139
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:04,401
Ayako. You've been drawing again?

140
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:05,986
Let go of me.

141
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,366
I'm so bored.

142
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,285
Mr. Aoki

143
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:15,579
been winning any bets?

144
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,039
Yeah.

145
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,542
- What?
- You look younger.

146
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,004
- What?
- I can't see clearly with these.

147
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,366
Hey!

148
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,326
Let me borrow it!

149
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,374
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,008
Sorry I'm late.

151
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,094
Thanks, Misa.

152
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,598
Hey, you look prettier.

153
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:27,526
Has he been like this?

154
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,320
The morphine kicked in

155
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,823
and he isn't responding to anything.

156
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,701
He doesn't respond
even if I talk to him.

157
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:43,291
Dad, it's Misa.

158
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,876
Dad.

159
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,678
Oh, look!

160
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,098
He knows that I'm here!

161
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:05,480
You shouldn't be using that here.

162
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:06,898
Sorry.

163
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,199
One of our actresses cancelled
because of illness.

164
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,911
What do you mean?

165
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,582
I know it's sudden
so feel free to say no, but...

166
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,043
the director saw your photo

167
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,086
and said he really liked you.

168
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,511
"Mom: 8 Voice Mail, 24 Missed Call"

169
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:31,233
He looks like an old man I don't know.

170
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,111
What a thing to say.

171
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,412
Remember when we were
playing in Dad's study

172
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,789
and found that DVD?

173
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:47,666
The porn DVD.

174
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,127
After Mom died

175
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:53,255
and we finally began to
get used to her not being around.

176
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,136
You think Dad masturbated
while watching it?

177
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,513
Don't say such things.

178
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:06,560
But he did his best to
cook all of our meals back then.

179
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,771
Spicy cod roe as a side dish every day.

180
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,440
Side dish?

181
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:14,609
Don't make me imagine Dad masturbating.

182
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:24,870
He had trouble
sewing those cushion covers

183
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:25,953
that we had to donate
for the school fundraisers,

184
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,123
and worked on them all night.

185
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,502
We'd all sit on the sofa together
and watch TV.

186
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,255
He let you do whatever you wanted

187
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,759
but I wore
that boring uniform for years.

188
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,512
He enrolled you in that private school

189
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,432
because it gave you an advantage

190
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,101
when applying to art schools.

191
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:51,146
Right, Dad?

192
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,158
You know

193
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,328
you've always been
oriented towards stability.

194
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,414
Your way of life, your clothes,

195
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,208
even the guys you went out with.

196
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:16,254
Unlike me, you've never
caused problems for Dad.

197
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,635
So all things considered,
everything about you is average.

198
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,555
You could have been perfect

199
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,391
if you'd made him a grandpa.

200
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm not saying it's wrong.

201
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:44,282
When all is said and done,
that's how we make parents happy.

202
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,746
Tomorrow...

203
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:54,251
I can't come tomorrow.

204
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,838
I have an appointment.

205
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,152
Excuse me.

206
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,113
This is your first time here, right?

207
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,823
Oh, yes.

208
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,580
Welcome. The usual?

209
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:33,874
I think I'll have a beer.

210
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,334
Sure.

211
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,297
Hey?

212
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,675
No way.

213
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,012
No way.

214
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:49,181
Oh man, my phone.

215
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,807
Did you lose it?

216
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:53,060
I was charging it and forgot about it.

217
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:54,770
Oh no...

218
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:56,521
Oh well.

219
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,441
Hey. Here.

220
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,859
Thanks.

221
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,406
Sorry.

222
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,241
I should close this.

223
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,953
My bag's wide open, too.

224
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,372
Drink more.

225
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:14,998
I don't know.

226
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,041
Thanks, thanks.

227
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,417
Hey, there's less.

228
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,418
Isn't this thin?

229
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,379
You must have diluted it.

230
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,965
Thanks for waiting.

231
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,760
Cheers! Cheers!

232
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,935
How many times have we done this?

233
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:41,525
Itaru Hibino?

234
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,610
Oh, I have my name cards!

235
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:50,033
I'm an editor at a magazine
specializing in the occult.

236
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:51,952
The occult?

237
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,537
No interest, huh?

238
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,873
Well, it's scary stuff, right?

239
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,917
It's not scary, but...

240
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,672
Oh no.

241
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:06,091
I feel like talking about this
whenever I get drunk.

242
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,676
About what?

243
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:12,514
My boss... the editor-in-chief.

244
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:15,392
She and I don't get along very well.

245
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:19,146
She's beautiful by anybody's standard.

246
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,024
And she does enjoy
advantages in the business

247
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,568
because of her looks, but...

248
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,987
- But?
- She's awful.

249
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,999
Where are you going?

250
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,959
To pee.

251
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,420
I see.

252
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,534
Ayako!

253
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,164
Ayako, are you up?

254
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:51,256
"Saturday morning"

255
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:54,718
- Morning.
- Morning.

256
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,637
Hurry or you'll be late.

257
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:09,441
Fluffy hasn't eaten anything
since yesterday.

258
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,567
It's only natural.

259
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,862
A 12-year-old cat is
64 years old in human years.

260
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,198
How do you know such things?

261
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,370
Let's eat.

262
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:29,670
You're done already?

263
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:31,463
Yeah. Thanks.

264
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:33,882
Don't forget your lunch.

265
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,452
I don't think she left for good.

266
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,829
Huh?

267
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,249
Yeah.

268
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,388
You're back!

269
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,640
Give me some water.

270
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:25,309
For pete's sake...

271
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,359
Ayako, your lunch.

272
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,862
- Here.
- Thanks.

273
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,408
See you.

274
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:43,577
- Have a nice day.
- See you.

275
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:05,974
Morning.

276
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,476
Morning.

277
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,694
Are you going somewhere?

278
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,489
What? I told you last night.

279
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:23,700
I'm staying overnight

280
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,661
at a hot spring in Mishima with Kazuko.

281
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,287
Mishima?

282
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:30,791
You mean in Shizuoka?

283
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,878
My sister's here and so is Norio, so...

284
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,630
I see.

285
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,259
I made some curry
for your dinner and breakfast.

286
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,761
OK.

287
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:51,019
See you, then.

288
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,945
You must be stressed
from caring for your dad,

289
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,405
Huh?

290
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:04,032
So enjoy yourself for a change.

291
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,372
Maybe I won't go after all.

292
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,959
Why? Go on.

293
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,586
See you.

294
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,124
Good morning.

295
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,001
Good morning.

296
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,843
Are you OK?

297
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,137
Just barely.

298
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,599
May I have some water?

299
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:01,024
Sorry, but I don't remember.

300
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:07,364
Did we do it?

301
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,328
Oh, well, I don't remember either.

302
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,955
- Oh, I see.
- Here.

303
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:16,206
Thank you.

304
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:21,294
I don't remember, but...

305
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:26,008
I'm wearing my pajamas
and took off my makeup.

306
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,015
These things happen to me a lot,
actually.

307
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:34,683
Just the other day

308
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:38,312
I got drunk and took a bath
with my clothes on,

309
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:40,605
then stripped down to my underwear

310
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:42,983
and fell asleep like that.

311
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,487
Oh, but nothing like this.
I mean,

312
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:51,700
waking up to a guy sleeping
next to me in the morning.

313
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,042
Oh, it's just that I hadn't I passed out

314
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,252
from being drunk like this in a while.

315
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,048
Because I usually drink by myself.

316
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:09,509
I do remember
I had a lot of fun last night.

317
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,304
I have a headache.

318
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,264
You OK?

319
00:36:19,436 --> 00:36:22,648
This reminds me of my place
back in university.

320
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:28,612
Built 30 years ago.
Rent's 50,000 yen. Paper-thin walls.

321
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,619
You think we kept it down?
Our voices.

322
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,000
No idea.

323
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:53,679
There she is in the photo.

324
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:57,432
I never knew she painted.

325
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,646
First time in 13 years.

326
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,022
Isn't that amazing?

327
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:04,982
Look. Look.

328
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,149
You're awesome!

329
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:07,359
Why didn't you tell us?

330
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:08,318
Congratulations!

331
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:09,736
You're amazing!

332
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,072
Huh? Did you see that?

333
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:13,740
Don't ignore us!

334
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:14,992
Honma?

335
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:17,077
She thinks she's so great.

336
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,787
We should hurry!

337
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:21,415
Who does she think she is?

338
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,339
"Congratulations to Ayako Honma"

339
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:31,633
"for winning an art award in France!"

340
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,685
Well, I'll go to my office now.

341
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,230
You're working on a Saturday?

342
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,524
I forgot my cell phone.

343
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,443
Oh, right.

344
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:00,954
Oh man, I'm sure I've got
so many missed calls and texts.

345
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,539
What a drag.

346
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:05,125
Bye.

347
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:07,878
Hey, wait a sec.

348
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,352
I have some shopping and stuff to do.

349
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:27,147
- Can I go with you?
- Sure.

350
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,849
This way.

351
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:06,937
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

352
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:12,359
Good morning. Here she is.

353
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,902
Nice to meet you.

354
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,237
Let's get to work.

355
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:16,863
Ms. Hashiguchi

356
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:19,199
I have to go somewhere else today.

357
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:23,203
I have to do this by myself?

358
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,455
Sorry.
I know it's your first time.

359
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:28,417
But we have three shoots scheduled today

360
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,711
and only a few managers.

361
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,463
I'll come pick you up tomorrow at noon.

362
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:39,136
If you have any problems,

363
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,762
don't hesitate to call.

364
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,142
You'll be fine.

365
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,227
I'll introduce you to everyone.

366
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,617
Good morning.

367
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,757
Why won't you answer my calls?

368
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,804
You have some explaining to do.

369
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,681
What's there to explain?

370
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:29,394
Tell me what's going on
so that I can understand.

371
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,397
You wouldn't understand anyway.

372
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:38,528
Do you think it's OK
to do such things behind my back?

373
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,530
No, I don't.

374
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:46,119
Even if you go by a different name.

375
00:40:46,453 --> 00:40:48,955
People can still recognize you.

376
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:52,626
It's not exactly a secret.
You show everything.

377
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:55,629
Your face, your naked body...
Obscene.

378
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:56,713
Stop it.

379
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:58,340
Sayaka, you saw?

380
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:01,301
I'm too embarrassed to go to university.

381
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,971
A friend, huh? Or your boyfriend?

382
00:41:04,096 --> 00:41:05,013
Who cares?

383
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:07,224
We came all the way from Kushiro

384
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:10,185
because we were worried about you!

385
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:13,230
All right. Be quiet.

386
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:18,860
The neighbors can hear
everything out here.

387
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,529
Come inside.

388
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:25,409
Come on.

389
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,934
Are you in debt?

390
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,394
No.

391
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,315
What about school?

392
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,066
Haven't been going.

393
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,988
Oh, I'll pay you back
my tuition and living expenses.

394
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:08,493
What will you do from now on?

395
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,287
Huh?

396
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:13,707
You've basically thrown your life away.

397
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:15,751
That's a bit dramatic.

398
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,970
Are you being deceived?

399
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:29,723
What?

400
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:35,854
Be honest with me
if you're being deceived.

401
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:39,274
I'll help you out.

402
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,949
OK?

403
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:53,914
Tell me!

404
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:16,937
Mom

405
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:19,940
you said we were going
to discuss this calmly.

406
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:30,617
I have to go to work.

407
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:31,743
Hey.

408
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:36,081
Quit.

409
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:44,756
Quit doing such work!

410
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:47,342
No.

411
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,472
You don't have to go.

412
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:56,685
I do.

413
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,402
Hey.

414
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,950
I don't mind you hitting me,

415
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:17,080
but my face is a tool of my livelihood.

416
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:26,965
Wake up.

417
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:32,763
You didn't come to Tokyo
to do such things, did you?

418
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:40,437
What do you want to be?

419
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:46,860
I've already become what I want to be
for the time being.

420
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:50,280
What?

421
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,539
I don't get you at all.

422
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,752
You've always been like this.

423
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:09,132
What were you thinking?

424
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:17,099
Of all my children, you were
the only one who rarely smiled.

425
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:26,441
I could never tell
what you were thinking at all.

426
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:48,672
I won't be back for a while.

427
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:55,721
Don't go.

428
00:45:55,929 --> 00:45:56,930
No.

429
00:45:57,014 --> 00:45:58,056
Don't go.

430
00:45:58,181 --> 00:45:59,308
No.

431
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:05,689
Please.
Take better care of yourself.

432
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:10,527
Please.

433
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:24,958
Hey, take a look at this.

434
00:46:40,724 --> 00:46:42,309
Honma?

435
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:46,688
The one in our class?

436
00:46:52,152 --> 00:46:53,779
Run an image search.

437
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:57,449
You really shouldn't do that.

438
00:46:57,658 --> 00:47:00,410
A porn star? This is awesome.

439
00:47:00,535 --> 00:47:02,079
This is awesome.

440
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:12,172
A porn star?

441
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:18,470
Honma, is your mother a...

442
00:47:18,553 --> 00:47:20,555
Stop it.

443
00:47:20,973 --> 00:47:23,976
"Honma's mother is a porn star."

444
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:29,606
Honma?

445
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:31,441
Honma?

446
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:33,777
Honma?

447
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:36,822
Honma?

448
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:39,825
Anemia?

449
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,285
Someone go get a teacher.

450
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,330
Honma?

451
00:47:47,082 --> 00:47:48,166
Hey.

452
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:52,254
Honma, are you all right?

453
00:48:45,098 --> 00:48:46,516
Are you OK?

454
00:48:47,517 --> 00:48:48,602
Yes.

455
00:48:51,063 --> 00:48:54,608
The nurse said you're anemic
and that it's nothing serious.

456
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,109
Shall I get her?

457
00:48:56,652 --> 00:48:58,111
I'm fine.

458
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:02,157
Honma.

459
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:08,413
I know this might not be the right time,

460
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:12,209
but you're the only one

461
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:14,628
who hasn't submitted
the counseling form.

462
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:18,882
Are you considering

463
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:21,093
a university of fine arts
or an art school?

464
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:23,345
I don't know.

465
00:49:24,388 --> 00:49:27,391
What does your mother think?

466
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:33,605
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

467
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:03,964
Excuse me.

468
00:52:04,047 --> 00:52:05,924
Ms. Hashiguchi, you're on.

469
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:24,067
She's here. Let's get started.

470
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:32,784
Over there.

471
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:37,789
We'll start from the bathing scene.

472
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:13,116
Mother.

473
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:50,964
Good work.

474
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,675
You too.

475
00:54:57,346 --> 00:54:59,514
This is your first time, isn't it?

476
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:01,767
You were amazing.

477
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:05,687
It didn't seem like that at all.

478
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:08,565
Really?

479
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:11,193
Did you get any sleep last night?

480
00:55:12,778 --> 00:55:14,529
Do I have bags under my eyes?

481
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:17,491
Oh, today's makeup artist
is really good at her job.

482
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:22,663
Just that I remembered
how I couldn't sleep at all

483
00:55:22,704 --> 00:55:25,999
before my first sex scene.

484
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,254
It wasn't such a big deal after all.

485
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:32,547
Hello.

486
00:55:32,673 --> 00:55:34,049
Hello.

487
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,888
You hear stuff like,

488
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,391
"You should only have sex
with someone you love."

489
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,436
But nobody is that pure

490
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,022
no matter how you try to gloss over it.

491
00:55:50,857 --> 00:55:52,609
This is work.

492
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:56,196
Work should be done
efficiently and enjoyably.

493
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:02,577
You're right.

494
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:05,539
I think you'll succeed

495
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,166
in this line of work.

496
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:11,378
I hope we work together again
in the future.

497
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:17,884
To tell you the truth,
you're really my type.

498
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:37,446
Honma, finally!
What took you so long?

499
00:56:37,487 --> 00:56:39,072
Honma.

500
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:43,952
Hey, Honma.
So you like to paint, huh?

501
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:47,497
Yeah.

502
00:56:48,415 --> 00:56:51,293
You do seem artsy.

503
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:52,794
Artsy?

504
00:56:52,878 --> 00:56:55,088
Isn't she?

505
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:58,800
Kind of moody and all.

506
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:00,385
Don't say that.

507
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:02,387
Who's your favorite artist?

508
00:57:03,388 --> 00:57:05,390
Zdzislaw Beksinski.

509
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:11,313
Huh? That was long.
Who did you say?

510
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,482
Who is that? Say it again.

511
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,776
Zdzislaw Beksinski.

512
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:18,528
Never heard of that.

513
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:20,989
Oh, is that true?

514
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:23,325
About that text that's going around.

515
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,453
Haven't you seen it?

516
00:57:26,828 --> 00:57:28,622
Have you seen it?

517
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,624
- I haven't seen it.
- Really?

518
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:33,835
It said something about
how Honma's father

519
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:36,630
is a porn star.

520
00:57:36,755 --> 00:57:37,798
A porn star?

521
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:40,717
Yeah. And her mom gave birth

522
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,386
and couldn't act in blue movies anymore

523
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:44,429
so she ran out of money and came home.

524
00:57:44,554 --> 00:57:47,891
Gross, huh?

525
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:49,935
Let's go.

526
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,771
That's sick, I can't believe it.

527
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:48,118
You OK?

528
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,129
You're laughing at me, aren't you?

529
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:03,717
Sending me weird texts

530
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:05,886
and acting like a stalker.

531
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:07,638
Tell me!

532
00:59:07,846 --> 00:59:09,473
That's what this is about,

533
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:11,099
right?

534
00:59:16,897 --> 00:59:18,398
Hey,

535
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:21,610
I'm sorry.

536
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,676
Happy now?

537
00:59:47,552 --> 00:59:49,262
Go to hell!

538
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:13,537
She's here.

539
01:00:13,662 --> 01:00:15,247
Hello.

540
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,707
Hi.

541
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:19,543
So we meet again.

542
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:22,045
This must be fate.

543
01:00:22,212 --> 01:00:25,007
Yeah. Nice to see you.

544
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,385
I'm counting on your steel vagina again.

545
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,348
We're starting so get ready.

546
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,599
Yes.

547
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:15,390
Ow!

548
01:01:15,557 --> 01:01:18,060
It's OK. Relax.

549
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,739
What are you doing?

550
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,452
I thought you were leaving again.

551
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,580
I was about to

552
01:04:25,747 --> 01:04:28,917
but I used up all my money on pachinko
so I can't go anymore.

553
01:04:32,254 --> 01:04:33,755
Give me a ride.

554
01:04:36,633 --> 01:04:38,885
I wish I could go somewhere.

555
01:05:18,216 --> 01:05:20,594
There you are, Ms. Hashiguchi.

556
01:05:23,388 --> 01:05:25,390
We're starting again.

557
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,436
Sorry. I wanted to get some fresh air.

558
01:05:32,648 --> 01:05:34,066
Let's go.

559
01:06:03,595 --> 01:06:07,057
Aren't you ever going to work again?

560
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,560
What's the point of working part-time

561
01:06:10,894 --> 01:06:12,896
at a supermarket or something?

562
01:06:19,695 --> 01:06:21,989
Your grandma is still able to work.

563
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:26,868
Being dependent isn't bad.

564
01:06:38,797 --> 01:06:40,716
Mom.

565
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:46,346
Were you a porn star?

566
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,145
You knew?

567
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:00,736
Until right before you were born.

568
01:07:01,236 --> 01:07:03,030
I used to do stuff like that.

569
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:11,163
Do you hate me even more now?

570
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:15,500
Is it true that my dad
was a male porn star?

571
01:07:17,669 --> 01:07:19,963
Who says such things?

572
01:07:21,423 --> 01:07:23,550
That you got pregnant from a shoot and

573
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:26,386
came home because you ran out of money.

574
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:37,105
You're lucky, Ayako.

575
01:07:38,106 --> 01:07:42,402
You're a good artist.
Receiving awards, even.

576
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,742
I didn't have anything.

577
01:08:07,469 --> 01:08:09,596
I'm starving.

578
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:14,726
Let's go to Mom's place and ask her

579
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:17,187
to make us something good to eat.

580
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,484
Come on, hurry.

581
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:45,882
Turn around.

582
01:09:46,568 --> 01:09:48,779
Is Mr. Goto's family here?

583
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,949
- Misa!
- Please come to his room.

584
01:11:02,853 --> 01:11:04,313
We're turning.

585
01:11:07,149 --> 01:11:09,067
Coming through.

586
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:23,749
Is mine bigger than Dad's?

587
01:11:26,293 --> 01:11:28,295
Is it better than Dad's?

588
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,737
I'm coming.

589
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:22,724
Good work.

590
01:12:24,726 --> 01:12:26,228
Sorry.

591
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:59,177
"Saturday night"

592
01:13:10,856 --> 01:13:12,566
- See you.
- Yeah.

593
01:13:14,192 --> 01:13:18,530
Hey, she reminds me of Takako
when she was in high school.

594
01:13:19,823 --> 01:13:22,034
Pretty hot.

595
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:25,704
Oh, sorry. See you.

596
01:13:26,163 --> 01:13:28,582
Thanks for coming.

597
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:32,919
Ayako, you should button up your shirt.

598
01:13:33,003 --> 01:13:35,339
I'm hot. I rode my bicycle.

599
01:13:35,422 --> 01:13:37,924
A clean look is important
in this business.

600
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,843
You know that.

601
01:13:46,224 --> 01:13:49,269
What's wrong? Why are you
silent all of a sudden?

602
01:13:56,902 --> 01:14:00,364
Grandma, are you...

603
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:02,783
What?

604
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:05,702
Are you jealous of me?

605
01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:10,456
Because I'm the daughter of your

606
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:13,126
young, pretty, trashy daughter.

607
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,337
What are you saying?

608
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:21,969
I know, Grandma.

609
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:25,180
You're really jealous of Mom because you

610
01:14:25,263 --> 01:14:29,434
gave up being a woman but she didn't.

611
01:14:30,018 --> 01:14:32,562
You think you should have neglected that

612
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:35,357
no-good daughter to live your own life.

613
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,537
I don't regret a thing.

614
01:14:48,954 --> 01:14:53,208
I was really happy, giving birth
to her and raising her.

615
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:56,461
It's true that before I had a child,

616
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,089
there were times that I wondered

617
01:14:59,214 --> 01:15:01,717
what was so great about living.

618
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,763
I used to be like you

619
01:15:06,972 --> 01:15:09,099
when I was around your age.

620
01:15:09,558 --> 01:15:12,227
Thinking that I was
the only unhappy person.

621
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:14,604
Always miserable.

622
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:51,516
Feeling like I couldn't break loose
from a nebulous place.

623
01:16:11,328 --> 01:16:12,871
But...

624
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:16,625
I realized after
giving birth to a child.

625
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:41,900
No matter how much I think about
the meaning of life

626
01:16:42,317 --> 01:16:44,778
I'll never discover it.

627
01:16:54,663 --> 01:16:57,165
I just live one day at a time,

628
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:03,296
and grow older as my child grows up.

629
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:11,471
That's all there is to it.

630
01:17:24,776 --> 01:17:27,029
When she came back from Tokyo

631
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:30,532
I thought, "How can she be so selfish?"

632
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,454
But I understood when I learned
that you were five.

633
01:17:38,457 --> 01:17:40,667
She wanted to put you in a school here

634
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:43,754
and raise you properly.

635
01:17:47,966 --> 01:17:50,177
"You'll understand when you grow up."

636
01:17:50,302 --> 01:17:53,013
"You have to be a parent to understand."

637
01:17:53,513 --> 01:17:57,059
That's all you and Mom ever say.

638
01:17:59,227 --> 01:18:00,687
Ayako.

639
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,385
Hello?

640
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:35,222
Yes, I heard.

641
01:18:36,765 --> 01:18:38,350
Are you all right?

642
01:18:41,144 --> 01:18:43,814
They said they have enough footage,

643
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:46,316
so please don't worry about it.

644
01:18:49,695 --> 01:18:51,697
I'm very sorry for your loss.

645
01:18:55,242 --> 01:18:57,828
Please call me again
when you feel better.

646
01:18:59,913 --> 01:19:01,289
Yes.

647
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:08,338
Did someone die?

648
01:19:12,009 --> 01:19:14,469
You should take better care of yourself.

649
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:18,557
Go in for a checkup sometime.

650
01:19:19,683 --> 01:19:24,396
It's just exhaustion and anemia.

651
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:26,815
That's serious enough.

652
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,653
You should never let yourself collapse

653
01:19:32,112 --> 01:19:34,406
on the set as an actress.

654
01:19:36,366 --> 01:19:41,496
There really isn't anything
we shouldn't let ourselves do,

655
01:19:42,914 --> 01:19:44,708
is there?

656
01:20:02,517 --> 01:20:04,686
We're very sorry for your loss.

657
01:20:05,187 --> 01:20:06,605
Miho.

658
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:40,889
Miho.

659
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:43,976
Are you OK?

660
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:07,040
Dad helped us out.

661
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:10,043
He specified everything
from who to invite to his funeral

662
01:21:10,085 --> 01:21:11,878
to the gifts.

663
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,047
It was like him to do that.

664
01:21:14,131 --> 01:21:16,133
We have to go buy mourning clothes.

665
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:19,136
Want to wear Dad's?

666
01:21:19,303 --> 01:21:20,804
You're about the same size.

667
01:21:20,887 --> 01:21:22,222
Really?

668
01:21:58,133 --> 01:21:59,801
He looks serene.

669
01:22:06,725 --> 01:22:08,060
Miho.

670
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:11,688
You be the chief mourner.

671
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:16,902
You were with him
a lot longer than I was.

672
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,239
I think he'd be happier that way.

673
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,287
You can handle it.

674
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:32,125
I'd probably mess up the final speech.

675
01:22:33,627 --> 01:22:35,671
No, you wouldn't.

676
01:22:51,979 --> 01:22:53,397
Miho.

677
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,817
I...

678
01:23:02,406 --> 01:23:03,907
Miho.

679
01:23:08,412 --> 01:23:10,372
I think I'm pregnant.

680
01:23:11,123 --> 01:23:12,499
Huh?

681
01:23:14,209 --> 01:23:15,585
A baby?

682
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:22,926
I'm happy for you.

683
01:23:25,929 --> 01:23:27,514
Congratulations.

684
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:29,474
You see,

685
01:23:31,435 --> 01:23:36,773
I found out I was pregnant
on the day Dad fell into a coma.

686
01:23:38,984 --> 01:23:41,194
Maybe his spirit left his body

687
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,156
and entered my womb.

688
01:23:45,949 --> 01:23:47,409
I see.

689
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:54,041
But I can't.

690
01:23:58,628 --> 01:24:00,213
What's wrong?

691
01:24:01,048 --> 01:24:02,382
I'm...

692
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:06,303
seeing someone else.

693
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:10,474
This could be Dad reincarnated.

694
01:24:10,515 --> 01:24:11,433
He'd be so sad in heaven

695
01:24:11,475 --> 01:24:13,393
if I got an abortion.

696
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:16,938
What the hell?

697
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:24,071
Sorry, you're right to be mad
at me at a time like this.

698
01:24:26,156 --> 01:24:28,408
Why am I always like this?

699
01:24:30,077 --> 01:24:33,455
I wish I could be proper like you.

700
01:24:34,581 --> 01:24:36,667
I'm not proper.

701
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,919
Yes, you are. Too proper.

702
01:24:39,628 --> 01:24:41,421
No, I'm not!

703
01:24:47,678 --> 01:24:49,137
Kenta.

704
01:24:50,055 --> 01:24:52,391
Let's go get our mourning clothes.

705
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:56,395
What, now?

706
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:58,647
Yes, now.

707
01:25:03,276 --> 01:25:04,820
See you later.

708
01:25:24,089 --> 01:25:25,590
Men and women...

709
01:25:25,757 --> 01:25:28,427
At the first sight?

710
01:25:32,556 --> 01:25:33,640
Do you know that notion

711
01:25:33,682 --> 01:25:35,892
about being reborn as a human?

712
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:37,519
You know how you meet

713
01:25:37,728 --> 01:25:39,563
different kinds of people in life?

714
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:41,356
People with character,

715
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,859
people who can get on in the world...

716
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:46,778
Or people who call kill without qualms.

717
01:25:47,195 --> 01:25:48,739
That's determined by how many times

718
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,533
they were reborn as human beings.

719
01:25:55,245 --> 01:25:59,916
So some weren't human beings
in their previous life?

720
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,251
Yeah.

721
01:26:01,626 --> 01:26:04,379
Leaves and bugs,

722
01:26:05,047 --> 01:26:09,259
even minerals.
Some might have been cats.

723
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:11,678
- I'll take this.
- I'll put it on your check.

724
01:26:11,762 --> 01:26:12,804
Yeah.

725
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:15,307
So for some, it might be

726
01:26:15,349 --> 01:26:16,349
their first time being human.

727
01:26:16,558 --> 01:26:19,603
And then if they reincarnate
as human again,

728
01:26:19,645 --> 01:26:20,937
that's twice.

729
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:23,023
How many times you've experienced

730
01:26:23,565 --> 01:26:26,068
being human

731
01:26:26,109 --> 01:26:28,195
determines your character.

732
01:26:29,154 --> 01:26:31,823
Interesting when you
think about it that way.

733
01:26:35,369 --> 01:26:39,206
Mr. Hibino. If that's the case,

734
01:26:40,499 --> 01:26:43,001
it might be my first time being human.

735
01:26:56,974 --> 01:26:58,809
I'll go take a shower.

736
01:26:59,017 --> 01:27:01,353
We might not have
any free time for a while.

737
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,898
Kenta.

738
01:27:17,202 --> 01:27:19,246
Make love to me.

739
01:27:20,288 --> 01:27:21,665
What?

740
01:27:27,462 --> 01:27:30,090
Whoa, hey.

741
01:27:31,466 --> 01:27:33,260
What's wrong?

742
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:36,221
I'm not who I was until yesterday.

743
01:27:37,389 --> 01:27:38,890
I can tell.

744
01:27:39,057 --> 01:27:41,393
You can? How?

745
01:27:42,185 --> 01:27:46,273
I mean you must be shaken
about your father's death.

746
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:51,653
The look on your face

747
01:27:51,695 --> 01:27:53,238
when you arrived wasn't normal.

748
01:27:53,322 --> 01:27:54,990
I could see that.

749
01:27:56,283 --> 01:27:58,076
Tomorrow's the wake.

750
01:27:58,493 --> 01:28:00,245
That's why.

751
01:28:00,912 --> 01:28:02,914
You get a day off work,

752
01:28:03,457 --> 01:28:05,375
and I have no housework.

753
01:28:06,251 --> 01:28:08,545
Stop it. This isn't like you.

754
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:10,547
What am I like, then?

755
01:28:10,756 --> 01:28:14,718
Tell me! What am I?

756
01:28:31,193 --> 01:28:32,903
It's your smell.

757
01:28:34,571 --> 01:28:36,990
That's why I wanted to take a shower.

758
01:29:49,271 --> 01:29:51,106
What's wrong?

759
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:56,945
I have a different fetish now.

760
01:29:59,323 --> 01:30:01,491
Masturbate for me.

761
01:30:06,538 --> 01:30:08,498
It really turns me on.

762
01:30:10,417 --> 01:30:12,002
Will you do it for me?

763
01:33:11,098 --> 01:33:16,144
I was having sex with
another man in Mishima.

764
01:33:21,525 --> 01:33:24,444
That's why I couldn't be
with Dad when he died.

765
01:33:30,993 --> 01:33:33,203
I was shooting porn.

766
01:33:35,038 --> 01:33:38,417
What are you saying?
I don't get it.

767
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:41,461
I was in a porn movie!

768
01:33:43,422 --> 01:33:45,924
I got naked in front of a camera

769
01:33:46,425 --> 01:33:49,177
and had sex with a guy I just met!

770
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,241
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK!

771
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:16,038
Do you think I'm OK?

772
01:34:32,888 --> 01:34:34,264
Sorry.

773
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:44,608
You're not mad at me?

774
01:34:44,691 --> 01:34:46,568
I can't be mad at you.

775
01:34:50,405 --> 01:34:51,948
My mind is too full

776
01:34:52,699 --> 01:34:54,534
and I don't know what to think.

777
01:34:57,663 --> 01:35:00,040
Why aren't you mad at me?

778
01:35:02,459 --> 01:35:06,296
Hey, why aren't you mad at me?

779
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,002
Thanks.

780
01:35:46,962 --> 01:35:48,672
I'll go home today.

781
01:35:50,549 --> 01:35:53,677
Yeah. See you, then.

782
01:35:54,928 --> 01:35:57,472
Hey!

783
01:36:00,809 --> 01:36:04,646
Um...

784
01:36:06,064 --> 01:36:09,151
Well, I wanted to say
something meaningful, but...

785
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:14,573
See you again.

786
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:16,908
See you again.

787
01:37:09,753 --> 01:37:12,172
"Ayano, Take care of yourself."

788
01:37:12,214 --> 01:37:14,591
"Come home if it gets too hard."

789
01:37:14,633 --> 01:37:16,009
"Mother"

790
01:37:38,323 --> 01:37:39,825
Hello?

791
01:37:39,992 --> 01:37:42,327
Sayaka, where are you?

792
01:37:42,661 --> 01:37:44,454
Let me talk to Mom.

793
01:37:45,706 --> 01:37:47,082
She's not here.

794
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:49,126
What?

795
01:37:50,335 --> 01:37:53,922
I took a plane.
I'm back in Kushiro already.

796
01:37:55,173 --> 01:37:59,011
Mom said she's dropping
by Aunt Masae's in Aomori.

797
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,513
Taking an overnight bus.

798
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:55,651
Mom!

799
01:39:01,823 --> 01:39:03,325
Here.

800
01:39:15,003 --> 01:39:17,422
"Come home if it gets too hard"?

801
01:39:21,051 --> 01:39:23,470
Writing down whatever you feel like.

802
01:39:31,019 --> 01:39:34,147
Of course I can never go home again!

803
01:39:38,944 --> 01:39:41,655
That's what I do for a living!

804
01:39:46,785 --> 01:39:48,245
That's...

805
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:51,790
my...

806
01:39:55,377 --> 01:39:57,337
That's my job.

807
01:40:29,786 --> 01:40:31,580
You're freezing.

808
01:41:29,054 --> 01:41:30,847
I'm sorry.

809
01:42:10,095 --> 01:42:11,888
Let's go now.

810
01:42:23,066 --> 01:42:25,027
Let's talk things over

811
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:28,322
after things have settled down.

812
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:43,081
"Sunday morning"

813
01:44:52,841 --> 01:44:54,009
Coming!

814
01:44:59,848 --> 01:45:01,975
I'm sorry to bother you so early.

815
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,312
I'm Takako Honma's daughter.

816
01:45:07,981 --> 01:45:09,399
Miho!

817
01:45:10,651 --> 01:45:12,527
Miho, come here!

818
01:45:23,789 --> 01:45:26,166
She's Takako Honma's daughter.

819
01:45:27,626 --> 01:45:29,628
My name is Ayako Honma.

820
01:45:30,879 --> 01:45:33,256
I came on behalf of my mother.

821
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:39,763
Thank you.

822
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:44,434
Please come in.

823
01:45:45,852 --> 01:45:47,562
Excuse me.

824
01:46:06,331 --> 01:46:07,708
Who is she?

825
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,668
Never mind.

826
01:46:10,335 --> 01:46:12,295
Help me sort through Dad's things.

827
01:46:12,421 --> 01:46:14,548
I have to put something in his coffin.

828
01:46:14,923 --> 01:46:17,259
Kenta, lend us a hand.

829
01:46:17,426 --> 01:46:18,677
Yes.

830
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,397
Please offer an incense stick.

831
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:34,109
Oh, yes.

832
01:47:14,775 --> 01:47:16,526
Just once,

833
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:28,288
he introduced me to your mother.

834
01:47:30,749 --> 01:47:32,209
I see.

835
01:47:34,795 --> 01:47:37,881
You weren't born yet.

836
01:47:42,928 --> 01:47:46,932
You were still in your mother's womb.

837
01:48:04,408 --> 01:48:08,328
Please look at his face.

838
01:48:34,938 --> 01:48:39,192
Don't hold a grudge against him.

839
01:48:46,408 --> 01:48:48,201
My mother is...

840
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:53,123
a difficult person, so...

841
01:48:58,503 --> 01:49:02,215
That's probably why
it didn't work out between them.

842
01:49:04,968 --> 01:49:06,803
That's not the reason.

843
01:49:07,888 --> 01:49:10,182
He had to think about us, too.

844
01:49:15,228 --> 01:49:17,064
She used to appear

845
01:49:21,318 --> 01:49:23,153
in porn movies.

846
01:49:33,163 --> 01:49:34,873
She even said that

847
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:39,795
she had no interest in
someone who wasn't alive anymore

848
01:49:42,297 --> 01:49:44,508
so she wouldn't come.

849
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:09,533
That's the kind of person my mother is.

850
01:50:20,585 --> 01:50:22,170
Do you...

851
01:50:24,297 --> 01:50:25,841
draw pictures?

852
01:50:37,561 --> 01:50:39,354
Come with me.

853
01:51:09,134 --> 01:51:11,053
Father used to paint, too.

854
01:51:14,473 --> 01:51:16,475
Back when he was young.

855
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,414
He used to say he regretted

856
01:51:39,748 --> 01:51:42,376
not being able to paint like that.

857
01:51:46,129 --> 01:51:48,840
He said this was one of his better ones.

858
01:51:55,555 --> 01:51:57,766
He loved this artist.

859
01:52:11,113 --> 01:52:13,407
He would show me these two books,

860
01:52:14,783 --> 01:52:18,036
sitting side by side on that sofa.

861
01:52:24,001 --> 01:52:26,962
He'd wanted to become an artist

862
01:52:28,005 --> 01:52:30,090
but couldn't,

863
01:52:38,515 --> 01:52:41,184
so he told me to go to art school.

864
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:49,484
I couldn't live up to his expectations.

865
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,654
I'm sorry.

866
01:53:02,622 --> 01:53:05,167
I love this painting, too.

867
01:53:12,049 --> 01:53:13,467
I don't know

868
01:53:14,343 --> 01:53:16,928
why my mother used to
appear in porn movies.

869
01:53:17,054 --> 01:53:18,180
I don't know what to think about

870
01:53:18,221 --> 01:53:20,932
that man being my father, but...

871
01:53:24,686 --> 01:53:26,146
But...

872
01:53:30,317 --> 01:53:32,778
I do love this painting.

873
01:53:33,945 --> 01:53:36,740
I know that for certain!

874
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:52,876
There was a fountain pen
he said was a gift from Mom

875
01:55:52,918 --> 01:55:55,879
that was important to him.

876
01:56:03,887 --> 01:56:05,597
Look for it.

877
01:56:05,681 --> 01:56:07,057
Right.

878
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:11,520
Kenta, move.

879
01:56:11,603 --> 01:56:13,563
Never mind, I'll look for it.

880
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,203
I already checked there.

881
01:56:31,373 --> 01:56:33,709
- You're so useless.
- It wasn't over here.

882
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:48,432
I'm a bit tired.

883
01:56:54,604 --> 01:56:56,940
I feel like stretching out my legs.

884
02:00:31,571 --> 02:00:33,156
Mr. Hibino.

885
02:00:35,742 --> 02:00:39,162
Mr. Hibino, I...
