1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,030

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,010
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,960
♫  Where the light goes between  ♫

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Whoa! It's so pretty! The winter sea!

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,110
Eonni, look there!

6
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,070
It's so pretty.

7
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,020
It's really pretty.

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,930
Let's take pictures together and eat something delicious too.

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,190
Okay.

10
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,670
Great. It was my wish to have a double date.

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,210
Double date, what the...

12
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,690
 Why am I here?

13
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,390
Jeong Si Ho! Let's talk.

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,440
Let's talk later. I'm a little bit busy now.

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,540
Are you really going to keep avoiding me?

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,940
Why? What is it?

17
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,150
Hyeong. Hello.

18
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,420
You're Si Ho, right?

19
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,480
I've heard a lot about you from Hui Su.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,940
Hui Su, did you ask him?

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,400
Ah, well...

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,380
I was about to ask him. But it seems Si Ho won't be able to go.

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,590
He says he's busy.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,800
Really?

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,640
What a shame.

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,320
I heard you've been best friends since high school.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,380
I wanted to be close with you too.

28
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,600
Se Jin's parents run a pension.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,920
There are no customers in winter. They told us to come and have fun.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,340
I guess we'll have to go by ourselves this time.

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll make sure you won't be bored.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,970
Since you're busy it can't be helped.

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Hey, wait!

35
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,950
I should've just ignored them...

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,530
Are you taking a picture? Take mine too.

37
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,360
Okay.

38
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm done taking them. That's enough.

39
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,860
Yes.

40
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,880
But what's going on?

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,430
You said you weren't coming, but you even ended up bringing a camera.

42
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,410
I'm glad you're here.

43
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,420
A present.

44
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,900
Thanks.

45
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,700
It's cold.

46
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,080
It would have been better if we had come here in summer.

47
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,610
I like the winter sea.

48
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,290
When there's a summer sea, there are lots of happy people, so

49
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,060
I feel a little jealous.

50
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,410
At the winter beach, the are many people who look lonely, so

51
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,440
I feel comforted.

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,290
Nuna. I'm kind of upset.

53
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,410
Does that mean you're not happy now?

54
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,600
It's not like that.

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's go to the sea in summer next year.

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,950
Next year?

57
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,730
By that time... it'll be 200 days, right?

58
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,510
Yeah. You're right.

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,900
 How long will you be able to love me?

60
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,400
So nice! The scent of sea.

61
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,390
Right, Si Ho?

62
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,590
Promise me this is the last time.

63
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,420
What?

64
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,940
The notebook.

65
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,370
Promise me you'll never use it again. It's not for you.

66
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,510
It's because I'm really worried. Please.

67
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,520
- Si Ho— 
 You dating random people and being hurt by those random people...

68
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,520
I don't want to see that.

69
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,170
We're best friends.

70
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,620
You can listen to this request from a close friend, right?

71
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,910
Alright. Don't worry.

72
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll make sure this is the last time.

73
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
Wait a second.

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,090
What?

75
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,410
Done.

76
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,930
When did you grow up so much, Jeong Si Ho?

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,480
What are you saying when you are short?

78
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm not short! I'm average height.

79
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,620
Ta-da!

80
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,880
What are you guys doing?

81
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
What do you think it is? When you come to a beach!

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,600
You got to light fireworks!

83
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,500
♫  Slowly it's seeping through me, like the feelings   ♫

84
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
♫  Hold still. Don't let it show, they'll never know  ♫

85
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,650
♫  Is this a dream of a dream?  ♫

86
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,690
♫  I'll let it come.  I'll let it out.  ♫

87
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,960
♫  One at a time  ♫

88
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,500
♫  The light is rushing in my veins like never before  ♫

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,530
♫  I see it clear. I feel it real. It's working   ♫

90
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,150
♫  The words are flowing out. I can't make it stop  ♫

91
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,910
What were you talking about with Hyeong Si Ho before?

92
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,620
Oh, we didn't say anything special.

93
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,320
So are those two going to start dating?

94
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,220
Who?

95
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,760
What do you mean by who? Of course, I'm talking about Se Jin and Si Ho.

96
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,530
I don't know. I didn't hear anything about it.

97
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,280
Did you hear something about it?

98
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,230
I'm sure that Se Jin likes him.

99
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,000
I thought he wouldn't come, actually.

100
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,940
Honestly, I wanted to be just two of us.

101
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,790
What?

102
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,070
Did you not feel that way?

103
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,400
Hold on.

104
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm sorry. But we are outside, and our friends are all around here.

105
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,650
No, it's okay.

106
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,600
I think I was rushing too much.

107
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,960
Aren't you hungry?

108
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,510
Shall we go eat now?

109
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,820
Yes, let's do that.

110
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,440
It's coming!

111
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Welcome to my place!

112
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,700
It looks delicious!

113
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,890
Let's do a toast!

114
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,420
Cheers!

115
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,720
Thank you, Se Jin!

116
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
Thank you for the food!

117
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,470
- There's no time... 
 - to eat food!

118
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,260
Aren't you drinking too much?

119
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,550
Oppa, are you not good at drinking? You should've told me first!

120
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,010
Si Ho's not good with drinking. You better drink that in multiple sips, kiddo.

121
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,780
What? Were you not good at drinking?

122
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,190
That's not true!

123
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm good at drinking!

124
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,170
I'm a total heavy drinker.

125
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,150
Hyeong, don't overdrink.

126
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,400
Mind your own business.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,310
Cheers!

128
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,170
Cheers!

129
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,550
If you don't play, you lose! Rock, paper, scissors!

130
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,440
What is this?

131
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,350
Bottoms up!

132
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,630
Really?

133
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,750
I mean, what is this?

134
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,980
Nuna, I'm going to the bathroom.

135
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,870
Okay, be careful.

136
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,650
I can't hold it anymore either.

137
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,080
You are on a different level.

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,240
You are such a great drinker.

139
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,200
That's not true. I'm a bit tipsy as well.

140
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,420
Eonni, do you like Jun Yeong?

141
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,020
What?

142
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,430
Of course.

143
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,730
Why aren't you dating Oppa Si Ho?

144
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,580
Hey, what are you talking about it out of the blue?

145
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,600
I bet you get this question often.

146
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,930
I was also just wondering.

147
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,500
You are dating all the other guys except Oppa Si Ho, so I wondered if you had a reason.

148
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,210
Hey, Si Ho and I are just friends.

149
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,670
It's beyond friends. It's more like comrades.

150
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,570
Comrades?

151
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,450
Then, he's more than a friend to you.

152
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,380
I just mean that we aren't in a romantic relationship.

153
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,240
But he's a very important person to me.

154
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,750
Also, he's a very good person that you can't even compare to me.

155
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,530
He's someone you are not dating but an important person to you.

156
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,150
Yes.

157
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,360
Then...

158
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,420
It's okay for me to date Oppa Si Ho, right?

159
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,300
Hey, why are you asking me about that?

160
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,420
I wanted to make sure.

161
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,390
What's the point for you to ask me? You have to talk about it with Si Ho.

162
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,560
I will.

163
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,060
I'm going to confess my feelings to him this time.

164
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,560
What?

165
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,980
It's okay with you, isn't it?

166
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,320
Of course, it's fine.

167
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,670
Thank you, Eonni.

168
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,030
It's late. Let's go inside as well.

169
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,680
Oh, that's right.

170
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,940
We had so much fun. Thank you for having us!

171
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,790
Come again next time.

172
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,170
Mom and Dad!

173
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,890
My daughter.

174
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,080
I'll come again soon to see you.

175
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,190
That oppa is the guy I have feelings for.

176
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,580
  Restroom

177
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,960
 Where do you think you are going?

178
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,990
 So what, you bastard?

179
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,810
 Look at this s**t!

180
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,920
 S**t. Do you have your f**king eyes behind you?

181
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
  You f**king bastard!

182
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
  F**k!

183
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,590
  Do you like it, you son of a b**ch?!

184
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,710
  F**k.

185
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,070
  Do you like it, you son of a b**ch?!

186
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,230
  You f**king piece of s**t.

187
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,240
But why is Oppa Si Ho taking so long?

188
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,320
That's true. Didn't he leave almost 30 minutes ago?

189
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,250
Right.

190
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,910
I said, let's go together!

191
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,940
There are so many kids. Do you think they came for a school trip this winter?

192
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,090
Guys, I'll go to the restroom real quick.

193
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,640
Where did he go?

194
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,280
Jeong Si Ho?

195
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,620
Jeong Si Ho.

196
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,350
It's okay.

197
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,510
It's safe here.

198
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,900
Seo Hui Su?

199
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,550
I'm Se Jin.

200
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,360
Are you okay, Oppa Si Ho?

201
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,990
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

202
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,990
It's a temporary thing.

203
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,440
Let's go. I'm okay.

204
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,320
You surprised me!

205
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,970
Are you sure you are okay?

206
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,410
Yes.

207
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,290
Thank you. Thanks to you, I've calmed down a bit.

208
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,940
- Let's go. 
 - I like you.

209
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,820
Now I know it clearly.

210
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,450
When I thought you were going to faint, my heart dropped.

211
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,440
Let's go. Others will be waiting for us.

212
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,800
Is it because of Hui Su?

213
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,660
What?

214
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,150
You are just watching her and not even telling her how you feel.

215
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,730
Like an idiot.

216
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,840
I don't expect much. Just give me a chance.

217
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,520
Let me go into the ring, at least.

218
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
I'll throw the punch.

219
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
Se Jin, I—

220
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,090
No more, no less, let's just date for one month.

221
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,880
How does that sound?

222
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,700
Nuna.

223
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,220
Nuna, what's going on?

224
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,390
Nuna, why don't you come to my place later?

225
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,490
I really want to be alone with you.

226
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,860
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,350
Why is Park Se Jin not coming now?

228
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:49,960

229
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,620
  The reason why I can't confess my feelings to you.

230
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,910
  It's because unrequited love can last forever.

231
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,560
♫   Before I knew it   ♫

232
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,880
♫   you became more than a friend   ♫

233
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,590
♫   My feelings which grew silently   ♫

234
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,820
♫  won't diminish. Oh   ♫

235
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,020
Si Ho.

236
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,580
It's okay. 
 ♫   Even if I approach   ♫

237
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,520
Calm down, Si Ho.

238
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,190
Let's breathe in and out slowly. 
 ♫  just one step closer  ♫

239
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,560
It's okay. 
♫   as if you're moving farther away   ♫

240
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,520
It's safe here.

241
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,860
♫  So always just in the same place   ♫

242
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,950
♫  I'm hovering around  ♫

243
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,090
♫   The words I've swallowed and swallowed as much as I could  ♫

244
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,420
  But can unrequited love really last forever?   
♫  While I look at you smiling today too  ♫

245
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,170
  Can it be?   
 ♫  I suppress my feelings  ♫

246
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,540
♫  I suppress my feelings  ♫

247
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,380
♫   Countless times to you   ♫

248
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,020
♫  I've made confessions you couldn't hear  ♫

249
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,980
  Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

250
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,200
  I like the winter ocean. It's because I feel a bit jealous of the summer ocean since it has so many happy people.

251
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,380
  At the winter beach there are many lonely-looking people, so it comforts me.

252
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,100
  How much can you love me more?

253
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,340
  I can't watch you dating anybody

254
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,260
  and getting hurt by  someone.

255
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,520
  We are best friends. You can listen to this request from a best friend, right?

256
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,290
  I don't expect much. Just give me a chance.

257
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,210
  Let me go into the ring, at least. I'll throw the punch.

258
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,610
  The reason why I can't confess my feelings to you. It's because unrequited love can last forever.

259
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:41,030
♫   The person who receives your love  Oh  ♫
