1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,990

2
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,390
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,520
This is Jeong Si Ho, the new student who transferred today.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,700
Please introduce yourself.

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,540
Hello, I'm Jeong Si Ho.

6
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,960
What, is that all?

7
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,060
Hold up your head and greet them.

8
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,510
So boring!

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,760
 Even then

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 you were also looking elsewhere.

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,900
Where did you come from? Are you a good student?

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,880
Why isn't he talking?

13
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,630
Hey, class is starting.

14
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,260
Go to your seats.

15
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,670
 But her senses were quick.

16
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,630
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

17
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,520
Hey.

18
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,050
Do you want to eat this?

19
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,990
Is it social anxiety disorder?

20
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,200
I saw you earlier in the hallway.

21
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,650
Come here when you're having a hard time.

22
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,810
I come here at times to hide.

23
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,050
This place is safe.

24
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,710
No one comes here.

25
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,190
Here.

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,820
Surprisingly, it was comforting.

27
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,710
Wake up.

28
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,850
 Maybe I went through all those hard times to meet you.

29
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,110
 That's what I thought.

30
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,280
 - But then...  
 - What are the two of you? Are you guys dating?

31
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,810
Are you crazy? Why would I date him?

32
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,670
Left home? What? Go back quickly.

33
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,460
Jeong Si Ho, I want to die.

34
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,660
What?

35
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,240
No one pays attention to a thing like me anyway.

36
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,880
I don't want to go home. I can't be at home.

37
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,530
I think if I'm at home, I'll die.

38
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,750
Hey.

39
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,250
Are you not dating?

40
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,550
No.

41
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,340
Why?

42
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,560
If you date, you need to break up.

43
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,510
- So I'm leaving. 
 - Bye!

44
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,700
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

45
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,950
Let go.

46
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,460
How did you get here?

47
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,390
- What? 
 - How did you get here?

48
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,950
Did you peek at my door lock code?

49
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,850
You're the one who told me. Do you not remember?

50
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,090
And is that important right now?

51
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm sorry, or I misunderstood. You should say things like that first.

52
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,270
What misunderstanding. You're so tiring.

53
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,120
- You're not a stalker. 
 - What are you saying?

54
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Stop following me around.

55
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,120
Why do you keep following me?

56
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,460
Am I not your girlfriend?

57
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,680
Is that something you should say?

58
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,150
I don't understand. Why are you angry at me?

59
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,890
You're the one who needs to apologize.

60
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,990
If you really don't like it, we can just break up.

61
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,480
Fuck. I can't believe I dated someone like you.

62
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,100
Just my luck.

63
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
What?

64
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,910
Your wife and also you,

65
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,580
ever since she was born,

66
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,130
only unlucky things have happened.

67
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,130
Hui Su.

68
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,870
if she hadn't been born.

69
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,620
 Of course it was a dream.

70
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,100
 Of course, it was too good to be true.

71
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,010
 Kim Kang Wuk.

72
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,550
 Private Profile

73
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,490
Is this it?

74
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,360
He's too much.

75
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,480
Seonbae Kang Wuk?

76
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,510
It's embarrassing, can't you just go?

77
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,450
I brought fried chicken. You should eat.

78
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm not hungry.

79
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,540
It's so cold here.

80
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,600
Should I just go home? Come on, open the door.

81
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,020
But how did you know?

82
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,490
That I got dumped. Have rumors started going around already?

83
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,450
You made it obvious that you broke up.

84
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,760
Do you want to get revenge on that jerk?

85
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,210
- How? 
 - What do you mean, how?

86
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,550
You just do it.

87
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,530
Should I do it for you?

88
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,450
It's fine.

89
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,430
I'll just go back to my normal daily life.

90
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,360
Dating didn't suit me.

91
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,240
That's why I had a thought.

92
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,770
About what?

93
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,110
Why don't you start writing lyrics again?

94
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,620
You didn't do it for a while because you were dating.

95
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,840
You said that when you're writing lyrics, you're just happy and don't think about anything.

96
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
That's true.

97
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,880
In high school, you were so depressed,

98
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,700
but do you know how much you changed after you came to university and started writing lyrics?

99
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,270
- Really? 
 - That's how you were!

100
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,230
So keep doing it.

101
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,460
What you like and are good at.

102
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,630
Hey, I'm not good! Everyone can do what I can do.

103
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,690
If you keep doing it,  at some point you will become good at it.

104
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,730
And, to be honest,

105
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,140
breaking up could be a good motivator, too.

106
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,950
You didn't forget the lyric writing notebook, did you?

107
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,800
Lyric writing notebook?

108
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,750
I definitely threw it in the trash can, though.

109
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,070
What are you doing instead of eating?

110
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,870
Oh, nothing. Let's eat.

111
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,550
Oh, okay.

112
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,880
That's right. There's Ha Rim's song, too.

113
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,050
One love leads to another.

114
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,780
 I don't know the rain.

115
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,650
 And of course, the rain didn't know me.

116
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,270
 It's time.

117
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,390
  After multiple trial and errors, I learned the rules of the notebook. 
   .

118
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,530
Hello, do you happen to have a boyfriend?

119
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,290
No.

120
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,010
 Notebook Rule #1

121
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,320
 Think about the person you want to date and write in the notebook.

122
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,490
Could I have your number?

123
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,810
 That's money, money, money.

124
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,730
 Notebook Rule #2

125
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,610
 Only wishes about dating come true.

126
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,550
 Dreams about suddenly becoming rich or getting hired don't come true.

127
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,100
 Notebook Rule #3

128
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,090
 Only realistic relationships are possible.

129
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,190
 If a wish is impossible with my current status, it won't come true no matter how much I write.

130
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,160
 Notebook Rule #4

131
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,980
 Relationships that are maintained only by the notebook only last a month.

132
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,200
Let's break up.

133
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,470
 - After that, each was different, but they all ended up the same way. 
 - At all?

134
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,480
Do you really not like me at all anymore?

135
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,250
It's only been a month.

136
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,310
Yeah.

137
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm really sorry, but I don't know why I liked you.

138
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,380
Sorry.

139
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,380
No, I'm sorry.

140
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,030
 But, the most important thing...

141
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,850
There aren't many pages left.

142
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
In that case...

143
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,160
What's this? Why doesn't it write?

144
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:23,490
 You will receive much love.  
 ♫  Open your heart, it cannot hurt.  ♫

145
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,750
 As much love as you want.  
  ♫  Warm tales of love, rushing through me.   ♫

146
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:40,000
 But as soon as you lose the last page, you will never be able to love again.  
 ♫   Let it all in, don't forget it.  ♫

147
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,690
 The final rule of the notebook.

148
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:52,370
 As soon as I use the last page, I might become someone who cannot love or date.  
 ♫   Give me a sign, I will abide.   ♫

149
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,770
 Hey! What are you doing lately?

150
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,240
 Are you crazy? Seriously.  Seo Hui Su, you...

151
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,270
Are you okay?

152
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
The sky must be falling.

153
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,120
Why are you sighing like that?

154
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,420
Is there something wrong?

155
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,380
Would you like to grab a beer after we finish?

156
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,020
No.

157
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,530
Why? Eonni Hui Su is busy so you have no one to hang out with.

158
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm tired.

159
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,420
But isn't it really amazing?

160
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,540
Eonni Hui Su is cute, but her becoming that popular...

161
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,920
What's her secret?

162
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,390
Why are you asking me that?

163
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,660
Ask Seo Hui Su yourself.

164
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,580
No, well, you two are close, so.

165
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,150
It's been months since I saw her.

166
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm not interested in her, so you can stop being interested too.

167
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,220
 Seo Hui Su

168
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,680
You came?

169
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,390
I did, but what a waste of time is this.

170
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,320
Because you don't believe me.

171
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,100
Would you believe someone like you?

172
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,670
You didn't talk to me for weeks and then you suddenly called me.

173
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,820
- I'll show you. 
 - You say that to me and expect me to believe you?

174
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,390
Exactly, so watch.

175
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,680
Him, what's his name?

176
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,110
Not him. He's about to get married so rumors wouldn't be good.

177
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,350
And what crime did they commit to be chosen?

178
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,980
They end up dating you even though they don't want to.

179
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,500
Whose side are you on? Are you not on my side?

180
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,260
That's not...

181
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,550
In any case, it's only for a month.

182
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,080
And it's not like I'm not losing anything either.

183
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,860
What do you lose?

184
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,930
Him over there? I've seen him a lot somewhere.

185
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,290
Let's just not do this.

186
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,700
What about him?

187
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,770
- Him who? 
 - Leaning over there.

188
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,460
That's right, there's him too.

189
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,820
His name is Park Jun Yeong, and people say that he's the most handsome freshman. Don't you know him?

190
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Would I have an interest in men?

191
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,080
One second. Okay.

192
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm not saying I really believe you, but

193
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,120
will you be okay?

194
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,150
Let's say that this is real.

195
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,840
Can you date someone you have no feelings for?

196
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,810
You don't like him, you know.

197
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
No.

198
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,810
This is how I overcome my breakup.

199
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,990
Are you kidding? I'm a fool for believing you for a second.

200
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,010
Jeong Si Ho.

201
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,180
Look at this.

202
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,820
  It's not so bad...

203
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,590
 A couple with an age gap isn't a bad thing, right?

204
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,370
 A couple with an age gap isn't a bad thing, right?

205
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,440
 We had only occasionally bumped into each other as seonbae (senior) and hoobae (junior).

206
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,030
 Instead of waiting for a coincidence that will pass

207
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,390
 I want a lasting connection.

208
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,980
 I'll give you three days.

209
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,480
 The library where we often bumped into one another.

210
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,080
 Come to me. Confess.

211
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,790
 In a trembling voice, tell me that

212
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,610
 you've been thinking of me ever since you first saw me.

213
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,580
 That you like me.

214
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,290
Nuna?

215
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,990
You're Nuna Hui Su, right? I'm a Korean major...

216
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,800
I know. Park Jun Yeong.

217
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,050
What's up?

218
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,530
We have a class together, right, Nuna?

219
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,330
The more I see you, the I keep thinking about you, Nuna.

220
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,490
A couple with an age gap isn't a bad thing, right?

221
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,730
Are you going to keep using this?

222
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,020
If I get confessed to it makes me feel good. I become happier.

223
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,890
And if you use all the pages? What will you do then?

224
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,520
Why are you thinking about that now? I can receive love from someone I just met.

225
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,790
Seo Hui Su. You don't look happy at all.

226
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,760
No, Si Ho. I'm really happy.

227
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,320
Someone liking me is like a dream.

228
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,470
- Can't you just understand that? 
 - This isn't a question of understanding.

229
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,000
Si Ho. I'll get going.

230
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,250
Jun Yeong suddenly said to meet.

231
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,860
If you really go like this...

232
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,300
Never mind, do as you like.

233
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,320
I'm going.

234
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,020
Oppa! I told you to call me.

235
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,400
I received a compliment on my last assignment, thanks to you.

236
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,670
Would you like to go and grab a beer? It's on me.

237
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,270
What's up? Why do you like so down?

238
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,480
If you don't want to go, you can just forget it.

239
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,220
- Sure, let's go. 
 - What?

240
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,490
Let's go. To have drinks.

241
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,430
What's the occasion

242
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,530
Sure! Let's go!

243
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,940

244
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,830
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

245
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,380
 Even then you were also looking elsewhere.

246
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,890
♫  Before I knew it  ♫

247
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,250
 So keep doing it.  What you like and are good at.  
 ♫  you became   ♫

248
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,880
  If you continue doing it, you'll be good at it anyway.  
 ♫  more than a friend   ♫

249
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,800
 No one pays attention to a thing like me anyway.
 I don't want to go home.  
  ♫   Growing silently   ♫

250
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 I think If I'm at home, I'm going to die.

251
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,500
 Maybe I went through all those hard times to meet you. 
 That's what I thought.  
 ♫   my feelings won't fade away Oh  ♫

252
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,170
 If I get confessed to it makes me feel good. I become happier.  
 ♫  Even if approach   ♫

253
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,590
 Someone liking me is like a dream.  
 ♫  just one step    ♫

254
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,710
♫   closer to you  ♫

255
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,120
♫  It feels like you'll move farther away  ♫

256
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,720
♫  So I always just hang around in the same spot  ♫
