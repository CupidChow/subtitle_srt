1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,010

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,200
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,520
 I mean, Hui Su's dad says no unless Hui Su says yes.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,290
 Where else would he find a lady like her?

5
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,360
 What would a little girl like her know?

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,520
 She'll just ruin her father's life.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,260
 If only that one had never been born, her mom wouldn't have died.

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,540
 Her dad is so depressed. Aigoo!

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,620
 What the heck is this? Seriously!

10
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,550
 Daddy.

11
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,560
 Daddy, are you sleeping?

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,380
 Daddy?

13
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,000
 Watch out, guys, Korean Department S.H.S

14
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,420
 I've seen her in general ed classes. She looks better in person.

15
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,040
 Huh? Which general ed class? Info, please.

16
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,980
 Sent a note.

17
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,260
 Instagram: 150 notifications

18
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,470
 The fortunate thing is

19
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,290
 that I'm used to being hated.

20
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,430
I thought she'd be super pretty, but she's pretty plain.

21
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,380
Should I come on to her?

22
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,630
I hate that. Do you want to do that?

23
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,410
Do you want to be in her collection of men?

24
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,280
Are you sure it's her?

25
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,470
She's acting coy.

26
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,600
I can't do that.

27
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,840
Really...

28
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
Is that her?

29
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,800
Really...

30
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,870
Hey, Seo Hui Su!

31
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,630
Where are you going?

32
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,800
It's you, right? The one who uploaded that weird post.

33
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,490
What are you talking about? Do you have proof?

34
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,680
Don't you get what's going on right now?

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,170
It'd be good for you to clean this up, so it doesn't get out of hand.

36
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,930
I'll sue you for slander.

37
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,870
No matter what happens,

38
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,430
I'll be sure to brand you a criminal.

39
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,120
What is this?

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,970
I'm so embarrassed in front of Jeong Si Ho.

41
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,050
Hey, Seo Hui Su, I'm glad I ran into you.

42
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,400
Come over here.

43
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
Teacher, what is it?

44
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,690
"What is it?"

45
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,460
Hey, what do you mean you're dropping out?

46
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,970
How can you say you're dropping out in a text?

47
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,620
It's just that it's boring

48
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,780
and makes me wonder what's the use in attending longer?

49
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,130
Hey, do your parents know what you're up to?

50
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,190
Tell your father to come by the school sometime.

51
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,830
No matter how busy he is, tell him to stop by for sure.

52
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,610
This is a serious matter.

53
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,630
My dad?

54
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,720
My dad's not interested in me.

55
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,400
If I tell him that I want to drop out, he'll say go ahead.

56
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,950
Start saying something that makes sense.

57
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,770
Yeah. It's nothing...

58
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,550
You're meeting with me today. Stay after school! Okay?

59
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,540
Okay.

60
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,800
Do you want to eat this?

61
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,600
 There are times when I can't really breathe and my chest feels constricted.

62
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,430
 At first, I just thought he was going through what I went through.

63
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,830
 So I just wanted to be nice to him.

64
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,120
 As time passed, I realized that you're a good person unlike me.

65
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,400
 So I got scared.

66
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,790
 Out of what I have, you've become

67
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,080
 the most cherished part of my life.

68
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,130
 Next time...

69
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,150
 I can't remember.

70
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,670
 Hey, what's going on, you two? Are you guys dating?

71
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,370
 Are you crazy? Why would I go out with him?

72
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,380
 Hey.

73
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,910
 Aren't you going to date?

74
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,860
 No, I won't.

75
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,690
 Why not?

76
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,800
 If I start dating someone,

77
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,550
 you and I would have to separate.

78
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,560
 I would have nowhere else to go if I lost you.

79
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,340
Hey, Seo Hui Su!

80
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,090
Are you okay?

81
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,590
 You said you're tired of me. You said you'd stop.

82
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,750
I'm sorry, Si Ho.

83
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm sorry...

84
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm sorry, Si Ho...

85
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,000
 Why are you on my side to the end?

86
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,340
Hey, don't you worry. You didn't do anything wrong.

87
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,710
I contacted Instagram and told them to delete all the posts about you. So—

88
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,450
Si Ho.

89
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,630
Huh?

90
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,490
Did I really do nothing wrong?

91
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,630
Even though I played with a person's heart because of my desire?

92
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,640
Hey, this and that are different.

93
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,660
You're right. I shouldn't have written down my notes.

94
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,790
First of all, what will you do about that jerk Park Jun Yeong? Should I really sue him?

95
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll try to do something about it.

96
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,550
Are you really going to let him slide?

97
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,400
Or should I beat him up?

98
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,250
Hey! What do you mean, beat him up? I'll take care of it.

99
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,770
I won't let him get away with this.

100
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,110
So, you just stay put.

101
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,020
All right.

102
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,590
And I'll throw away my notebook, too.

103
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,390
Are you really going to throw that away?

104
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,970
Yeah. I'm going to stop it now.

105
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,950
Good. You made the right decision.

106
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,430
Thanks, Jeong Si Ho.

107
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,850
I'm sure there's something there.

108
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,560
What could it be?

109
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,020
Strangely, it makes me wonder.

110
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,050

I might both laugh freely and cry my heart out

111
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,210
What are you doing?

112
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,700
Hi, Oppa, you're here.

113
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,050
Did you calculate everything?

114
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,430
Of course. I finished everything before you got here.

115
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,960
Oppa, do you want to go to Namsan after we get off work?

116
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,420
I heard the night view is totally awesome.

117
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,270
Se Jin.

118
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,960
Yes?

119
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,350
Our month is over.

120
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,540
Sorry. I won't beat around the bush.

121
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,810
I haven't developed feelings for you.

122
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,050
Let's stop doing this.

123
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,630
It's because of Seo Hui Su.

124
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,170
What?

125
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,950
All right. We won't do this any longer.

126
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,130
But don't say stuff like, "Let's remain close seonbae and hoobae."

127
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,100
I don't want to bruise my ego even more.

128
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,390
Okay. I understand.

129
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,190
 Seo Hui Su

130
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,290
Yeah. Next week is good, too. But let's just burn it tomorrow.

131
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,540
Why drag it out until next week?

132
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,820
That notebook is upsetting.

133
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,510
 Department of Korean office - Please knock before you enter, Dean

134
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,790
I thought I could do it.

135
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,770
Hey, Seo Hui Su!

136
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,010
Seonbae...

137
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm sorry.

138
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,300
Well...

139
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,720
Hui Su, I heard there are many other victims besides you.

140
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Yes.

141
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,530
But don't worry. I just want to reveal what's relevant to me.

142
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,750
I won't affect other people with it.

143
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,540
What are you talking about?

144
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,820
Excuse me?

145
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,200
Hui Su, look at this.

146
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,710
 The facts behind Park ** from the Korean Department / Reporting sexual harassment group text within the Korean Department...

147
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,940
Everyone is worried about you.

148
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,950
I heard you've been avoiding people and not answering your phone.

149
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,920
Seonbae, that's not it—

150
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,030
Is Park Jun Yeong still harassing you?

151
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,020
Hui Su,

152
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,320
let's go inside together.

153
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,190
We'll help you, so this a**hole can't step a foot in our department. Okay?

154
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,440
 I thought I was used to being hated on by others.

155
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,040
 Instagram, 150 notifications

156
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,170
 Seo Hui Su, are you okay?

157
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,270
 There's another victim in our club, too.

158
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,970
 Ms. Hui Su, it's upsetting that something like this happened. You didn't do anything wrong.

159
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,220
 Ms. Hui Su, I'm sending you another piece of evidence from a group chatroom. I'm cheering you on.

160
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,260
 The one who didn't look at her surroundings,

161
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,630
 was it me?

162
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,340
Hurry up and come over here!

163
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,450
You're walking like you're a criminal.

164
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,380
Did you call me to pick a fight?

165
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,360
Aren't you going to drop out?

166
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,940
You'll be disciplined with a suspension anyway.

167
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,920
If I were you, I would've dropped out.

168
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,620
F**k, what do you want me to do?

169
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,000
You called me out when I'm busy. How annoying. I'm leaving.

170
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,980
I'm curious about something.

171
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,080
About what?

172
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,840
How did you start liking Seo Hui Su?

173
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,300
What?

174
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,960
Hey. Why are you curious about that all of a sudden?

175
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,790
I looked into it.

176
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,840
The day before you confessed your feelings to Seo Hui Su,

177
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,150
you had come on to one of the students in the design department, too.

178
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,400
Was it Lee Hae In?

179
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,310
That's right.

180
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,850
How did you have a change of heart so quickly?

181
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,180
Did you even like her?

182
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,380
I don't know if you'll believe this, but...

183
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,420
Eonni!

184
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,290
Se Jin, you scared me because you said you were coming over so late at night.

185
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,810
I was just worried about you, Eonni.

186
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,080
Let's have a drink.

187
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,630
Thanks. Let me take that.

188
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,030
Park Jun Yeong, that crazy a**hole.

189
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,020
He's the one who's in the wrong. What a f**king loser.

190
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,510
Anyway, jerks like him give men a bad name!

191
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,180
Eonni, you did the right thing.

192
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,770
You've got to nip it in the bud with guys like him.

193
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,880
They'll expel him, won't they?

194
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,240
I heard the disciplinary committee will meet. I'm sure they'll come up with some resolution.

195
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,770
You should sue him, too.

196
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,090
Eonni, when did you empty your glass?

197
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,400
Here you go.

198
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,280
Cheers.

199
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,380
Cheers!

200
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,620
Hey, I've gone over my limit here.

201
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,060
Eonni, I'm craving alcohol tonight, too.

202
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,180
Jeong Si Ho rejected me.

203
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,630
Crazy. Why would he reject someone as pretty as you?

204
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,670
I don't know. So I decided to stop pursuing him, too.

205
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,190
I won't like a guy who doesn't like me either.

206
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,800
You're so cool, Se Jin.

207
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,950
I really respect such a mindset like yours.

208
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,420
I so envy it.

209
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,420
I have a question for you, Eonni.

210
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,590
What?

211
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,860
Ask me anything. I'll tell you everything.

212
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,820
Eonni, how did you get so good at dating all of a sudden?

213
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,710
There are methods, you know.

214
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,410
What method?

215
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,620
Share them with me. I want to date, too.

216
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,780
Well, it's...

217
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,180
Working really hard on writing lyrics.

218
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,350
Writing lyrics?

219
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,890
What's that?

220
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,370
Something like that. You don't have to know.

221
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,760
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

222
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,480
Eonni... What is it?

223
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,340
Eonni, are you asleep?

224
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,400
 People told me, love at first sight is not real...

225
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,790
 The cafe I go to often ...

226
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
 People told me, love at first sight is not real...

227
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,220
 You don't know me, and I don't know you ...

228
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,960
Did she write out all the love confessions she received into songs?

229
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,170
 3/6/22

230
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,350
 3/6/22

231
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,180
The dates don't match.

232
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,710
 3/11/2022

233
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,220
 3/6/22

234
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,930
Whatever.

235
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,880
Seo Hui Su, what exactly did you do?

236
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,680
 Seo Hui Su

237
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,950
 Seo Hui Su

238
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,400
 Seo Hui Su

239
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,540
What's this...

240
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,400
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

241
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,930
 Second year, second semester grades: C, D+, C+, C, D+, B+, D+

242
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,620
I'm done for this semester, too. Gosh!

243
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,920
Whatever! I'll just do a good job next semester.

244
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,500
What's life? There's not much to it.

245
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,180
Seo Hui Su, you can do it...

246
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,220
What's wrong with my complexion?

247
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,420
Is it because it got cold all of a sudden?

248
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,350
Seriously.

249
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,170
Gosh...

250
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,160
Treating wrinkles at age 21? What in the world?

251
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,950
Get taut.

252
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,360
Get taut.

253
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:26,010

254
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,740
Daebak. How long ago was this picture taken?

255
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,870
 Hey, look at this photo.

256
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,360
 It's an antique at this point, isn't it?

257
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,350
 Oh, there's more besides this one.

258
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,410
♫  Tears that will not stop shedding  ♫

259
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,990
 That was a strange day.

260
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:57,590
 All the downtrodden and depressed feelings I had all day disappeared like magic.

261
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,860
 They were merely a few old pictures

262
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,420
 and they were comforting me.

263
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,480
♫  While I was crying  ♫

264
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,620
 Hey, can we have a malatang for dinner tonight?

265
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,340
 Deal. Count me in.

266
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,300
 Out of what I have, you've become the most cherished part of my life.

267
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,930
  I thought I was used to being hated by others.

268
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,100
 But the one who didn't look at my surroundings was me.

269
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,380
 Don't worry. You didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,380
 You said you're tired of me. You said you'd stop.

271
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,420
 Why are you on my side to the end?

272
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,360
 He rejected me. So I decided to stop pursuing him, too. I don't like a guy who rejects me, either.

273
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,020
 He rejected me. So I decided to stop pursuing him, too.

274
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,130
♫  So you can find me when I'm hiding  ♫

275
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,230
♫  Now  ♫

276
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,230
♫  I can face your heart that started having feelings for me  ♫
