1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,040

2
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,350
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,230
 I don't know if you'll believe it.

4
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,380
Well, I was at the library, and she was standing on the opposite side.

5
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,340
It was as if something possessed me.

6
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,760
I won't be able to explain this.

7
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,660
As if something possessed you?

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,170
Yeah. When I think about it, I feel like throwing up.

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,280
It was definitely my memory, but it didn't feel like one.

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,940
But do you know what's even stranger?

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,400
What?

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,120
You know Kim Kang Wuk who was dating Seo Hui Su.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,020
My friend was drinking with him not too long ago. He said he felt the same as me.

14
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,820
He too was about to confess to another girl.

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,630
What has her name?

16
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,610
Kang Ju Yeon?

17
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,800
 March 16, 2022

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,380
 A day without any problems  ends with nothing happening.

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,220
 I love you, Hui Su.

20
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,630
 Let's date.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,440
 Let's just burn it. Let's wait until next week.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,910
 That notebook makes me upset.

23
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't tell me...

24
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,500
 Seo Hui Su

25
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,910
 Seo Hui Su

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,540
It can't be.

27
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,970
Have you got everything? Let's hurry up and get rid of it.

28
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,680
I don't see it.

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,420
What do you mean?

30
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,290
The notebook has disappeared. It was definitely here, but now it's gone.

31
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,800
How can it disappear? Try to search for it some more.

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Is it because of that?

33
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,200
Since I've decided to get rid of it, the notebook found out and disappeared.

34
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,610
It must think I don't really need the notebook.

35
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,650
Does that make sense?

36
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,510
Hey. Then, does that notebook itself make sense?

37
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,420
I guess.

38
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,480
It's for the best. I wanted to get rid of it anyway.

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
You're right.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,350
But still, in my life without dating, I could try it as much as I liked.

41
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,450
What is dating really?  One hand has held so many, Seo Hui Su.

42
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,520
I know, right?

43
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,770
What's so special about dating? I wasn't even able to do what I need to do.

44
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,580
How about trying to compose and sing your song this time?

45
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,040
Hey. Me and singing?

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,080
Why? You're quite good at singing.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,910
I think you don't even know what you're capable of.

48
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,560
So, I just want to say do what you're good at.

49
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,140
Let it go. Anyway, don't make trouble like this again.

50
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,060
Got it?

51
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,530
Got it! Stop nagging.

52
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,580
But still, it's true I liked that a little bit.

53
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,290
You wouldn't know. You've never dated.

54
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,270
You still haven't come to your senses?

55
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,290
I have.

56
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,670
- Oh? 
 - Oh?

57
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,690
Aren't you hiding that notebook from me?

58
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,600
Hey! Don't look there!

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Hey! Stop it!

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,190
A-Are you okay?

61
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,360
You were strangely—

62
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,180
So why were you searching through someone's bed?

63
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,960
You got hit because you deserved to be hit.

64
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,980
Get out!

65
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,650
Are you okay?

66
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,740
It's just that I'm a little bit tired.

67
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,410
Why are you so pale? This won't do, rest a bit.

68
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,980
Do you want some water?

69
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,590
Don't treat me well.

70
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,900
I told you.

71
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,190
I don't like being close oppa and dongsaeng with you.

72
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,080
What is it, Seo Hui Su? Are you hiding right now?

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,600
Because of Jeong Si Ho? Me?

74
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,140
Seo Hui Su, snap out of it.

75
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,550
Si Ho is just family.

76

 LIKE

77
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,120
Should I try it once?

What did you say? I didn't hear you.

I am Seo Hui Su who applied to be a lyricist.

Lyricist?

122

Are you Seo Hui Su?

123
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,360
Yes.

Yes.

127
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,600
I cried a little when I read the lyrics you wrote.

128
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,060
I really really liked them.

129
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,800
Pardon?

130
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,670
Thank you.

131
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,590
If you don't mind, could I try to sing the song?

148
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,190
You really sang the song well.  You're the best.

149
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,950
It's because the lyrics are good.

150
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,070
Actually, it's a melody that I have been treasuring.

151
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,690
But I didn't have the right lyrics,

152
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,040
so I've held onto the song for over a year.

153
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,490
I am very grateful.

154
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,780
Not at all.  I am more thankful.

155
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,410
The melody is really pretty.

156
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,020

157
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
What is it?

158
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,580
Please join our band.

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,550
but we still have lots of songs without lyrics.

161
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,370
Please ...

162
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,820
I also have a favor to ask of you.

163
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,780
A favor? What is it?

164
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,700
I want to learn to compose music.  Please teach me.

165
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,220
All right. I'll teach you as much as I know.

166
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,380
So you're signing with us, right?

167
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,420
Yes!

168
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,740
How is this part?

169
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Wow. That's good.

170
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,880
Why not do it?

171
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,060
I'm learning how to tune the guitar.

172
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,410
Wait a second, Seonbae.

173
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,550
Me, really?

174
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,850
No...

175
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,950
that's a relief.

176
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,800
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Get home safely.

177
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,250
- Oh, Jeong Si Ho. 
 - Are you having fun?

178
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah. It so much fun.

179
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,770
When what I've written is played with music,

180
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,990
it truly feels like I am watching my baby flying in the sky.

181
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,080
What? Baby?

182
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,830
Yeah.  And I completely love my seonbaes.

183
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,820
They even loaned me a guitar.

184
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,990
You're not dating someone like Do Bin again are you?

185
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,960
Hey. When I don't even have the notebook, how could I be doing that?

186
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,990
If you have the notebook, you'll hear the sound.

187
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,590
What's going on?  Are you trying to pick a fight? Seriously.

188
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,910
What's that?  What's that sound?

189
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,580
I know, right?

190
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,800
There must be fireworks somewhere. Where are they doing that?

191
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,820
It's pretty.

192
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,770
♫  Everything is brightly lit  ♫

193
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,150
♫  Your face which just looked sad  ♫

194
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,900
♫  comes to mind  ♫

195
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,890
♫  Where will they go?  ♫

196
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,960
♫  The feelings which couldn't   ♫

197
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,800
♫  which couldn't be expressed  ♫

198
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,100
I left my AirPods in the office.  Will you go with me?

199
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,780
No.  I'm watching the fireworks.

200
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,750
- Hurry back.

201
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,500
Hui Su. Thank god.

202
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,760
Seonbae Do Bin.

203
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,950
Just a moment.

204
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,200
I was getting ready to go home

205
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,100
when I heard the sound of exploding fireworks from somewhere.

206
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,050
Ah. Yes.

207
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,940
And then?

208
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,370
It's a fireworks show.

209
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,310
I wanted to confess my love on the day of a fireworks show

210
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,300
like the lyrics you wrote.

211
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,030
What?

212
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,970
A confession?

213
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,070
To me?

214
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,040
I like you.

215
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,140
Me?

216
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,750
A lot.

217
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,600
I know you're surprised,

218
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,650
but I've been thinking about this for a long time.

219
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,630
Hey, Seo Hui Su.

220
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,770
Follow me.

221
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,640
Why? What's the matter with you?

222
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,570
What are you? What is that seonbae?

223
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,580
What am I?

224
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,080
I also don't know what's happening.  Why did Seonbae suddenly—

225
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,340
While the notebook has vanished.

226
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,070
- The notebook? 
 - As you said, the notebook vanished.

227
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,780
Why are you lying?

228
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,130
What do you mean by lying?  I haven't told any lie.

229
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,720
Why are you doing this to me?

230
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,160
You said you weren't doing it anymore.

231
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,330
I really don't have the notebook.

232
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,940
Then ..

233
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,630
are you saying it's real that that seonbae confessed and said he loved you?

234
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,540
Suddenly?

235
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,110
If I don't have the notebook,

236
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,420
can't he?

237
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,700
Are you saying I can't receive a confession without having the notebook?

238
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,070
Okay.  I know that too.

239
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:12,010
I know better than anyone in the world that there is no one who readily likes me.

240
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,690
But Shi Ho. I've never lied to you.

241
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,920
Because you told me to do what I am good at doing, I—

242
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,160
Seo Hui Su.  That's not what I'm saying—

243
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,530
If not, then what are you saying?

244
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,970

245
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,620
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

246
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,550
 Everything is brightly lit 
 Your face which just looked sad

247
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,510
 comes to mind

248
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,520
 Because I want to become a shining star

249
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,850
♫  Everything is brightly lit  ♫

250
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,220
♫  Your face which just looked sad  ♫

251
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,500
♫  comes to mind  ♫

252
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,570
♫  Where will they go  ♫

253
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,350
♫  The feelings  ♫

254
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,400
♫  which couldn't be expressed  ♫
