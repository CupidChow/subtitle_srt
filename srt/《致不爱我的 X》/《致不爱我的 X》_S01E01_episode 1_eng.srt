1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,270
 Han Ji Hyo

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,840
 Do Yeong

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,960
 Kwon Ah Reum

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,780

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,740
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,810
 Where is the perfect place to receive a confession of love?

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,730
 Not in Service

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,780
  On the street on the first day it snows?

9
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,110
 Or ...

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,300
 Any roof glowing with the splendor of the setting sun?

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,120
 If it's not that either...

12
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,920
 Wait a second

13
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,200
 On a warm blanket on top of the bed?

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,970
 I like you.

15
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,150
 I like you.

16
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,850
 I like you.

17
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,020
 I like you too.

18
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,990
 I like you too.

19
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,890
 I like you too.

20
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,090
 Anywhere is great.

21
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,620
 Seonbae, is something wrong?

22
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,100
 Can't you breathe? What's wrong, Seonbae?

23
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,690
 Seonbae, are you okay?

24
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,770
 Seonbae, look at me!

25
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,540
 Seonbae ...

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,420
 Blood! Blood! Seonbae!

27
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,800
 Seonbae, are you dead?

28
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
 Seonbae!

29
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 Seonbae, Seonbae, what's wrong with you?

30
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,850
 Seonbae, Seonbae, don't die! Don't die!

31
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,100
 Wake up! Open your eyes! Don't lose consciousness, Seonbae.

32
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,790
 One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

33
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,540
 Seonbae, wake up!

34
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,960
 Seonbae. Seonbae.

35
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Everything was good so why did you die again?

36
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,150
I don't know ...

37
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,010
 Again my damn day starts like this today.

38
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,630
♫   When I'm practicing by myself, I got the power I need   ♫

39
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,630
♫  When I'm in front of you, I have no power at all   ♫

40
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,100
♫  You gotta do what you like. Do what you like.  ♫

41
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,610
♫  tbd  ♫

42
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,670
♫  I'll appear when you call me. Just like a magical chant  ♫

43
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,630
♫  Even if I don't appear, isn't it obvious?   ♫

44
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,120
♫  You gotta do what you like. Do what you like.  ♫

45
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,900
♫  Whatever you like  ♫

46
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,150
 Where are you?  I've saved you a seat.

47
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,190
On my way.

48
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,430
 After class, are you up for some malatang for lunch?  
 (T/N: Malatang is spicy soup dish usually containing meat and vegetables)

49
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,500
Did a Chinese ghost who died without getting to eat malatang get stuck in your belly?

50
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,170
No, I won't.  Eat it with somebody else.

51
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,240
 Why?  You're the only person who will eat it with me.

52
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,480
 You like malatang more than anyone.

53
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,460
Don't go overboard.

54
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,820
 What?  Do you have plans?

55
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Today is the first day of the school party.

56
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,880
But I couldn't write a single lyric.

57
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,790
 Hey, you have to eat.  You'll faint if you keep going like this.

58
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,770
 Then you won't write anything.

59
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,250
 Don't you know that food gives a Korean power?

60
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,840
What you say is true, but then ...

61
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,250
Hey, I'm hanging up for a while.

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,110
♫  Have you eaten?

63
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,780
♫ I starved thinking of you.

64
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,580
Seonbae Kang Wuk.

65
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,970
How are you?

66
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,890
You're working hard.  Are you practicing writing lyrics?

67
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,630
Yes. Something just popped into my head.

68
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,440
Then in the next concert can I sing the lyrics you've written?

69
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,420
He's handsome.

70
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,080
Yes.

71
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,200
I'll try my best.  That's something I hope to do.

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,650
Okay.  See you later, Hui Jin.

73
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Seonbae, my name is Hui Su.

74
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
It's Seo Hui Su.

75
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,420
I said I'm going.

76
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,630
I received a confession from my crush in a dream.

77
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Is it fate that I bumped into him this morning, Si Ho?

78
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,600
It's not. I heard Seonbae died in your dream.

79
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,620
 Jeong Si Ho. He's been my best friend since freshman year of high school.

80
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,230
 He acts like he's normal now,

81
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,070
 but five years ago, he was actually the type of guy I could piggyback.

82
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,560
Furthermore, I have to pay attention to class, so would you be quiet?

83
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,960
Since when did you care about grades? You're acting like a jerk.

84
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,770
Friend, even so, one shouldn't avoid studying.

85
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,850
Even if we add both our grades, the total is less than 4.5.

86
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,700
Receiving a confession is nice.

87
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,500
But he died.  What exactly was it?

88
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,650
How great was it to receive a confession?

89
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,310
More than that, won't it be a problem to have a dream like that every day?

90
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,290
It's not every day.

91
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,300
Why do you say that?

92
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,070
Dreams are the opposite...

93
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,830
Maybe it's a positive sign?

94
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,070
Unconscious.

95
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,530
A dream is the manifestation of the unconscious and that unconscious is desire.

96
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,890
Carl Jung said eventually a desire suppressed by consciousness

97
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,990
is revealed through a dream.

98
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,960
You heard that right?

99
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,060
You didn't do something more in your dream, did you?

100
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,800
What are you saying? Get out of here.

101
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,830
- Hey. 
 - What?

102
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,170
What do you like about him so much?

103
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,020
About him?

104
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,160
First of all...

105
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,050
♫  What would it be if it were you?  ♫

106
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,260
 He's handsome.

107
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,230
♫  These crazy days   ♫

108
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,620
♫  when your day comes   ♫

109
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,950
 His voice is really nice.  
 ♫  You are as much alone as I am  ♫

110
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,360
 When people hear him singing, they all fall in love with him.

111
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,020
♫  If you see it's broken will you know?  ♫

112
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,040
That hyeong, how to put this... He's kinda...

113
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,920
♫  How much I want you.  ♫

114
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,580
Isn't he a bit stupid?

115
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,360
He's always forgetting the lyrics or falling down.

116
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,760
Hey. Perfect people die earlier.

117
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,780
You don't know "gap moe"?  (When someone does the opposite of their normal behavior.)

118
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,020
Gap? Gap what?

119
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,980
Gap moe.

120
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,440
His face is already perfect. Don't you think he should be a little bit lacking to be human?

121
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,700
And that's really charming.

122
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, you wouldn't know. I'll take care of it.

123
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,840
Well... do so.

124
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,080
Hey, I've ordered spicy level 0 for you!

125
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,980
How can you eat malatang if you can't even handle level 1?

126
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,440
I can eat spicy food better than you.

127
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,150
Boss. Give us some water, please.

128
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,990
Anyway, you're not going to confess, right?

129
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,050
Are you crazy? Why would I confess?

130
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,040
What? You should confess.

131
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,270
 Park Se Jin. Si Ho's part-time colleague and a design department freshman at our school,

132
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,970
 and also my best drinking buddy.

133
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,880
Se Jin. Why are you here?

134
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,470
Since we've met like this, shall we drink some soju later?

135
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,820
That would be great, Eonni.

136
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,460
I was eating malatang over there, and ran to you after hearing your voices.

137
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,390
I bet my entire fortune that she'll find somebody new within a month.

138
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,570
I'm going to kill you, for real.

139
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,420
You're not going to confess? Just confess.

140
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,610
For what? It won't work out anyway.

141
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,100
Why do you think it's not possible?

142
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,950
Hey! Aren't your friends waiting for you?

143
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,260
Eonni. We were at that pub during the end-of-semester party.

144
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,520
- Do you remember? 
 - What?

145
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,340
 TERRA

146
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,080
 Seonbae...

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,570
 You're gonna get hurt like that.

148
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,290
 I saw that. Clearly.

149
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,990
He'd supported your head so carefully.

150
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,030
I thought you were going to start dating during summer vacation.

151
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,100
Really?

152
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,520
Let's do the opening party at our store today.

153
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,360
Just wait. There's a possibility between you two.

154
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,800
Right, Si Ho Oppa?

155
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,870
What? Why aren't you saying anything?

156
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,160
To Seo Hui Su's table over there.

157
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,070
Okay.

158
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,500
Se Jin. This is on the house, right?

159
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,820
Of course.

160
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,920
Eonni. That seonbae is sitting diagonally from you today.

161
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,880
There's a rule you have to sit diagonally so you can see his face well.

162
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,920
Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,090
If you keep teasing me, I'll get angry.

164
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,550
It's true though...

165
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,720
Starting now,

166
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,350
to welcome our freshmen, we're going to introduce our lyrics.

167
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,590
Who's going to start?

168
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,790
How about Kang Ju Yeon, who is now in her first semester?

169
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,020
Yes, first of all, to Kang Wook for making a nice melody,

170
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,980
thank you.

171
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,650
- Oh. 
 - Hey.

172
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,360
I'm going to announce it!

173
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,030
The title is "Colored."

174
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,320
I want to slowly get colored into your time,

175
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,600
to slowly get spread over the dark night, the silent day.

176
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,100
You might be frightened, but there's nothing to know about it.

177
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,230
The light of May, the yearning of October

178
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,970
make you close your eyes.

179
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,950
Now, try moving your feet.

180
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,390
Try fading away peacefully. Try dancing.

181
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,540
Thank you.

182
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,370
Wow.

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,700
That was so good.

184
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,540
Of course! Our ace, Kang Ju Yeon is different.

185
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,830
She's different.

186
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,560
Okay, and next

187
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,700
is your our second-year Hui Su!

188
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,280
I'm going to announce it.

189
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,590
The title is "Have You Eaten?"

190
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,200
Have you eaten?

191
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,700
No matter how tired you are, Koreans have to eat.

192
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,400
In the end, love is also energy.

193
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,740
A love recipe for you. Have you eaten?

194
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,990
Have you eaten, let's eat... In the end, love is also energy.

195
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,880
That was good.

196
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,270
Hey, stop drinking so much.

197
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,390
Why?

198
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,740
Today I'm going to drink myself to death.

199
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,880
Give me more alcohol, you punk!

200
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
No. Just stop.

201
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,220
Nothing's going well for me today.

202
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,720
Seonbae.

203
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,460
Thank you.

204
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,660
Hey. Your lyrics were really cute.

205
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,030
I liked that.

206
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,370
Really?

207
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,670
Thank you.

208
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,710
Have fun, Hui Ju.

209
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,780
Seonbae, but my name is Hui Su.

210
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,840
Hey, Seo Hui Su. Stop drinking, this won't do.

211
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,070
You saw that, right? He patted you on the head.

212
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,920
- What's happening here?  
  - Hey.

213
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
Are you going to keep talking nonsense?

214
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,380
Why?

215
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,380
Why is it nonsense?

216
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,890
She's too drunk...

217
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,230
Tell me, Jeong Si Ho.

218
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,050
When someone treats me well...

219
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,210
When it seems somebody likes me, is that ridiculous??

220
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,490
It's not like that.

221
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,940
Se Jin might not be able to tell.

222
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,320
Jeong Si Ho, I'm going to show you.

223
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,600
Just wait.

224
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,040
Hey, what are you going to...

225
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,810
Seonbae.

226
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,380
Seonbae!

227
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,960
Seonbae.

228
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,820
Seonbae.

229
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,890
Seonbae.

230
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,410
Seonbae! I want to tell you something.

231
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,650
Me?

232
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,800
What do you want to talk about?

233
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,860
Well...

234
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,160
Th-That...

235
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:32,000
Ah! That is... I wanted to ask you what you liked about my lyrics.

236
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,370
Lyrics?

237
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,560
I must've been drunk. Sorry, I don't remember.

238
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,720
It's okay. I'm sorry I was...

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
I wasn't following you, I just...

240
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,720
Eonni, is this your lyric notebook?

241
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,660
You write them by hand?

242
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,650
That's cute.

243
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,490
Ju Yeon. What are you doing here?

244
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,370
Your lyrics are kinda cute

245
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,850
and fairytale-like? They have that kind of flavor.

246
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,350
But these lyrics are not about someone special,

247
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,980
but rather about an ordinary person telling their story.

248
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,830
It resonated with me.

249
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,200
How about writing about your story next time?

250
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,620
About something you sincerely feel or hope for?

251
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,080
Thank you.

252
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,640
Okay, and about us two sneaking out...

253
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,980
Keep it a secret. Eonni Hui Seon?

254
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,950
We'll head out then.

255
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,530
My name is Seo Hui Su. Seo Hui Su.

256
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,130
Is it so hard to remember someone's name?

257
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,950
So annoying.

258
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,650
Hey, Seo Hui Su. Are you done drinking?

259
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,620
Do you want to drink together?

260
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,860
Why would we drink together given that I'm a lightweight?

261
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,050
So shall we go home?

262
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,190
Hey, Jeong Si Ho. Are you doing well these days?

263
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,620
What do you mean?

264
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,800
Nothing. It's fine.

265
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,280
Aigoo, our Si Ho!

266
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,520
Let go.

267
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,540
Hey. I told you to let go.

268
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,050
Hey... Are you crying?

269
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,900
I'm so embarrassed and annoyed!

270
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,870
It's all because of that dream.

271
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,730
I was thinking he really might like me.

272
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,630
I'm so stupid.

273
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,680
There was a girl like Kang Ju Yeon next to him...

274
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,330
Hey, and what's wrong with you again?

275
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:00,220
Kang Ju Yeon is taller than me, her body is better...

276
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,180
She's a better lyricist.

277
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,150
Hey! Your lyrics are way better that Kang Ju Yeon's or what was her name.

278
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,340
She's so rude!

279
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,560
Is she some kind of professional lyricist?

280
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,190
And your face is way pret—

281
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,120
So I want to say... she's not that pretty.

282
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,740
What the heck! Why aren't you responding? It's making me feel awkward.

283
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,990
Hey, are you sleeping?

284
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,750
What, where am I?

285
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,550
 You threw a tantrum saying you wanted to go to your dad's house so I sent you home in a taxi.

286
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,940
 Your father is on a business trip to the countryside. When you see this message, pay me back for the taxi.

287
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,600
Why is it Dad's house, of all places?

288
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,580
 Dad?

289
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,620
 Window Album

290
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,080
What's this?

291
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,430
 Seo Hui Su

292
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,420
Why is my name here?

293
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,720
A dream again?

294
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,460
What kind of dream was that?!

295
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,490
 No Track writing team to send the file for the next regular performance's new song by this week.

296
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,350
I want to leave the club.

297
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,020
It's so embarrassing I could die.

298
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,560
 What about if you write the next story next time, Eonni?

299
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,910
 What you truly feel and want in life.

300
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,120
That's not it.

301
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,620
Even if I leave, I have to write something better than Kang Ju Yeon and then leave.

302
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,130
It's already all written.

303
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,430
When I try to do something, there's never anything to do.

304
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,640
Why is this here?

305
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,220
 Be completely sincere and write what you want here.

306
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,380
 What? What's this?

307
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,080
 I'll give you everything.

308
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,230
 So take the pen and open me up.

309
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,600
 My heart, more than anyone else...

310
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,030
 shines more than anyone else

311
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,800
We're here.

312
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,270
You came?

313
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,990
Hi, Se Jin. Write your name here and go on in.

314
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,740
Are you going to stay here?

315
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,470
Are you not going in?

316
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,610
I collect the money.

317
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,010
Still, I'm planning on seeing the last performance.

318
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,860
Eonni...

319
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,440
- I'm sorry for last time. 
 - Ah.

320
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,400
Se Jin, I'm really okay.

321
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,380
So don't worry about it, okay?

322
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,470
The performance is starting.

323
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,160
Let's go in together.

324
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,570
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

325
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,220
Your seat is over there.

326
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,190
Hui Su, will you get rid of this? It's turned into  a trash can.

327
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,680
Yes, Seonbae. I'll throw it out.

328
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,350
Thanks.

329
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,830
Hello, everyone.

330
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,260
Welcome to No Track's regular performance.

331
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,390
Today we will be playing a new song, especially for you.

332
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,030
I'll keep this short and start now.

333
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,550
The title is "Would You Please Confess to Me."

334
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:11,920
♪ A day without any problems

335
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,860
♪ ends with nothing happening.

336
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:25,700
♪ Like a day filling one page of a diary

337
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,400
 ♪ it's an ordinary day.

338
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,750
 ♪ Like the main character of a novel

339
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:41,360
♪ like the final scene of a movie

340
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,920
♪ Is believing in fate

341
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,180
♪ too strong a desire for me?

342
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,030
♪ Under the yellow starlight

343
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,300
 ♪ would you please confess to me?

344
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,170
 ♪ A day when everyone congratulates me

345
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,940
♪ my heart will shine more than anyone else

346
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,150
What is this?

347
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,160
It doesn't make sense.

348
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,170
♪ That you like my expression

349
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,780
♪ That you'll love me forever

350
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,170
♪ would you continue to say those things?

351
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,690
♪  I can't believe it even if you tell me

352
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,600
I love you Hui Su. Let's date.

353
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,020
Me? Why?

354
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,780
What!

355
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:48,020

356
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,350
♫   I hope that close-mouthed heart   ♫

357
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:04,970
♫  is for my sake  ♫

358
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:11,770
♫   Do the eyes looking warmly  ♫

359
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:18,200
♫  not mean anything?  ♫

360
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,700
♫  I might both laugh freely and  ♫

361
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:28,400
 Dear X Who Doesen't Love Me  
♫  cry my heart out.  ♫

362
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,900
  I received a confession from my crush in a dream. Is it fate that I bumped into him this morning, Si Ho?

363
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,000
♫  You're the only one who knows  ♫

364
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,300
♫  what the ending will be  ♫

365
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,200
♫  Under the yellow starlight  ♫

366
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,600
♫   would you please confess to me?   ♫
