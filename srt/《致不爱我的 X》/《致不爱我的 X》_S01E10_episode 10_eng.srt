1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,020

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,130
  Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,360
Something happen for goodness sake.

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
I don't need this notebook anymore.

5
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,160
Please.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,040
Dad?

7
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,860
You. What are you doing at this time of night?

8
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,990
Why are you coming out of there?

9
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,620
I had something to do.

10
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,200
You're not in trouble, are you?

11
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,840
Why do you think I'm in trouble?

12
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,730
Or

13
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,690
are you thinking of dropping out of college?

14
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,680
I don't like coming because you're like this.

15
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,510
Well, that's enough.

16
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,850
It's late so sleep here tonight. There's fruit in the fridge,

17
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,580
eat it if you want.

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,750
What sound is this?

19
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,400
Dad.

20
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,460
I saw something in your study...

21
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,600
What?

22
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,180
Why did this suddenly fall down?

23
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,350
Man, really.

24
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,760
I hope they're not ruined...

25
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,370
What did she touch...

26
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,350
Huh?

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,790
This was where this was.

28
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,600
Dad. What is that notebook?

29
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,640
Huh?

30
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,420
What's that notebook?!

31
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,860
What are you talking about? What about this notebook?

32
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,360
Last time I came here and I took that notebook

33
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,030
and I wrote in itâ€”

34
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,450
Dad, I screwed up again. I messed everything up.

35
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,420
Can you do something about that notebook, please?

36
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,000
Hui Su, calm down a little bit.

37
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:15,150
This is the prenatal notebook your mom used to write in

38
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,680
and a notebook to remember her after her death.

39
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,710
From before you were born

40
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,830
and until she died, she wrote in it.

41
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,630
What?

42
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,640
Here.

43
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Look.

44
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,250
 December 3, 2001, I met my child for the first time - Seo Hui Su

45
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,500
  December 3, 2001

46
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,870
  I met my child for the first time.

47
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,490
  I can't feel anything yet

48
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,630
  but I know that we're connected.

49
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,840
  What will she look like?

50
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,670
  Will she look like me or her father?

51
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,370
  I just hope she's born healthy.

52
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,390
  No matter what she looks like I'm ready to love her.

53
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,940
 Diapers, why?

54
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh, boy...

55
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,220
  We're getting ready, little by little, to meet the baby.

56
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,940
  I'm nervous and excited.

57
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,360
I can't believe it.

58
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,720
Mom used to write in this notebook?

59
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,660
That's right.

60
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,360
And this one too.

61
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,410
  Seo Hui Su

62
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,690
  I have to become a good mom.

63
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,190
  I guess we'll definitely fight as the child grows.

64
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,710
  Despite that we will smile again

65
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,270
  and sleep facing each other.

66
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,210
 I hope she becomes a child who can love herself.

67
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,390
 Hui Su.

68
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:13,360
 Mom only wants and hopes this for you.

69
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,670
  No matter what anyone says, treasure yourself first

70
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,390
  and become someone who can embrace and

71
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,410
 love yourself.

72
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,430
Dad.

73
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,750
Don't you blame me?

74
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,430
What?

75
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,920
Mom died because of me.

76
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,470
What are you talking about? Why is it because of you?

77
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,050
Mom died after getting sick while giving birth to me.

78
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,560
You said it too, then, at the hospital.

79
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,090
If I hadn't been born...

80
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,880
Hui Su,

81
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,010
what are you talking about?

82
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,590
I heard everything you said.

83
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,170
You said it to Grandmother.

84
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,570
When you almost died because of me.

85
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,550
I think of it sometimes.

86
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,550
If it wasn't for me Mom and Dad would have lived happily.

87
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,820
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to live.

88
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,480
  After she was born,

89
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,050
 strangely, only bad things were happening.

90
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,400
  You two shouldn't have gotten pregnant so early.

91
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
  If Hui Su

92
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,550
 hadn't been born

93
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,950
  I would have died a long time ago.

94
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,320
  The reason I'm living even like this

95
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,440
  is all because of Hui Su, Mom.

96
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:59,520
  So, don't dislike my one and only child.

97
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,430
That was just an accident, Hui Su.

98
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,530
Your mom didn't die because of you.

99
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,430
Dad didn't almost die either.

100
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,230
It's just

101
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,020
how it was

102
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,600
supposed to happen.

103
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,930
If you have lived

104
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,000
all this time thinking that way,

105
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,070
Dad is really sorry.

106
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,630
Dad.

107
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,820
Dad...

108
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,970
Dad was afraid that something bad would happen to you.

109
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,890
Thinking of having to take responsibility for you alone without Mom,

110
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,590
I was always in a hurry.

111
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,370
Just because.

112
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,230
I should have treated you more warmly.

113
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm really sorry.

114
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:14,280
 Hui Su, do you know the meaning of your name?

115
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,910
  Radiant "Hui", Protective "Su"

116
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,800
  Become someone who can be radiant on their own, someone who can protect herself.

117
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,900
  While we raise you with love

118
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,160
  and leave this record.

119
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,970
  There will come a day where you will record your own life also, won't there?

120
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,850
  How radiant will you be?

121
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,860
  I lived thinking no one loved me  all this time,

122
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,900
 but the only one who didn't love me was myself.

123
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:48,990
Dad, tell me more about Mom. I want to hear it.

124
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,700
Okay.

125
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,200
  I had to love myself first to love someone else.

126
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:27,970
  To the one I love,

127
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,010
Oppa, where are you?

128
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,210
What happened?

129
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,510
I don't see hallucinations and my fever is suddenly down.

130
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah.

131
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,620
Hui Su must have written the last page.

132
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,870
What do we do?

133
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,410
Because of me, Eonni...

134
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,860
It's okay Se Jin.

135
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,740
Don't cry.

136
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,140
What?

137
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,570
You didn't do anything wrong.

138
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,400
It's a relief that you're better,

139
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,170
really.

140
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,220
Hey, Seo Hui Su!

141
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,980
Jeong Si Ho!

142
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,430
How is Se Jin? Is she feeling better?

143
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah. She says she's feeling better.

144
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,830
I'm so glad!

145
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm so relieved.

146
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,590
How about you?

147
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,010
Did you use up the last notebook page?

148
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,350
My dad told me that

149
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,740
my mom used to be super scary.

150
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,580
Really?

151
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,080
But nevertheless, I think she must've been a wonderful person.

152
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,420
She was super scary. No joke.

153
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,700
My dad told me a lot about Mom.

154
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,360
I see.

155
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,300
Do you want to go and eat cup ramen? I have so much to tell you.

156
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,330
Hey.

157
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,840
Huh?

158
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,400
I...

159
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,140
I like you.

160
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,050
What?

161
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,610
I don't care what you wrote in your notebook and about whom.

162
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,480
I've always liked you from the very first moment I met you until now, without wavering.

163
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,120
Whatever curse you may be under,

164
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,250
I'll continue... I'll like you forever.

165
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,860
So...

166
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,980
don't worry about the notebook issue.

167
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,150
Jeong Si Ho.

168
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,110
It's really nothing now that I've actually said all that.

169
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,220
I thought we'd drift apart the moment I said it out loud.

170
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,810
Hey! How could we drift apart?

171
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,140
I think we need to.

172
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,580
When we were younger, you always protected me by my side when I had panic attacks.

173
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,500
But I realized I couldn't keep relying on you.

174
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,630
Even if you reject me, I need to become a decent person on my own.

175
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Hui Su,

176
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,510
I'm going to the military.

177
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,530
What?

178
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,490
What? Military? Why? When are you going?

179
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,160
Let's stay apart for a while. Live well without me.

180
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,170
And then... after that...

181
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,940
Let's decide after that.

182
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,610
Decide what?

183
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,150
Whether we'll stay friends or not.

184
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,680
Just wait a year and a half.

185
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,300
Why would I wait for you?

186
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,970
Just wait for me.

187
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,750
Whatever.

188
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,880
Oh, this...

189
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,230
â™«  The light is rushing in my veins like never before  â™«

190
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,540
You took a bad picture.

191
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,120
â™«  I see it clear I feel it real. It's working  â™«

192
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,370
 At that moment, the notebook was no longer important to us.

193
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,370
â™«  I can't make it stop  â™«

194
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,410
 The fact that we were always together.  
 â™«  Do you remember me?  â™«

195
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,640
 And the fact that we'll be together. That was the only important thing.  
 â™«   Give me a like, I'll give you love like never before  â™«

196
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,370
â™«   Give me a like, I'll give you love like never before  â™«

197
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,450
â™«  So foolishly, unskeptically I'm giving  â™«

198
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,090
â™«  It's all been done before  â™«

199
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,560
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

200
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,310
â™«   But I do it over again   â™«

201
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,560
â™«  Again  â™«

202
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,030
Seo Hui Su?

203
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,360
Didn't you go to the concert hall?

204
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,260
Hi, Seonbae.

205
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,770
I still have some time until the concert. I'm going to change and go a little later.

206
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,640
I thought you'd go straight to the concert hall, Seonbae.

207
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,040
I thought I might, but I noticed the light was on in the workshop.

208
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,230
But what are you doing with that?

209
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,060
It's a debut stage for me. I should take care of myself, you know.

210
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,900
Don't you think I've become prettier than earlier?

211
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,060
I think so.

212
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,950
It really shows right away after I do the treatment, huh?

213
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,590
Yeah.

214
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,210
But aren't you nervous? It's your first performance.

215
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,210
Of course, I am!

216
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,770
I'm totally nervous. I won't make a mistake on stage later, will I?

217
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,130
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

218
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,380
Just do as you normally do.

219
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,090
Thanks, Seonbae.

220
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,670
I'll crush it.

221
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,660
Crush it.

222
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,590
Okay.

223
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,370
Thanks, Seonbae.

224
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,640
Eonni, I'm here!

225
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,290
You're late again.

226
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,930
I told you to come early and help out.

227
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,810
Sorry. I'm a little busy lately, you know.

228
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,070
Flirting with your potential guy must be going well.

229
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,580
In my opinion, I think he'll fall for me next week.

230
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,950
So, why isn't Si Ho here?

231
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,890
He didn't get his furlough revoked, did he?

232
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,690
He says he's on his way right now. Gosh, you're so particular.

233
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,860
Eonni, I'll take awesome pictures for you.

234
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,850
Fighting!

235
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,480
Fighting! Fighting!

236
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,720
Hui Su, it's show time.

237
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Are you ready?

238
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,150
Yes. I'm ready, Seonbae.

239
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,210
Hello! I'm Seo Hui Su from the band club, LIV.E.

240
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,820
I originally joined the group as a lyricist and

241
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,130
I got to write this song for the first time.

242
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,950
I wanted to sing this song myself, and that's why I'm on stage.

243
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,320
Sing! Sing!

244
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,700
Sing!

245
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,810
- Okay. I'll sing.
  - Sing!

246
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,060
This song is a reflection over twenty years

247
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,480
and also a letter to someone.

248
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,030
The title of the song is, "Beloved Self."

249
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,400
Then I'll start the song.

250
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,410
â™«  Tears which were unceasing  â™«

251
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,080
â™«  Whether I was quite lonely or  â™«

252
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,990
â™«  I had to endure alone  â™«

253
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,140
â™«  the darkness which would end someday  â™«

254
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,820
â™«  Like a lost child,  â™«

255
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,070
â™«  spending the day wailing  â™«

256
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,870
â™«  I was searching for the person  â™«

257
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,450
â™«  who would love me  â™«

258
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,390
â™«  I who can't be strong enough  â™«

259
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,680
â™«  I who am not confident  â™«

260
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,180
â™«  I who am different from others  â™«

261
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,960
â™«  Randomly over and over the thought embarrassed me  â™«

262
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,740
â™«   Beloved self  â™«

263
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,640
â™«  Having hidden myself  â™«

264
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,230
â™«   I hope my spirit which started now  â™«

265
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,700
â™«  can last forever  â™«

266
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,960
â™«  I will save myself   â™«

267
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,430
â™«  I will cherish myself more than anyone  â™«

268
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,200
â™«  I will also love the me of yesterday  â™«

269
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,420
â™«  I love myself  â™«

270
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,520
â™«  Don't tell me   â™«

271
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,940
â™«   that your past was miserable  â™«

272
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,010
â™«  I did not know how to give   â™«

273
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,150
â™«  the love that I only received   â™«

274
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,570
â™«  I was getting tired   â™«

275
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,980
â™«  of an indefinite wait   â™«

276
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,300
â™«  No one could do it instead of me  â™«

277
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,200
â™«  I'm going to be stronger  â™«

278
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,490
â™«  Even if I stay still  â™«

279
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,030
â™«  Even if things don't improve  â™«

280
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,900
â™«  I believe in myself  â™«

281
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,840
â™«  more than anyone else  â™«

282
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,760
â™«  Beloved self  â™«

283
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,610
â™«  Now I realize  â™«

284
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,120
â™«  I was hiding myself  â™«

285
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
â™«  Now I hope my spirit which started  â™«

286
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,470
â™«  will last forever  â™«

287
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,710
â™«  I will save myself   â™«

288
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,260
â™«  I will cherish myself more than anyone  â™«

289
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,060
â™«  I will also love the me of yesterday  â™«

290
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,620
â™«  I love myself  â™«

291
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,330
â™«  Many people around me    â™«

292
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,860
â™«   are praying  â™«

293
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,740
â™«  you will be happy  â™«

294
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,060
â™«  You can't get through this alone  â™«

295
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,850
â™«  We will achieve it together  â™«

296
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,760
â™«  Dear beloved today too  â™«

297
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
â™«  I love myself  â™«

298
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,480
â™«  Now I realize  â™«

299
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,020
â™«  I was hiding myself  â™«

300
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,210
â™«  I hope my spirit which started  â™«

301
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,450
â™«  can last forever  â™«

302
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,720
â™«  I will save myself   â™«

303
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,200
â™«  I will cherish myself more than anyone  â™«

304
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,990
â™«  I will also love the me of yesterday  â™«

305
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,280
â™«  I love myself  â™«

306
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,620
â™«  I love you  â™«

307
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,220
â™«  I love myself  â™«

308
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,060
 Thanks to bagy, Channel Manager of the Magical Notebook Team

309
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,800
  Thanks to Segmenters: pilar_velasquez, cgwm808 and sophie2you

310
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,080
 Thank you for loving Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me.

311
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,160
 I thought no one loved me all this time.

312
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,120

313
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,990

314
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,920

315
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000

316
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,110

317
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,970

318
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,900
 The fact that we were always together, and the fact that we'll be together. That was the only important thing.

319
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,600

320
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,500

321
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,920
