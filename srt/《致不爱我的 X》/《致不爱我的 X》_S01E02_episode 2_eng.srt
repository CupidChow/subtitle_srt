1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,940

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,210
 Han Ji Hyo

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,660
 Do Yeong

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,410
 Kwon Ah Reum

5
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,240
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,350
♪ That  you like my expression

7
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,880
♪ That you'll like me forever

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,210
♪ would you continue to say those things?

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,490
♪ I can't believe it if even if you tell me.

10
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,660
What is this...

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,770
That doesn't make sense.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,310
I love you, Hui Su.

13
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,380
Let's date.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,030
Daebak.

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,120
Me?

16
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,630
Why?

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,670
"That you like my expressions,  that you'll love me forever."

18
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,620
"Would you continue to say those things?"

19
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,030
"I can't believe it even if you tell me."

20
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,090
That doesn't make sense.

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,160
How was Kang Wuk able to sing this?

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,910
The lyrics weren't even submitted.

23
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,090
Was I dreaming?

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,570
Hello?

25
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,570
Are you awake?

26
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,370
Jeong Si Ho?

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,940
It's too early in the day to be playing around.

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,190
What is it?

29
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,400
 It's me, Hui Su.

30
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,850
Seonbae Kang Wuk ?

31
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,420
Yes.

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,100
  - Did you sleep well?   
 - Yes. I slept very well.

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,050
Did you sleep well?

34
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,410
To meet you?

35
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,580
Yes, I totally can! It's totally okay with me.

36
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,980
Yes. Yes.

37
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,400
Okay, see you later.

38
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,540
It hurts.

39
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,620
It hurts! It's real!

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,820
For real!

41
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,170
 The moment I answered the call, it was no longer important what would happen to me.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,180
Stop smiling. That would be better.

43
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,620
I didn't know something like this could happen to me.

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,590
Are you happy?

45
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,690
Si Ho. This isn't a dream, is it?

46
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,670
And what about that girl from earlier?

47
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,050
That Ju Yeon or what was her name?

48
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,080
That...

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,230
Let it be. You're going to manage it somehow.

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,520
Hey! That's usually how love happens.

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,350
All of a sudden and unexpectedly.

52
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,940
No need for plausibility when it comes to passionate feelings.

53
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,290
Ah, really?

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm going to ask him. Today.

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,800
There could've been some kind of misunderstanding.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,120
There could be nothing going on between them, am I right?

57
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,430
Yeah. You're right.

58
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,890
Anyway, how is my makeup today?

59
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,440
Too thick? Should I remove it?

60
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
I don't know. Go wait outside.

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,890
The boss is coming.

62
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,240
So petty.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,780
I was about to leave anyway. I'm going.

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,000
This is it. The place I was talking about.

65
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,910
It's so pretty!

66
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,800
Really?

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,690
There are many other nice places too.

68
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,630
I'll take you there.

69
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,400
Really?

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,900
I didn't know this could happen to me.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
Seo Hui Su, you've succeeded!

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,900
What was it? What?

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,020
Ah... Seonbae.

74
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,160
I would like to ask you something.

75
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,700
That...

76
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,920
Ju Yeon...

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,530
At the opening party you two looked really close,

78
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,740
so I was a bit...

79
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,040
She's only a hoobae.   (A junior at work or from school.)

80
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,430
She kept asking me to go with her.  It was so bothersome.

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,500
- Really? 
 - Yeah.  Really.

82
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,010
Hui Su. This is really my first time.

83
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,280
What is?

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,510
During my life I've never liked someone like this.

85
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,810
 Lies.

86
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,450
I mean it, Hui Su.

87
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,210
Seonbae.

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
Is it too sudden?

89
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm sorry. I was too fast, right?

90
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,160
No, it's not like that.

91
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,810
Then?

92
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,350
What if this is just a dream?

93
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,470
Even if it's a dream, it's good. It doesn't matter.

94
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,000
In my dream, you... In my dream...

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Anyway, no...

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,150
If it really is a dream, I don't want to wake up.

97
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,900
I don't want to see you die again.

98
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,150
♫  Open your heart, open your eyes  ♫

99
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,920
There. It's real, right?

100
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,340
♫  Let it all out, don't forget it  ♫

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,710
♫   Give me a sign of your love  ♫

102
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,800
 One, two, three.

103
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,430
Oppa. Why do you like me?

104
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,880
Hm?

105
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,420
Why do you like me?

106
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,910
You fell for me at first sight. That's it?

107
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,600
Who knows.

108
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,050
Is there any reason? I just like you.

109
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,650
Not like that. Be more specific.

110
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,560
What, why and how much you like me?

111
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,020
Hurry.

112
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,980
I lost.

113
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,280
I, you...

114
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,970
Me?

115
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,020
I like that you're good at receiving love.

116
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,780
Hm?

117
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,450
My ideal type is someone who is good at receiving love.

118
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,770
Really?

119
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,930
I knew at first sight.

120
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,010
People who received loved when they were younger.

121
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,970
People who exchange love transparently, without a sense of inferiority or pride.

122
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,220
People who are overflowing with love from their entire body.

123
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,690
That kind of person is my ideal type. And then you appeared.

124
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,060
I see.

125
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,800
 I felt like something was wrong.

126
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,660
Seonbae-nim, everyone. Goodbye.

127
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,720
- See you. 
 - Get home safely.

128
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,430
Bye.

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,310
I forgot my phone.

130
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,270
You know Hui Su and Kang Wuk?

131
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,010
There are so many things that are weird about it.

132
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,720
During rehearsal, Kang Wuk definitely said this,

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,710
"Ju Yeon. I love you."

134
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,940
I heard him say that!

135
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,880
It's possible I've just misheard.

136
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,750
You didn't mishear him.

137
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,410
It's true Kang Wuk has liked Ju Yeon all this time.

138
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,680
That's why he had Ju Yeon sit in the front row, so he can publicly confess his feelings for her that day.

139
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,170
Then did he change his mind that day?

140
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,780
Is something like this possible?

141
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,950
I know, right?

142
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,000
Ever since that happened, Ju Yeon left the club.

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,950
What kind of mess is this?

144
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,190
So that's why I asked him.

145
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,240
What did he say?

146
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,550
He doesn't remember.

147
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,740
Just like some bewitched person, he said he likes Hui Su.

148
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,020
What is she up to?

149
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,380
Turns out she's a total femme fatale.

150
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,880
This is incredible.

151
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,860
But those two really don't suit each other, right?

152
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,340
It was kind of random.

153
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,760
  For receiving this unbelievable love

154
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,180
 Seo Hui Su

155
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,700
 Would you please confess...

156
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,590
 and wanting to avoid the truth.

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
Aren't you cold?

158
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,340
Why are you sitting outside and spacing out?

159
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,010
Nothing. I just had some things to think about.

160
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,840
You always say that.

161
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,020
What?

162
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,530
That's what you always say when you feel down.

163
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,210
What's going on? Is your relationship not going well?

164
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,240
The thing is...

165
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,660
Do you remember that time? When I got completely drunk a few months ago.

166
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,380
I don't know. Because that didn't happen only once.

167
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm talking about the day when I drank soju from the bottle in your store.

168
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,980
That also didn't happen just once.

169
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,610
Do you have a death wish?

170
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,220
All right. What about that day?

171
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,860
On that day, did I go to my dad's house?

172
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,940
I didn't, right? I went straight home, right?

173
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,220
Don't you remember it?

174
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,030
  It's driving me crazy, for real!

175
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,000
  Jeong Si Ho.

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,770
  You better be quiet.

177
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,710
  Can you take me to my dad's house?

178
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,710
  What?

179
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,620
  I miss my dad.

180
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,650
  Can you take me to my dad's house, Si Ho?

181
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,730
  Will you be okay?

182
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,140
  Do you really want to go there?

183
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,390
  Did you make up with your dad?

184
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,520
  I miss my dad.

185
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,880
  I'm saying I miss my dad.

186
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,100
Since you kept saying so, I took you to your dad's house.

187
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,280
So, it did happen.

188
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,120
Si Ho.

189
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,720
Do I look like I grew up in a loving family?

190
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,190
What?

191
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,670
How do I look?

192
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,040
Do I look like a bright and loving person?

193
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,570
Did something happen to you?

194
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,830
I guess I don't look like it.

195
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,540
I'm not saying that.

196
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,370
It's fine.

197
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,880
But I can still date someone, right?

198
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Everybody's dating someone.

199
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,620
What's going on with you? Why are you not answering my question?

200
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,520
Oppa!

201
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,090
Oh, Eonni Hui Su was here, too.

202
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,650
You are so busy dating these days, Eonni Hui Su.

203
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,240
You don't come to the store to drink these days.

204
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
Do you know how sad Oppa Si Ho and I are?

205
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,830
Are you that happy dating?

206
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,720
  I wonder how it feels to grow up in a loving family.

207
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,710
Se Jin, it's been a while.

208
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,820
Did your class just end?

209
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,620
Oppa Si Ho is going to help with my homework.

210
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,120
Eonni, bring Seonbae Kang Wuk to the store. Let's all hang out together.

211
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,560
I will, Se Jin.

212
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll come by next time.

213
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,840
Jeong Si Ho, I'll call you later.

214
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,090
You two have fun.

215
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,030
When did I say I'd help with your homework? I just said you could come by since I'll be around here.

216
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,750
Please! I'm about to die.

217
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,210
I have to draw a portrait, and there's no better model than you.

218
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,040
I guess all the handsome guys are dead in this world.

219
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,960
Forget about it. Why don't you draw your face with a mirror?

220
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,570
- I'll get going. 
 - Wait a minute.

221
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,200
Why are you calling me suddenly?

222
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,080
I knew it would be like this.

223
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,180
Oppa, "Part-timer Park Se Jin."

224
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,710
Isn't this too cold?

225
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,770
Give it back to me.

226
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,700
One second.

227
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,820
Here you go.

228
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,240
Why did you put a heart on it?

229
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,750
  Our cute youngest♥

230
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,230
You're really playing hard to get.

231
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,170
Okay, I get it. 
   Park Se Jin

232
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,460
I'll leave my name like that. But please be my model.

233
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,050
Please, help me!

234
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,490
Okay. Let's go.

235
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,760
Let's walk together!

236
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,140
  The notebook wasn't a dream.

237
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,420
  This notebook definitely worked some magic.

238
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,270
I'll be selfish just this once.

240
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,050
  But because of it, I can't abandon this happiness.

241
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,680
Yes! Thank you.

242
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,390
What did they say?

243
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,080
They said I can come in starting this Monday.

244
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,920
That's great.

245
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,020
I didn't know dating could be this costly.

246
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,580
So, how much was that thing?

247
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
It was 200 thousand won ($200).

248
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,730
But still, Oppa Kang Wuk really wanted it.

249
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,680
Does he buy anything for you?

250
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Yes! These rings and necklaces are all from him.

251
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,160
Aren't those just from a street marketplace?

252
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,010
Hey, what's important is his heart and nothing else.

253
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,110
I'm going to bring this to his house in secret. He'll love it, right?

254
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,790
Sure, do whatever you want.

255
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,600
Why don't you date someone too?

256
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,350
Se Jin is a nice person.

257
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,960
She's bright and lovely.

258
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,740
Stop talking nonsense, and drink this.

259
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,630
You surprised me!

260
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,230
Sorry, I'm late!

261
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,500
Eonni, you came here today!

262
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,220
Yes. I'm going to have just one drink today.

263
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,480
I just saw your boyfriend outside.

264
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,240
Oppa Kang Wuk went to a different town to do a tour.

265
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
No.

266
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,470
It was definitely him with a guitar on his back at the three-way intersection.

267
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,930
You must have mistaken someone else for him.

268
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,990
I bet he'll be very surprised.

269
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,810
What? Am I drunk?

270
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,040
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

271
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,110
  That's how love works. It happens suddenly when you don't even realize it.

272
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,180
  You don't need a possibility in a spark of emotion.

273
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,530
  It's the first time. I had never liked anyone this much in my life.

274
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,130
  I'm being sincere.

275
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,810
  Si Ho. Do I look like I grew up in a loving family?

276
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,150
 Do I look like a bright and loving person?

277
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,220
  The secret of me receiving this ridiculous amount of love, the truth that I wanted to avoid.

278
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:07,160
  I wonder how it feels to grow up in a loving family.

279
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,040
