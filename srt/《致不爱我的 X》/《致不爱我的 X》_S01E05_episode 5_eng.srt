1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,020

2
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,870
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,940
 There are certain rules when it comes to bed scenes in romance movies.

4
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,410
 A handsome and cute male lead.

5
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:58,400
 Romantic space, warm lighting, bedding that appears to be bacteria-free.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,460
 And...

7
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,970
 The most important...

8
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,170
 kiss?

9
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,370
 It's a little different.

10
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,200
 What are you doing, Seo Hui Su?

11
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,030
Hey, what if other people see us?

12
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,000
Why? No one's looking.

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,730
Everyone's busy studying.

14
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,280
This is a public place.

15
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,410
So what? Hm?

16
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,400
Eonni.

17
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,400
I have something to tell you. Can I have a minute?

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,030
Oh.

19
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,550
What is that you have to tell me?

20
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,810
I was just saving you because it seemed like Park Jun Yeong was annoying you.

21
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,170
You're thankful, right?

22
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,940
Eonni, you should tell him if you don't want to do something. Why is that jerk Park Jun Yeong like that?

23
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,240
It's obvious that you don't like it, but he keeps doing it on his own.

24
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,400
Sorry. He's still your boyfriend.

25
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,420
No, you're right.

26
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,980
But how did things go that time?

27
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,540
That time? What do you mean?

28
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,400
- You said you were going to confess to Si Ho. 
 - Ah...

29
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,820
Didn't you hear it from him?

30
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,430
Huh?

31
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,390
No, I didn't hear anything.

32
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,090
What's this? You said you two were close.

33
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,560
I suggested that we date for just a month.

34
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,910
Really?

35
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,180
And so? Did Si Ho say he would?

36
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,340
Yes.

37
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,610
I see.

38
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,090
Half the battle is over.

39
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,530
Se Jin, you're amazing.

40
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,230
What are you saying? You're the one who is good at dating.

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,670
Either way, it turned out well.

42
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,970
Wow, to think that Jeong Si Ho has a girlfriend.

43
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,970
We're not at that level yet.

44
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,980
Let's go.

45
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,960
 Nuna, it seems like I'll be hanging out with my friends and get home late today.  .

46
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,910
 Go to bed first.

47
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,620
Why isn't he saying we should break up?

48
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,470
What's with this?

49
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,120
If we end things this time, it's really the end.

50
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,730
I promised Si Ho.

51
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,740
She's pretty.

52
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,410
 Is this Seo Hui Su from the Na Ri University Literature Department?

53
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,760
 Yes, this is she. Who are you?

54
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,900
 They say that you'll date anyone if they confess.

55
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,020
 Do you want to go out with me if I confess, too? I'm really good looking.

56
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,160
 Unplugged

57
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,080
What are you taking pictures of?

58
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,560
Oppa, do you want to go see a performance at the college this weekend?

59
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,410
My friend is in it.

60
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,000
Se Jin, about that month you talked about. That's not for us to date, it's...

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,350
Oppa, I know.

62
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,190
Can we just call it flirting?

63
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,390
So that we can get to know each other better.

64
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,500
Oppa, you only have to show me a very little bit,

65
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,360
even just 10% of the interest that you shower Hui Su with.

66
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,760
It's because I'm really not sure

67
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,160
if it's okay to do this.

68
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,190
I also feel sorry for doing this when I don't have feelings for you.

69
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,580
It's the last bus!

70
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,740
I'm leaving first. Let's talk later.

71
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Almost three weeks have gone by now!

72
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,570
Just put up with it a little longer. I told you I won't say anything else.

73
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,460
See you tomorrow.

74
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,780
Yeah.

75
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,160
Where?

76
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,240
All right, let's meet there.

77
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,610
It'll take about 15 minutes.

78
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,380
Yeah.

79
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,690
What is it? Hurry up and say it.

80
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,600
You called me in the middle of the night saying you're having a hard time.

81
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,450
 I heard that you'll date anyone if they confess to you . . .

82
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,390
What a crazy a**hole Hey, who is this?!

83
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,170
You were right.

84
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm planning not to use the notebook like you said.

85
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,110
Good. You made the right decision.

86
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,340
Just work hard at studying with me now.

87
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,800
With you?

88
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,780
Yeah. With me.

89
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
You don't want to?

90
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,820
No, it's not that I don't want to.

91
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,390
I heard that you decided to date Se Jin.

92
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
- That'sâ€”
 - I was a little upset.

93
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,430
If something like that happens, you should tell me first.

94
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,540
But you two look good together.

95
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,000
Se Jin is pretty, lovable, and kind.

96
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,230
And did you see Se Jin's mom at the resort?

97
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,770
She seems like a really good person.

98
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,390
Why are you trying to set me up with her?

99
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm just saying that I like Se Jin.

100
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,170
She's a really good girl.

101
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,630
I told you, it's not like that.

102
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,820
Forget it.

103
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,220
Speaking of that, it's been a month for you, too.

104
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,060
Then what's going to happen?

105
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,410
Why isn't he saying anything this time?

106
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,460
I'm not sure.

107
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,850
We usually end up naturally breaking up,

108
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,450
but weirdly, Jun Yeong isn't saying we should break up right now.

109
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,110
This hasn't happened before.

110
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,540
He said he still likes me.

111
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,610
So? You're not going to break up with him?

112
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,220
Huh?

113
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,500
Well, since he's not saying we should break up.

114
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,160
He says he still likes me, you know.

115
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,600
That's why I'm saying, you should have a good relationship.

116
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,950
A good relationship?

117
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,620
What is that?

118
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,250
Well...

119
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,100
You cherish, protect, and trust each other.

120
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,820
With someone that doesn't have anything wrong with them.

121
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,420
I really can't listen to this.

122
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,340
What?

123
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,350
I'll take care of my own matters, so you just do well.

124
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,930
You said you were so happy because you felt loved.

125
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,340
Do you regret it now?

126
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,630
Why are you acting like this?

127
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,880
You told me to date a good person who doesn't have anything wrong with her?

128
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,060
Hey, Jeong Si Ho. Why are you suddenly getting mad?!

129
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,400
- Are you asking because you don't know? 
 - I don't know!

130
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,560
What, I can't even complain to my friend as we drink beer?

131
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,310
Friend?

132
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,190
That's right, friend.

133
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,180
Hey, I'll say one last thing as your friend.

134
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,680
You're always doing something, regretting it, worrying about it

135
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,450
and then calling me and making me listen to stuff like this as your friend.

136
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,190
Now...

137
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,590
I'm sick of it now.

138
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,160
All right.

139
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,480
I didn't know you were thinking that way.

140
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,840
I don't know anything about what a good or bad relationship is, but...

141
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,190
But you...

142
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,560
You really can't do this to me.

143
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,350
I'm saying you're treating me really badly.

144
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,330
â™«  Before I knew it  â™«

145
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,120
I want to stop this, seriously.

146
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,440
â™«  you became more than a friend  â™«

147
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,630
â™«  My feeling which grew silently  â™«

148
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,700
â™«  won't diminish. Oh  â™«

149
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,540
Who is it?

150
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,360
You didn't even call me...

151
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,570
Is that so, my Nuna Hui Su?

152
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,790
The alcohol smell. How much alcohol did you drink?

153
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,420
Nuna, I want to do it.

154
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,420
We can't. I'm not feeling well today.

155
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,880
And how can you come here without contacting me?

156
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,000
Why? Don't you love me, Nuna?

157
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,890
What?

158
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,500
You say you love me, so why can't you do it?

159
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,630
I'm disappointed.

160
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,420
No, that's not it.

161
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,390
Let's do it.

162
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,640
2023.1

163
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,080
 Q: I'm missing my period...

164
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,840
 Jeong Si Ho

165
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,950
 Calling Jeong Si Ho

166
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,950
Seo Hui Su, get a hold of yourself.

167
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,730
You just need to take a test.

168
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,110
 Park Se Jin

169
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,180
Hello?

170
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,590
It's negative.

171
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,820
What a relief.

172
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,050
The heavens really helped me.

173
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,600
Did you tell Park Jun Yeong?

174
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,960
No.

175
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,740
You should tell him.

176
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,770
Because it isn't certain.

177
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,050
Then, when are you going to tell him?

178
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,350
You have to discuss it with your boyfriend.

179
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,500
Still, thank you for coming.

180
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,550
I was too scared to check alone.

181
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,350
I was really relieved when you called me.

182
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,070
 Seo Hui Su, Missed call

183
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,990
 Se Jin, I have a favor to ask you.

184
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,820
 What is it?

185
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,250
 Can you contact Hui Su just once?

186
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,400
 Something feels off.

187
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,860
 Ah... Eonni Hui Su?

188
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,960
 Sure.

189
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,380
 Thanks.

190
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,870
I know, right? It's good that I called you.

191
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,980
I'm thankful, so I'll treat you today.

192
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,480
No. I have something to do, so I think I'll have to go.

193
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,130
Buy something for me later, Eonni.

194
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,100
Okay, I got it.

195
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,390
Are you going to your part-time job?

196
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,180
Yes, that's right.

197
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,350
I see.

198
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,060
What about Si Ho?

199
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,170
He's doing well, of course.

200
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,410
Eonni, why don't you come to the store that much these days?

201
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,930
I'm busy these days.

202
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,930
Then, your relationship...?

203
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,800
It's going well.

204
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,780
Thanks to you, Eonni.

205
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,630
Really? What do you mean, thanks to me?

206
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,810
It is thanks to you, Eonni.

207
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,990
I'll head off first.

208
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,770
Bye!

209
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,880
Nuna, you're home?

210
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,080
You're a little late today.

211
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,470
Nuna, I'm hungry. Shall we order something to eat?

212
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,720
Aren't you going home?

213
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,210
What's with that? Do you want me to go home?

214
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,660
I'm disappointed.

215
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,430
I was waiting for you all day because I wanted to see you.

216
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,350
I told you that I'm not feeling good today.

217
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,310
Really?

218
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,210
I get it. You're being so serious.

219
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,900
 Korean Department Secret Group Chat: Hey, did you go back in there to do that thing again?

220
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,940
 In mating season, huh?

221
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:44,380
 She's something, too. Amazing.

222
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,730
What is this?

223
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,140
 Ah, fuck, seriously.

224
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,680
 It's tough pretending to like her, too.

225
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,060
 I realized it in that moment.

226
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,340
 The reason why the law of the notebook didn't work on him.

227
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,430
What are you looking at?

228
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,600
You piece of trash.

229
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,460
Fuck.

230
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,530
What are you doing right now?

231
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,030
Get out.

232
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm telling you to get out of my room!

233
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,360
 Because he doesn't really love me.

234
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,310
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

235
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,190
 All one-sided loves have something in common.

236
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,090
What? There's only 30 minutes left?

237
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,580
 You always work hard even though no one notices you.

238
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,000
What's this? Why are you so pretty today?

239
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,580
If you're at this level, there's no one who won't be attracted to you no matter where you go.

240
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,250
 Se Jin, I can't meet with you today.

241
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,890
 I just got a call from the boss, and someone skipped their shift.

242
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,850
 I'm headed to the store now.

243
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,080
 Sorry. I'll get in touch with you later.

244
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,050
 Then what about our date?

245
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,340
 We agreed to go on a date today.

246
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,280
 And there's one other thing.

247
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,930
It's okay. It's okay.

248
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,050
If Oppa can't come to me, I'll just go to him.

249
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,920
 Even though you know there won't be a happy ending,

250
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,560
 you still end up anticipating one.

251
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,440
 So have a good relationship. Where you cherish, protect, and trust each other,

252
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,520
 with a person that doesn't have something wrong with them.

253
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,580
 I don't know anything about what a good or bad relationship is. But... You really can't do this to me. You're treating me really badly.

254
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,610
 Ah, I really want to stop this.

255
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,650
 The reason why the notebook's laws didn't work on him is because he didn't really love me.

256
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,630
 It is thanks to you, Eonni.

257
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,650
 All one-sided loves have something in common.

258
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,800
 That you work hard even though no one notices you. And another one. Even if you know that you won't have a happy ending, you end up anticipating one.

259
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,940
