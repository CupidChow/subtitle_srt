1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,940

2
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,230
  Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,580
Jeong Si Ho, you're really too much.

4
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,330
Seriously, I told him the truth.

5
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,270
I really didn't know.

6
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,150
Why don't you believe me?

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,980
What do you expect me to do?

8
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,170
Hui Su?

9
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,090
Are you hurt somewhere?

10
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,530
No, I'm okay.

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,990
You hurt your leg just now. Do you think you can walk?

12
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm really okay so pretend you don't see me and go, Seonbae.

13
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,900
How are you okay when you can't even walk well right now?

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,750
This all because you confessed.

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Is my confession this unwelcome?

16
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,570
It's not that...

17
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,430
If you dislike it so much pretend it didn't happen.

18
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,420
What?

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,130
I'm sorry I confessed for nothing.

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Still, I'll take you home today since you are hurt.

21
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,940
  It was a scene I had always imagined.

22
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,890
  A scene that always comes out in romance movies.

23
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,490
  Hugging someone's waist and breathing in the night air.

24
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,930
  A scene riding a bicycle.

25
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,090
  A scene like I had dreamed of many times.

26
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,610
Seonbae, do you really like me?

27
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,440
Yes.

28
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,780
You shouldn't.

29
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,310
It wasn't written in the notebook.

30
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,410
What?

31
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,100
It wasn't written in the notebook, your confession song.

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,910
I understand so hold on tight.

33
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,480
  I realized in the moment my dream

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,670
  became reality.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,300
 ♫  You're the birthday wish you made ♫

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,820
  This is not something that can happen to me.   
 ♫   You're the wish upon the stars   ♫

37
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,830
 ♫  It seems all has faded ♫

38
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,370
  This is absolutely something that cannot happen to me.   
  ♫  and life got in the way ♫

39
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,600
  What Jeong Si Ho said was right.

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,700
Park Se Jin, open the door.

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,800
Park Se Jin, open the door!

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
Park Se Jin.

43
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,020
Eonni?

44
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
It's you.

45
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,260
Why are you coming into someone else's house so easily?

46
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,200
Get out.

47
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,670
You're the one who took my notebook.

48
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,890
It's you. You're the one who wrote in my notebook.

49
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,570
 Eonni, do you have any romantic notions?

50
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,310
  You know, should I call it like a fantasy?

51
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,270
  Things you want to do while dating.

52
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,030
 Me?

53
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,860
  I have a lot.

54
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,190
  I have so many that I don't know where to start.

55
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,830
  Just tell me one.

56
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,280
  If I had to pick just one, you know there's that kind of thing.

57
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,650
  When you watch a romantic drama or movie

58
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,130
  there's a girl on the back of a boy's bicycle

59
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,930
  who is hugging the boy's waist tightly

60
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,610
  while looking at the back silhouette of the boy

61
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,170
 and leaning into him.

62
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,810
 That sort of thing.

63
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,780
 This Eonni,

64
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,870
  is more innocent that I thought.

65
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,570
  Hey, you told me to tell you.

66
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,820
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,950
What did you do with the notebook? Hurry and give it to me!

68
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,780
Do you know what that is?

69
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,580
Why should I?

70
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,160
What?

71
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,960
I don't want to. I'm not going to give it to you.

72
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,650
Even if you don't have the notebook, Si Ho likes you.

73
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,820
That notebook should have come to me, and not you.

74
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,590
Se Jin, what are you saying right now?

75
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,570
Stop acting like you don't know.

76
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,090
You know.

77
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,740
Wish you two well? Say that you look good together?

78
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,150
Acting like the generous friend,

79
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,360
acting like a victim by yourself.

80
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,000
You're always the heroine.

81
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,230
You disgust me.

82
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,290
That's what you thought of me?

83
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,490
Have you ever liked someone until your heart ached?

84
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,020
Have you ever really loved someone?

85
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,150
You always depended on that notebook.

86
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,570
Se Jin, why are you acting like this? You're not this kind of person.

87
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,570
You're right.

88
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,180
I wasn't originally this kind of person.

89
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,140
This is all because of you.

90
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,440
This is all because of you.

91
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,610
Why does Jeong Si Ho like this kind of person?

92
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,490
Go.

93
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,590
Leave. Get lost!

94
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,430
  Am I the problem, again?

95
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,560
What are you doing? Aren't you going to sing?

96
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Wake up. Our performance is next week.

98
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,350
We can't lose out to No Track in viewership.

99
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,190
I know. Let's start practice again.

100
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,290
♫  Everything is brightly lit.  ♫

101
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,970
♫  Your face which just looked sad  ♫

102
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,640
♫  comes to mind  ♫

103
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,980
♫  Where will they go?  ♫

104
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,260
♫  The feelings which couldn't  be expressed  ♫

105
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,460
Sorry.

107
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,480
 Let's meet up later this evening, Seonbae.

108
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,370
I couldn't reach her for days.

109
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,600
 Park Se Jin

110
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,610
Park Se Jin?

111
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,370
What's wrong with you? You haven't been coming to the cafe, either.

112
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,890
Your face...

113
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,850
Is something the matter?

114
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,480
Well...

115
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,900
Are you crying?

116
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,100
The notebook.

117
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,190
Why do you have that?

118
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,820
Seonbae, did you wait very long?

119
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,640
It's okay.

120
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,540
Here.

121
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
Thank you.

122
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,180
Hui Su, by chance, you didn't come to say that you'll quit the club, did you?

123
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,020
It's not like that, Seonbae.

124
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,430
You haven't been coming out to the club room, either.

125
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,580
It's my fault, but...

126
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,240
I have something to say to you, Seonbae.

127
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,370
What is it about?

128
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,000
About the reason you like me

129
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,290
and

130
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,170
why you shouldn't like me.

131
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,960
What?

132
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,670
Did you write in this notebook?

133
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,350
You didn't, right?

134
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,670
Why don't you say something?

135
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,640
By chance...

136
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,580
By chance, did you write down to the last page? Did you?

137
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,700
Do you know what kind of notebook this is?!

138
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,910
Because of you Hui Su—

139
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,810
That damn Seo Hui Su, Seo Hui Su.

140
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,780
Stop talking about Seo Hui Su.

141
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,270
Have you read this notebook, Oppa?

142
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,890
While Seo Hui Su wrote all kinds of names, your name wasn't there even once.

143
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,230
Do you still like her?

144
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,810
Can't I

145
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,940
be the one?

146
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,680
If you like me is it okay to act this way?

147
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,550
So did you write my name in the notebook?

148
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,070
So

149
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,540
did you suddenly grow to like me?

150
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,350
Did I receive some benefit from the notebook, like Eonni did?

151
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,630
Stop playing.

152
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,600
There's nothing more I want to talk to you about.

153
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,830
I didn't write in it.

154
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,320
- What? 
 - I said I didn't write anything!

155
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,460
So to summarize what you're saying,

156
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,290
I like you because of the notebook and

157
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,910
I will naturally come to forget you now.

158
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,560
And because you wrote down the relationship with me as the last one,

159
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,910
you're under the curse of never being able to find genuine love.

160
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,020
Just think of me as a crazy person like I'm portrayed to be online.

161
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,810
That may be better.

162
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,580
I'm relieved.

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,020
What?

164
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,170
I said I'm relieved.

165
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,580
Even after a month passed, I still like you, Hui Su.

166
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,000
I guess the curse of the notebook didn't work on me.

167
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,830
Wh-What do you mean by that?

168
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,710
I've liked you even longer than you think, Hui Su.

169
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,380
What's a month? It's probably been over 200 days.

170
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,800
 No Track

171
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,020
 You know the concert early in the year?

172
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,370
 I'm close to the hyeong who plays the bass. So I was going to watch the concert.

173
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,520
 But I was running late that night.

174
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,480
I love you forever.

175
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,580
Love you.

176
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,040
Why don't the lyrics roll off my tongue, Hui Su?

177
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,150
It's not the 80s. What the heck is this?

178
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,740
 I thought of calling your name, but I just watched you since you were so into it.

179
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,660
Yeah, this is it.

180
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,790
 It was that night.

181
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm sorry! Did you come for the concert?

182
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,770
Yes.

183
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,040
Please fill out the registration form, and you can go in.

184
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,970
 It was the day I started liking you, Hui Su...

185
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,460
 I love you, Hui Su. Let's date.

186
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,830
 M-Me?

187
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,990
Hey, did you hear, Kim Do Bin?

188
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,220
About what?

189
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,230
The No Track vocalist got caught cheating.

190
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,340
 Anonymous: The club vocalist is a player, he's dating someone else right away

191
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,860
 Honestly, I was a little glad.

192
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,360
 I've been thinking about you ever since that day.

193
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,890
 But I didn't have your number or anything, so I had given up.

194
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,710
Excuse me, Nuna.

195
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,090
Dating a younger man isn't so bad, right?

196
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,880
 But our lines kept getting crossed.

197
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,640
 And then...

198
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,180
My name is Seo Hui Su, an aspiring lyricist.

199
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,350
I've been wanting to meet you. Come in.

200
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:45,650
 You joined our club. You have no idea how happy I was then.

201
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,610
I don't care about notebooks and whatnot.

202
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,440
I've had feelings for you for a long time.

203
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,880
Genuinely.

204
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,120
Se Jin, what's wrong with you? Are you okay?

205
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,570
I just wanted to erase Hui Su Eonni's name, too.

206
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,860
I tried to make that notebook mine.

207
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,610
I'm scared...

208
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,600
What? What are you talking about?

209
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,870
That notebook... I'm so scared...

210
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm going crazy because I'm so scared...

211
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,420
 Se Jin! Se Jin!

212
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,510
Se Jin, what's wrong?

213
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,410
Are you okay?

214
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,650
I'm scared, Oppa.

215
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,430
Please save me.

216
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm so scared.

217
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:13,610

218
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,370

♫   I was quietly gazing  ♫

219
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,370
 Was I the problem again?  
 ♫  at the silet sea   ♫

220
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,410
 When a dream became reality, I realized it.  
 ♫  It reminds me  ♫

221
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,360
 That this could never happen to me. Never.  
 ♫  of us  ♫

222
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,300
 Pretending to be a generous friend. Acting like a victim all by yourself. You're always the heroine.  
 ♫  The words you said   ♫

223
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,290
 Pretending to be a generous friend. Acting like a victim all by yourself. You're always the heroine.  
 ♫   like a baby learning their first words  ♫

224
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:37,390
 I've had feelings for you for a long time. 
 Genuinely.  
 ♫   I love you  ♫

225
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,360
 Eonni don't you have any romantic notions? You know. Should I call it a fantasy?

226
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,430
  Stuff you want to do when you're in love.

227
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,150
♫  Quietly  ♫

228
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,220
♫  burning fireworks already  ♫
