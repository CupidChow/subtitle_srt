00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,030

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,440
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me 
Episode 9

3
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,020
 Seo Hui Su

4
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,580
 Someone who knows my heart better than anyone else

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,620
 I wanted to be loved.

6
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,560
 In the morning that no one hugged me.

7
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
 Like a little child.

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,160
Seo Hui Su. Come out here.

9
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,550
What do you mean you're dropping out of school?!

10
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,440
How can you decide to drop out of school without talking about it with your parents?

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,980
I'm so embarrassed.

12
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,690
What would the teacher think of me?

13
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,650
You can't do this, think of your mom.

14
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,600
School doesn't suit me.

15
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,600
How are you going to live without having a high school diploma?

16
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,050
Dad, I want to study to be a lyricist!

17
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,000
I know I can work really hard at it.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,320
I have a whole plan for it. Can you at least hear me out?

19
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm just doing this...

20
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,770
because I don't think I'll be able to look at your mom later if I let you.

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,220
Drop out?

22
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,250
To be a lyricist? Then what are you going to do about college?

23
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,570
I let you be and... Are you crazy?!

24
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,190
Dad! Who are you?!

25
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,210
You always talk about mom. But mom isn't here, she's dead!

26
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,240
Mom's face?

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
I don't even remember it.

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,870
Stop putting the blame on Mom. It's all because of you.

29
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,680
You don't even care about me, so stop putting the blame on Mom!

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
It makes me mad!

31
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,890
 Grandma

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,620
How many times have you done this?

33
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,680
Hurry up and go home. Or at least answer your phone.

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,380
I don't want to.

35
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,140
If you're going to be like this too, just go home.

36
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,600
Hey this upsets me too. If you drop out, what am I supposed to do?

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,590
I've been thinking about doing this even before you and I got close.

38
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,250
No matter how much you do this, I'm not going to change my mind.

39
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,310
Hello?

40
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,510
Yes.

41
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,660
Yes she's next to me.

42
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,790
Excuse me?

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,510
Yes.

44
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,820
I understand.

45
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,430
Hui Su, they said your dad got in a car accident.

46
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,270
While he was looking for you at the street corner.

47
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,550
It's all because of that girl.

48
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,470
Your wife and you...

49
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,880
After she was born, for some reason, only bad things happen.

50
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,490
You guys shouldn't have had a kid that soon.

51
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,630
If Hui Su wasn't born...

52
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,070
 But do I even have the right?

53
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,560
 I've liked you for a long time.

54
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
 Genuinely.

55
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,480
It wasn't because of the notebook? It was real?

56
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,650
There's no way.

57
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,080
There is no way.

58
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,580
Get home safely.

59
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,670
Don't feel too burdened. I was just expressing my honest feelings.

60
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,650
Bye.

61
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,460
Seonbae.

62
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm not someone who deserves to be liked in that way.

63
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,500
I always hurt the people around me.

64
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,280
Why are you saying something like that?

65
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,350
 I'll say one more thing as a friend.

66
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,530
 The way you create a problem and then come to me to tell me about it and ask for help.

67
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,360
 I'm...

68
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,860
 sick and tired of it.

69
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,490
 They're right. I wasn't always like this.

70
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,120
 This is all because of you.

71
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,620
 Why did Jeong Si Ho have to like someone like you?

72
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,070
 Go.

73
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,180
 Leave. Get out!

74
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm just letting you know in advance.

75
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,360
Since you'll end up being disappointed anyway.

76
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,560
Does your friend think that as well, Hui Su?

77
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,410
My friend?

78
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,150
Yes.

79
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,510
The one you're always with. The tall friend with the small face.

80
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,310
Oh, Si Ho?

81
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,670
He probably does.

82
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,050
But even so, he's always at your side. Right?

83
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,510
You're receiving plenty of love right now, I guess you don't know that.

84
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,930
Don't put yourself in a corner like that.

85
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,240
You're trying.

86
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,190
I am?

87
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,280
Yes. You're telling me this because you're scared I'll get hurt.

88
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,290
You're trying your best to not be who you say you are, Hui Su.

89
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,430
So don't say that.

90
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,550
You're very lovely and

91
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,610
a good person.

92
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,320
Hey!

93
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,740
Oppa. That blood...

94
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,540
The blood!

95
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,980
It's okay, Se Jin.

96
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,380
It's okay so calm down.

97
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm so scared.

98
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,190
When did this start?

99
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,200
I was a little sick the first time it happened.

100
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,760
The thought would pass quickly.

101
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,110
But the more I tried to change the name in the notebook ...

102
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,360
the more my thoughts

103
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,330
and pain, got worse.

104
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,860
As if it's telling me to stop bothering it.

105
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,610
Let's tell Hui Su.

106
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,160
- We have to figure something out together.
 - No don't.

107
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,580
What would she know?

108
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,600
What if she gets hurt too?

109
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,540
Then what are we going to do?

110
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,270
You can't keep living like this.

111
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,270
At least now you're looking at me.

112
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,960
Honestly, I was more mad at you than her.

113
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,120
Someone who didn't acknowledge my feelings.

114
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,860
Looking at him forever.

115
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,220
I'm a better person.

116
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,240
I know I can be better than her.

117
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,740
I yelled at her and got mad but I'm the same.

118
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,340
I wanted to use the notebook's powers

119
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,190
to hear you telling me that you like me.

120
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,230
Hey, your fever—

121
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,180
I'm really okay now so you should get going.

122
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,910
How long are you planning on staying at a place where a girl lives by herself?

123
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,480
I'll be back tomorrow.

124
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
Let's try to figure something out tomorrow.

125
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,550
Okay?

126
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,770
Si Ho.

127
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm really going to stop now.

128
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,950
I hope you will stop what you're doing too.

129
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,910
I'll be back tomorrow.

130
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,760
Alright. Let's fix this.

131
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,090
I can fix it right now.

132
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,560
 Park Se Jin

133
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,900
 The person you have called is unavailable right now. Please leave a message at the beep.

134
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,120
Where is she? I can't even contact her.

135
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,080
Hey, Seo Hui Su.

136
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,080
Jeong Si Ho.

137
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,580
She tried to burn it and rip it but...

138
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,460
I can't believe it.

139
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,610
So how is Se Jin?

140
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,810
Is she okay?

141
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,280
Jeong Si Ho!

142
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,240
She told me not to tell you.

143
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,860
What are you going to do?

144
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,410
Don't you think this notebook's curse would be done if we complete it?

145
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,880
You can't do that. Give it to me.

146
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,710
Think about it.

147
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,840
If we write in it till the last page, it has to be done.

148
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,520
Then Se Jin will be okay, don't you think so?

149
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,260
I'll figure something else out, okay?

150
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,620
You said you tried everything.

151
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,660
I don't know.

152
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,660
But there will be something. There has to be.

153
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,600
Si Ho, there's only one solution.

154
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,610
You also know it.

155
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,600
Listen to me.

156
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,940
Then what about you?

157
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm going to take responsibility.

158
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,420
No matter what happens, I'm the one who made this mess.

159
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,790
I can't bear seeing Se Jin get hurt because of me.

160
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,510
Si Ho, go to Se Jin for me.

161
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,930
Go look after her.

162
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,580
I'm okay.

163
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,110
Okay?

164
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,680
Who are you going to write?

165
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,030
Jeong Si Ho. Thanks to you, I graduated from high school.

166
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,680
Looking back, I think that was a good thing.

167
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,830
I would've regretted it if I'd dropped out.

168
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,620
So who are you going to write?

169
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm learning to be a lyricist again.

170
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,460
Isn't that so cool? I'm not giving up.

171
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,480
So don't worry.

172
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,590
It's all going to be okay. Really.

173
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,960
♫  A frozen heart  ♫

174
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,040
♫  Who will kiss it?  ♫

175
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,650
♫  Saying that you're waiting for the spring  ♫

176
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,750
♫  Could you become the reason   ♫

177
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,160
 Who did I want to receive love from?  
 ♫  for those words  ♫

178
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,920
 My dad?   
 ♫  The wandering wind  ♫

179
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,860
 All these guys?   
 ♫  I can freely say   ♫

180
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,040
 My friends?

181
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:40,430
 Or... Si Ho?  
 ♫  The spring I'm waiting for  ♫

182
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,730
 Before I receive love, I wasn't ready to give love.   
 ♫  I'm here now   ♫

183
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,360
♫  Don't let me go  ♫

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,450
♫  I barely put my head down  ♫

185
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,330
♫  Give me the first greeting of spring  ♫

186
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:08,400
 I have to go back to the place where everything began.

187
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,860
 Dear X Who Doesn't Love Me  
  ♫  This heart   ♫

188
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,870
 I wanted to be loved  
  ♫  until the day it breaks   ♫

189
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,980
 Ever since that early morning when no one embraced me.

190
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,910
 I don't deserve to be loved like that.  
  ♫  I'll give you the gift of a blue romance  ♫

191
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,970
 Don't push yourself into a corner like that. You're doing your best, Hui Su.  
  ♫   Break me   ♫

192
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,940
 Who did I want to be loved by?  
  ♫  down   ♫

193
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,550
 Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Really.

194
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,990
