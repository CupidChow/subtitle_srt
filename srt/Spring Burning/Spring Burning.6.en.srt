1
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,640
I can't live like this anymore

2
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,200
Stop crying, stop crying

3
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,760
I can't live like this, stop crying

4
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,719
Alright, alright

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,079
You all bully me

6
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,040
You all don't treat me like a human

7
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,519
Enough, enough

8
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,640
Don't pull me

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
Alright, alright, go inside

10
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,799
Go inside

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Enough, enough

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,799
Stop crying, stop crying

13
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,000
So noisy, so noisy

14
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,840
What's wrong now

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,400
Look at her

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,319
I married into your family as a good girl

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,200
You all don't treat me like a human

18
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,520
Since we can't go on like this,

19
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,240
let's split up the family.

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

21
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,919
Your mother died, and now you want to split up the family.

22
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,960
I asked you to take care of Shanshan before.

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
I went to earn money to support the family.

24
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,639
But how did you take care of her?

25
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,479
She was either sick or injured every other day.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,719
Now the family is still scheming against each other.

27
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,479
Is it meaningful?

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,599
Did I delay your meals or something?

29
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,199
Third brother,

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,280
Have you lost your mind?

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,639
Do you want to anger mom to death?

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Is it because she doesn't like me?

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,080
So you have to kick me out?

34
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,840
Second Sister-in-law,

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
I don't mind you making money with outsiders,

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,879
I

37
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,000
But for just two dollars,

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
would you scheme against your own family?

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

40
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,280
What did you say?

41
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,199
Mom,

42
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,280
Do you think those villagers

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
suddenly raised their prices?

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,599
I, I

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Mom, Mom, Mom,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,680
I'll hit you, you ungrateful fool!

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,479
Mom,

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,439
It's all because of you!

49
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,080
How is it my fault?

50
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,759
You,

51
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,719
You can't have children,

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,560
so they all bully me.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
It's all because... Enough!

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,039
Shut up!

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,919
I'm not healthy, I can't have children,

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
so you want to dominate our whole family?

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
You want to control everything?

58
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,159
You, you, what's wrong with me?

59
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,560
You bully me, what's wrong with that?

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,199
What do you mean I bully you?

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,759
I

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,080
I don't want to live with you anymore.

63
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,360
Qi Shenggong, I don't want to live with you anymore.

64
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,080
Did you hear that?

65
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,159
She doesn't want to be with your second brother anymore.

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,960
She wants a divorce.

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,919
What will your second brother do?

68
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,759
Let her divorce.

69
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,400
I can still live without a woman.

70
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,319
Hurry, hurry

71
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,439
Go check on your second brother

72
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
You little fox

73
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,800
Was it you who instigated this?

74
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,759
Ever since you arrived

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Old Three doesn't even listen to me anymore

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,919
You can call me little fox

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
But you can't call me little fox spirit

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,879
Pah

79
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,719
I think you are a little fox spirit

80
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,000
Mom

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,000
Mom

82
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,560
What are you doing? Come here

83
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,280
Mom, listen to me carefully.

84
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,319
Don't you find it strange?

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,319
Sheng Feng is such a good person.

86
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,439
Why does he have such a bad reputation outside?

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Who says my son is bad?

88
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,680
My son is so good.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,519
Yes.

90
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,639
But before I married into this family, I heard

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,279
that he hit his ex-wife.

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,879
Right?

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,439
Sheng Feng has never been married, where did the ex-wife come from?

94
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,040
It's even more impossible that he hit someone.

95
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,480
Which witch is spreading rumors?

96
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,319
Just go out and ask around.

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,680
You'll know who said it.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,680
Tan Hong

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
I understand

100
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,839
No wonder the third brother said he wanted to split the family.

101
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,680
Then the family split.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What about your second brother?

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Mom

104
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,879
This is what I think

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
This big matter

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,879
needs to be divided into two smaller matters

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,279
First of all

108
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,040
whether to split the family or not

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,959
the family has lived together for ten or twenty years

110
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,399
splitting the family is not that easy

111
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,600
besides

112
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,600
Shanshan is your biological granddaughter

113
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,560
doesn't she still need your care?

114
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,959
by the way

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
what you mentioned before

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,639
forty yuan a month

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,319
Shengfeng said to give it as it is.

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,439
Leave me five pieces.

119
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,560
This is your pocket money.

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Mom is already so old.

121
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,399
What do you need pocket money for?

122
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,480
No need.

123
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,079
Let's look at the second matter.

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,439
Second sister-in-law,

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,399
She makes a lot of noise but does little.

126
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,000
She won't leave.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
Go inside and you'll see.

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,639
Shengfeng said this,

129
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,519
to make the second sister-in-law calm down.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
After all, a harmonious family leads to prosperity.

131
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,600
Always being in chaos is not a solution.

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
It's not a good way.

133
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,279
Yes, yes, yes.

134
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,600
That makes sense.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
College students are really different.

136
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,800
Little brat

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,279
Do you think I'm a burden?

138
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,360
Brother

139
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,360
Do you remember?

140
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,720
When dad just passed away when we were kids

141
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
The kids in the village bullied me

142
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,040
They laughed at us for not having a dad

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,759
It was you and big brother who stood in front to protect me

144
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
From that moment, I swore

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,120
I would definitely protect my family

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,399
from any harm

147
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,199
Now that big brother is gone

148
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,639
I only have you left as a brother

149
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,839
I just don't want to be a burden to you.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,319
I understand what you mean

151
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,720
I just want my sister-in-law to be a bit more peaceful

152
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,560
Don't make the house chaotic

153
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,199
Yes

154
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,319
Your sister-in-law likes to stir things up

155
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,720
But look at my body

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't have children

157
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,920
Your sister-in-law has stayed with me all these years

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
I have to remember her kindness

159
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,240
So in my life

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,079
I always think about giving in to her more

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,079
She is right, I am not successful

162
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,360
I am useless

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,319
You support our family

164
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,399
But I didn't expect that in the end

165
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,279
My wife would still scheme against you

166
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:28,759
Brother

167
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,639
You are a man

168
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,279
Don't think about those unhappy things

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,559
Since things are already like this

170
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
Let's just live our lives well

171
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
Life will naturally become smooth

172
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,519
Third Brother

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
You've grown up

174
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,840
And you got married

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Lu Ran is quite smart

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
And very easy to get along with

177
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,600
That's great

178
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,240
Yes

179
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,759
She is very nice

180
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
But she and I

181
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,480
Hard to say

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
What's so hard to say?

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,480
You were just advising me

184
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,159
Feelings can be cultivated slowly

185
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,399
Right?

186
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,919
I

187
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,159
I think she likes you quite a bit

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,519
These are all correct

189
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,679
What comes next

190
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,720
I'll say the first line

191
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,879
You write down the next line

192
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,240
Bright moonlight before my bed

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,159
You're back

194
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,320
Dad

195
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,879
What is Shanshan doing

196
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Mom is teaching me to write

197
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
So obedient

198
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,679
Where is Second Brother

199
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,399
He said he wanted to relax

200
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,639
Where are the others

201
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,399
Second Sister-in-law is probably waiting for someone to comfort her

202
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,440
Find a way out

203
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
Mom went back to her room with a headache

204
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,840
Mom didn't give you a hard time, did she

205
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,879
No

206
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,960
She was very easygoing

207
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,600
Really

208
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,679
Write quickly

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,759
This, this

210
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,360
This

211
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,120
That's right

212
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,360
That's right

213
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,960
It's already this late

214
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,519
Shanshan must be hungry

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,279
Second Aunt will cook for you

216
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,759
Write quickly

217
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,120
Next sentence

218
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
I raise my head to look at the bright moon

219
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,279
All these years

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,639
I rarely felt at peace

221
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,159
It turns out it was in this

222
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,960
strange man's house whom I haven't known for long

223
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm going to the shop.

224
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,399
Wait a moment.

225
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,600
Freshly steamed buns

226
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,720
Eat them while they're hot

227
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,559
The top box is for you

228
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,600
The bottom box is for the brothers

229
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,120
Then you don't need to bring me lunch at noon

230
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll come back to eat

231
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,080
Okay

232
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,519
I'll make you stuffed pancakes

233
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,759
Okay, I'm leaving then

234
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,799
Brothers

235
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,840
Put down what you're doing

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,960
I have a few words to say

237
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,440
Zhao Wei, come here

238
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,960
I seriously thought about it

239
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,159
I decided

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
We brothers together

241
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,159
will partner up in the future

242
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,840
to run this shop

243
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,000
Brother

244
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,399
I know we are laid off

245
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,000
but the shop can't use so many of us

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
Listen to me first

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Our shop used to have limited staff

248
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
many orders were queued up

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
many people couldn't wait and left

250
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Our shop has never lacked work

251
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,039
You all used to work at the steel factory

252
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,720
Now that everyone is free

253
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,639
I'll give each of you ten percent shares

254
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,679
Together

255
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
we'll take on the orders we couldn't before

256
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
we'll take them all

257
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Brother Qi, we'll just follow you

258
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,799
We don't want shares

259
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,639
Yeah, we don't want shares, brother

260
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,000
The shop needs people, and you have skills

261
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,919
I can't do it alone

262
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,440
I'll give you shares

263
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
I also want everyone together

264
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,559
to make this shop bigger and stronger

265
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,679
Brother

266
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,440
Okay

267
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,360
Brother, then we'll keep working

268
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Let's get to work

269
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,440
Thank you, Brother Qi

270
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,480
Thank you, Brother Qi, thank you, Brother Qi

271
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,399
Third brother's wife

272
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,480
Second sister-in-law

273
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,600
This is for making buns

274
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,759
Preparing to make stuffed pancakes

275
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,919
Second sister-in-law is going to cook

276
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,840
What are you steaming?

277
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,279
Steaming buns

278
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
There's no water left

279
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,039
It's not even steaming anymore

280
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,240
Let me see

281
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,120
Is it?

282
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Exactly

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
It really is

284
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
So, I'm telling you

285
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,399
When cooking, you need to keep an eye on everything

286
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,440
Second sister-in-law

287
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,279
I'll give you

288
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
I stirred it the wrong way

289
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
You come, you come, you come

290
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,720
I'll do it, I'll

291
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,919
I'll get my sunflower seeds

292
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Do you eat buns?

293
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,320
We're all going to split up

294
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
You eat meat, I'll eat sunflower seeds

295
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,240
Why does the taste seem off?

296
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,879
It was fine just now when mixed with the meat.

297
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,480
Third brother's wife

298
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,480
What are you doing?

299
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,240
Maybe it's too hot, the meat has gone bad.

300
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,240
You ate it.

301
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,839
If you don't believe me, sister-in-law,

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,400
there's another one here, try it.

303
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,559
Are you trying to get rid of beggars?

304
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,400
You're wasting money.

305
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,359
If mom finds out, she'll be heartbroken.

306
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,640
Just keep wasting.

307
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,599
Our Qi family's money,

308
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,039
will be wasted by you sooner or later.

309
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,200
If someone eats bad food, they'll have to go to the clinic.

310
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,440
Second sister-in-law, do you want some buns?

311
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,279
They smell really good.

312
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
Shanshan, are you up?

313
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,000
Mom

314
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,960
The third daughter-in-law is too wasteful.

315
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
You're stirring up trouble again.

316
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,359
How am I stirring up trouble?

317
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,559
You didn't see it.

318
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
Those fresh meat patties

319
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,400
full of meat filling

320
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,640
She said they didn't taste good and threw them away.

321
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,279
What

322
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,880
Threw them away

323
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,559
They're still in the slop bucket.

324
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,599
Take it

325
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,640
Mom

326
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,319
The third son's money

327
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,000
She spends it however she wants.

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,079
I just can't stand her wasting food like that.

329
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,640
This wasteful thing

330
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,000
Lu Ran

331
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,519
You come out here, Mom

332
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
Mom, we've already split up, we can't interfere

333
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
Move aside

334
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,880
Move aside, we can't interfere

335
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,079
Lu Ran, Mom

336
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,119
Mom

337
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,839
Lu Ran

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,799
Where are you going?

339
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,720
To the toilet

340
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,200
What did your mom eat?

341
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,000
Mom feels nauseous

342
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,359
Nauseous

343
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,799
Why?

344
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,920
Meat buns

345
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,079
Mom smelled them and wanted to vomit

346
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,759
Has your mom mentioned feeling tired recently?

347
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
Wants to eat something sour

348
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
Is she pregnant?

349
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,240
Okay

350
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,119
Okay

351
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,720
Go check on your mom

352
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,480
I'll make something delicious for your mom

353
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,960
Mom

354
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,559
What did you just say about the third daughter-in-law?

355
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,079
I noticed she didn't look well.

356
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,759
Why would I say anything about her?

357
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,799
I'm too happy to say anything bad.

358
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,920
Lend a hand quickly, this afternoon.

359
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,079
Make something light.

360
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,440
Mom

361
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,799
What are you so happy about?

362
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
The third daughter-in-law is pregnant.

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,079
The way she's been throwing up.

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,640
It's exactly like when I was pregnant with Sheng Gong.

365
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,920
She's pregnant.

366
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
That reaction.

367
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,480
It's definitely going to be a big, healthy boy.

368
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,640
No, Mom, Mom.

369
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
Maybe she just ate something bad.

370
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,640
I've had several children.

371
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,640
I know what I'm talking about.

372
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,200
Finally, the Qi family is getting a new member.

373
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,039
The third daughter-in-law is really capable.

374
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Even though you can't have children.

375
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,559
But the third daughter-in-law is pregnant.

376
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,119
You haven't given birth, you don't understand.

377
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,279
From now on, the dirty and tiring work.

378
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,240
Don't let her do any of it, Mom.

379
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,880
Wife

380
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,559
What are we having for lunch?

381
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
All you think about is eating.

382
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm hungry.

383
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,400
What's wrong with her?

384
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,599
Mom, your big mouth, you were too happy.

385
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
Forgot she can't hear this.

386
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,319
The third son's wife is pregnant.

387
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,279
Quick, comfort her.

388
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,160
Don't let her cause trouble for me, okay, okay, okay.

389
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll go check, I'll go check.

390
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
Mom, slow down

391
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,160
It's okay

392
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,000
Silly girl, don't cry

393
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,440
Mom

394
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,839
Did you eat something bad?

395
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know

396
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,839
It could be possible

397
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,400
Dad

398
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,240
Dad

399
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,200
What's wrong? You look so pale

400
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,240
Mom threw up

401
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,839
Exactly

402
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,880
She ate a bite of a spoiled pie this morning

403
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,359
I haven't had time to make lunch yet.

404
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,119
Why make lunch at this time?

405
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,599
There aren't any medicines at home.

406
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,640
I'll take you to the hospital.

407
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,839
Your mom is happy now, alright, alright.

408
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,640
Give birth.

409
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,480
They can all give birth.

410
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,039
Stop arguing, keep your voice down.

411
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,079
I'm the one who can't give birth, I'm sorry, okay?

412
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,119
You're not the only one who can't give birth.

413
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,720
Oh, heavens.

414
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,759
I'm begging you.

415
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,559
What do you want to do? What did I do to deserve this?

416
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,000
Stop crying.

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,240
Don't follow me.

418
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,759
What's wrong with second brother and sister-in-law?

419
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,640
Don't worry about her.

420
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,319
Sister-in-law.

421
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,000
This matter of yours right now

422
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,119
is the most important thing for us.

423
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,680
Most important.

424
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,279
I'll handle it, don't worry about her.

425
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
How is it?

426
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,240
Third brother, you're back.

427
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,799
The food will be ready soon.

428
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,119
Mom, watch over Shanshan.

429
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm going to the hospital.

430
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,359
This

431
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,039
What's wrong with your mom?

432
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:11,880
She's sick.

433
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,920
Sick.

434
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,759
You go back to your room first. I'll cook.
