00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,080
Walk slower.

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,900
Don't you know I'm feeling well?

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,100
Okay, Mom.

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,020
I'll walk slower.

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,900
You know,

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,260
you took so long buying groceries,

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,580
leaving me alone at home.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,140
I almost died in there.

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,460
It's all my fault, Mom.

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,940
Next time, I'll go fast

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,860
and come back fast.

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,020
You better.

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,020
Lu Ran,

32
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,140
you're finally back.

33
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,500
Who are you?

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,980
Who's he?

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,220
Mom,

36
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,740
he's Shengfeng's business partner,

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,100
a leader from the Shuguang Group.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,860
A leader?

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,140
Then come in for some tea.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,260
No need.

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,540
We have a business to discuss.

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,980
Lu Ran, let's talk over there.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,340
Alright, then. You two chat.

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,980
Go inside and play.

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,220
Go with Grandma.

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,020
Grandma.

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,540
You two talk.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,620
Let's go.

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,500
Shanshan, go play inside.

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm not very familiar

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,260
with business affairs.

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,220
Shengfeng just went to the factory.

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,900
You should go directly to him.

54
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm not here for him.

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm here for you.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,060
Me?

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,780
After you disappeared from college,

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
I'd been looking for you.

59
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,720
Later, I went to your home.

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,140
Your uncle said...

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,020
you were married.

62
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,420
With Qi Shengfeng at present,

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,700
there was a lot I couldn't talk about.

64
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,460
Lu Ran.

65
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,260
Was it because

66
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,780
I didn't reply to you in time

67
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,700
that you got angry, dropped out,

68
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,180
and got married?

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
No, Senior Fang,

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,820
you've misunderstood.

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
It's a long story.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,780
Lu Ran,

73
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
I know

74
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,380
you are a very strong-willed girl.

75
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,460
I thought about it seriously back then.

76
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,540
But now I regret it.

77
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,940
Senior Fang,

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,700
when I wrote that letter,

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,060
I did want to express
my admiration for you.

80
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,500
But what's past is past.

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,740
I don't have any other feelings for you now.

82
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,340
Lu Ran,

83
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,740
even though you're married,

84
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,580
if you ever need it,

85
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,340
I can find you the best divorce lawyer.

86
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Senior Fang, let me go.

87
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,460
Senior Fang.

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,700
What are you two doing?

89
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,100
- It's my business.
- Lu Ran.

90
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,260
You shameless pair!

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,540
- You shameless pair!
- Mom!

92
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,380
Mom, Mom, calm down.

93
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,460
What's wrong with you?

94
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,480
- Mom, go.
- You shrew!

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,740
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom!

96
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,780
- Come with me.
- Relax.

97
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,630
You're seducing her!

98
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,750
- You even came here!
- Go!

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,620
- How dare!
- Lu Ran!

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,460
- Don't run away!
- Shrew! Lu Ran!

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,380
Mom, stop, Mom!

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,700
- I'll beat you to death!
- Mom!

103
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,900
Mom!

104
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,180
Mom!

105
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,940
He's Shengfeng's business partner.

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,620
You're spouting nonsense.

107
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,460
I heard everything.

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,100
You even wrote him letters.

109
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,460
I've wasted my affection on you.

110
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,900
Is it for this other man

111
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,060
that you won't sleep with Shengfeng?

112
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,460
Mom,

113
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,660
I have no relationship with him.

114
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,580
Please calm down.

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,460
You have no relationship with him, huh?

116
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
You're rotten to the core.

117
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,980
Your parents died early,

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,220
and you were raised
without proper guidance.

119
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,220
I'm telling you,

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,580
you did bring bad luck to your parents.

121
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,140
Now you want to drive me crazy

122
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,580
with anger, don't you?

123
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,460
What?

124
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,540
What's with that look?

125
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,940
Mom,

126
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,020
you can say whatever you want about me,

127
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,380
but not about my parents.

128
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,940
So what if I said it?

129
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,980
You're in the wrong anyway.

130
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,300
Bringing your affair home.

131
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Can't I criticize you?

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,500
Ungrateful wretch!

133
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,660
The adulterous daughter-in-law
is hitting her mother!

134
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,780
Where are you going?

135
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,820
Fine, go find your lover.

136
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,580
Oh heavens,

137
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,660
what deity

138
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,420
has the Qi family offended?

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,260
Hurry, your dad is not doing well.

140
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,660
Lu Ran, faster.

141
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,380
Lu Ran,

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,500
quickly say a few words to your dad.

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,700
Dad,

144
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,180
Dad, what's wrong?

145
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,660
Ran,

146
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
I can't be there to watch you grow up.

148
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,140
You must take good care of yourself.

149
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,780
This is the only thing
your mother left behind.

150
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,620
Keep it safe.

151
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,420
Dad, wake up!

152
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,060
Dad!

153
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,620
Dad!

154
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,940
Dad, what's wrong?

155
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,220
Wake up quickly!

156
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,460
Dad!

157
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,620
Dad, what's wrong?

158
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,380
Wake up!

159
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,980
Dad!

160
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,860
Dad, wake up quickly!

161
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,380
(Dad,)

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,700
(don't worry.)

163
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,140
(I will take good care of myself.)

164
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,020
Mom, I'm back.

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,260
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

166
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,660
Where's Lu Ran?

167
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,500
She brought that man home openly.

168
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,540
I scolded her, and she ran off.

169
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,780
She hasn't come back yet.

170
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Grandma hit Mom with a broom.

171
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,860
She said Mom brought bad luck to her parents.

172
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,780
Enough!

173
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,900
What's wrong with that?

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,260
Was I wrong?

175
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,300
She even tried to hit me!

176
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,220
Mom,

177
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,700
since she married me,

178
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
she's been one of us.

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,460
She took care of Shanshan,

180
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,860
and handed over her business

181
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,780
to Second Brother.

182
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,780
She's been devoted to this family.

183
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Kindness begets kindness.

184
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,380
Shouldn't you feel a little moved?

185
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,780
What do you mean?

186
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,860
Do you mean

187
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,780
I was wrong?

188
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
That I'm just picking on her?

189
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,100
Is what you're doing appropriate?

190
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,700
How could you bring up her parents?

191
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,740
When Dad passed away,

192
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,860
you'd lose your temper if he was mentioned.

193
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,540
Why bring that up now?

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,660
You've gone too far!

195
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,680
For the sake of a woman,

196
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,260
you're bullying your own mother.

197
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,020
Let's eat!

198
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,220
Why did you come here?

199
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,020
I came looking for you.

200
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,460
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,020
I apologize on behalf of my mom.

202
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,260
Actually, Mom used to have a good temper.

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
Dad was a kind man.

204
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,260
After he passed away,

205
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,180
as a widow with children,

206
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,660
life wasn't easy.

207
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,020
Many people mocked her.

208
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,020
Then one day,

209
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,700
Mom yelled at everyone in the village.

210
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,980
Then the villagers quieted down.

211
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,460
She got used to solving things that way.

212
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,220
Later, when Big Brother and his wife died,

213
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,060
and as Shenggong took after Dad,

214
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,140
Mom became a bit more biased.

215
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,900
Mom's had a hard time all these years.

216
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,300
She worked hard to raise us.

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,460
I just want her to have an easier life now.

218
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,300
I know that the hearts of parents

219
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,380
are universally tender.

220
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,420
It's okay.

221
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,460
You don't have to tell me all this.

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,860
