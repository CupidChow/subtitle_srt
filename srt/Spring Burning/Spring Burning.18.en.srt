Let me see.

The factory your dad and brother

built with all their effort

is just gone now.

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,710
It's not exactly gone.

26
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,110
Just upgrading, that's all.

27
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,670
How isn't it gone?

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,670
All the workers were laid off.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,830
The machines are being replaced.

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,830

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
Mom.

32
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,390
Did Lu Ran say something to you?

33
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,990
What could she say?

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,110
She isn't even back yet.

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,600
It's so late, and she's still out.

Mom.

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,990
I'll go pick up Lu Ran then.

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,520
Where... where were you?

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,830

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,300
I'll make you something to eat.

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,070
Okay.

56
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,320
I didn't get what it meant.

57
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,470

your heart is hard and cold,

I never meant to yell.

95
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,680
These past few days,
I've tried to talk to you,

96
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,950
but you've just ignored me.

97
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,120
Yesterday, I accidentally

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,040
saw your notes on the steel factory issues

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
and your solutions.

100
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,320
So I...

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,710
It's because I understand your worry.

102
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,120
Thousands of workers mean
thousands of families.

103
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,590
You're afraid that

104
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,510
if we take over the factory

105
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
and another failed order happens,

106
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,950
those families

107
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,240
would suffer.

108
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,800
My little workshop now

109
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,510
feeds a few of my buddies

110
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,270
and keeps our family

111
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,560
comfortable.

112
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
That's all I can handle.

113
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,760
If something goes wrong,

114
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll do my best to fix it.

115
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
But...

116
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,870
These past few days,

117
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,390
you've been worried about the new orders.

118
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,520
I've noticed.

119
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,750
It's because you know

120
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,750
if Shuguang takes over the steel factory,

121
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
the workshop's orders will drop by half.

122
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,280
And right now,

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,750
the factory still owes us payments.

124
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,670
If this continues,

125
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,040
the shop will collapse.

126
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,830
Lu Ran...

127
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,680
I want the steel factory to do well,

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,680
but I don't want everyone
to take risks with me.

129
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,050
I proposed this

130
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,080
precisely because
I knew you'd think this way.

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm doing this

132
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,080
not just to save thousands of jobs,

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,960
but because I understand the policies

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,030
and the global trend.

135
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,280
I know that the factory
has a bright future.

136
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,640
But...

137
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
But if anything goes wrong,

138
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
do you realize what we'd face?

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
I know.

140
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm willing to
bear the consequences with you.

141
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,390
I met with Party Secretary Fang today.

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,470
The reason the Shuguang Group deal is stalled

143
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,280
is their refusal to properly relocate workers.

144
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,990
Their compensation offer is pitiful.

145
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,030
And after the machine repair incident,

146
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,350
it's clear they don't care

147
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,750
about the workers.

148
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,750
They just want the factory.

149
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,750
So Shuguang never plans to

150
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,110
relocate the workers.

151
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,110
Wasn't that a contract requirement?

152
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,520
I didn't realize how bad things were

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,870
for the workers

154
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,440
until I talked to Mr. Fang today.

155
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,230
If that's the case,

156
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,910
why don't we at least try

157
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,950
and fight for them?

158
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,950
After all,
you care about the workers, don't you?

159
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,830
Then tell me the specifics.

160
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,110
Here's the situation,

161
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,360
I already spoke with Party Secretary Fang.

162
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,550
We need to fight for a chance

163
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,200
to take over the steel factory.

164
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,680
Just say yes or no.

165
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,680
Why did Mr. Fang ask us to come together?

166
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,200
I just happened to pass by yesterday,

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,440
had a quick chat with him.

168
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,710
Suddenly, there's a new competitor

169
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,570
for the steel factory contract.

170
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,830
It turns out to be a nobody.

171
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,670
Qi Shengfeng,

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
you call that a company, huh?

173
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,760
Lu Ran.

174
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,630
This is a steel factory
with thousands of workers.

175
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,920
How can you compete
with the Shuguang Group?

176
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,320
With your little delivery gig?

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,200
Or your small-time

178
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,200
blacksmith workshop?

179
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,810
Do you even have the money?

180
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
Senior Fang,

181
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,230
no need to worry about that.

182
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,680
If we're sitting here,

183
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,870
we have what it takes
to compete with you.

184
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,310
Good.

185
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,630
Mr. Fang, Director Sun.

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,990
Mr. Fang, Director Sun.

187
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,230
Everyone, please sit.

188
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,230
Party Secretary Fang, Director Sun,

189
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,560
today's meeting is quite unexpected.

190
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,390
Factory contracting is a major decision,

191
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,590
so we're being extra cautious.

192
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,870
We appreciate your understanding.

193
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,030
Ms. Bai,

194
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,520
we've negotiated many rounds.

195
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,990
I want to know if the Shuguang Group

196
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,340
has adjusted its terms.

197
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,760
- We...
- No.

198
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,280
Not at all.

199
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,480
We believe the factory's future

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,520
depends on advanced tech

201
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,400
and highly educated talent.

202
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,200
We'll focus on that

203
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
moving forward.

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,750
Mr. Qi, what is your take
on the contracting?

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,840
Party Secretary Fang, Director Sun,

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,760
here's our proposal.

207
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,920
We've made the statistics.

208
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,470
After assessment,

209
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,160
two-thirds of the machines

210
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,870
can resume production post-repair.

211
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,750
As for the funding for the contracting,

212
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,040
we'll secure loans.

213
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,600
During restructuring,

214
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
we'll keep at least
two-thirds of the workers.

215
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,750
Once production stabilizes,

216
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,270
outstanding payments owed to the factory

217
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,520
will be collected gradually.

218
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,910
Those funds will prioritize

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,830
backpay for workers first.

220
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,670
The rest will be allocated to...

221
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,550
Dad.

222
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,990
Shuguang Group's modernization plan

223
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,750
would massively benefit

224
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,230
the city's economy!

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Why hesitate over

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,560
their pie-in-the-sky proposal?

227
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,240
Ms. Bai,

228
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,990
no father-son privileges here.

229
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,590
If two-thirds of the equipment is functional,

230
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,800
is Shuguang Group willing to retain it?

231
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,880
No.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
And we won't keep any workers either.

233
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Manager Fang.

234
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Then,

235
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,830
these contract terms are non-negotiable.

236
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,430
Wait, Dad...

237
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,870
Party Secretary Fang.

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
If we leave like this today,

239
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,350
our next offer won't be this generous.

240
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,320
Party Secretary Fang, Director Sun,

241
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,470
I'm sorry

242
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,280
for this outburst.

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,710
We'll reconvene internally.

244
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,710
Lu,

245
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
taking over the factory

246
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,360
isn't just about ownership.

247
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,320
Can you handle the issues?

248
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,150
We've evaluated every risk

249
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,200
and its solutions.

250
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,040
We're fully confident.

251
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,870
So what do you think

252
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,160
are the key problems

253
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,560
facing the steel factory currently?

254
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,950
Stable orders, stable production.

255
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,990
And the toughest challenge?

256
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,830
Laying off all the entitled workers

257
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,750
who don't do their jobs

258
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,110
to restore discipline.

259
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,400
Qi,

260
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,630
I know

261
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,990
your family has a history with the factory.

262
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,030
You don't want to see

263
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,710
such drastic restructuring.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,950
But remember,

265
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
understand what situation

266
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,630
you're really facing.

267
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,560
Party Secretary Fang, Director Sun,

268
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,200
we're fully aware

269
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,630
of the difficulties ahead.

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,870
As you said,

271
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,750
I have a history with the factory,

272
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,790
and emotional ties.

273
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,360
I know what it means

274
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
to Shantou Town.

275
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,520
And I know what reforms

276
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,830
would suit it best.

277
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,590
We're not stuck in the past.

278
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,820
My workshop's partnered

279
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,630
with city universities for years.

280
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,710
We have top graduates as Shuguang does.

281
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,030
And we keep learning,

282
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,030
improving,

283
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,160
and pursuing innovation.

284
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Please trust us.

285
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,870
Why keep staring at me?

286
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,830
Admiring your handsome face.

287
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,630
I think my earlier efforts,

288
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,630
together with

289
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,950
your rousing speech today,

290
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,800
made our bid perfect.

291
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,670
Did you see it?

292
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,040
Party Secretary Fang kept nodding.

293
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,520
That's a sense of recognition.

294
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,110
I spoke from the heart.

295
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,520
With the factory's severe issues,

296
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Shuguang Group's offer is decent.

297
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,190
Yet Director Sun and Mr. Fang

298
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,350
hesitate

299
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,080
because they can't bear massive layoffs.

300
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,680
Director Sun and Party Secretary Fang

301
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,440
are enduring pressure

302
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,710
to protect workers' livelihoods.

303
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
What a painstaking care.

304
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,790
Manager Fang,

305
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,670
even though you're close to
Party Secretary Fang,

306
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,040
I still hope you won't lose control

307
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,630
during negotiations.

308
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,590
You're representing Shuguang's reputation.

309
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
We should immediately

310
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,710
halt business with Qi Shengfeng

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,230
and stop sourcing from him.

312
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,950
Fang Hongyang, wake up!

313
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,320
If the steel factory doesn't operate,

314
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,800
where will we get the missing parts?

315
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,950
Should we shut down Shuguang's production?

316
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,590
Breaching the contract means
paying penalties!

317
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,390
Chairwoman Bai values

318
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,830
your relationship with your father.

319
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,280
You should put more effort into that.

320
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,080
Thanks for the advice, Ms. Bai.

321
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,830
I know what to do now.

322
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,320
Brother Qi, are we taking over
the steel factory?

323
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,750
- Yeah, I heard of that.
- Yes.

324
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,720
That's amazing!

325
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,240
Brother Qi, we finally get to...

326
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,670
Call the person in charge out!

327
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,150
What's going on outside?

328
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,280
Brother Qi, there's trouble outside.

329
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,080
Should we call the police?

330
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,230
No need.

331
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,920
Let's deal with it.

332
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
Just don't kill anyone.

333
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,820
- Got it.
- Alright.

334
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,720
Okay.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
Hey, stop pushing!

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,920
Don't act recklessly!

337
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,870
Talk properly!

338
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,120
Stop shoving me!

339
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
I said don't push me!

340
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,440
What, you wanna fight?

341
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,360
Stop crowding in!

342
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,030
Don't move!

343
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,950
Starting a fight, huh?

344
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
What are you doing?

345
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,720
Don't force your way in!

346
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,480
Look at you.

347
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,140
If Qi Shengfeng hadn't gone easy on you,

348
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,310
once the police got involved,

349
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,560
how would you have handled it?

350
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,150
I never expected

351
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,350
you'd stoop this low.

352
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,150
Dad, I really don't get it.

353
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,450
For something as big
as acquiring the factory,

354
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,750
how could you trust Qi Shengfeng

355
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,480
over me and the Shuguang Group?

356
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,240
Do you still trust Qi Shengfeng?

357
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,110
Am I your son or is he?

358
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,320
Outrageous!

359
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,990
You...

360
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,390
If you had half his strategic mind,

361
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,590
I wouldn't be this stressed!

362
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
If the Shuguang Group

363
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,800
would keep the workers,

364
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,910
would I be forced to do this?

365
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,800
Then make him your son!

366
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,590
Do you think Qi Shengfeng

367
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,520
will take over the factory smoothly?

368
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,270
Dream on!

369
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,760
Outrageous!

370
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,590
Fang Hongyang's lost his mind,

371
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,870
sending thugs to wreck your workshop!

372
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,910
It's fine. I'm not hurt.

373
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,320
Then why hide your arm?

374
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,720
Really, it's nothing.

375
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,910
He clearly wants to sabotage production

376
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,720
so we can't raise funds

377
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,960
for the factory contracting.

378
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
You must be careful now.

379
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,280
A company like the Shuguang Group

380
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,760
wouldn't do this.

381
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,510
This is Fang Hongyang's doing.

382
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,830
He resents us being together.

383
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,590
Because you two were...

384
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,870
classmates?

385
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,110
I never told you about Fang Hongyang.

386
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,560
I should explain properly today.

387
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,160
No need. Don't force yourself.

388
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,150
I didn't overthink it.

389
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,590
Then forget it.

390
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,400
No, you should know.

391
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,670
Back in school,

392
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,430
he was my senior,

393
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,190
top grades,

394
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,430
strong leadership.

395
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,480
And he's Student Council President.

396
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,760
I admired him.

397
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,160
That's all.

398
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,080
And?

399
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,760
That's literally it.

400
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Especially after what he just did...

401
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,480
I misjudged him completely.

402
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
"Not hurt", huh?

403
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,320
Wait.

404
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,710
This...

405
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,280
Let me get the meds.

406
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,320
Don't bother.

407
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,870
Just scratches.

408
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,550
They came with twenty-some men today.

409
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,160
I charged at them first

410
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,270
and took on five alone!

411
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,480
If the police hadn't come,

412
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,830
I'd have wiped them all out.

413
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,670
Now you're showing off?

414
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,640
Ow!

415
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,430
You hit harder than they did.

416
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,960
Does it really hurt?

417
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,040
Kidding.

418
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,110
Why hit me again?

419
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,320
Ma Qiang, how's your injury?

420
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,830
Take a few days off to rest?

421
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm fine, Brother Qi.

422
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,190
Just a minor wound.

423
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,200
See?

424
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,120
No big deal.

425
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,240
I can't handle heavy work

426
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,590
for a few days,

427
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,670
but I can still help the guys out.

428
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,070
You and Ran are fighting the big battles.

429
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,870
We can't slack off on our work.

430
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,520
Really, I'm good.

431
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,270
- Ms. Bai.
- I'm okay.

432
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,240
What brings you here?

433
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,040
- No worries.
- I'm here to see Mr. Qi.

434
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,800
You focus on the contracting.

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
Brother Qi.

436
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,310
Ms. Bai.

437
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,720
What's the purpose this time?

438
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,390
I'm not as crude as Fang Hongyang.

439
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,880
When we worked together before,

440
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
I never imagined you'd become

441
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,190
Shuguang Group's competitor.

442
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,590
Speak plainly.

443
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,190
You started as a blacksmith,

444
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,240
built this small mold factory from scratch.

445
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,800
You're very capable.

446
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,540
We've collaborated before,

447
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,760
I trust your abilities.

448
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,040
We don't have to be competitors.

449
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,670
We could work together.

450
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,720
On behalf of the Shuguang Group,

451
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,760
I invite you to become our Vice President.

452
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,720
Vice President?

453
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,240
I see great potential in you.

454
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,790
After joining,

455
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,830
you'd still oversee

456
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,870
the factory acquisition and restructuring.

457
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,150
So you're saying...

458
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,960
I could develop the factory

459
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,390
my own way?

460
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,000
Absolutely.

461
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
Once you're in charge.

462
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Last time you promised to keep workers,

463
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,320
then went back on your word.

464
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,830
If I become responsible,

465
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,350
and you reverse my decisions later,

466
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,080
what then?

467
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
We need to upgrade the machines

468
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
and streamline the workforce.

469
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,400
But if you want to

470
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,320
bring your men in,

471
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,120
I'll allow it.

472
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
I didn't take over the factory

473
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,150
just to feed me and my crew.

474
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,360
If you insist on

475
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,000
laying off all workers,

476
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,670
I'll have to decline.

477
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,510
The Shuguang Group will take over

478
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,280
Shantou Town Steel factory.

479
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,240
Don't decide just yet.

480
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,560
You still have a choice.

481
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,440
Once we acquire the steel factory

482
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,560
and upgrade the machinery,

483
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,000
your little workshop here

484
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,870
won't be needed anymore.

485
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,360
Well then, Ms. Bai,

486
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,520
we'll see about that.

487
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,150
I suggest you don't push your luck.

488
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
Hey, guys!

489
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,390
Ran.

490
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,870
- Come get some melon!
- Ran.

491
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,480
- Hey, Ran.
- Ran.

492
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
- Let me help.
- Watermelon!

493
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,660
- Fresh melon!
- Melon!

494
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,470
Thanks, Ran!

495
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
What's Shengfeng doing inside?

496
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Hi, Ran.

497
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,070
- Hi, Ran.
- Ms. Bai from the Shuguang Group

498
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,560
came to talk with him.

499
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,310
Work stuff! Just work!

500
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,520
Ran, it's work talk!

501
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,440
Business! Seriously!

502
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,360
It's just work.

503
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,230
This melon looks

504
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
so sweet.

505
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,030
Why are you here?

506
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,590
Think it over carefully.

507
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,110
Come find me when you decide.

508
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,390
Enjoy the melon, guys.

509
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,960
Thanks, Ran.

510
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,630
What to think over?

511
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,950
Nothing.

512
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,800
So sweet.

513
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,240
- Ran!
- Ran!

514
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,160
Wait, don't go, Ran!

515
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,280
Have some melon!

516
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,190
- Lu Ran!
- Wait, why'd Ran

517
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,830
leave so suddenly?
