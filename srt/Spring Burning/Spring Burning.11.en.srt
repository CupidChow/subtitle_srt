=Episode 11=

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,200
If you truly care about her,

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,720
you should let her go.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,760
Don't chain her to that small place.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,870
Lu Ran's future

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,920
should be decided by herself.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,350
Mr. Fang,

25
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,230
we're here today to sign the contract.

26
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,150
Right.

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,310
To sign the contract.

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,640
But this contract

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
is also related to Lu Ran, right?

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,030
If it weren't for Director Sun,

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,230
we wouldn't have met.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
If it weren't for Lu Ran,

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,760
this contract

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,230
wouldn't have been signed so easily.

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,720
What do you mean, Manager Fang?

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,670
You need

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,270
to divorce Lu Ran on your own

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
and let her leave you.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,230
After that, all the orders
from Shuguang Group

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,350
will be yours.

41
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,920
Manager Fang, are you suggesting

42
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,760
that I use Lu Ran as a condition

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,480
to exchange orders with you?

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,920
Mr. Qi,

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,280
business is business.

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
You need to be smart.

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,950
With my help, your career
will get bigger and stronger.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,950
You'll find anyone you want later.

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Manager Fang,

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
Lu Ran isn't something

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,820
that can be traded
for anything in my heart.

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,640
If our future cooperation

53
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,320
depends on using Lu Ran
as a precondition,

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
then I'd rather not take this order.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,890
(Learn to Teach,
Uphold Integrity to Lead)

56
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,950
So now

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,830
what would make you feel happy?

58
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,790
To study.

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,600
I need to go back to school.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,660
(Lean Production. Promote Efficiency)

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
Director Sun,

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,390
I'm here today to confirm

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,680
whether we'll continue

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,390
producing the next batch of goods.

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,710
Shengfeng,

66
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,830
of course, we'll produce.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
But look, the factory...

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,900
Director Sun.

69
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,950
Teacher Zhang, you're here.

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,650
Why did our mechanical class students

71
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,710
suddenly get barred from internships?

72
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,910
Here's the thing, Teacher Zhang.

73
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,150
The factory is very busy now.

74
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm overwhelmed every day.

75
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,350
I still have to arrange for students,

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,180
workplaces,

77
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,470
and workers to supervise them.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
There is no time for that.

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,750
But when our students graduate,

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,920
they can't have never touched a machine.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
What does that...

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,350
have to do with me?

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,000
What if the students
only come once a week?

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Teacher Zhang, I was rude before.

85
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,590
You go back for now.

86
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,040
Let me think about it, okay?

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
Okay, thank you.

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Thank you.

89
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,790
Director Sun,

90
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,080
about the payment...

91
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,190
Shengfeng,

92
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,120
you know how it is.

93
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,150
We've known each other for so long.

94
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,320
Consider this a favor to me, okay?

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,750
If you need help with anything else,

96
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,880
just tell me.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,480
Not asking me for money

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,030
would be the biggest help.

99
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,880
Let me refill your water.

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
You walk so quietly

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,200
and scare me.

102
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,720
Is Shenggong here?

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
Not yet.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Here's the ledger Ma Qiang sent
for the workshop.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,030
I've checked it

106
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,110
since I'm free.

107
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,390
You can review it later.

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,880
The recent orders in the workshop

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,830
have kept everyone busy.

110
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,590
Especially with

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,270
the big order from Shuguang Group,

112
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,720
you have to assign tasks fairly.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
More work, more pay.

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Don't let them toil

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,510
without extra compensation.

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,510
- Lu Ran...
- I've figured out

117
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,030
how to distribute pay based on labor.

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
It's all written here.

119
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,390
Cross-check it with the ledgers

120
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,310
when you have time.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
Okay.

122
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,990
Lu Ran,

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,380
from now on, don't worry
about the workshop's affairs.

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
Just focus on studying.

125
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,230
Getting into college is what matters.

126
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,670
Fine.

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,710
I'll study hard,

128
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,030
get into college,

129
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,870
and go to Beijing!

130
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,030
Why is she angry?

131
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,830
Isn't Beijing great?

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Shenggong!

133
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,230
Why are you here?

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
You're blood brothers,

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,870
yet they live in this big house

136
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,790
without you.

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,960
Quiet.

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,270
It's not their fault.

139
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,800
I chose not to come.

140
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,080
When will you take me to town?

141
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,360
I can't stay in the village anymore.

142
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
Everyone mocks me.

143
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Mom is still furious now.

144
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,030
Wait for her to calm down.

145
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,950
Give me time, okay?

146
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,240
Mom loves you most.

147
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,470
Talk to her!

148
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
She loves me,

149
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,070
but this is different.

150
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,270
I need time.

151
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,870
Wait until she cools off.

152
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,790
Is that okay?

153
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,800
Qi Shenggong, don't forget.

154
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Without my help,

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,270
could you handle the jobs

156
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,160
Lu Ran introduced?

157
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
Could you earn money?

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,880
Lower your voice, please.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,640
If Mom hears, she'll tear you apart.

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm afraid of her?

161
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,030
Go quickly!

162
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,950
I'll visit you in a few days.

163
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,310
Go.

164
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Mom,

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
let me help.

166
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,470
I've been running around alone.

167
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Hurry up.

168
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,040
Hurry.

169
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,760
Chop the scallions

170
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,390
and stir-fry the vegetables.

171
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,310
I'll take a break.

172
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,230
Okay.

173
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,350
It's so hot.

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,080
Mom!

175
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,790
Shengfeng!

176
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Shenggong!

177
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm here.

178
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,560
You're back!

179
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,590
Mom.

180
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,630
It's raining. Did you get soaked?

181
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,950
Shenggong.

182
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,830
What a handsome man.

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,350
Big sunglasses.

184
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,400
See?

185
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,960
After leaving Tan Hong,

186
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,320
my son is doing great.

187
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,390
Next,

188
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,200
let's find a wife much better than her.

189
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,470
Mom.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,920
Shenggong.

191
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,360
Your outfit is sharp.

192
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,280
So handsome.

193
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,870
Stay for dinner.

194
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,990
Almost ready.

195
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,310
Keep busy.

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Shenggong,

197
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,400
what's with this style?

198
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,390
Listen,

199
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,320
now that you're earning,

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
you need to plan

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
and save some money.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,110
Enough.

203
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,990
So only you can buy gifts for your wife?

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,550
My son is filial,

205
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,520
buying gifts for his mom. Jealous?

206
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
He's jealous. Ignore him.

207
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,840
- You look thinner.
- Yes, I am.

208
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Living alone is hard.

209
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,790
I'll find you

210
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,830
a good wife later.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Mom, I'm concentrating on work now.

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
Don't think about that.

213
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,910
Alright.

214
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,920
Tell me

215
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,510
about your big achievements.

216
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,720
Let me hear.

217
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Shanshan!

218
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,510
Uncle,

219
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,920
why are you dressed like a peacock?

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
Do you miss me?

221
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Yes.

222
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,270
Uncle, you cut your hair.

223
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,710
It looks better.

224
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,200
Shanshan, you're so sweet.

225
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,360
Alright.

226
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,630
Let's go inside.

227
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,530
Look how well I cleaned the room.

228
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,320
- Here, Mom.
- Come on.

229
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,550
- I'll help Lu Ran.
- Right, go help.

230
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,500
Dinner's ready.

231
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,350
- You go.
- Let's go.

232
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,360
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,920
So happy?

234
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,160
Shenggong's here. Of course, I'm happy.

235
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,830
Mom missed him.

236
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,350
Let them talk.

237
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,590
Focus on your studies recently.

238
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,630
Mom nags, but you can ignore her.

239
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,960
After all, to her,
I'm just a daughter-in-law.

240
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,920
If I don't work,

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,350
she'll get mad.

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Why did you two leave me

243
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,400
outside listening to Uncle's stories?

244
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,510
Today, I made your favorite dried fish

245
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,680
to make it up to you.

246
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
- It'll be done soon.
- Go.

247
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,830
Go there.

248
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,670
Let me help.

249
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,120
Chop this.

250
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,040
Okay.

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,150
It's really different now.

252
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,360
I manage so many people now.

253
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Those deliverymen line up
at the company gate.

254
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,270
So impressive.

255
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,320
- Here it is.
- It's true.

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
Really?

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,230
Okay, let's eat.

258
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,590
Here.

259
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,470
Alright, it's all your favorites.

260
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,030
Ran, last month's share is here.

261
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,950
Count it.

262
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,350
This... Shenggong,

263
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,440
this is too much.

264
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,350
Just take it.

265
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,950
She introduced some companies to me.

266
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,070
I've also

267
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,630
found new ones.

268
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,400
Future earnings will be greater.

269
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,870
You're so capable.

270
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,630
Any girl marrying Shenggong

271
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,160
would be lucky.

272
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,590
Come, give me the cup.

273
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
Here.

274
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's drink.

275
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
Pour it.

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,400
Come on, Mom.

277
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,790
Just a little.

278
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,470
- Good wine.
- Enough.

279
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,310
Come on, Shenggong, let's toast.

280
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,910
- Mom.
- Okay.

281
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,830
Good.

282
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,880
Let's eat.

283
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,280
Eat.

284
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,310
Here.

285
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,360
Have some more, Mom.

286
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,740
(Enlistment Honor)

287
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,430
Shenggong,

288
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
since business is going well,

289
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,590
stop splurging.

290
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,830
Save some money for your future.

291
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,440
It seems like you're elder.

292
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,400
Let me tell you,

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,950
after divorcing,

294
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
I realized how comfortable

295
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,590
and happy life is when I'm untouched.

296
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,880
So free.

297
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Mom asked me to persuade you

298
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,830
to take another wife.

299
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
Look at me.

300
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,360
I've got nothing now.

301
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,040
The divorce

302
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,560
scandalized the village.

303
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,590
Even with this business,

304
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,520
people

305
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,950
in the village

306
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,870
still mock me.

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
Don't consider it, okay?

308
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,630
What about you and Ran?

309
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,160
Still a fake marriage?

310
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,710
What's going on?

311
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,550
You like her, right?

312
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,470
She doesn't want to?

313
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,550
Yes,

314
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
I really like her.

315
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
But the priority

316
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,750
is to help her finish college.

317
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,840
The rest can wait.

318
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,110
You're dumb.

319
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,870
If she goes to college,

320
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,870
will she come back to you?

321
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,240
Shenggong,

322
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,590
whether she returns isn't important.

323
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,400
What's important is

324
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,870
her future is free.

325
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,750
Her life should be decided by herself.

326
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,470
Shengfeng, you're blind.

327
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,630
She pretended to die

328
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,510
to escape marriage

329
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,440
because she's a college student, right?

330
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,990
Now that she has finally settled down,

331
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,800
you support her leaving?

332
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,950
Listen to me,

333
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,750
just get things done

334
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,830
to lock her down.

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,120
I want Lu Ran

336
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,590
to follow her dreams.

337
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,750
That's what's best for her.

338
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,990
I hope she has a good life.

339
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,280
Anyway, if Mom knew

340
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,080
your thoughts,

341
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,200
she'd tear this place down.

342
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,800
Don't tell her.

343
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,200
Let me sleep with you tonight.

344
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,800
I don't want to wake them.

345
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,160
Want to play this again?

346
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,280
Come.

347
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Shenggong,

348
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,680
stay as long as you want.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
The room's yours.

350
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
Move in

351
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,200
whenever you're ready.

352
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,950
This room will always be left for you.

353
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,830
Guys,

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,110
our workshop

355
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,350
will grow in the future.

356
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,640
From now on,

357
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,160
you'll be paid
based on qualified products.

358
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,280
More work, more pay.

359
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,320
- Record carefully.
- Got it.

360
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,300
- Okay.
- Okay, Brother.

361
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,400
Was this Ran's idea?

362
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,040
From now on,

363
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,450
don't go find her unless necessary.

364
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,560
What's wrong with Ran?

365
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,590
She has other things to attend to.

366
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,310
Okay.

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,920
There's another thing.

368
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,710
Let's discuss it.

369
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
In our city,

370
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Anshi University's
mechanical class students...

371
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,000
Thanks.

372
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,080
Anshi University's
mechanical class students

373
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,280
need a place
to take their practical classes.

374
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,830
I've checked it out.

375
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Our workshop fits.

376
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,870
What does it mean?

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Why didn't I understand it?

378
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,580
It means college students

379
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,230
come to our workshop to study.

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Study?

381
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,510
We teach college students?

382
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,480
Qiang,

383
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,800
they're college students.

384
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
What can we teach?

385
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,200
We've been working

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,280
with machines for years.

387
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
We know them

388
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,630
inside out.

389
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,870
We can check, repair, and use them.

390
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,830
This is what the students want to learn.

391
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,360
That's...

392
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,670
That's simple.

393
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,390
I let them come here

394
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,000
because Lu Ran showed me

395
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,590
how much vision and knowledge
college students have.

396
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,960
- Think about it.
- It's true.

397
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,240
Since she arrived,

398
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,480
she's brought so many ideas.

399
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,440
That's right.

400
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,350
She is full of confidence and energy.

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
There's a long way to go.

402
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,040
We must improve ourselves

403
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,630
to keep up with this society.

404
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,630
Bigger stages await.

405
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,070
So I hope you can

406
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,200
improve with me

407
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
and make this workshop thrive.

408
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,680
- Got it.
- No problem.

409
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Don't worry, Brother.

410
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,240
Actually, I'm selfish too.

411
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,080
Lu Ran wants to return to school, right?

412
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
Maybe through this,

413
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,110
I can meet her teachers
and school leaders,

414
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,350
and see if I can help her.

415
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,790
Brother,

416
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,350
it's not selfish.

417
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,160
Going back to school
has always been her dream, right?

418
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,080
Yeah.

419
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,680
Brother Qi,

420
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,190
if Ran goes to college,

421
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,430
will she stay with you?

422
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,350
- Nonsense!
- What did you say?

423
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,240
What's wrong with Brother Qi?

424
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,720
In fact,

425
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,240
I always thought Ran was impressive.

426
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,590
But her ways

427
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,720
are hard to learn.

428
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,870
With these mechanical students,

429
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,110
we need to learn carefully.

430
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,870
I'll go confirm

431
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,240
with the school.

432
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,270
Okay.

433
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,000
- Don't worry.
- Brother Qi, don't worry.

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,320
We'll study hard.

435
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,480
This chance to learn
from college students

436
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,110
is rare.

437
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
That's right.

438
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,670
Alright.

439
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,060
(The 4th Provincial University Games
are held at our school.)

440
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,830
- Please come in.
- President,

441
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,590
we've found an internship factory.

442
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,350
This is Mr. Qi from the mold factory.

443
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,480
Their equipment

444
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,110
meets our internship requirements.

445
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
Hello, President.

446
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,560
Mr. Qi, thank you for supporting us.

447
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,350
Our students in the mechanical class

448
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,910
need practical experience.

449
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,870
I heard from Teacher Zhang

450
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,760
that you're also sending mentors.

451
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,720
We're really grateful.

452
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,550
In the future,

453
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,550
if you ever need help,

454
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,390
just ask, Mr. Qi.

455
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,520
President, you're too polite.

456
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,110
Actually, I have a request.

457
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,720
A relative of mine

458
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,270
dropped out

459
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,320
for special reasons

460
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,870
but wanted to return to school.

461
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,430
If someone dropped out

462
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,190
and tried to come back,

463
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,910
I'm afraid it's not suitable.

464
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,520
She is really excellent.

465
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
I hope to ask for a chance
to take the exam.

466
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,150
If she can pass the exam,

467
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,070
can she come back and re-enroll?

468
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,990
Is that okay?

469
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,160
This is indeed a special situation.

470
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,590
I have to report
to the relevant departments.

471
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,000
We regret losing

472
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,480
talented students.

473
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,390
If she's willing to test,

474
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,480
we'll give her this opportunity.

475
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,040
If possible,

476
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,590
bring her when ready.

477
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,310
Thank you, President.

478
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,630
Then I'll let her come.

479
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,750
By the way,

480
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,720
please don't mention my involvement.

481
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,600
Thank you.

482
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,960
I'll leave now.

483
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,590
- Good.
- Thank you, President.

484
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,630
I'll walk you out.

485
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,880
Studying

486
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,960
and studying.

487
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,830
What's the point?

488
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,070
You'd better

489
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,080
give the Qi family a grandson.

490
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,120
Mom,

491
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,590
studying's important.

492
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,110
Don't disturb Lu Ran.

493
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,280
If you're overwhelmed,

494
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,670
I'll hire someone to help.

495
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
What did you say?

496
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,960
I said I can hire someone to help.

497
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,760
You're wasting money.

498
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,630
Do you think I can't handle it?

499
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,870
You give the money to me.

500
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,800
Did you grow up in a shelter
for so many years?

501
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,910
Fine. I don't want to talk.

502
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,320
What's up?

503
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,240
I received a payment today.

504
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,320
Let's go shopping in the city.

505
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,160
Why should I?

506
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,430
Didn't you tell me not to interfere?

507
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,230
I want to...

508
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,960
Mom,

509
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,350
let's go.

510
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,240
I want to go too.

511
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,190
