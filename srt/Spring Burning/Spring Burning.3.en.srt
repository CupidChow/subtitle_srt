1
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,239
Sis-in-law

2
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,959
Where did you go yesterday?

3
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,680
I was at home yesterday.

4
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,680
Waiting to welcome you.

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
I was so busy.

6
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,959
Where could I have gone?

7
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,480
No, Sis-in-law.

8
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,879
I think I saw you yesterday.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,200
Yes.

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,719
Just, just.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,159
Next to the clinic, wasn't it at night?

12
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,359
Did the wedding make you silly?

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
Guilty conscience.

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,039
You can tell you're not easy to deal with.

15
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,520
Sorry, Sis-in-law.

16
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,000
Maybe I remembered wrong.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,360
Also,

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
I didn't run away from the wedding.

19
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,680
Sheng Feng took back the betrothal gift.

20
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,080
No, no, that's not right.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,400
This morning,

22
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,840
Didn't the third brother give you money?

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Right over by the pavilion.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,759
Sis-in-law, what did you just say?

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,039
I, I said,

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
Back there,

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
Did you see the curtain back there?

28
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,800
There's cured meat inside.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,400
Mom said you should cook it today.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,639
Alright, thanks Sis-in-law.

31
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,280
Cook it all.

32
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,840
Do a good job.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,719
Mom treasures that cured meat like her life.

34
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,280
You'll have a tough time today.

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,360
Shanshan

36
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,479
Mom

37
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,319
Second Brother, Sister-in-law

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,319
Time to eat

39
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,159
Coming, coming

40
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,120
What day is it today? We have meat to eat

41
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,960
Your cooking skills are really good

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,479
Mom, come and see

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,599
Where did this meat come from? It's really good

44
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,319
Where did this meat come from?

45
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,439
Behind the kitchen curtain

46
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,560
The hanging one

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,199
You are really something

48
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,039
Do you know

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,960
That meat was for the New Year

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
You cooked it now, what will I eat for the New Year?

51
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,400
How could you cook the whole piece of meat?

52
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,120
Sister-in-law, didn't you tell me about this meat

53
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,000
I told you

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,280
This meat must not be touched

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
You

56
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,759
You are a jinx

57
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,719
You are going to ruin our family

58
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,360
Do you know how much this meat costs per pound?

59
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,800
Two dollars per pound, move aside, move aside

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,599
Come, come, come, Mom

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,319
Mom

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,360
What are you doing?

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,039
Don't be angry

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
Mom, Mom, Mom

65
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:57,960
Mom

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't call me Mom

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
Then, Aunt

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,159
The meat is already cooked

69
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,680
We can't just throw it all away

70
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't talk

71
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,400
Throwing it away would be wasteful, don't be angry

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,479
Yes, Mom

73
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,919
It's already cooked, not eating it would be a waste

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Eat, eat, eat

75
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,240
Come, son

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,319
This piece is good

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,839
Come, eat a piece of lean meat

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,759
Let me tell you,

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,120
San'er handed all the money to me.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,759
You also need to give me the betrothal gift.

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
How much does Sheng Feng give you every month?

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,319
Forty.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
And what about Second Brother? How much does he give?

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,639
He barely earns anything, he doesn't need to give.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
So, it means

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Auntie, you are in charge

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,439
Qi Shengfeng supports the whole family alone

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

89
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,480
What are you doing? Put it down

90
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,000
You little troublemaker, you keep eating after taking a bite

91
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,319
There's no food for you to eat

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,360
Aunt, you really manage this household well.

93
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,199
Qi Shengfeng earns money to support the whole family by himself.

94
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,399
In the end, the daughter gets scolded just for eating a piece of meat.

95
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,319
This is absurd.

96
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
This meal is impossible to eat, right?

97
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,000
So I absolutely won't give you this money.

98
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,480
And this meat.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,399
Sister-in-law asked me to make it.

100
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,360
Otherwise, as a newcomer,

101
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,920
how would I know where the meat is if no one tells me?

102
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:46,800
No, Mom.

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,439
I... I... I...

104
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,480
What's wrong with you?

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
You talk too much, Mom, Mom.

106
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,439
Mom.

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,839
Are you trying to kill me, Mom?

108
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,759
Mom, I was wrong, I was wrong.

109
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,720
Mom, don't hit me.

110
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,519
Mom, Mom, Mom.

111
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,720
I said I was wrong, Mom.

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,399
Mom, I was wrong.

113
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,360
Don't, don't, don't hit me.

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Mom, Mom, Mom.

115
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,519
I think you just want to eat the meat.

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,480
Really.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
Sister-in-law's cooking skills are really good.

118
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,439
Shanshan.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,920
Look

120
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,959
Come out, sit here and eat.

121
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,399
Come, sit there.

122
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,480
It's all yours

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,199
Eat up

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,279
Is it tasty?

125
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,519
Eat more.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
You are at the age where you need to grow.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,160
Mom, I want to go out and play.

128
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,040
Go ahead.

129
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Be careful.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,879
Don't go too far.

131
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,800
Doing this kind of physical labor

132
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,279
is it enough to just eat two pancakes for lunch?

133
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,800
Brother

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Brother Qi

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,360
Brother

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
I just went to town

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,319
and brought back the fan you bought for sister-in-law

138
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,199
I brought it back

139
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,759
I also ran into Director Sun

140
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,759
He urgently needs to see you

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,839
Ma Qiang

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Director Sun isn't as important as sister-in-law

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,399
I've never seen

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
Brother Qi care so much about anyone

145
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,360
She just joined the family yesterday

146
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,959
Afraid that sister-in-law might be hot

147
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
Today he immediately got the fan

148
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,639
Yeah, yeah

149
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,879
Get to work, everyone

150
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,959
Work, work

151
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
Brother is embarrassed

152
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,040
I'll take it inside, Brother Qi

153
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,240
Brother Qi just married a new wife

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
He's still getting used to it

155
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,639
Come on

156
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,639
Here

157
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,639
You motherless girl, let go of me

158
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,039
I'll make you eat mud balls

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,679
Come on

160
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,120
Let go of me, I'll make you eat mud balls

161
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,240
Come on

162
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,679
Let go of me, open your mouth

163
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
Come on

164
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,240
That's for not listening

165
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,519
You brat

166
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,279
What are you doing

167
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,080
Dare to go against me

168
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,759
Let her go

169
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,360
Let go

170
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,240
What are you doing

171
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
Shanshan

172
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,559
Are you hurt anywhere

173
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,519
Apologize to Shanshan

174
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,559
Who are you

175
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,120
Don't you know who my father is

176
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,480
Why should I apologize to a motherless girl

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Who said she is motherless

178
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,240
I am her mother

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,759
How old are you

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
Who taught you to speak like that

181
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Come here

182
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,279
I'll make you eat

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll make you eat

184
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,240
Is it good

185
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,519
You little brat

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,759
You're finished

187
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,399
I'm telling you

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,919
I'm going to find my dad right now

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Just wait

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,559
Let's go

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,559
Isn't this Zhang Lao Si's kid?

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Seems like it

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
You two troublemakers

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Do you know who his dad is?

195
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,320
If you mess with his dad, our whole family will suffer

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,399
Is this how you act as an aunt?

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,639
Shanshan is being held down and beaten

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,879
And you're just watching

199
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,519
Kids fighting is normal

200
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,440
A couple of hits won't hurt her

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,559
How about I hit you twice?

202
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,639
Look at this

203
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,120
This is our new daughter-in-law

204
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,639
Come on, hit her twice, hit

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Hit once, hit once

206
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,320
I think you're crazy

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,879
Are you crazy?

208
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,080
Come on, hit hit hit

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,519
Come

210
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,679
Yes, I'm crazy

211
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,840
This new daughter-in-law is quite tough

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,279
She even dares to provoke the second sister-in-law

213
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,120
Indeed

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,879
Raised by a concubine

215
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,200
Messing with Zhang Lao Si

216
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,039
Watch how I deal with you

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,320
What are you looking at? Don't you have work to do at home?

218
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
Don't dare to mess with the new daughter-in-law

219
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,360
She's fierce with us

220
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,840
Let's go

221
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,360
Okay

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,919
Second Brother

223
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,559
I just got married and moved in

224
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,840
I was thinking of inviting Sheng Feng and his brothers

225
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,000
to come over for a meal

226
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,960
but I don't know where his shop is

227
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,919
Brother, could you help me tell him?

228
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,039
Sure, I don't have anything else to do anyway

229
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,919
I'll just take it as a walk

230
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay

231
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Okay

232
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,919
Let's go

233
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,519
Sister, you won't be mad at me, right?

234
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,240
Why would I be mad at you?

235
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,080
Someone used to bully me

236
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,559
Grandma always said I was a troublemaker

237
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,879
She would scold me

238
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
It's not your fault

239
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
You did nothing wrong

240
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,919
You need to protect yourself

241
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,679
If your dad finds out

242
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,440
that you were bullied

243
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,799
he would be very upset

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
I would be very upset too

245
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Do you understand?

246
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,720
I understand, Mom

247
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,559
Call me sister

248
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,840
Sister

249
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Wipe your face clean

250
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,759
Little kitten

251
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,320
Then put on a pretty little dress

252
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,320
Where is everyone

253
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,039
Who bullied my son

254
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,080
Get out here

255
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,720
Get out

256
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,840
Come out, get out

257
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,879
What's going on, what's happening

258
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,759
Zhang Laosi

259
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,159
Why are you here

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,480
What's going on

261
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,240
Ask your new daughter-in-law

262
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,159
Dad, she hit me

263
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,639
And stuffed mud balls in my mouth

264
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,159
What's going on?

265
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,840
Mom

266
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,919
It seems like Lu Ran hit Zhang Hu.

267
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,799
Why did you hit Zhang Hu?

268
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
No, I couldn't stand it.

269
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
His son, no more nonsense.

270
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,519
We are all from the same village.

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,759
Hand over your daughter-in-law to us.

272
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,879
Our Zhang family won't make things difficult for you.

273
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,279
I came from the town.

274
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,159
If you dare to touch me,

275
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,240
aren't you afraid of provoking the wrong people?

276
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,480
If you have any background,

277
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,799
why were you sold to our family?

278
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,120
Alright, stop talking.

279
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,320
In this village,

280
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,519
no one dares to go against me, Old Zhang.

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,879
Tie him up and take him away.

282
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,840
Wait a minute.

283
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
Mom, mom, mom.

284
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,039
Why are you stopping me, mom?

285
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,399
Wait.

286
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,440
Fourth Brother.

287
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
We have handed the person over to you.

288
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,879
You can't make things difficult for our family anymore.

289
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,159
Not making things difficult is fine.

290
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
The medical fee is three hundred yuan.

291
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,120
What are you doing?

292
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
Let me search to see if there's any money, Old Zhang.

293
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:14,960
How dare you.

294
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,759
What are you doing?

295
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,480
Don't you believe there's law and order in this world?

296
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,919
Do you believe I'll report to the police?

297
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,759
What are you doing? Let go.

298
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,759
What are you doing?

299
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,440
Mom, mom, mom.

300
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,000
Let go.

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,039
Let go, let go, let go.

302
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,240
Are you okay, mom?

303
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,159
I'm fine, I'm fine.

304
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,240
Is your wife okay?

305
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,720
My wife is treating my brothers to dinner today.

306
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,399
There are quite a lot of people here.

307
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,200
Qi Shengfeng

308
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,879
You dare to oppose me.

309
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,399
Are you okay?

310
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm fine, I'm fine.

311
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,720
Zhang Laosi

312
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,720
You usually act all high and mighty in the village

313
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
I'll let that slide

314
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't bother with you

315
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,759
But today you bullied my wife

316
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,919
What am I afraid of?

317
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
You're asking for it

318
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,039
Get him, go!

319
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,559
Dad, are you okay?

320
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,200
Move aside

321
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,440
Sheng Feng

322
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,759
We are all from the same village

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,639
I just wanted to talk about it

324
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,559
Because of a woman, we became enemies

325
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,639
It's not necessary

326
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,240
Misunderstanding

327
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Brothers, it's all a misunderstanding

328
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,440
Sheng Feng, if we start fighting

329
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,440
It will become a big issue

330
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,600
We will have to pay for medical expenses, right?

331
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,320
Brothers

332
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,240
Fight without worry, I'll cover the costs

333
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,840
Okay

334
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,559
That's not what I meant

335
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,320
Aunt, it's not necessary

336
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,080
Then

337
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,840
You offended my wife, not my mother

338
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,559
Sheng Feng's wife

339
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,279
Isn't this a case of the flood washing away the Dragon King's temple?

340
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
We are all from the same village.

341
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,720
We see each other all the time, right?

342
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,519
Shanshan

343
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,840
Come here

344
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Tell your son to come here

345
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,480
Come here

346
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
Make him apologize to Shanshan

347
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,759
Dad, I didn't say anything wrong

348
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,360
Shut up

349
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,840
Apologize

350
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,799
I'm sorry, Qi Shanshan

351
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
I know I was wrong

352
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry, Qi Shanshan

353
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,720
Is that okay?

354
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,320
Sheng Feng's wife

355
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
Zhang Hu, remember this

356
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,080
Shanshan has a

357
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,919
mother who can't stand to see her suffer even a little

358
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,360
See, the misunderstanding is resolved

359
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,600
Then we'll be leaving

360
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,240
Brothers

361
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,679
Stop

362
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,679
Doesn't my wife deserve an apology?

363
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,440
Sorry, Sheng Feng's wife.

364
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,279
Did I scare you?

365
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
Wife, is this okay?

366
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,039
I'll listen to you.

367
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,679
Okay.

368
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,279
If my wife says it's over, it's over.

369
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
There won't be a next time.

370
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,919
Zhang Lao Si.

371
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
If you can't teach your son,

372
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,000
I can teach him for you.

373
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,399
Don't let me see

374
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,759
them bullying other kids in the village again.

375
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,279
Yes, yes, yes.

376
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,080
Let's go.

377
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,879
Be careful.

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,679
Don't let me see you again.

379
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,360
Ma Qiang

380
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,360
Ma Qiang

381
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,519
Hello, sister-in-law. Hello, sister-in-law.

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
Sorry to trouble everyone.

383
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,480
Sister-in-law, you're too polite.

384
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,320
It's no trouble, no trouble at all.

385
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,200
No, no.

386
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's have a meal together.

387
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,120
Great, we can taste sister-in-law's cooking.

388
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,679
Thank you, sister-in-law.

389
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,519
Taste sister-in-law's cooking.

390
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,159
Then you go wait for us in the pavilion.

391
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,840
Okay.

392
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:42,799
We'll head over then.

393
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Thank you for your hard work, sister-in-law.

394
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
Thank you for your hard work, sister-in-law.

395
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,000
What's going on?

396
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,279
Why apologize?

397
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,840
When dad wasn't around before,

398
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,039
Zhang Hu often bullied me.

399
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
But now I have mom.

400
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,759
She said she would protect me.

401
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,759
I was doing chores at home just now.

402
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,960
Shanshan went out to play.

403
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,680
I thought of bringing you some food.

404
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,359
I ran into

405
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,240
Shanshan being bullied by Zhang Hu.

406
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,400
I just fought back in kind.

407
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,759
And now they've come looking for trouble.

408
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,920
She clearly suffered a lot too.

409
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,400
Why is she only thinking about getting justice for Shanshan?

410
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,359
Shanshan

411
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm sorry.

412
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
Daddy didn't protect you well.

413
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,799
Daddy, you need to earn money to support the family.

414
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
And now I have Mom.

415
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,039
Daddy, you don't need to apologize.

416
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,799
Shanshan, be good.

417
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,319
Then I'll go cook.

418
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Shanshan, come here, let me see.

419
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,799
Are you hurt anywhere?

420
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Mom, I saw you bought meat and vegetables just now.

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,599
Where are they?

422
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,319
In the kitchen.

423
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,119
Then I'll use them to entertain the guys.

424
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,200
San'er

425
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:14,799
Mom

426
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,880
Lu Ran married into our family

427
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
and became one of the Qi family.

428
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,680
Why didn't anyone take care of her just now?

429
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,680
Watch your tone.

430
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,279
How come no one took care of her?

431
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,559
So many people came in,

432
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,960
looking fierce and menacing.

433
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,880
Do you expect your old mother to go up and fight?

434
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,160
Can I even win?

435
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,680
Exactly, San'er.

436
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,799
Who is Zhang Laosi?

437
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,759
You know who he is.

438
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,599
What do you expect us women to do?

439
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,559
Exactly.

440
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
No one told me Shanshan was being bullied.

441
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,119
Only Lu Ran, who just joined the family, helped her.

442
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,400
Stood up for her.

443
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,519
Is this appropriate?

444
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,240
Shanshan was bullied,

445
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
how would I know?

446
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
I just heard about it too.

447
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,400
Fine.

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
So now, whatever Mom says is wrong, right?

449
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,160
I...

450
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
You married a wife and forgot your mother, right?

451
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,279
Alright, alright, alright.

452
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,599
I won't say anything more.

453
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,559
Mom, that's not what I meant.

454
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,279
Stop talking.

455
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,960
Whatever I say is useless.

456
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,599
Mom.

457
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,880
Calm down, calm down.

458
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,680
Move aside

459
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,799
Here, the dishes are ready

460
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,240
So abundant

461
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,000
Brother Qi

462
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,920
These were all made by Sis

463
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,480
Smells so good

464
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,200
Sis

465
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,759
You really can handle both the living room and the kitchen

466
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,079
Sis, your cooking skills are amazing

467
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,000
Even the chef at Jinsheng Restaurant in town

468
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,119
can't compare to you

469
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,759
Brother Qi, you're so lucky

470
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,039
Really delicious

471
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,039
Indeed, it's delicious

472
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,119
Everyone, eat more

473
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,200
Why are you standing there?

474
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,480
Come over and eat together

475
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't have the face for it

476
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,640
How much is your face worth?

477
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,319
That meat is two yuan per pound

478
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,319
Mom

479
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,440
Then, I'll go

480
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,519
Go, go

481
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,720
Sis, where did you learn these cooking skills?

482
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,319
Second Sis

483
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,960
Eating

484
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,279
Second Sis, Second Sis, Second Sis

485
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Ribs

486
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,200
Look, these ribs smell so good

487
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,240
Second Sis

488
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,359
Today, my brothers and I are discussing some business

489
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,440
You, Mom, and Second Brother can eat inside

490
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,000
Then

491
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
Then you guys talk

492
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,480
Lu Ran

493
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,400
Men discussing business

494
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,200
Why are you sitting there? Come back.

495
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,599
Alright

496
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,799
Then you brothers chat

497
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,200
I'll take Shanshan inside to eat

498
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:28,880
No need

499
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
No, sister-in-law, don't

500
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,200
There's nothing you can't hear

501
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,640
Exactly

502
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,359
Right

503
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
No need to be polite, you sit

504
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,759
Alright, let's get down to business.

505
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,680
Yes, Brother Qi.

506
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
I just ran into Director Sun.

507
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,839
It's not time yet.

508
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,119
He keeps urging us to deliver quickly.

509
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,920
I don't know why.

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,799
Exactly, yes.

511
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,240
Since it's ready,

512
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
then you guys should deliver it later.

513
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,960
Delivering isn't a big deal.

514
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,039
But if they find fault,

515
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
and you're not there,

516
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,440
we brothers can't handle it.

517
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes, that's right, Brother Qi.

518
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,519
Should be sent off

519
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,240
Nothing's wrong at home

520
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,960
But this factory director

521
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,720
Why is he still asking your shop for things?

522
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,359
Don't they have their own factory, sis?

523
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,799
You might not know this

524
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,599
Let me tell you

525
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,319
Even though we call ourselves a blacksmith shop

526
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,359
In reality, it's a small model factory

527
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,119
Right?

528
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,240
That's right, many orders

529
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,519
The factory can only ask Brother Qi to do them

530
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,599
Yes, isn't that right? Yes

531
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,079
Brother Qi is a celebrity in the factory

532
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,400
He and the people from the county

533
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,519
Don't listen to their nonsense.

534
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,799
It's just a small shop.

535
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,680
Sis, let me put it this way.

536
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
Brother Qi's craftsmanship,

537
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,200
is top-notch.

538
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,880
Even the molds at the steel factory,

539
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,079
the old factory director personally asks Brother Qi to make them.

540
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,680
Because the errors are minimal, they bring them back to the factory.

541
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,599
for mass production.

542
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,079
The defect rate is extremely low.

543
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,000
That's because Director Sun is kind-hearted.

544
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,519
He's just looking out for our business.

545
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Brother Qi, you shouldn't be too modest.

546
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,240
You're too modest, brother.

547
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,240
The factory's efficiency has been declining.

548
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,039
We only earn seven or eight bucks a month.

549
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,200
If it weren't for Brother Qi,

550
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,160
we would be starving.

551
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,200
Thanks to Brother Qi.

552
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,960
But now even the steel factory is struggling.

553
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,440
Most of our shop's orders

554
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,640
depend on the steel factory.

555
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,519
In the future,

556
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,920
I don't know what we'll do.

557
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,440
Why are you saying that?

558
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
Sis is treating us to a meal today, hurry up and eat.

559
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,599
We still have to deliver goods later.

560
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,200
Eat.

561
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,599
By the way

562
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,039
Can you take me along when you go to the city to deliver goods?
