00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

193
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,400
I had planned

194
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,510
to move old equipment here

195
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,870
and add new machines.

196
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,280
But now only one has arrived.

197
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,840
The other one is coming soon.

198
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,150
Brother Qi works fast.

199
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,840
- Yes.
- Look at our new factory.

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Big and spacious.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,870
But I'll cover the second machine's cost

202
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,790
personally.

203
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,230
It's a family business.

204
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,710
Brother Qi, why say that?

205
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,150
You're treating us as outsiders?

206
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,000
Too polite.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,350
We all know about Ran.

208
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,440
Let's shoulder this

209
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
together!

210
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,480
Yes, let's do it together.

211
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,870
Brothers,

212
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,230
I appreciate it.

213
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,120
If we brothers want to open a factory,

214
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,520
we have to make sure
business is business,

215
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,260
so that it'll last.

216
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,680
And business partnerships

217
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,960
require clear boundaries.

218
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
We understand
you surrendered the workshop

219
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,990
for Ran.

220
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,550
But she's been good to us.

221
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,870
We should share this burden.

222
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
- Yes.
- Brother Qi.

223
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Yes, Brother Qi.

224
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,480
We understand your thoughts.

225
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,710
- But...
- This is decided.

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,400
Besides,

227
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,800
don't tell Lu Ran about this.

228
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,990
I don't want her to feel guilty.

229
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,790
This...

230
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,360
Okay, Brother.

231
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,750
We won't tell Ran.

232
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,670
Don't worry.

233
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,310
Yes, Brother.

234
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,950
Don't worry, we're here.

235
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,400
Isn't Ran moving out?

236
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,220
Go over there.

237
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,200
We'll handle things here.

238
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,050
- Yes.
- Alright.

239
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,910
Thanks for your hard work.

240
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,820
- Okay.
- Alright, Brother.

241
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,360
- Thanks.
- Be careful, Brother.

242
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,480
Let's start.

243
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,340
- Come on.
- Come on!

244
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,270
Come.

245
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,390
You two,

246
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,350
such big matters

247
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,990
and you didn't tell me!

248
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,550
Come on, Brother.

249
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Mom,

250
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,800
Shengfeng didn't want to trouble you.

251
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,510
Once it's done,

252
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,750
you won't suffer.

253
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,520
And it'll be a surprise.

254
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
A surprise indeed.

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
Yeah, a surprise.

256
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,230
I'm moving to the town
to live in a big house.

257
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,000
Shenggong,

258
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,230
finish packing quickly.

259
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,750
Ma Qiang and the others will come soon.

260
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,800
Let's move then.

261
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,830
I won't join you.

262
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,830
What's wrong?

263
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,790
Why not?

264
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,630
Divorce scrambled your brain?

265
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,280
Mom, I'm over 30 years old.

266
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,630
I can't mooch off my brother anymore.

267
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,390
I won't go.

268
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,800
Brother, what are you saying?

269
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,070
Shengfeng, don't try to convince me.

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,470
I know you mean well.

271
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
But I'm your brother.

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,350
I can't lower myself.

273
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,230
Shengfeng, stop convincing me.

274
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
Brother,

275
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,470
I'm not here to convince you.

276
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Lu Ran says you've been running

277
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,470
the cart business lately.

278
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,830
I'll leave it to you.

279
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,560
Just give her dividends
after making money.

280
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,000
Brother,

281
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,110
no matter where you are,

282
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,950
we're still brothers.

283
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
I support

284
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,350
your decision.

285
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,560
Take care.

286
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,820
(Oxygen Tank Transport
Service Agreement)

287
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,990
Come on, let me help.

288
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,070
I'll do it.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,920
Be careful.

290
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,110
What a great house.

291
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
Shengfeng,

292
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,200
I never dreamed of such a nice place.

293
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,400
Brother Qi!

294
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,830
Brother Qi, good news.

295
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,870
Director Sun asked you to go quickly.

296
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,350
He got us an order

297
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,230
from a city group project.

298
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,950
- Really?
- Really.

299
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,120
Ran.

300
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,040
It's a good thing.

301
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,320
Go negotiate quickly.

302
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,520
Mom and I will finish here.

303
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,910
Yes...

304
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,040
- Let's go.
- Go ahead, Shengfeng.

305
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
Such a good house,

306
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,680
but Shenggong refused to come.

307
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,760
Mom,

308
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,710
Shengfeng and I were busy.

309
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,200
Shenggong actually

310
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,630
managed the cart business

311
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,390
very well.

312
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,950
- Really?
- Yes.

313
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,870
Shenggong is very capable.

314
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,910
You have to let him build

315
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,900
his own career gradually.

316
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,470
Yes, you're right.

317
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,790
Come on, let's move.

318
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,080
Mom, take a break, I'll do it.

319
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,790
Okay...

320
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,560
Be careful, don't fall.

321
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,680
This house is really good.

322
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,830
I have to clean it up properly.

323
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,820
(Shantou Town Steel Factory)

324
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,470
Yes, Director Sun.

325
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,990
How's business?

326
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,630
Shengfeng, you're here.

327
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,550
Director Sun.

328
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,670
Let me introduce.

329
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,230
This is Manager Fang.

330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,160
Hello.

331
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,520
This is Qi Shengfeng.

332
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,630
He's the best

333
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,750
in the county

334
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,230
and

335
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,350
the city.

336
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,030
Please trust him

337
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,030
with full confidence.

338
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,230
I'm definitely relieved

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,280
for whom you introduced me.

340
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,750
I didn't expect you to be recognized

341
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,950
by Director Sun at such a young age.

342
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,560
So promising.

343
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,750
Thank you.

344
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,750
Have a seat.

345
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,670
Sit down, please.

346
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,360
Shengfeng,

347
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,630
I've only introduced him

348
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,630
as the general manager

349
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,110
of our city's famous Shuguang Group,

350
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,630
but there's another layer to him

351
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,560
I haven't introduced to you.

352
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,440
You two have a lot of connections.

353
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Manager Fang
is Party Secretary Fang's son.

354
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,430
Director Sun,

355
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,590
why mention that?

356
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,680
Though connected,

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,870
I must stress

358
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,080
that Shuguang Group

359
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,110
demands supreme quality.

360
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,990
This order is just a trial

361
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,440
for us.

362
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,590
Manager Fang means

363
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,160
let's give it a try

364
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,920
and smooth cooperation

365
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,800
will bring more orders.

366
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Rest assured.

367
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,800
We won't let you down.

368
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,270
Work hard.

369
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,830
I hope we'll have a happy cooperation.

370
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,710
He'll be fine.

371
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,160
Let's talk about the details.

372
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,280
Okay.

373
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,840
Mr. Qi,

374
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,920
remember to seize

375
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,280
this opportunity.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't waste

377
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,110
Director Sun's efforts.

378
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,310
Yes, we'll work hard.

379
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,520
And I'll state again

380
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,870
that we emphasize

381
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,360
quality above all.

382
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
You can rest assured.

383
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,590
Lu Ran?

384
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,880
Is that you?

385
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,480
Senior Fang?

386
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,400
Lu Ran!

387
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,550
It's really you.

388
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,720
I didn't expect to meet you here.

389
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,240
I heard after your family's troubles,

390
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,390
your uncle and aunt forced you
to get married.

391
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,390
Long story.

392
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,350
I'm indeed married.

393
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,320
Lu Ran,

394
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,150
I read your letter very seriously

395
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,520
back then.

396
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,390
I thought about it and I'm touched.

397
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,370
- Later, I went to find you...
- Senior Fang,

398
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,550
the past matters little now.

399
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,760
How can it be?

400
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,760
Lu Ran, you know I...

401
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,720
By the way,

402
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
I heard

403
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,190
you married a good-for-nothing.

404
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,640
With your talents,

405
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
you will have a great future.

406
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,960
You can actually choose to divorce.

407
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,590
My lawyer friend...

408
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,720
Senior Fang,

409
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,430
the rumors are not credible.

410
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,910
This is my husband.

411
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,960
You...

412
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,320
You two...

413
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,670
I haven't had a chance to introduce you.

414
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,110
I didn't realize you knew each other.

415
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,640
That's nice.

416
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,350
You're a good match.

417
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,430
I told you the rumors can't be trusted.

418
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,110
I've got something to do,

419
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,280
so I'll leave now.

420
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,190
By the way,

421
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,330
(Fang Hongyang)
here's my business card.

422
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,620
If you need anything in the future...

423
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,150
No... If you two
need anything in the future,

424
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,430
you can contact me.

425
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,800
Okay.

426
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,560
Be good to Lu Ran.

427
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,030
Goodbye, Manager Fang.

428
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,760
Shuguang Group Manager.

429
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,000
Is this the Shuguang Group I know,

430
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
the famous one in our city?

431
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,270
You...

432
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,480
Now you're working
with such a big company.

433
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,000
Should I call you

434
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,900
Mr. Qi from now on?

435
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,080
You and him...

436
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
How close were you two?

437
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,960
It was when I was in school.

438
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
We sometimes studied together.

439
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,030
Let's go home first.

440
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,430
Let's go.

441
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,150
What letter was he mentioning?

442
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,120
Want to know?

443
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,080
No, I'm just curious.

444
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,510
It's definitely about learning.

445
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,560
You were a top student.

446
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,080
- Keep it.
- Okay.

447
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,460
(Enlistment Honor)

448
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,190
I asked you to buy so much and you...

449
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,190
- Mom.
- Tan Hong,

450
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,320
why are you here?

451
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,640
I brought gifts.

452
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,830
You don't have to do this.

453
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,190
How dare you show your face
after all you've done!

454
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,710
Shenggong!

455
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,750
Stop shouting!

456
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,670
Qi Shenggong!

457
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,280
- I said out, did you hear?
- Shenggong!

458
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
I said out!

459
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,430
Shenggong!

460
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,700
- He's not here.
- Qi Shenggong!

461
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,550
Shenggong!

462
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,510
Shenggong...

463
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,430
- Shenggong!
- Take this.

464
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,600
Get out!

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,910
Get out! Did you hear?

466
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,560
Get out now!

467
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,190
Get out!

468
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,800
What a woman.

469
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,480
You useless!

470
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,790
The Qi family is cursed.

471
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,440
You'll have no heirs!

472
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,600
- Who are you cursing?
- Bah!

473
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,760
- Your husband died early
- Say one word...

474
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,240
because you jinxed him!

475
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,480
Your son is also jinxed by you
and can't give birth.

476
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,640
Pooh!

477
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,910
You...

478
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,190
Come back here.

479
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Come back...

480
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,640
Slow down.

481
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,310
- Dad!
- Lu Ran.

482
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,590
- Shanshan.
- Shengfeng,

483
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,510
how is it?

484
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,190
I just returned home after buying,

485
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,790
and neighbors said Mom fainted.

486
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,720
Mom is okay.

487
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,160
She didn't have breakfast today.

488
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,310
Tan Hong came to fight,

489
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,240
and Mom got dizzy.

490
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,630
How did she find us?

491
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,960
She probably

492
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,040
tracked us down and asked around.

493
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,000
She came here

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,320
when only Mom was home.

495
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,800
How is Mom? Let me take a look.

496
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,680
She is inside.

497
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,670
I'll buy her some food.

498
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,230
Let's go.

499
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,190
Sister,

500
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,800
I've heard it.

501
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,830
The Lu family cheated you out
of a lot of bride price.

502
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,720
The bride ran away.

503
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,040
Just once.

504
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,430
Later, she was back.

505
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
Let me tell you,

506
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
you don't know

507
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,280
that there's no good for that family.

508
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,110
They asked for 2,000 yuan.

509
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,030
2,000 yuan!

510
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,510
And they came to blackmail us
after she ran away.

511
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,760
2,000 yuan?

512
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,880
Oh my god.

513
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,630
That family is so evil.

514
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,750
Right.

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,240
I heard she's a college student.

516
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,110
There's already once.

517
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,720
She might run again.

518
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
She won't.

519
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,680
Those two

520
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,830
have a good life now.

521
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,910
Sister, please be more careful.

522
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,670
College students have seen the world.

523
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,200
Can she live

524
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,350
with your son for the rest of her life?

525
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,240
Sister,

526
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
that's not appropriate.

527
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,430
What's wrong with a college student?

528
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,350
Do you know what Shengfeng is?

529
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,550
He's not an ordinary man.

530
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,390
That's right.

531
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,440
My son is honest

532
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
and promising.

533
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
- Right?
- Yeah.

534
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
He's very capable.

535
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,670
He bought a house in town recently.

536
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,430
Compared to our country houses,

537
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,790
you won't believe how big it is

538
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,670
till you see it.

539
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,830
- It'll shock you.
- Be careful.

540
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,670
There are several floors in the yard.

541
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,030
You've never seen it...

542
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,720
Sister, my IV bag's empty.

543
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,830
Empty.

544
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,200
- I wasn't finished.
- Doctor.

545
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,120
Doctor!

546
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
Mom, are you done chatting?

547
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,670
No... My head hurts.

548
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,790
Let me see.

549
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,270
- What's wrong?
- My head...

550
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,280
My whole body aches.

551
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,470
You...

552
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
Where were you?

553
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,720
Buying groceries for so long?

554
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,630
I could've died alone.

555
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,030
Tan Hong

556
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,790
came to make trouble again.

557
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,400
She was screaming and shouting.

558
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
Do you know what she said?

559
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,550
She called me useless.

560
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,480
And she cursed our whole family
to die horribly.

561
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,400
If I hadn't...

562
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,320
I'm mad!

563
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,680
Why did I walk so slowly

564
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,830
and shop so far?

565
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,110
It's all my fault, Mom.

566
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
I walked too slowly.

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,830
I could've helped sooner if...

568
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,000
What nonsense!

569
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,430
You'll only come back after I'm dead?

570
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,640
Next time... Next time she comes,

571
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll stay home

572
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,870
and curse her for you.

573
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,480
But now...

574
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,510
I... I can't do anything
during this time.

575
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,150
I'll take over then, Mom.

576
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,160
Let me take a look.

577
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,800
Is this speed okay?

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
Be gentle.

579
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,190
What if my heart races?

580
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,800
I need some water. I'm thirsty.

581
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,790
Alright, I'll find water.

582
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,240
Get me water somehow.

583
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,270
Doctor!

584
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,320
Doctor, do you have water?

585
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,880
Take this.
