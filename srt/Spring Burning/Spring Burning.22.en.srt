- Please let me in.

(Shuguang Group)
No appointment, you can't enter.

21
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,870
- I came from another province.
- Sir, please...

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,080
I know, sir.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,390
- You can't go in.
- Ms. Bai!

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,290
I only need 10 minutes.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
We offer prices cheaper

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,400
- Sir.

- We want to

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,300

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,280
- You need an appointment.
- Ms. Bai!

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,270
- No appointment, no entry.
- Wait.

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,350
You can go.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,710
Actually, Ms. Bai told me...

34
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,630
What?

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,150
Do you mean my word as good as Bai Simeng's?

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,710
No, no, no. Not at all!

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,630
My apologies.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
Hello.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,940
Are you from a steel factory?

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,760
Which steel factory?

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
What do you want?

43
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,400
I asked you a question.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,750
Which steel factory are you from?

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,710
Why are you here?

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm from Jianhong Steel
in the neighboring town.

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
I came

48
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,520
because I heard Shuguang Group secured

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,230
the cross-river bridge project.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,510
I'd like to collaborate.

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,080
Li Quan.

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,340
(Anshi Jianhong Steel Co., Ltd.)

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,600
You want to supply steel for this project?

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,510
- Come in.
- Okay, thanks.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,040
You're hurting me!

57
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,000
- Why do you hit me?
- You!

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Then I'll hit back. Believe me.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,600
Zhou Huacheng, are you an idiot?

60
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,480
You fail at everything you do!

61
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,270
If I hadn't found a new steel factory,

62
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,320
Lu Ran's factory
will still be making money off us.

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,830
Here, have some sunflower seeds.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,200
Use your hands. Don't gross me out!

65
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,920
Who peels seeds by hand?

66
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,230
Never had them before?

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,790
I actually peeled it.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,160
Here, eat one.

69
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,040
With your foot smell, it's sweet and sour.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,550
How could you give it to me like this?

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,830
Keep massaging.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,120
Lighter! Lighter!

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,550
I'm going light, I am!

74
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,360
This is infuriating!

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,660
I thought you were giving birth.

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,760
You scared me to death.

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,320
Steel prices are fluctuating wildly now.

78
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,360
To be safe,

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,990
we'll stock more raw materials

80
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,600
within reasonable price ranges.

81
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,040
We've already rented storage space.

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,200
The shipment should arrive today.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,790
Brother Qi! Brother Qi!

84
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,030
Ran!

85
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
Bad news!

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,760
Shuguang Group just canceled our contract.

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,310
What?

88
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,430
Haven't Shuguang's orders always been stable

89
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,640
and increasing every month?

90
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,040
Did their project hit a snag?

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
Why cancel suddenly?

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,000
I went to confirm the supply list today,

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
but they said they'd cancel the orders.

94
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,680
I don't know why.

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,030
Oh, I asked them.

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,710
They said they found a new supplier.

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,590
Another steel factory?

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,470
Yes, some unknown company.

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,760
This doesn't make sense.

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,390
We have a contract with Shuguang.

101
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,080
Why breach it without reason?

102
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,830
And Shuguang's always been meticulous

103
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,880
about partnerships.

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,390
Why would they choose

105
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,270
some no-name company

106
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,200
over us?

107
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,800
Is Shuguang Group really rejecting us?

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,870
We stockpiled a lot of materials

109
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,000
just for this project.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
If this batch doesn't sell,

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,760
we'll be in big trouble.

112
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,680
And our workers' wages

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,560
are based on production output.

114
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
That means

115
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,830
we've already advanced their pay.

116
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,670
Yes.

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,830
This is no small sum.

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,270
We're just starting out.

119
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,800
Almost all our capital

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
is tied up in production.

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,350
If we don't get payment soon,

122
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,320
it'll be disastrous.

123
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,870
Well, Ma Qiang,

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,760
first, inform the accounting department.

125
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
Then I'll go with you to Shuguang Group

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
to see if we can salvage the deal.

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,870
- Alright.
- I'll head there first.

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,750
Brother Qi, Ran.

129
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,670
Let's go.

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
Ms. Bai,

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,760
Director Qi
from Shantou Town Steel Factory is here.

132
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,990
Please come in.

133
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,670
Please, have a seat.

134
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,280
Chairwoman Bai.

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Chairwoman Bai,

136
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
we're here because

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
your company suddenly

138
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
terminated our partnership,

139
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,350
leaving us with massive steel stockpiles.

140
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,800
We'd like to know

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,830
the exact reason.

142
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,510
Did our company order you

143
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,640
to produce excess steel products,

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,760
causing your backlog?

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,040
Ms. Bai,

146
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,320
we have a contract with you.

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,270
And our collaboration has been going well.

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm wondering

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,640
why cut us loose so suddenly?

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,590
Does our company lack a market division?

151
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,200
Do I need to

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,680
explain it to you in person?

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,120
But let me make this clear,

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,710
the decision is ours.

155
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,200
We may choose you,

156
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,680
or we may not.

157
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,350
But you're breaching the contract.

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,440
We are business partners.

159
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,000
I act by market principles.

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Anything else?

161
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,470
If not,

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
I won't keep you.

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,160
Let's go.

164
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,790
Go.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,520
Chief Lu.

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
Why are you here?

167
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,430
I go wherever I want.

168
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,390
None of your business.

169
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,560
Bai Simeng,

170
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,220
you're just an adopted daughter.

171
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,390
Why do you always boss me around?

172
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,760
People might think

173
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,080
you're the owner of the Shuguang Group.

174
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,350
Now that I'm back,

175
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,150
are you still dreaming of
being the heiress?

176
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,240
Sorry.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Next time, you'll regret this.

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
Grandma.

179
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,760
Qianqian.

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,950
Grandma.

181
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,320
My dear Qianqian.

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,360
How is your day?

183
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,230
Thank you, thank you.

184
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,950
Grandma,

185
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,590
about me changing suppliers,

186
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,870
will it be a bad thing for the group?

187
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,350
It shouldn't cause any real harm.

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,320
But aren't we breaching the contract?

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Don't worry.

190
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,160
Our legal team is strong.

191
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,280
Once the lawsuit is over,

192
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,720
their factory will go bankrupt

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,630
from cash flow problems.

194
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,590
Besides,

195
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,110
didn't you say

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,470
they bullied you?

197
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,230
I will avenge you.

198
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,430
Great.

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,550
Grandma, you are the best.

200
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,750
Of course.

201
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,630
My Qianqian,

202
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
if I don't spoil you,

203
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,750
who else would I spoil?

204
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,870
All these businesses,

205
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,400
aren't they for you?

206
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,590
Right?

207
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,520
Grandma...

208
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,160
I can see these businesses weren't for me.

209
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,040
You did all this for Sister Simeng.

210
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,120
Everyone in the company listens to her now.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,560
Who actually respects me?

212
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,470
Qianqian.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Since you brought this up,

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,520
I must remind you.

215
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,760
Do you know

216
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,400
there are complaints about you

217
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,470
throughout the company?

218
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,870
I hope you'll act more carefully

219
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,230
and earn people's respect.

220
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,280
I knew they'd badmouth me,

221
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,680
especially that Bai Simeng,

222
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,830
leading her people
to target me everywhere.

223
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,790
I...

224
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,710
Forget it.

225
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,520
Maybe I shouldn't be involved in this.

226
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,560
Grandma, I won't bother you anymore.

227
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll just go home.

228
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,320
At least I'll have peace alone.

229
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,560
Qianqian, listen to me.

230
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,830
Simeng has been with me all these years.

231
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
She does have management experience.

232
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,550
People respect her.

233
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,520
Isn't that perfectly normal?

234
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,550
Be careful.

235
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,680
Besides,

236
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,470
don't you see how much I've favored you?

237
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
Look.

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,710
You wanted the river bridge project.

239
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,470
Didn't I give it to you?

240
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Do you know

241
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,670
how important this bridge project is

242
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,470
to our company?

243
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,730
And when you wanted to change suppliers,

244
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,080
didn't I agree too?

245
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,590
Do you know why I did this?

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
Because I believe in you.

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,320
I want to give you more authority

248
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,990
to help you grow faster.

249
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,280
But Qianqian,

250
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,990
no matter what,

251
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
you mustn't disappoint me.

252
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,080
Grandma, don't worry.

253
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,990
I definitely won't let you down.

254
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Good.

255
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,590
Since you don't like them,

256
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,440
I'll make

257
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,320
all of Shuguang Group's partners

258
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,590
cease cooperation with them.

259
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,830
Really?

260
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,310
Yes.

261
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,230
Thank you, Grandma!

262
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Grandma, you're so good to me.

263
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
You... you sit. Take a seat.

264
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,000
- Come on.
- I wouldn't dare!

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,520
- Sit down, sit.
- Grandma, you sit.

266
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,370
- Sit.
- Okay.

267
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,240
- Sit.
- Alright.

268
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,080
- Sit, come on.
- Then I'll soak up some good luck.

269
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,870
Is Shuguang Group insane?

270
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
Harming everyone.

271
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,350
Why ruin us like this?

272
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,350
Two-thirds of our steel factory's machines

273
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,560
are idle.

274
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,750
And several other companies

275
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,160
suddenly canceled orders.

276
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,080
Shuguang Group is targeting us.

277
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,800
It doesn't make sense.

278
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,240
How much do we have left in the funds?

279
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,830
Don't lose heart yet.

280
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,110
Keep the green hills,
and you'll have firewood.

281
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,950
Our factory still has advantages.

282
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,630
Upgraded equipment

283
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,950
and skilled workers.

284
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,670
Our output and quality

285
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,470
outperform other steel factories.

286
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,000
True.

287
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,560
Our production costs

288
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,080
are lower than others too.

289
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Brother Qi,

290
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,440
should we sell at a discount?

291
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,200
We can't back down now!

292
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,830
Think about it.

293
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,110
Shuguang Group is a major player
in Anshi.

294
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,750
Their influence is huge.

295
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,230
Many industries rely on them.

296
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,000
That's why

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
their attack hurts so much.

298
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,470
We can't fight back.

299
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,870
What if we reach out to companies

300
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
not tied to the Shuguang Group?

301
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,150
Would that give us hope?

302
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,070
Yes.

303
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,230
I checked before

304
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,560
only some firms in neighboring cities

305
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,870
might cooperate with us.

306
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,470
Shuguang controls our city,

307
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,400
but not the whole province or country!

308
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,950
Makes sense.

309
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,630
Our strategy now is

310
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,560
no price wars.

311
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
If we slash prices,

312
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,630
competitors will turn against us.

313
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,990
We'd gain more enemies.

314
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,880
So, let's use our cost savings

315
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,590
on logistics instead.

316
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,960
- Smart idea!
- Right!

317
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,690
Brother Shenggong's transport business

318
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,470
is thriving now.

319
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,870
We can trust him.

320
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,310
Yeah!

321
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,880
Brother Qi,

322
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,320
let us take a trip

323
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,870
to other provinces then.

324
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,790
I'll visit companies that showed interest

325
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,200
and those that rejected us

326
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,670
- last minute.
- Okay.

327
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,550
Okay.

328
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,470
- That's it.
- Okay.

329
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,830
Let's arrange it this way.

330
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
We'll be waiting for your call.

331
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,630
Once you secure the order,

332
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,230
contact us to make samples.

333
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
- Okay.
- Alright.

334
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
- Good, go ahead.
- Okay, Ran.

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,790
We don't have much time.

336
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,670
Go now.

337
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,710
- We're leaving.
- Bye.

338
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,150
Ms. Lin,

339
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,520
you're our biggest partner.

340
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,240
I know your company

341
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,590
urgently needs this batch.

342
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,320
We have a formal contract.

343
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,720
And you've been satisfied

344
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,640
with our products.

345
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
Lu, let me be blunt.

346
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,830
I can pay the penalty fee.

347
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,910
Don't misunderstand.

348
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,350
I'm not here for the penalty.

349
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,720
I won't risk offending

350
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,870
Shuguang Group for one batch.

351
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,790
Please leave.

352
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,470
Ms. Lin. Ms. Lin!

353
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,270
Lu?

354
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,230
Lu! What's wrong?

355
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,830
Someone! Help! Someone!

356
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,150
Director Li, you're too kind.

357
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,070
Please, have a seat.

358
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Alright.

359
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,090
Shengfeng,

360
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,200
come here, sit down.

361
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,750
I heard you're in trouble.

362
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,590
I owe you a big favor.

363
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,300
I've been waiting for you to ask.

364
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,250
Well,

365
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,590
no need for introductions, right?

366
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,560
Mr. Qi, you don't know this.

367
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,920
Director Li speaks highly of you.

368
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,800
He came all the way from Lushi

369
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,830
just to bring us together.

370
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,520
Mr. Wang, here's the thing.

371
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,000
I know your company

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,510
regularly needs precision parts

373
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,430
for production.

374
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,230
Many are imported from overseas.

375
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,630
What I'm saying is

376
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,470
my steel factory can make them too.

377
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,070
Old Li,

378
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,200

Mr. Wang, how about this,

387
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
you give us the specs,

388
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,160
and we produce a batch of samples for free.

389
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,040
If they pass inspection,

390
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,110
we'll talk further.

391
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,550
If not,

392
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,960
you lose nothing.

393
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,950
What do you think?

394
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,400
You're confident.

395

396
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,350
give you this chance?

397

Mr. Wang,

398
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
