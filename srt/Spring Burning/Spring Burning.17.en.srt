19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm sorry, Grandma.

20
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,640
We couldn't secure the deal.

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,080
Director Sun and Party Secretary Fang

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,760
still want us to retain some workers.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,040
Hongyang,

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,360
negotiate with them again.

25
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,120
Okay, leave it to me.

26
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,950
Mom, we're back.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
We left food for you.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,710
I'll heat it up later.

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,110
Is the machine fixed?

30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,390
Fixed.

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,350
Excellent.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,640
Then the workers
won't be laid off, right?

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,800
Everyone's waiting for their wages.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,950
When will they get paid?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,390
Even if the machine's fixed,
it's useless.

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,440
The new owner
taking over the steel factory

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,550
wants to lay off all workers.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,600
What kind of person is that?

39
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,970
So cruel.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,600
He's denying ordinary folks' livelihood.

41
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,230
Your father spent his whole life

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,390
devoted to the steel factory.

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,200
If the factory gets
completely overhauled,

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,270
everything will vanish.

45
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,640
It won't be
the Shantou Town Steel Factory anymore.

46
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,550
When people die, they won't even
have memories to hold on to.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,720
Shengfeng,

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,710
I've put my life's work

49
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,990
into this factory.

50
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,790
Our whole family must protect it,

51
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,200
and let this factory

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,040
safeguard our town's
peace and prosperity.

53
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,360
Dad,

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I'll protect the factory.

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,950
Good boy.

56
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,110
Was your father also
at the steel factory?

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,710
Dad was part
of the first batch of workers.

58
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,670
Later he became a core member.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,950
Back then, the factory had nothing.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,390
He did everything

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,270
to boost production.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,590
When I was a kid, he often

63
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,710
took me there to play.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,590
The steel factory grew up

65
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,800
with me.

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,440
Why didn't you
and Shenggong join the factory?

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Dad died from overwork.

68
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,320
After that,
Big Brother went to work there...

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,840
but had an accident.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,910
To compensate our family, the factory

71
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,830
offered me and Shenggong jobs.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
Mom refused.

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,350
She said Dad and Big Brother
had died honorably.

74
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,030
We shouldn't tarnish their legacy

75
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,240
by using connections to get us in.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
What if...

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
we contract the steel factory?

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
We?

79
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,150
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
Where would we get the money?

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,270
The factory's staff are complicated.

82
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,890
How would we handle
thousands of workers?

83
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,870
And how would we

84
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,640
pay their back wages?

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
It's not like my workshop

86
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,030
with just dozens of people...

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,630
Today's dishes seem bland.

88
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,760
I'll get you some chili.

89
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,910
If the steel factory really collapses,

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,350
it'll affect us.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,870
Many of our past orders

92
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,080
came from them.

93
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,560
But doesn't Shuguang Group

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,200
work with us now?

95
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,510
If they take over,

96
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,800
they'll still give us orders.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,470
They're installing new machines

98
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,640
with higher output

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,120
and precision.

100
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,680
Soon,

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,240
we might not get any work at all.

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,670
Then

103
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,200
all these workers will be laid off,

104
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,640
what will they do?

105
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,640
There's no future.

106
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,390
My uncle works at the factory.

107
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,870
His whole family depends on him.

108
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,750
Now the elders and women at home

109
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,870
only eat one meal a day,

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,200
saving food for the kids
and working men.

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,390
My neighbor is critically ill

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,510
and relies on

113
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,440
her husband's wages to stay alive.

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,190
These days,

115
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,560
I can hear her moans every day.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,200
To be honest, it's heartbreaking.

117
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
Enough talk.

118
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,680
Focus on your own tasks.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,350
Finish eating and get back to work.

120
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,740
(The 4th Provincial University Games
are held at our school.)

121
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,590
Impressive, Lu Ran.

122
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,510
Your solution is excellent.

123
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,910
You have a real math talent.

124
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,120
Thank you, Teacher Wang.

125
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,120
Listen,

126
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
there'll be

127
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,440
an international academic exchange soon.

128
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,830
I'll recommend you.

129
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,360
Teacher Wang, such a great chance...

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,760
Teacher Zhang, you're back.

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,390
What's the rush?

132
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,470
The national policy

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,160
now encourages business development
and entrepreneurship

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
with new loans.

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
I spent class time

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,600
explaining it,

137
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,950
but most students didn't grasp it.

138
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,560
I talked myself hoarse

139
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,830
and distracted.

140
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,480
Teacher Zhang,

141
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,390
I'd like to consult you

142
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,710
about loan policies.

143
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,830
I need to prepare for the next class.

144
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's walk and talk.

145
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Alright.

146
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,600
Then I'll go first, Teacher Wang.

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,520
Okay.

148
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,880
Lu Ran, the exchange program
is settled then.

149
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,790
Teacher Wang...

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,960
Teacher Zhang!

151
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,270
The dual-track system now
has higher policy ratios

152
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,200
on commodities.

153
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,200
And steel is in urgent demand
for many industries.

154
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,080
What's the dual-track system?

155
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
It means

156
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,640
commodity prices used to be fixed

157
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,830
but now adjust based
on supply and demand.

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,270
So steel prices can rise.

159
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,080
And it's a hot commodity now.

160
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,310
So what?

161
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,350
So steel factories

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,120
have bright prospects.

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,880
You say we have no money,

164
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,360
but current policies
encourage development.

165
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,270
We could borrow
from credit cooperatives.

166
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,950
We can repay over many years.

167
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,680
If you become a factory director,

168
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,710
you'll manage it well.

169
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,670
You're already running
your workshop smoothly, right?

170
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,590
Lu Ran,

171
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,830
I can't do it.

172
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,590
Why?

173
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,950
Before, I felt like
I couldn't continue studying.

174
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,030
You encouraged me to keep studying

175
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,590
and got me opportunities.

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,230
Why doubt yourself now?

177
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,160
It's different.

178
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,350
You're oversimplifying.

179
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,870
A factory has thousands of workers,

180
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,630
not just a few like my workshop.

181
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,630
But with current policies...

182
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,080
I don't understand
your talk about policies

183
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
or dual-track systems.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
But I've seen with my own eyes

185
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,440
thousands of steel factory workers
not getting paid.

186
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,280
Their families can barely afford food.

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,390
Then you should change this situation.

188
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,560
I can't change it.

189
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
How do you know
without even investigating?

190
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,640
You...

191
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,920
You're not investigating!

192
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,750
How do you know?

193
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
The last time,

194
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,840
I tried expanding

195
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,690
my workshop

196
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,910
to hire more workers,

197
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,910
an accident nearly

198
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,750
destroyed everything.

199
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,830
That was an exception.

200
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,590
If Shuguang Group takes over,

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,800
they'll lay off thousands.

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,200
But at least, they'll give severance.

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,750
If we fail,

204
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,630
it's over.

205
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,230
You're assuming failure

206
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,150
without trying! What if it works?

207
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,680
And what if it fails?

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,160
Lu Ran!

209
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,440
(If we fail,)

210
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,110
(what happens to the brothers?)

211
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,920
(What about Shanshan and Mom?)

212
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,710
(And what about you,)

213
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,320
(who's with me?)

214
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,200
Mom, you're back.

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,350
I'm furious.

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Mom, who upset you?

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,920
Your dad.

218
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,320
How?

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,160
There's something

220
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,590
I'm sure I'm right about,

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
but Dad thinks I'm wrong.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,710
Who's correct?

223
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Me, obviously.

224
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,680
Did you investigate?

225
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,640
Investigate what?

226
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,790
The teacher says,

227
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,470
"No investigation, no right to speak."

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
Wise words.

229
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,470
Shanshan, be good.

230
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,630
I won't stay here for a few days.

231
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
If you miss me,

232
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,630
I'll take you to the cabin later.

233
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,590
Lu Ran!

234
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,830
Shut up and don't follow me.

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
Shanshan,

236
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,350
what did Mom say?

237
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,670
Mom said you should wait,

238
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,830
and she'll take me to the cabin.

239
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,800
So will you abandon Dad

240
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,990
to go with her?

241
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,160
Stop, you can't go in.

242
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,870
I need to see Director Sun.

243
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,800
You can't go in now.

244
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,710
No entry without a pass.

245
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,480
Is something wrong?

246
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,400
New orders.

247
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,270
No pass, no entry.

248
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,510
I've come often before.

249
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,600
I know that.

250
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,040
There's no way in now.

251
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,870
Just let me in.

252
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,790
Absolutely not.

253
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,920
We need to see the pass
before you can get in.

254
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,950
Fine, then.

255
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,630
(If the gate's blocked,)

256
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,920
(I'll climb the mountain.)

257
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,430
Wow,

258
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,830
it's so high.

259
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,470
Who knows

260
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,480
when this strike will end?

261
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
Excuse me,

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,320
can I ask a few questions?

263
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,030
Did you get

264
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,910
this month's pay?

265
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,730
No.

266
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,680
Speaking of which, I'm angry.

267
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,230
I haven't been paid for half a year.

268
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
No salary.

269
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
How long have you been working here?

270
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,320
I've been here ten years.

271
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,830
Seven or eight years.

272
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,350
He joined two years after me.

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Okay, thank you.

274
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,880
No need.

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,240
Let's go.

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,890
(5. Centralized KPI Management)
About two years.

277
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,790
So you're new here then.

278
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,080
How's the factory business
these two years?

279
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,280
Barely enough work to get by.

280
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,590
Why isn't the factory
taking external orders recently?

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,870
You go first.

282
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,870
If there are orders, why no money?

283
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,320
- I want to know too.
- Lu Ran.

284
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,670
Director Sun!

285
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,400
Thank you.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,990
Perfect timing.
I have some questions for you.

287
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,280
Here's the thing.

288
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,600
Our university now encourages students

289
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,830
to do social practice.

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,350
To promote industrial upgrading
in factories,

291
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,200
I'd like to ask you

292
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,230
about the difficulties
the factory is facing.

293
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
After all, no investigation
means no right to speak.

294
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Can these matters be casually discussed?

295
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,280
Just share
what you're comfortable saying.

296
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,470
Alright. Come with me.

297
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,920
Put your helmet on.

298
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,550
What about you?

299
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,630
Don't worry about me.

300
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,240
The workers' jobs...

301
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,870
Yeah, they all work here.

302
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,840
Director Sun, these years the factory...

303
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,710
Yeah, they were all built years ago.

304
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
Director Sun, let me finish.

305
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,680
Then ask something I can answer.

306
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,550
Busy?

307
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,470
Yes.

308
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,000
What's wrong?

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
What's up with Brother Qi today?

310
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,680
Bad mood.

311
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,950
Let's check.

312
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

313
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
- Brother Qi.
- Brother Qi.

314
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,670
Brother Qi!

315
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,590
What's wrong, Brother?

316
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,070
Tell us about it.

317
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,470
- It seems you're in a bad mood.
- Did you...

318
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,160
fight with Ran?

319
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,870
She's ignoring me.

320
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,110
It's definitely not Brother Qi's fault.

321
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,270
- Of course not.
- Right.

322
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,480
How could it be his fault?

323
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,120
- Brother Qi can't be wrong.
- Yes.

324
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,280
But Brother,

325
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,680
women...

326
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,280
sometimes need to be coaxed.

327
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,560
Right, Qiang?

328
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
They need coaxing.

329
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,110
Then... how to coax?

330
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,870
Ma Qiang knows.

331
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,790
He's experienced.

332
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,190
How?

333
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,510
Ran is a college student after all.

334
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,990
She's worldly.

335
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,840
- We can't follow conventional methods.
- Exactly.

336
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,910
You must do something she's never seen.

337
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,830
Right.

338
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,870
It's not just different,

339
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,440
but something Brother Qi's good at.

340
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,330
- Right.
- Correct.

341
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,790
- That's the answer.
- Exactly.

342
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,710
Brother,

343
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,590
what are you good at?

344
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,480
Don't you know?

345
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,520
Are you stupid?

346
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,790
What do we do?

347
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,990
We forge iron.

348
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,470
That's right.

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,520
Forging.

350
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,520
So what should we forge?

351
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,830
Taking over the steel factory
isn't impossible.

352
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,800
Taking over the steel factory
is possible.

353
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,080
Lu Ran, why don't you sleep on the bed?

354
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,630
Qi Shengfeng,

355
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,470
taking over the steel factory
isn't impossible.

356
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,440
I did research.

357
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,470
Why don't you understand?

358
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,830
Lu Ran, you're drooling.

359
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,040
You tricked me.

360
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,280
I prepared a gift for you.

361
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,090
♪Tell you my little wish on my behalf♪

362
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,750
You'll definitely like this gift.

363
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,030
I spent several days

364
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,560
making you an iron heart.

365
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,560
Iron heart. Look.

366
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,080
It weighs several jin.

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Pick it up.

368
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,840
No, you...

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,350
Lu Ran!

370
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,670
Go back now and rest early.

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,840
No...

372
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't you like it?

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,830
Don't you like the color, Lu Ran?

374
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,390
Maybe I'll change the color next time.

375
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,800
Lu Ran,

376
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
let's discuss the steel factory.

377
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,430

Brother!

383
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,640
Brother,

384
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,270
Ran didn't like that gift

385
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,350
you made last time.

386
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,480
Was it too small?

387
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,760
She said she'd never seen such a gift.

388
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,510
Never seen it?

389
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,870
Never seen it means she must like it.

390
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
Brother,

391
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,320
will you still pick up Ran
at university today?

392
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,800
She said not to come.

393
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,350
It means she doesn't like it.

394
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,190
President,

395
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,600
this is truly...

396
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,040
This is truly remarkable.

397
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Our Shuguang Group's

future talent reserves

399
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,190
will depend on you.

400
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,040
Chairwoman Bai, you're too kind.

401
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Thank Shuguang Group

402
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,760
for providing so many positions
to our school.

403
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,840
(Meng?)

404
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,390
Grandma, what's wrong?

405
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,990
Nothing.

406
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,400
Let's go.

407
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,870
(I said not to come,
so you really didn't come.)

409
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,880
Party Secretary Fang!

410
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,880
Lu?

411
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,030
Didn't I tell you to notify Lu...?

412
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,000
He told me.

413
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,910
Here's the situation.

414
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,430
I didn't know what to do back at school.

415
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,270
I didn't know when you'd return.

416
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,510
So I thought I'd wait here.

417
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,910
I need to report something.

418
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,360
You haven't eaten, have you?

419
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,640
Let's get something.

420
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Okay.

421
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,080
Lu,

422
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,190
you want to take over the steel factory?

423
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,830
Yes.

424
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,240
We did research

425
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,310
and prepared solutions for subsequent

426
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,520
steel factory reorganization.

427
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,340
(Steel Factory Issues and Solutions)

428
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,390
Where would you get that much money?

429
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,160
For the takeover funds,

430
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
we can get loans.

431
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,590
And I know

432
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,550
the reason leaders

433
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,760
hesitate to sign with Shuguang Group

434
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,550
is because they don't want

435
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,910
mass layoffs.

436
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,150
Now Shuguang Group

437
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,830
won't spend time and energy

438
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,080
reorganizing personnel.

439
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,560
They just want
to purge workers quickly with money.

440
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,870
Yeah, you're right.

441
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,630
Now Shuguang Group wants full layoffs.

442
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,550
And the worker severance

443
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,720
is minimal.

444
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,320
Then can you give us a chance to try?

445
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
Given Qi Shengfeng's feelings
for the steel factory,

446
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,830
plus his character and skills,

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,350
I believe we can do it.

448
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,880
Lu,

449
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,590
taking over a steel factory

450
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,350
isn't child's play.

451
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,230
Party Secretary Fang,

452
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,760
