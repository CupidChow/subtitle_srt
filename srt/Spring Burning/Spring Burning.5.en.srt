1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,840
Pillow

2
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,959
Go to sleep now.

3
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,039
What do you want to say?

4
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,479
Thank you.

5
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,000
The brothers were just saying it casually.

6
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,479
You even took it to heart and helped us find a livelihood.

7
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
I know.

8
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,319
Originally, this matter had nothing to do with you.

9
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,280
Now you have to worry about this with me.

10
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,919
Well, we are husband and wife.

11
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,080
Husband and wife should be of one mind.

12
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,759
Besides,

13
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,000
I also earn money myself.

14
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
This transportation business

15
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,800
has always been Zhou Huacheng's, the secretary's son.

16
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,159
If we take this job,

17
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
he will definitely cause trouble.

18
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,759
If he comes to cause trouble,

19
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll report it to the police.

20
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,800
In front of the police,

21
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
he wouldn't dare do anything to me.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
It's fine, I'll handle it tomorrow.

23
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,879
Just make sure the transportation is arranged.

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Go to sleep.

25
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,120
Don't just drink porridge

26
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,439
Come, have a steamed bun

27
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,519
Mom just made them, San'er

28
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,279
Using fresh flour

29
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,519
Time to eat

30
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,839
Hurry up and eat

31
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,480
People will be here soon

32
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm telling you

33
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,399
You didn't see it

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,439
Everyone was so happy to hear three yuan per person per day

35
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,319
They were so happy

36
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
The old Sun family

37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,439
Didn't they look down on you for being a blacksmith before?

38
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,519
Always said our family was down and out

39
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,319
Now they have to rely on us to pay their wages

40
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,600
Eat quickly, eat quickly

41
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,879
Okay

42
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,399
I'll leave this side to you for a while

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
I'll go to the oxygen cylinder factory first

44
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,720
Let me take you there first

45
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,519
No need

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Take care of things here

47
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
We'll split up

48
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,519
Then I'll have Ma Qiang go with you

49
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,519
Okay

50
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,759
We'll eat again next time

51
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,319
Alright

52
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,439
What do you all mean by this?

53
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,319
The third son of the Qi family

54
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,879
I know this

55
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,920
You want my men to help transport goods

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,839
But

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,639
We are all from the same village

58
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,600
You can't just do big business and eat meat alone

59
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,959
Let us have some soup

60
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
Yes, that's right

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,040
This oxygen tank factory is not close to the hospital

62
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,279
It's far

63
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:48,959
Sister-in-law

64
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,920
This job is indeed laborious

65
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,279
So, we give everyone three yuan a day

66
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,079
The third son of the Qi family

67
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,879
Help you with this job

68
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,959
Our men won't be able to do anything else

69
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,800
Right?

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,879
Yes, yes, yes

71
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,839
Add some money, add some money

72
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,319
Three yuan is not little

73
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,079
Everyone should be clear about this

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,199
Even if you go to town

75
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,000
without some skills

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,680
it's impossible to earn this money, right?

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,079
You can't say that

78
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,839
I know you gave your brother seven dollars

79
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,279
This job isn't easy, right?

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
We're all from the same village

81
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,480
I didn't take advantage of you

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes, that's right

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,600
I agreed to pay you three dollars

84
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,839
How did it become seven?

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Aunt, you can't say that

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,000
We're all helping your son, right?

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Right?

88
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes, yes

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,399
My son is helping you make money

90
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,519
We also helped him get jobs, right?

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,480
Alright, alright

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,519
Stop arguing, stop arguing

93
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,720
I worked hard to arrange business

94
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,279
hoping to improve everyone's life

95
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,199
Since everyone thinks it's troublesome

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,279
then forget it

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
No way

98
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,360
Third Brother, how about five bucks?

99
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
We're all from the same village

100
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,160
We're not taking advantage of you

101
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,399
Five bucks is fine, fine, fine

102
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,839
Five bucks is fine, five bucks is fine

103
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,360
Sister-in-law

104
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,480
Since everyone finds it so difficult

105
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,079
Let's pretend I never brought it up

106
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,600
No

107
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't go, Third Brother

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Come, come, come

109
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,480
Third Brother, five bucks is fine

110
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:03,879
Aren't you also in need?

111
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,399
Brother, as long as there's work

112
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,439
There won't be a shortage of people to do it

113
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,399
Mom

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Let's forget about it today

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,680
Then what about this work?

116
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't worry, someone will do it

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,920
Here they come

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,519
Brother Qi

119
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,279
Brother

120
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,279
Little Zhao is here

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,720
Brother Qi

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Everyone, go back

123
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,759
No need to trouble everyone

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,199
Third Brother Qi, we can discuss things

125
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,720
We can discuss things, let's go

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,959
Why did you leave? Really

127
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,519
You

128
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,680
Let's discuss it further

129
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,680
There's no more work

130
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,800
Let's talk about it later

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,600
There's no more work now

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,279
Didn't we say? Five bucks is fine

133
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,839
Brother

134
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,560
You brought us here early

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Did you already know they were going to cause trouble?

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
People are always greedy

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,759
Especially when there's profit to be made

138
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
Then why did you send them?

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,600
This cart business

140
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,279
We can't rely on just a few of us

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,600
Got it

142
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,680
Let them cause trouble first

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,079
Then set the rules for them

144
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,759
That's a clever move

145
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Let's go back to the shop

146
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's go

147
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,959
Pay up

148
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,040
If you're leaving, just go. You scared me!

149
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,120
What are you doing?

150
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,319
Hand it over

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Come on, let me try my luck

152
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,959
What luck? The money's all gone

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,759
What's wrong?

154
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,560
Here, take three cards

155
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,120
Give me a smile, brother

156
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,360
Okay

157
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,920
Come, shuffle the cards

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,879
Big brother, big brother

159
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,240
Alright, alright, are you calling for spirits?

160
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,120
Speak

161
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,439
Did that person come looking for you?

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,160
No

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
This time, you are quite patient

164
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,600
You haven't delivered the goods for two days

165
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,399
No, big brother

166
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,279
Yesterday's batch has already been delivered

167
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,399
Paid

168
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,240
Yes

169
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
No, which jerk dares to take my goods?

170
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
No, it's not our brothers

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,879
It's that woman named Lu Ran

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,879
Lu Ran

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,399
Yes

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
Your cousin

175
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,360
Impossible

176
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,840
She married into the village

177
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,159
Lu Ran is particularly ungrateful

178
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,919
Our family

179
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,960
Kindly wanted to find her a good family to marry into

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,919
She refused to marry

181
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
She pretended to hang herself to scare me

182
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,200
It scared me terribly

183
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,039
Alright, alright

184
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,919
My mom because of this

185
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,600
Had a headache and lay down for several days

186
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,759
Could it be the same name?

187
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
Definitely the same name

188
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,279
She married over there

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,120
Her husband's family must be keeping a close watch on her

190
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,519
That old lady from the Qi family

191
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,840
Is not easy to deal with

192
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,159
Besides

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,039
She doesn't have many acquaintances in town

194
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,279
Let alone in the village

195
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,639
Brother Acheng, she's alone

196
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,399
How could she possibly steal your delivery business?

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
Anyway, whether male or female

198
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,679
Dare to steal my goods, get them

199
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,519
Yes, get them, get them

200
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's go

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
Alright, Brother Cheng, let's go

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,039
Brother Acheng, I'll go with you

203
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
Baby, you go home first

204
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,039
It will be too bloody later

205
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,399
Don't get scared

206
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,720
Get the stuff

207
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,919
Let's go

208
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,080
How could it be her

209
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,159
It's good if she isn't beaten half to death

210
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,840
Xiao Lu, look

211
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,000
It's been half an hour already

212
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,919
Why haven't they arrived yet?

213
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,360
Could something have gone wrong?

214
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,759
Don't worry, Manager Zhang

215
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,840
I've arranged everything

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
They must be on their way

217
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,639
Xiao Lu

218
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,240
You seem uneasy

219
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,360
Let's be clear upfront

220
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,200
If this batch is delayed

221
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,360
I won't refund the deposit

222
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,759
I'll leave first

223
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,960
Manager Zhang, it's not delivery time yet

224
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,279
Why do you keep mentioning the non-refundable deposit?

225
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,279
Sis, they're here, sis

226
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,440
Quick, quick, Brother Qi, look

227
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,679
We won't get the penalty fee

228
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,120
Xiao Lu, just kidding

229
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,639
I trust you to handle things

230
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,679
Everyone's here

231
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,039
I'll go inside to handle something

232
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:23,960
Okay

233
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,600
Sis

234
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,759
I came a bit late

235
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,720
Did I delay anything?

236
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,399
No problem

237
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,200
Why is everyone here?

238
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,240
Everyone came together

239
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,159
The people from the village

240
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,600
Now know that someone is doing this job

241
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,879
They'll be at ease from now on

242
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You thought it through and left a backup plan

243
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,200
Thanks for your hard work, brothers

244
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,440
It's not hard

245
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,679
Come

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,759
Slow down, slow down

247
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,840
Slow down, slow down, slow down

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,559
Then you guys move slowly

249
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,159
Okay

250
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,919
Go ahead, Brother Qi

251
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,360
Then I'll go pick someone up

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,120
The problems at the steel factory are increasing.

253
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,720
Well, Zhou Rong, you sure are something.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
You have quite the nerve.

255
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,879
You actually dared to hide this from me.

256
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,559
Secretary Fang,

257
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
we actually have a heavy burden.

258
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,360
Secretary Fang, Secretary Zhou,

259
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,000
Director Sun,

260
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,840
Xiao Qi, what are you doing here?

261
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
My family is at the oxygen cylinder factory.

262
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,919
Leading the villagers to do some small business.

263
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,159
I knew you would come today.

264
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,559
So I thought I'd come over and say hello.

265
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,320
Leading the villagers to prosperity is a good thing.

266
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,360
Let's go over and take a look together.

267
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,120
Perfect timing.

268
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,399
I also want to inspect the oxygen cylinder factory.

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,639
Alright, I'll take you there.

270
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,120
Okay.

271
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,399
Secretary, then I won't go.

272
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,399
Alright, goodbye.

273
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,480
Thank you for your hard work.

274
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
I'll be leaving first.

275
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,519
Goodbye, Director.

276
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,360
I'm leaving, sister-in-law.

277
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Be careful on the road.

278
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,919
I'm leaving, sister-in-law.

279
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,559
Take it easy on the road, Qiangzi.

280
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Why don't you go with them to keep an eye on things?

281
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,080
No need, sister-in-law.

282
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,600
Brother Qi asked me to stay here with you.

283
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,360
Alright.

284
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,360
How about, Xiao Lu,

285
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,840
I take you to the finance office to settle the bill?

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,120
Sure, this way.

287
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:04,720
No, this car of yours

288
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
can't you drive it better for me?

289
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,240
Stand here, stand here

290
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,440
Back up, back up, back up

291
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,159
What are you doing?

292
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,519
Boss Zhou, what do you mean by this?

293
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,440
What do I mean?

294
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,799
What do you mean?

295
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,399
I

296
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,039
You don't want to do business with me, Zhou Huacheng, right?

297
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,399
I'm just delivering goods here

298
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,399
Whoever wants to come, I'll let them come

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,799
Fine

300
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,360
What do you mean now?

301
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,200
This

302
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,159
Boss Zhou, I

303
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,919
What could I mean?

304
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm just doing business

305
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,240
Get out

306
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,320
This

307
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,200
Get out where?

308
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't leave

309
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Lu Ran, right?

310
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,240
Lu Ran

311
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,120
Ran Ran Ran

312
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:45,879
Boss Zhou

313
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,879
It's better to have one more friend than one more enemy.

314
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
We're all in business.

315
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,960
Why don't we discuss how to cooperate?

316
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,159
Cooperate? Discuss cooperation with me?

317
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
A girl wants to cooperate with me?

318
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,120
Can you agree?

319
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,840
Definitely can't agree, no way.

320
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Take a look.

321
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,600
It's not that I don't agree.

322
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,759
My brothers don't agree.

323
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:07,960
Zhou Huacheng.

324
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,440
I think your attitude suggests you're looking for trouble.

325
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,120
Yes.

326
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,240
I guessed it long ago.

327
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,080
We've already reported to the police.

328
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Reported to the police.

329
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,200
Reported to the police.

330
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm so scared, where are they?

331
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,759
Where are you?

332
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,720
What are you doing? What are you doing?

333
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,639
What are you doing?

334
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,600
What do you want to do?

335
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,080
What are you doing? What do you want?

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
You, Qiangzi

337
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,200
What are you doing?

338
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,720
What are you doing?

339
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,480
Brother, they are bullying sister-in-law.

340
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,679
Yes, bullying her.

341
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,320
Zhou Huacheng

342
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,840
Sheng Feng

343
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
Brother, Sheng Feng, brother

344
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,879
Sheng Feng, you, brother

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,879
Sheng Feng

346
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,600
Alright, I'll tell you.

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Even the police chief has to call me brother.

348
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,039
Do you understand?

349
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:44,720
I

350
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,919
Dad

351
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,399
Dad

352
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,080
He

353
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,960
Darn thing

354
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,279
He hit me

355
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,639
Who told you to act like a jerk?

356
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,679
Showing off

357
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,440
He hit me

358
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,279
Are you okay?

359
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,080
What's going on, Xiao Qi?

360
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,080
Lu Ran, this is Secretary Fang.

361
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Secretary Fang.

362
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,080
We have been negotiating with this oxygen tank factory.

363
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,559
Discussed a shipping cooperation.

364
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,799
Paid the deposit and signed the contract.

365
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,639
Everything is legal and compliant.

366
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,519
Yes, yes.

367
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,759
We signed the contract.

368
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,519
What's wrong with you?

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,919
I don't have a contract.

370
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,039
But originally this job

371
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,000
was done by us.

372
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
Why did they take it away?

373
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,320
They won't let us live.

374
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,759
You useless jerk.

375
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,159
You embarrass yourself all day long.

376
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,600
Get out, go back home.

377
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,840
Wait till I get back and deal with you.

378
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,720
Let's go.

379
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,720
Xiao Qi,

380
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,279
I'm sorry for today.

381
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,639
I'll educate him properly when I get home.

382
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,480
Old Zhou,

383
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,279
your son is quite something.

384
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,799
Arrogant and overbearing, relying on others' power.

385
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,360
If there's a next time,

386
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,840
your term as town committee secretary will be over.

387
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes, yes.

388
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,440
Secretary Fang,

389
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,919
this Xiao Qi,

390
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,600
I've never heard you mention him before.

391
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,279
His name is Qi Shengfeng.

392
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,639
He was an outstanding youth in our province last year.

393
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,600
He helped repair the imported equipment at the steel plant.

394
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,039
He's a very outstanding young man.

395
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,759
So you're Qi Shengfeng.

396
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,799
I've often heard the leaders mention you.

397
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,080
But I've never met you.

398
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,879
You're truly young and promising.

399
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,039
Let's cooperate more in the future.

400
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,399
Stay in touch.

401
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm so angry

402
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,519
I'm so angry

403
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,360
I really

404
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,480
I really, I really am

405
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm falling apart

406
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,080
How do I have brothers like you

407
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm asking you

408
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,960
The secretary came today

409
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,360
Why didn't you tell me

410
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,120
Big brother, you didn't know either

411
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,399
How would I know

412
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,200
And that

413
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,960
I don't even know who that person is

414
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,559
Yes, big brother

415
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,240
That's right

416
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,879
It's not your fault

417
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:05,879
Come

418
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Bad luck today

419
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:09,960
Really unlucky

420
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,639
Come on, cheers, cheers

421
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,399
Cheers

422
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,159
Sis

423
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,080
You don't know

424
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,480
Seeing Brother Qi so calm

425
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,679
When he came over at noon

426
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,120
He was afraid you'd run into Zhou Huacheng alone

427
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,919
The wheels were almost sparking

428
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,960
I can vouch for that

429
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,480
Brother Qi was riding like he was sprinting

430
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,639
We couldn't keep up

431
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,639
Weren't you all together?

432
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Brother Qi was worried something might happen to you

433
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,039
He arrived early

434
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,039
He was waiting outside

435
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Pretending to come with us

436
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,159
Yeah

437
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,159
Right

438
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,480
Where are you going, bro?

439
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,759
I'm going to the bathroom

440
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,000
Brother Qi is shy

441
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
Brother Qi definitely didn't say

442
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,720
The city leaders really like Brother Qi

443
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,519
Right

444
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,799
Was he always like this?

445
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,919
He wasn't like this

446
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:51,600
He wasn't like this

447
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,320
Maybe he's only like this with you

448
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,919
Yeah, yeah

449
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,159
Sorry, sorry

450
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,440
This is really good, Sis

451
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
Does he know any other girls?

452
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,679
No, no, no

453
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,559
No, no, no

454
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:04,920
No

455
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,599
Absolutely not

456
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,599
You're his first

457
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:07,920
First love

458
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,759
Yeah, yeah

459
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,039
First love, first love, first love

460
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,160
Really his first love, really

461
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,960
How did you bring the leader here?

462
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,079
Secretary Fang comes at this time every month.

463
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,359
I specifically went to wait for him today.

464
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,519
I also had him take a look at the oxygen cylinder factory.

465
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:28,799
Not bad.

466
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,680
You are both brave and wise, Comrade Qi.

467
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,599
Zhou Huacheng came to cause trouble today.

468
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,880
If we get into a conflict,

469
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,039
it will be considered a public disturbance.

470
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,440
It would be more trouble than it's worth.

471
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
You are thorough and discreet.

472
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,039
You are like this at home,

473
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,279
and also at work.

474
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,039
And why haven't I heard you mention

475
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,319
the Outstanding Youth of the Province award?

476
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
It was recommended by the city leaders.

477
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,119
I don't think I did anything

478
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,039
remarkable.

479
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,400
There's nothing much to say.

480
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,839
You are really modest.

481
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,039
Hey, where are we?

482
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,319
This is our home.

483
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,920
Why does the wind make me feel dizzy?

484
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,359
Who are you?

485
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,839
I am Qi Shengfeng.

486
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,119
Be careful.

487
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,799
Qi Shengfeng.

488
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,119
I really can't let you drink anymore after this.

489
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,240
You just look honest.

490
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,039
But you have your own ideas.

491
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes, yes, yes.

492
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,680
Whatever you say.

493
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,680
Do you have a lot on your mind?

494
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,720
You've had too much to drink.

495
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,799
Come, sleep.

496
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,880
Come.

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,640
Come on.

498
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,640
Come.

499
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,039
Lift your foot.

500
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,200
Come.

501
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,319
Lu Ran, you

502
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,160
You drank too much

503
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,440
I didn't

504
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
I, I need to go out

505
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,240
I didn't

506
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,480
Do you have feelings for me?

507
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:29,759
I

508
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,960
Dad

509
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,240
What's wrong with Mom, Shanshan?

510
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,640
Mom, Mom drank too much.

511
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
I want to sleep with Mom.

512
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,759
Okay, you sleep with Mom.

513
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Come

514
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,200
Didn't drink too much

515
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,279
Spend quality time with mom

516
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,920
Awake

517
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,240
Good morning

518
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,039
Did you sleep well yesterday

519
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,240
Pretty good

520
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,359
Last night I

521
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,680
You drank too much yesterday

522
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,759
We can't drink like this anymore

523
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,799
I didn't do anything weird, did I?

524
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
It was just on the way back yesterday

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,519
You got a bit tipsy from the breeze

526
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,160
Then you came back and quickly freshened up

527
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,359
and then went to sleep

528
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,319
What are you writing?

529
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,039
Take a look.

530
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,480
I want to set some rules for the villagers.

531
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,200
Didn't we sign a long-term cooperation with the oxygen tank factory?

532
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
Didn't we sign a long-term cooperation?

533
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,279
We should also sign one with the villagers.

534
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,680
This way, things will be done properly in the future.

535
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,079
But the business is yours.

536
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
So I want to discuss it with you first.

537
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,920
Although you said you wanted to discuss it with me,

538
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,359
you still need to implement it.

539
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,559
And I see

540
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,079
you already have some ideas.

541
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,559
This is what I think.

542
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,440
Sign a contract with the villagers.

543
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,200
But they need to provide collateral.

544
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,319
The daily wage is fixed at two yuan.

545
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,119
If someone doesn't work properly

546
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,079
or has any complaints,

547
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,920
we won't use them.

548
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
They need to know

549
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,599
If there's trouble

550
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,400
it won't benefit anyone

551
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,440
I agree

552
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,440
With contracts and collateral

553
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,160
they will work more diligently

554
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,519
and won't cause trouble easily

555
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,960
How do we arrange things for the brothers?

556
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,480
Three pieces

557
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
This price is reasonable

558
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,200
Steady and sustainable

559
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,799
We need to plan for the future

560
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Alright

561
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,799
Develop slowly like this

562
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,079
Once we have funds

563
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,200
the shop can gradually expand

564
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,880
I've also been thinking about the shop's expansion recently

565
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,400
Let's take it step by step

566
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
What's the situation with these people outside?

567
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,680
These are the villagers who wanted more money yesterday

568
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,720
Here they come again

569
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You eat something first

570
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,319
I'll go talk to them

571
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,559
Here they come, here they come, here they come

572
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,119
Third Brother

573
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,640
Third Brother

574
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,319
Sit, sit, sit, everyone sit

575
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,039
Sit, sit, sit

576
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,039
Old Third, three pieces it is.

577
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,559
We'll take this job.

578
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,279
We neighbors help each other out.

579
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,240
Help each other out.

580
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,519
Help each other out.

581
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,599
That's how it is.

582
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,240
Ours is a long-term arrangement.

583
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,319
So we need to sign a contract with everyone.

584
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,000
We need to use something as collateral.

585
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,359
The wage is fixed at two dollars a day.

586
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,559
Everyone is free to choose.

587
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,559
It's okay if you don't want to do it.

588
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,160
Sheng Feng, about the previous matter,

589
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
we were wrong.

590
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,240
We almost delayed your important business.

591
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
It won't happen again.

592
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
No, no, definitely not.

593
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
Tomorrow, there's still work, right?

594
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,920
We will definitely work hard.

595
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,599
Definitely work hard.

596
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,359
San'er, this, this, this...

597
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,759
What are you doing?

598
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:21,680
San'er, you forgot.

599
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,279
This group said they want to raise the price.

600
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,319
You can't take them.

601
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,480
Don't take us.

602
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,480
You said it before.

603
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,240
If this delivery doesn't arrive, we'll lose 500 yuan.

604
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,519
What are you saying? What are you saying?

605
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,519
Wasn't it you who told me to ask for seven yuan? Nonsense.

606
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,279
Don't listen to her nonsense.

607
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,440
How am I talking nonsense? You said it.

608
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,200
I can testify.

609
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,440
It was Tan Hong who said it.

610
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,839
She even asked us to give her two yuan.

611
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
What are you saying?

612
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,039
Why are you hitting people?

613
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,200
You can't hit people. You can't hit people.

614
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll tear your mouth apart.

615
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,519
I'll beat you to death.

616
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,119
That's enough.

617
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,160
Second sister-in-law, go back to the room first.

618
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,279
You can't listen to them.

619
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,920
Go back.

620
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,000
This, this...

621
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,480
Since everyone thinks two yuan is too little

622
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,440
then forget it.

623
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,960
No, it's not too little, not too little.

624
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,519
Don't go, let's discuss it further.

625
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
No one is showing any sincerity.

626
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
How can we discuss this matter?

627
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,519
Third Brother

628
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,920
We can still talk about these two yuan.

629
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,240
Yes, yes, right.

630
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,039
This matter is reasonable and fair.

631
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
It's beneficial for everyone.

632
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We are all from the same village.

633
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,480
Is it meaningful to do this repeatedly?

634
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,519
Is it meaningful?

635
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,599
I promise

636
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,480
In the future, we will definitely work hard.

637
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,319
We won't mess around anymore.

638
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,200
Yes, yes, I promise too.

639
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,319
Alright then.

640
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,599
If anyone causes trouble again

641
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
we won't use them anymore.

642
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
They will have to return all the previous wages.

643
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,119
Does everyone agree?

644
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,680
No objections, no objections, no objections.

645
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,039
Then let's sign, sign, sign.

646
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,759
Come on, sign it.

647
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,160
Hurry up, sign it.

648
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,400
Come on, you sign first, you sign first.
