19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,200
Mom, we're back.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,120
You're so late.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,430
Come on, have a bite.

22
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,870
I made noodles for you.

23
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,710
Shanshan's sleeping with me tonight.

24
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,080
Don't worry about it, okay?

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,630
Lu Ran,

26
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,510
Shenggong is too honest.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,560
That's why he got scammed.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Mom, it's no big deal.

29
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,320
Everything's been resolved now.

30
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,870
Alright, alright.

31
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,230
I'll go tell him right away

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,760
and asked him not to be upset anymore.

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,160
Eat quickly.
Rest early after you finish.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm going to bed.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,460
Leave the bowls.
I'll clean them tomorrow.

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,550
Got it.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,480
Lu Ran,

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,200
Shenggong has caused you trouble
this time.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,200
Everyone makes mistakes.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,960
You can't be so harsh

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,480
on him just because
of this one error, right?

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,270
Of course not.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm just afraid he'll be used again.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,160
I know.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,830
You lectured him. He knows he was wrong.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,550
We're a family.

48
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,600
Rules are important,
but we still need to tolerate each other.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,790
Let's not talk about this incident.

50
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,200
Before this,

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
didn't he manage the cart business

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
quite well?

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,880
If Shenggong acts foolish again,

54
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,360
you can go discipline him.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
Thank you.

56
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm hungry.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,360
I'll head home after eating.

58
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,640
You can stay here tonight.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
I told Mom

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,280
you moved out for school.

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,440
If you leave this late,

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,040
it'll be hard to explain.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,040
You have a point.

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,790
Then I'll stay.

65
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,710
You...

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,670
I'll sleep on the floor.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,390
The noodles are cold.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Eat them.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,870
- Not bad, huh?
- It's delicious.

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,440
Wei, Qiang.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Brothers.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,950
- Ran.
- Come here.

73
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,390
- Come on.
- Food's ready.

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Brothers, come quickly.

75
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,190
So much food.

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,120
Ran brings good fortune
whenever she comes.

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Another feast.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,310
Come here.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,920
Help yourselves.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
Yes.

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,720
- Everyone's worked hard.
- Ran's too kind.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,950
Here, chopsticks.

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
Here.

84
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,280
Thank you, Ran.

85
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,790
Thank you.

86
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,320
- Here.
- It smells so good.

87
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,120
How's the goods?

88
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,440
Don't worry, Ran.

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,830
Before Brother Qi left,

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,510
he made a new auxiliary production mold.

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,830
It's faster than before.

92
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,780
We'll definitely finish.

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
With Shengfeng gone,
we're relying on everyone.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,340
- You're too polite.
- Ran, you're too kind.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,710
This is what we should do.

96
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,990
And

97
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,120
after Brother Qi settles

98
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,030
Shuguang Group's last batch payment,

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,750
our whole workshop will thrive.

100
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,710
Yes, that's right.

101
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,840
Qiang,

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,470
are the college students
coming to class soon?

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
It's over.

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,240
- I totally forgot.
- How could you forget?

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
What's this with college students?

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,000
Ran, didn't you know?

107
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,720
Brother Qi connected

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
with university leaders.

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,800
They said
they want students to intern here.

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,440
The leaders inspected us recently

111
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,270
and they were super impressed.

112
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,440
Ran, you should've seen

113
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
those leaders.

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
They are so impressive.

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,910
When was this?

116
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,430
- About ten days ago.
- Yeah.

117
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,590
- Roughly.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,600
That day, Brother Qi said he wanted

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,350
to discuss having students study here.

120
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,830
Ran, can you believe it?

121
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,390
I didn't think we'd be teaching

122
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,600
university students one day.

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,520
Exactly.

124
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,910
It's a shame

125
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,470
they're all male students.

126
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,240
- What are you thinking?
- Hurry up and eat.

127
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
Always joking around.

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,160
Eat now.

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,720
Lu Ran.

130
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,120
Why do you visit all day?

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
No real business?

132
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
I have a business.

133
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,430
Then tell me.

134
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,950
I went to Shuguang Group today.

135
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,720
They were very satisfied
after inspection

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
and placed another order.

137
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,310
What else?

138
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,080
Also...

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,080
I want to see you.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,920
And then?

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,880
And then...

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,830
I... I want to see you.

143
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,390
If I don't ask,

144
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,800
will you never tell me things?

145
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,600
What things?

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,350
I know about your factory's
school partnership.

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,200
It has to do with me

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
getting a chance to take a make-up exam,

149
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
doesn't it?

150
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,880
You earned this chance

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,470
because your grades are good.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
Why do you always

153
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,350
think of others

154
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,680
but bottle up your own words?

155
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,390
Fang Hongyang came

156
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,830
to claim credit with me.

157
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,590
I didn't even know.

158
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,150
The last time he came to your house,
I thought...

159
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,670
What did you think?

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,350
I thought you liked him.

161
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,440
Are you a blockhead?

162
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,440
Don't you know who I like?

163
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,200
I...

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
No...

165
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,790
I know.

166
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,000
I know who you like.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Lu Ran.

168
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
When will you come home with me?

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,830
I'll consider it.

170
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,870
It depends on my mood.

171
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,030
Consider it, huh?

172
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,110
Alright.

173
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,630
Then take your time.

174
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,750
I'll... I'll come back later.

175
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,240
No, I'll see you tomorrow...

176
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480
What exactly do you want to say?

177
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,720
I...

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Just...

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,080
keep considering.

180
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
Rest early.

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,950
Remember to use this desk lamp.

182
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,440
It's better for your eyes.

183
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,520
Got it. Go home.

184
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,670
I'm leaving.

185
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,520
I'll come by tomorrow.

186
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,380
(Enlistment Honor)

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,520
Shanshan,

188
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
what does Mom mean by this?

189
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
Is she angry?

190
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,680
Why won't she come back?

191
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,280
Dad, I'm sleepy.

192
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,800
Shanshan, sweetheart.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,040
Don't sleep.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,670
Did Mom mention

195
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,680
if she's coming back lately?

196
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,040
Ask her yourself.

197
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,400
What does she really mean?

198
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,700
(The 4th Provincial University Games
are held at our school.)

199
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,320
It's really impressive.

200
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,430
Lu Ran,

201
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,750
you can score over 90

202
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,280
in such a short time.

203
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,760
That's great.

204
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
The top scorer only beat you
by two points.

205
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,670
Okay.

206
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,920
You've passed my class.

207
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,870
Thank you, Teacher Wang.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
How about other courses?

209
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,440
Do you have confidence in them?

210
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,880
Yes.

211
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Good.

212
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,160
Dad, do you miss Mom?

213
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Mom finishes her exams today.

214
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,080
We'll see her soon.

215
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,830
What do you know, kid?

216
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,750
Mom, you're back.

217
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,800
How was the exam?

218
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
Did my best. Results are fate.

219
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,560
Here's a chocolate for you.

220
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,310
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

221
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,190
Get back here!

222
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,040
Keep running!

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Hit me if you dare.

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,270
If you don't, you're not a man!

225
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,550
Okay, you think I won't?

226
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,870
I...

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,870
Still running?

228
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,790
Should I hit you?

229
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,790
Let me ask you,

230
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,590
did you find Fang Hongyang?

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,800
Did you incite things
about Qi Shengfeng?

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
You ruinous woman!

233
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,400
Now the cart business is gone.

234
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,630
How do I support you?

235
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,520
What's happening?

236
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,320
She's pregnant!

237
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,440
Stop making trouble, Mom!

238
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,600
Listen,

239
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,080
now that the cart business is gone,

240
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,630
even the clients have left.

241
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm losing it!

242
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,110
You jinx!

243
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,710
Cheng! Cheng!

244
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,800
Shall I call her?

245
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,710
- Okay.
- Manager Zhang?

246
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,120
Why didn't you tell me?

247
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,470
Manager Zhang has business for you.

248
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,880
I came to discuss

249
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,710
cart business.

250
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,080
My friend

251
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
kept using Zhou Huacheng's cart,

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,350
but deliveries kept getting delayed.

253
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,080
He really wants to meet you

254
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,680
and collaborate with you.

255
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,320
Then let Shenggong handle it.

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
The cart business is still his domain.

257
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,550
Lu,

258
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,680
this friend is my referral.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,560
Don't cause trouble again.

260
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,830
Don't worry. Never again.

261
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,520
Okay, I'll leave now.

262
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,950
Alright.

263
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,960
Manager Zhang, leaving already?

264
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,200
Yeah, factory matters.

265
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,120
Well then, take care.

266
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,040
Goodbye.

267
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,280
Mom, let me.

268
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,630
Shouldn't you move back after exams?

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,160
I need to study in the city.

270
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,990
Must you study?

271
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,510
My son will live like a widower.

272
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,430
Mom!

273
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,680
Fine, I'll keep it.

274
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,710
I'll come back weekly

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,950
when school's light.

276
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,470
She comes back too late.
I'm afraid to bother you.

277
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
Oh no.

278
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,350
I have homework to do.

279
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,870
Mom, I'm leaving.

280
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,080
I... I'll walk you out.

281
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,550
Mom, I'll walk her.

282
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,710
Flatterer.

283
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,190
Flatterer!

284
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,280
Flatterer.

285
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
What'll you do later?

286
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,920
Tidy up. Then study.

287
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,510
Tidying means

288
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,870
chores I can help with.

289
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,520
- Let's go.
- No need. Go back.

290
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,150
I can really do it,

291
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,120
such as cleaning windows,

292
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,840
mopping floors, moving beds...

293
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,270
Since when are you so observant?

294
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,080
Was Mom wrong about your widower life?

295
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,810
♪Light, etched on the old wall♪

296
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,470
Don't do this again. It's too dangerous.

297
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,990
You... put me down.

298
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,530
♪With you by your side♪

299
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
Is your hand okay?

300
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,470
- Fine.
- Let me wipe.

301
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,140
♪Traded for bolts of red silk♪

302
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,800
♪Wait, love braving the stormy tides♪

303
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,040
Cleaning windows, huh?

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,370
♪Perhaps in this world, only you♪

305
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,230
Are you doing housework?

306
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,470
Yeah.

307
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,950
Look, I cleaned well.

308
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,710
♪Even as time flows♪

309
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
Let me do it.

310
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,870
You're going to the workshop

311
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
before dark.

312
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,760
So...

313
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
really don't need me?

314
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,290
♪Trust the end that it will bloom♪

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Then I'll go.

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,920
Go.

317
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,750
I... I'll really go.

318
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
Go.

319
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm leaving.

320
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,720
Go now.

321
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Hurry up.

322
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,110
Don't clean that up until I get back.

323
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,520
Watch out.

324
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm leaving.

325
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,080
Ran.

326
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,030
Ran!

327
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,030
Shenggong, why are you here?

328
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,960
I brought two people for you to check.

329
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,430
Come here.

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,030
They're...?

331
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,910
They're the representatives
of Zhou Huacheng's team.

332
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,590
They want to follow your lead.

333
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,320
- Right.
- Exactly.

334
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
What do you think?

335
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,080
Is that okay?

336
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,670
If they want to work under me,
that's fine.

337
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,430
But I have many rules here.

338
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,040
They must sign contracts
and pay deposits.

339
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,390
No unauthorized strikes.

340
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,320
And they must cooperate
with the arrangements.

341
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,400
- No problem, Ms. Lu.
- No problem.

342
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,430
Don't call me Ms. Lu.

343
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,110
So what do you think?

344
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,350
- Alright.
- That's great.

345
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,990
- Thank you, Ms. Lu.
- Thank you, Ms. Lu.

346
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,300
(Administration Building)

347
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,750
Grandma.

348
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,670
What's the current situation
with the steel factory?

349
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,760
Shantou Town Steel Factory
has outdated equipment,

350
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,830
overstaffed personnel,

351
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,260
and disorganized internal management.

352
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,270
Ms. Bai,

353
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,920
the steel factory
is being contracted out

354
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,870
due to poor management.

355
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,480
This is all the information.

356
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,390
We need to take over the steel factory.

357
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,910
If we contract it,

358
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,000
our Shuguang Group's industrial chain

359
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,530
will be complete.

360
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
In the future, we won't be constrained

361
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,460
at any stage.

362
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,840
Both contracting and restructuring
of the steel factory are major projects.

363
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,820
Mr. Fang's father holds a key position.

364
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,980
We can ask him
to facilitate connections.

365
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,980
Then...

366
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,140
Then it's settled.

367
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,900
Simeng, you handle the connections.

368
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Let Fang Hongyang assist you.

369
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,980
But Grandma,

370
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,940
Fang Hongyang recently

371
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,100
made mistakes with supplier issues.

372
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,820
Using him...

373
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,780
Fang Hongyang's father

374
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,020
is the Party Secretary Fang of our city.

375
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,460
I understand, Grandma.

376
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,500
Then hurry up with the arrangements.

377
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,620
Still no news?

378
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,660
None.

379
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,780
I see.

380
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,500
(Meng)

381
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,380
(Where exactly are you?)

382
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,990
(Shuguang Group)
The contract needs revisions here.

383
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,100
Secretary Tong.

384
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
Ms. Bai,

385
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,380
is Grandma asking
about her biological daughter?

386
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,180
Yes.

387
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,340
After all these years,

388
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,620
there's still no clue?

389
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,140
The young lady went missing decades ago.

390
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,780
Searching like this is like

391
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,540
fishing for a needle in the ocean.

392
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,660
Are there any other leads?

393
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
When she got lost,

394
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,620
she was wearing a longevity lock.

395
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,220
But after all these years,

396
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,140
there's been no trace.

397
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,980
Qi Shengfeng.

398
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,300
We're at the school gate.

399
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,580
It might affect your reputation.

400
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,380
What's there to fear?

401
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,260
This is how relationships work.

402
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,820
You should even kiss me.

403
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,420
Really?

404
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,060
I've never dated before.

405
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,900
Me neither.

406
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,740
But I've seen others date.

407
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,460
The teacher praised me.

408
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,260
He said
my make-up exam results were good

409
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,140
and let me continue junior year classes.

410
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,740
I can also take missed courses

411
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,140
with next year's juniors.

412
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,580
I knew you could do it.

413
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,780
By the way,

414
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,460
we need to hurry with finding a school

415
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,420
for Shanshan.

416
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,820
I've looked.

417
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,940
Let's go check now.

418
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,230
- Okay.
- Let's go.

419
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,660
Come on, get on the bike.

420
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,140
