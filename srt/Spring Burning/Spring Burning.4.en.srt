1
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,319
By the way

2
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,760
Can you take me with you when you go to the city to deliver goods?

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
I came in a hurry

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,519
I didn't bring many things

5
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,040
I want to go to the city to buy some things

6
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,200
If it's inconvenient, never mind

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,040
It's convenient

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
Everyone, hurry up and eat. Gather at the village entrance after eating

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
No problem, okay, okay

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
What's inconvenient about this?

11
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,799
You're too polite, sister-in-law

12
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,040
If there's anything you need to move, I'll help you

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,879
Hurry up and eat

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
So many dishes can't shut your mouth

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,959
That fish is also delicious

16
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,840
Okay, okay

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
This is probably a secret recipe.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Thank you for your hard work, sister-in-law.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,199
It's really delicious.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,759
Only these are left.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,639
Everyone has left.

22
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,240
Gone.

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:23,800
Let me help you.

24
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,759
Don't get wet.

25
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,120
Okay.

26
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,479
Are you having such a hard time now?

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,639
The factory's performance isn't good.

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,879
The brothers take turns working at the shop.

29
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,879
So, you're struggling like this,

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,000
but you still keep so many brothers with you?

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,759
We've been brothers for so many years.

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
I have to take responsibility for them.

33
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,560
That's pretty good.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
You're loyal.

35
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,919
By the way, second sister-in-law

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,520
It's nothing

37
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,680
just some trivial matters between women

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,039
after all, we are sisters-in-law in name now

39
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,280
By the way,

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,919
Mom asked for the meal money.

41
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,080
I didn't pay.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,319
I even argued with her.

43
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,960
Now I'm giving you the money.

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
You decide what to do.

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,719
You're a reasonable person.

46
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,680
If Mom

47
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,960
makes you feel uncomfortable,

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
I can talk to her for you.

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,199
That's not necessary.

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,400
About Shanshan

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,719
I'm sorry

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,759
It was my oversight

53
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
About Shanshan

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,159
I am very grateful to you

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,039
Be careful

56
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,520
Did you twist your ankle?

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Brother Qi

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Sister-in-law

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
I, um

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,199
I put the fan in your room

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
You guys continue, you guys continue

62
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,519
I'll go now

63
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,360
Go ahead

64
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,800
Um, don't let mom see the floor bed

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
And it's hard to open the window

66
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,199
It's hot now

67
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm afraid you might not be used to it

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,759
You're too polite

69
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,439
Thank you

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,600
No problem

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,519
I've only been in this house for two days

72
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,519
and so much has already happened

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,360
none of them are easy to deal with

74
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,480
but

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,560
Qi Shengfeng really is a man.

76
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,800
I need to think.

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,519
How can I make sure that the father and daughter

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
live a better life?

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Do you need me to take you there?

80
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,759
No need.

81
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,399
I need to go to several places to buy things.

82
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,199
Okay.

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,439
Wait for me in the car after you finish shopping.

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,240
I'll go find them.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Alright.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,399
Here's the key.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,720
It'll be easier for you to come back later.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
See you later.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,519
Mr. Zhou, please make an exception.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,720
I've already explained it very clearly to you.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Stop nagging, will you?

92
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,639
No, with you like this

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,279
It's really hard for me, Mr. Zhou.

94
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,439
What else do you want me to do?

95
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,519
What do you want?

96
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,560
Mr. Zhou, you know this batch is urgent.

97
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,079
You can't just raise the price arbitrarily.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Stop talking nonsense.

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
What do you mean by raising the price arbitrarily?

100
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,319
I already told you.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm negotiating with you.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
But we agreed on this price a long time ago.

103
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,759
I'm telling you,

104
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
All the big shots in town are my people.

105
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,759
Do it if you want, if not, get lost.

106
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,800
This

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
Mr. Zhou, you

108
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,199
Think it over clearly.

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,720
This

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Boss Zhou

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,519
Or else, let's go

112
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,600
Let's discuss it again.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,319
Pfft

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
If it weren't for having a good dad

115
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
What do you think you are

116
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,759
Isn't this an opportunity

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,959
I need to ask

118
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,199
Comrade, what's the situation

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,399
It's none of your business

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,079
I might be able to help you

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,319
I have a car

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Your car

123
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,839
It's like this, comrade

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,079
The hospital in this town

125
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Needs our oxygen tanks

126
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,600
They must be delivered by tomorrow morning

127
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,120
It's a matter of life and death for the patients

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Isn't it

129
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,519
We had arranged the delivery beforehand

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,639
He raised the price on the spot

131
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,040
Comrade

132
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,040
Why don't you help me deliver the goods

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll pay you

134
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,839
Just right

135
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,519
My car is a delivery vehicle

136
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,800
And it happens to be an urgent order

137
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,040
I can help

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,279
However

139
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,720
If I help you

140
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Then the work from your factory

141
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,439
You have to give it to me in the future

142
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
Why don't we go over and talk

143
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,639
This way

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,639
Sit here, come

145
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,439
Miss, how should I address you?

146
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
My name is Lu Ran.

147
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,120
Lu Ran, right?

148
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,519
Our main client?

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,759
Mainly hospitals.

150
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,240
But there are also other small shops.

151
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,079
Your car can't pass through the small road.

152
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,199
So, I'm worried.

153
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,839
You don't need to worry about moving the goods.

154
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
We usually transport some goods too.

155
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,000
Our oxygen tanks are very valuable here.

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,920
They must not be bumped or scratched.

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,079
Alright.

158
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,720
We will transport them carefully.

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,759
May I ask,

160
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,800
how many goods do you have in total?

161
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,519
For this batch,

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,079
there are forty tanks in total.

163
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
For each tank,

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
I can give you one dollar.

165
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
For a regular transporter,

166
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,079
one car can carry two tanks.

167
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,639
That would be forty dollars.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
That's more than what they earn at the steel factory

169
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,959
in a month.

170
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
So, do you have the final say on this?

171
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,200
Of course, I have the final say on this.

172
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,720
I am the factory director here.

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,679
Not to mention,

174
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
our factory,

175
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
has at least ten to twenty orders every day.

176
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,879
I can give all of them to you.

177
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
But, to prevent

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
someone like Zhou Huacheng from raising prices arbitrarily,

179
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,200
we need to write a contract.

180
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
Signing the contract is not a problem.

181
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,519
But you need to include the minimum quantity you promised us.

182
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,039
In that contract.

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
That's not a problem.

184
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,240
It's just that I'm worried.

185
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,000
You might stop after completing two orders.

186
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,840
How about this?

187
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,039
You just need to pay a deposit of five hundred yuan.

188
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,440
We'll include it in the contract.

189
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
If we can secure this deal,

190
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,480
the five hundred yuan deposit

191
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,919
will be earned back in a little over a month.

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,879
Alright

193
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,000
If we all lose our jobs

194
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,039
We can't rely on

195
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,639
Brother Qi's mold shop to get by

196
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,440
That shop

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,039
Brother Qi can handle it alone

198
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,120
We can only help out at most

199
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,600
It's fine, we're all brothers

200
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,639
Where is Sis?

201
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,600
Why hasn't she come back yet?

202
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,000
She didn't run away again, did she?

203
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't talk nonsense. Shut your darn mouth.

204
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,799
Is Sis that kind of person?

205
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,919
She might have gone to buy something.

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's wait a bit longer.

207
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,639
Wait a bit longer.

208
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,639
Okay, fine, let's wait a bit longer.

209
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,200
Sis

210
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,200
Sis

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,720
Sis

212
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Sis

213
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,000
Sis

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,159
What's with your expressions?

215
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,679
You don't think I ran away again, do you?

216
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,639
No, no.

217
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,279
No.

218
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,519
We were just talking about work.

219
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,399
The director just had a meeting with us.

220
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
He said the factory's performance isn't good.

221
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,679
We might all have to turn to Brother Qi.

222
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
Don't talk nonsense.

223
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,639
Brother Qi's mold shop.

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,519
We can't support so many people.

225
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Brothers, don't worry.

226
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,399
As long as I'm here,

227
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,759
I won't let you go hungry.

228
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,080
Brother Qi, you can do it.

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,879
You know, there are so many laid-off workers in our village.

230
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,399
How can we take care of all of them?

231
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,720
If I were your wife, I'd scold you.

232
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,960
You're just a good-for-nothing nice guy.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
Sis, don't worry.

234
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,600
We won't be a burden to Brother Qi.

235
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,639
We won't bother you.

236
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,559
Yes.

237
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,679
You are brothers.

238
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,159
It's right to help each other.

239
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,840
It sounds like you need money.

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,960
Yes.

241
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,759
Maybe I can help.

242
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,279
It's like this

243
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
I was just about to discuss with you

244
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,679
This oxygen cylinder factory

245
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,240
I made a business deal with them

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
Really, really, sis

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Really, what's going on?

248
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
This oxygen tank factory

249
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,799
specifically supplies hospitals

250
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
I happened to see today

251
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
their manager arguing with someone

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was the delivery guy

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,799
raising the price on the spot

254
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
And it just so happens that today the hospital

255
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,159
has a particularly high demand for oxygen tanks

256
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,519
So I thought

257
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,440
we usually transport some steel, right?

258
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,240
If we transport these oxygen tanks

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,279
it shouldn't be a big problem

260
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,840
So I tried talking to their manager

261
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,519
and managed to get the order

262
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,639
We even signed a contract

263
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,840
Sis, you're amazing

264
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,919
I've worked at the steel factory for five years

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,440
I didn't know

266
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,480
delivering oxygen tanks to the neighboring factory could make money

267
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,519
Indeed

268
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,120
Following Brother Qi and sis

269
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,480
we'll never go hungry

270
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,120
It's all thanks to sis

271
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't get too excited yet

272
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,759
This order is very urgent

273
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,200
There are a total of forty tanks

274
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
They need to be delivered by tomorrow

275
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,720
We only have a van

276
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,919
and a tricycle

277
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,279
Can we deliver them all?

278
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,120
This

279
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,039
This is tough

280
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,240
You two go get the cart

281
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,759
I can fit a few tanks in my car

282
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
You guys take the tricycle for the first trip

283
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,919
Okay, okay, got it

284
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Got it, bro

285
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:47,840
With me

286
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,519
Car keys

287
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,399
Come on, hold it steady.

288
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,559
Gently, gently, gently.

289
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,919
Don't bump it, be gentle.

290
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
Here, you move this bottle.

291
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,879
Alright, come on, come on.

292
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Over here, over here.

293
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,240
Gently, gently.

294
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,360
Yes, yes, yes.

295
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,159
Yes, yes, yes, turn it around, turn it around.

296
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,879
Yes, yes, yes.

297
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes, perfect.

298
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,120
Just these goods.

299
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,519
There is a second batch of these goods.

300
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,480
Remember to come on time.

301
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,039
Okay.

302
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,039
I'll go ahead.

303
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,360
Thanks for your hard work.

304
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,879
Brothers.

305
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,399
Brother, Brother

306
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Sister-in-law, Brother Qi

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,799
Sister-in-law, Sister-in-law

308
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,480
It's time to split the money

309
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,759
So much

310
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
So much money

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,759
There are forty bucks in total here

312
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,039
Seven bucks per person

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,360
Seven bucks

314
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,440
This is too much, seven pieces

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,919
Sis, thank you, Sis

316
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,679
I wouldn't dare

317
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,679
I want three pieces

318
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,480
No, no, two pieces are enough for me

319
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,759
Sis, take it, take it

320
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,360
Two pieces are enough

321
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,279
Yes, Sis

322
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
We only need two pieces

323
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,399
As long as you keep working with us

324
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,879
You are our great benefactor

325
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Take it, Sis, don't

326
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,360
A total of forty pieces

327
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,559
Seven pieces per person, I'll take five

328
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,240
I just happened to negotiate this deal

329
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,080
Without your work

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,759
It wouldn't have been possible

331
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,360
You put in the effort

332
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,559
You deserve this money

333
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
I can't promise in the future

334
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,720
But I guarantee seven pieces per person every day

335
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,279
But each cart has my two pieces

336
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,600
And you get one piece

337
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,879
Then thank you, Sis

338
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,799
Thank you, Sis, thank you, Sis

339
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,639
Thank you, Brother Qi

340
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,840
We've been tired for a whole day and night

341
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,679
Hurry back and rest

342
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,799
There's another job this afternoon

343
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,759
Really?

344
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,919
Then we'll head back first

345
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,559
Brother

346
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,799
We'll take the tricycle and the cart back

347
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,159
Okay

348
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,279
I won't be a third wheel

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,240
Let's go

350
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go, hurry back

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,720
Let's go, Brother, let's go

352
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,200
Slow down

353
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,480
Your seven pieces

354
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
I'll leave mine with you

355
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,559
Okay

356
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,000
Then I'll keep it for you

357
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,960
You've been busy all night, must be tired

358
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,440
Let's go, let's head home

359
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,120
Alright

360
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,440
Lu Ran

361
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,279
Worked all night

362
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,919
Really exhausted

363
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,279
You don't even realize your face is dirty.

364
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,159
Lu Ran

365
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,639
Awake

366
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Arrived

367
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,279
Arrived

368
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,759
Come

369
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,679
What's wrong? Is it low blood sugar?

370
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,360
You

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
Put me down

372
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,039
It's okay, take a rest

373
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
I can walk by myself

374
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,080
Arrived

375
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,759
Home

376
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,879
Where did you go

377
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,279
Didn't come back all night

378
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,960
If you don't come back

379
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,080
I'll have your brother report to the police in town

380
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,519
What's this for

381
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,600
Leg is broken

382
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,879
Put it down, put it down

383
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,720
Aren't you ashamed

384
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,840
Mom

385
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,319
Last time, I was immature

386
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
I cooked the meat you had saved

387
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,160
This is the meat I bought for you

388
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll buy you more meat next time I earn money

389
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,839
Mom

390
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Lu Ran, last night

391
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,119
was busy with us all night

392
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,920
She's exhausted

393
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,640
What were you busy with?

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,160
Perfect, let's tell Mom about this

395
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:22,960
Mom

396
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,279
We need you for what we're going to discuss

397
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,440
It's something that can make money for our family

398
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,799
Go ahead, explain clearly

399
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
Mom, don't worry

400
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,519
Here's the plan

401
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,759
First, call out Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law

402
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,799
We'll discuss it together

403
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,799
Yes

404
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
Second Brother, Second Brother

405
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,079
Come out and listen

406
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,720
I'll go put the meat away

407
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,799
You two sit down first.

408
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,720
You talk about this business.

409
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,079
It can really help the villagers make money together.

410
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,119
Three yuan per person per day.

411
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,039
Everyone who transports goods can get three yuan.

412
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,759
You two must be earning quite a bit.

413
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,839
These college students are really different.

414
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,000
Much better than you.

415
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,920
Yes.

416
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,319
I don't have two thousand yuan for the bride price.

417
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,759
Alright, let's talk business.

418
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:10,920
Second Brother

419
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
If you don't have anything to do recently

420
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,920
Do you want to join us in delivering goods?

421
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:15,880
Okay

422
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,480
Alright, alright

423
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,160
I'll do it

424
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,359
Three bucks a day

425
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
This is a great opportunity

426
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay

427
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
What's up?

428
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,519
Third Brother, this isn't right

429
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,799
Outsiders get three bucks

430
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,160
Your own brother also gets three bucks

431
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,839
Is there no distinction between inside and outside?

432
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,079
Second Sister-in-law, we must follow the rules

433
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,319
It should be what it is

434
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,640
Of course

435
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
We still need family to organize this

436
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,519
We'll share the earnings together

437
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,559
Alright, alright

438
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,720
Really took two thousand bucks as bride price

439
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,720
Generous

440
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
Second Sister-in-law, we are all family

441
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
You should consider the family

442
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,839
What do you mean by that?

443
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,680
For so many years

444
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,359
Haven't I always thought about the family?

445
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,240
Second Sister-in-law knows that

446
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,920
After all, Shanshan is still young

447
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,599
We need to raise her well together

448
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,000
Our ancestors are truly blessing us

449
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,359
To have such a capable daughter-in-law

450
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,440
Mom

451
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,640
We still need to trouble you

452
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,039
Find a few families in the village who are willing to do this job.

453
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,319
Leave it to Mom.

454
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,599
In our village, which family

455
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,480
I know the situation of every household.

456
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,200
I will definitely ensure everything for you.

457
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,319
It has to be

458
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,519
our mom.

459
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:30,680
By the way

460
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
let everyone gather after lunch

461
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,680
to discuss together

462
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:35,680
Okay

463
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,119
Alright

464
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll go now

465
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,359
Thanks, Mom

466
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,960
It's not hard

467
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,960
Do your best

468
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,359
I'm leaving

469
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,319
Leaving

470
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,279
Mom

471
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,599
My stomach hurts

472
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,119
I'll go to the bathroom and be right back

473
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,039
Lazy donkey always has excuses

474
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,839
Hurry up

475
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,640
Do you want to try on your new dress?

476
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,160
Sure

477
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,400
Second brother, we'll go back to the room first

478
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,759
Let's go

479
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Finished showering

480
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,240
Get in bed

481
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,839
What are you doing?

482
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,319
Listen to how much they earn.

483
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,920
Did they take our share?

484
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:41,759
By the way,

485
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,319
Today,

486
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
give each brother seven bucks.

487
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
Keep five bucks for yourself.

488
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,799
This isn't right.

489
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,640
Seven bucks, each person gets seven bucks.

490
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,720
If you ask me,

491
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,559
we should set a rule from now on.

492
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,680
Follow the rules.

493
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,759
Don't worry.

494
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,599
I know all the brothers well.

495
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,759
They won't say anything.

496
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
You're losing out this way.

497
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,880
You need to think more about yourself.

498
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,799
If they hadn't completed this order,

499
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,279
there wouldn't be any future orders.

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,680
Anyway, I'll be leaving in a while.

501
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,960
You guys work hard.

502
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,039
Growing the business is the most important thing.

503
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:23,960
Also,

504
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,279
No need to rush off.

505
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,799
Wait until everything is settled.

506
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
Once everything is settled,

507
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,720
then you can leave.

508
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,559
Also, about the family,

509
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,680
Don't always think you have to handle everything alone.

510
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,240
Nothing is necessarily expected.

511
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,440
You need to let everyone fend for themselves.

512
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,160
By the way,

513
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,839
I took this job today.

514
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,599
I paid a 500 yuan deposit.

515
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,359
I took it from the bride price money.

516
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,599
I didn't discuss it with you beforehand.

517
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,480
At that time,

518
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,440
Since I gave it to you, it's your decision.

519
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Where are you going?

520
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,480
Slow down.

521
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
Keep your voice down.

522
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,000
Did you hear that?

523
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,200
What's wrong?

524
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Seven yuan per person.

525
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,960
How much do you think this couple earns?

526
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:07,880
How much do they earn?

527
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,519
It's because the third couple is capable.

528
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,079
Giving us three pieces is not bad.

529
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,039
Are you stupid?

530
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,680
It hurts.

531
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,319
Do you know they treat you like a beggar?

532
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,880
Little witch.

533
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
She said she returned the bride price.

534
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,839
Why is she so cunning?

535
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,680
Keep your voice down.

536
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,920
Don't let the sister-in-law hear, it's not good.

537
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,079
What little witch?

538
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,680
No wonder you can't make money.

539
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,519
Pathetic.

540
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
Just you wait.
