1
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,239
Today is the day I'm being forced to get married.

2
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,159
Then I'll turn this happy event

3
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,359
into a funeral.

4
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,599
Are you ready yet?

5
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,680
Lu Ran

6
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,639
Lu Ran

7
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,560
Lu Ran, hurry up and hold on tight.

8
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,599
The people coming to pick up the bride will be here soon.

9
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,240
Lu Ran, Lu Ran

10
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,280
Stop dawdling, hurry up.

11
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,360
Come in quickly, stop shouting.

12
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
Put it down quickly.

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
Quickly, quickly put it down.

14
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,360
Put it down.

15
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,159
This child

16
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,840
Why is he so troubled?

17
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,800
No breath left

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,039
No breath left

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,039
No breath left

20
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,639
She can't die

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
We accepted so many betrothal gifts

22
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,759
What will I do if she dies

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
The Qi family will definitely force me to marry

24
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,560
Qianqian

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,199
I can't marry that ugly and poor man

26
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,039
My life is ruined

27
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,520
Qianqian, what do we do now

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,280
What to do

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,039
What are you doing

30
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,759
You

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,240
In a moment, just say

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,479
She drank too much and fell asleep

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Then marry her off

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,120
The dead can't come back to life

35
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,080
Dead is dead

36
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,879
Her dying at the Qi family has nothing to do with us

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,240
What are you doing? Why aren't you coming down?

38
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,759
The groom is still waiting

39
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,840
She

40
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,919
What's wrong with her?

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
She's dead

42
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,479
Dead, dead

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,159
This, this

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,439
Come

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,280
Come

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Hurry up and carry her out

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,680
Alright, carry, carry

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,439
Carry her, carry her

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
Be careful

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,479
Dad, Mom, stay calm

51
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,639
Coming, coming

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,439
Coming, coming

53
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,719
Be careful.

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,759
What's going on?

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
She doesn't want to marry.

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Look at that groom, he's as fat as a pig.

57
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,120
I also heard that this person

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
beats women and children when he can't make money.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
Life is really tough.

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,040
Be careful.

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,399
Uncle.

62
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,800
This couple is really ruthless.

63
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,920
Such a good girl.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,240
What's going on, Uncle?

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
This kid got too excited.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,319
Drank too much.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,360
Alright, alright, come on.

68
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,319
Don't miss the auspicious time.

69
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,240
Alright, alright.

70
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,319
Careful, careful.

71
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,759
I'll pull the cart.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Well, Aunt, Uncle.

74
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,319
I'll head back first.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,959
There's still a bit of road left.

76
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,519
Congratulations.

77
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,439
Take it slow.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Alright, alright.

79
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,040
Slow down.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,480
Let's go.

81
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,720
Alright, alright.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
Congratulations.

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
We're almost at our village.

84
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,240
The scenery is really beautiful.

85
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,199
Our village has cows and sheep.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Luckily, pretending to be dead wasn't noticed.

87
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,079
My name is Lu Ran.

88
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,000
My parents passed away early.

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,839
I finally got into college.

90
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,639
They forced me to drop out for a high bride price.

91
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,720
To marry the village blacksmith.

92
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,560
Finally, I can get rid of my uncle and aunt's family.

93
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,519
Sister.

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
You really like drinking.

95
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,959
Life has become too much for me.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Isn't it?

97
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,759
I need to use the bathroom.

98
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,360
I...

99
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,279
Bathroom emergency.

100
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,439
I'll go take care of it.

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
What's going on?

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,519
It seems even the heavens are helping me escape the wedding.

103
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,879
Fatty, I'm going to sneak away first.

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,399
Why did the car go there?

105
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,120
Miss

106
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,160
Why did it run away?

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,160
It's bad enough that Aunt's family is so vicious,

108
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,720
but now they're even more wicked.

109
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,079
I'm already dead,

110
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,519
and they still want to marry me off to deceive people.

111
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm free now.

112
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,240
Miss

113
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,680
Why is this fat guy chasing so closely?

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's hide here for a while before leaving.

115
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
Human trafficker

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,040
Just passing by

117
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,680
You guys carry on

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,759
Xiaohua, don't let her run away

119
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,639
You call this Xiaohua?

120
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,680
Sis

121
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,360
Since you're here, don't leave

122
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,879
And one delivered right to the door

123
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,839
Let me tell you

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,600
That will definitely sell for a good price

125
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
This time we are sure to make a big profit

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,879
If you cry again

127
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,639
If you cry again, I'll kill you

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,600
Cry again

129
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,439
Jerk

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,439
Hurry

131
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
Why is it silent?

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Oh no, they ran away

133
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,639
Chase

134
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,439
Find them and kill them

135
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,079
Yes

136
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be afraid, hurry up.

137
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,560
Take a look over there, brother.

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,639
I don't know.

139
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,200
Look over there.

140
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:33,879
Let's go.

141
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Then you guys go check over there.

142
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,039
I'll go over there, okay.

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,480
Okay.

144
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,080
Alright, brother.

145
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,799
We must not be caught by the traffickers.

146
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,600
At worst, we fight to the death.

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,759
I'll fight you.

148
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,399
Run quickly.

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,240
Run!

150
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,399
How could a good girl become a trafficker?

151
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:08,679
Dad.

152
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,600
You will die a horrible death.

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Dad.

154
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,039
Dad, let go of sister.

155
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,039
What are you doing out here?

156
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,399
Shanshan.

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,799
Shanshan.

158
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,000
Dad.

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,759
Miss, sorry about that.

160
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,039
We mistook you for a trafficker earlier.

161
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,679
This sister is really pretty.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,480
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

163
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

164
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,159
Sister, my stomach hurts.

165
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Shanshan.

166
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,000
Quickly.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,360
Shanshan.

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
Take her to the clinic.

169
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,559
My car is over there.

170
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,159
How is it?

171
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,759
Don't be nervous.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,679
How can you be a father like this?

173
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,559
You let your child be kidnapped by traffickers.

174
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,159
Do you know what the consequences would be if it were any later?

175
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,200
It's my fault.

176
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
I didn't take good care of my daughter.

177
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,840
Be more careful in the future.

178
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,799
Many things can't be undone if you're late.

179
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,120
Regret won't help then.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Everything has been checked.

181
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,360
There are no major issues.

182
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,320
But she keeps saying her stomach hurts.

183
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,360
Let her rest here for a while.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
Who will go with me to pay the fee?

185
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,279
You go, I'll watch her.

186
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, thanks.

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,279
Let's go, let's go.

188
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,960
Come, sit here.

189
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,559
Let me see which child has a stomachache.

190
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,960
Does it hurt here or here?

191
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,879
Sis, it really hurts.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,159
Can you stay with me?

193
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,679
Sure.

194
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,559
But children shouldn't lie.

195
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,840
Sis, do you like me?

196
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,399
Of course I like you, you're so cute.

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
Really?

198
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,559
They all don't like me.

199
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,200
Except for Dad.

200
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,600
No one else likes me.

201
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,000
Then starting today,

202
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,879
there's one more person who likes you.

203
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,879
Sister, come home with us.

204
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,559
Shanshan

205
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,039
Sorry

206
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
The child was probably scared today.

207
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,360
Talking nonsense

208
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,759
It's okay

209
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,879
Dad, bring sister home.

210
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
Shanshan, be good.

211
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,879
Sister went back to her own home.

212
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,440
Be good, little one.

213
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,159
Sister will come to play with you next time.

214
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,039
No

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,279
Sister, if you leave, my stomach will hurt.

216
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,879
Shanshan

217
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,360
Second sister-in-law

218
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
She scared me to death.

219
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
You little brat

220
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,120
Why didn't you stay at home?

221
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,000
Why did you run around?

222
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,159
I didn't go to you.

223
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,440
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

224
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,879
As long as everyone is okay.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,559
Second aunt, take a good look at you.

226
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,360
Look at you.

227
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,879
This person looks familiar.

228
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,559
This little girl

229
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,360
Could it be that her family sold her?

230
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Where is your home?

231
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,480
In a nearby village

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,720
It's already so late today

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,159
It's not convenient for me to go back

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
Can I stay at your place for the night?

235
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,919
My... my home

236
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,279
Isn't it inappropriate?

237
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,480
You, a grown woman

238
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,279
Keep asking to go home with a man

239
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,720
Dad, if it weren't for the sister today

240
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,120
I would have been kidnapped by traffickers long ago

241
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,600
Besides, it's so late

242
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,679
Where can she go alone?

243
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,639
What are you talking about?

244
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,960
Third brother

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,759
You have a wife now

246
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,639
Bringing a random woman home

247
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,919
I'll take you home first later.

248
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,639
Then I'll go back.

249
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,080
Alright, alright.

250
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,200
Take me back to where I came from.

251
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,840
Then hurry home.

252
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,679
There are a lot of things to do at home.

253
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,679
You go home first, sister-in-law.

254
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,399
Hurry home.

255
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,879
Don't misunderstand, I don't mean anything else.

256
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,559
You have a family too.

257
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll just stay at your place for one night.

258
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll leave tomorrow.

259
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
Is that okay?

260
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,159
Okay

261
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,399
Thank you, big brother

262
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,320
Let's go, Shanshan

263
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,799
Sister, hurry up

264
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,240
Go

265
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,320
We're here.

266
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,919
The car was bought from the shop.

267
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,399
My family doesn't know yet.

268
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,440
Then don't tell them.

269
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,600
Let's go.

270
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,399
Come

271
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

272
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,480
Let's go

273
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
So young and already driving a car

274
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
This must be a second-hand car

275
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,720
Mom

276
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,039
Shanshan has been found

277
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,840
Alright, alright

278
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,559
Come inside

279
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Put the child inside first

280
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,080
Third brother, how did you bring her back?

281
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Who is this girl?

282
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,120
Mom, let's put Shanshan down first

283
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,039
Okay

284
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,919
Give me back my daughter

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,840
Give me back my daughter

286
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,080
My poor daughter

287
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,519
You heartless Qi family

288
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,120
Our Lu family's daughter

289
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,519
She was fine when she left this morning

290
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,360
This evening

291
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
She was killed by your Qi family

292
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,159
You came just in time

293
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,559
I was just about to look for you

294
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,159
You took the bride price

295
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,440
Where is she? Hand her over

296
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,279
What?

297
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,399
She's gone

298
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,320
Mom, is it because she died

299
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,480
they're afraid of trouble

300
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,240
and deliberately said she ran away

301
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,840
The person is from your Qi family

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,360
In front of everyone

303
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,799
Taken from our house

304
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,679
All the villagers from miles around saw it

305
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,720
If you don't hand over the person today

306
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,320
Then compensate us, compensate us

307
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,399
Pah

308
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,399
Stop talking nonsense here

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You want money from us? No way

310
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
I was going to look for you

311
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,080
But you came to me first

312
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,879
Do I have to be this unlucky?

313
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Running away from the wedding to the groom's house

314
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,360
Does your Lu family have any shame?

315
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
You happily took the betrothal gifts

316
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,120
But the girl ran away halfway

317
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,000
We haven't even settled the score with you, and you came to us

318
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,919
Yes, she ran away from the wedding

319
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,120
That morning

320
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,240
It was clearly your family who took her away

321
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,480
You're talking nonsense

322
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,200
This vicious family

323
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
Uncle and aunt are so superstitious

324
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,159
yet they dare to use the dead to extort money

325
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,919
If I, the dead, come back for revenge

326
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
they would be scared to death

327
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,639
I must teach them a good lesson

328
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,679
When collecting the bride price

329
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,080
why didn't I hear a word from you

330
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,960
What bride price? We need to go in and find someone

331
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,039
We need to find someone, move aside

332
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
We need to find someone, we need to go in

333
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
Who are you looking for? Who do you think you are?

334
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,840
You still want to enter my house

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,399
Do you think I'm giving you face?

336
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,360
You're still lying, get out

337
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,200
Let us in

338
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,799
You, get out

339
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,039
We need to find our daughter

340
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,240
You think you're in the right?

341
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,159
Let go, let go

342
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,159
You dare to come to my house and cause trouble

343
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,840
Let go

344
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,759
I need to find our daughter

345
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,840
They're hitting people

346
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,600
Lu Qianqian

347
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,720
I've been searching for you so hard

348
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
Lu Luran

349
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,759
Dai Cuihua

350
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,680
Lu Jiakang

351
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Do you think you have treated our family fairly?

352
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,839
Don't come over

353
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,160
Luran

354
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,400
Auntie just wants to find you a good family

355
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,440
It's you

356
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,240
You're the one who can't figure it out

357
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't come over

358
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,519
Don't come over, don't come over

359
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,039
Luran

360
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
This is a dowry of two thousand yuan

361
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,079
It's all here

362
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,960
I'll give it all back to you

363
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,039
I'll give it back to you

364
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,640
Luran

365
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,640
These years

366
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,759
Auntie has raised you single-handedly

367
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,480
You can't be ungrateful

368
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,279
I want to take you all with me

369
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:07,880
Go

370
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Ghost

371
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,319
Ghost

372
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
What does this have to do with you?

373
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,279
Qi Shengfeng, I didn't marry you willingly.

374
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,960
Let me discuss something with you.

375
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,880
I'll return the bride price to you.

376
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,839
Let's end this matter here.

377
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Is that okay?

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,039
Are you crazy?

379
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
This is my man.

380
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,200
So the person she is supposed to marry is actually me.
