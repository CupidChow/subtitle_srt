1
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
I am Qi Shengfeng

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
He is Qi Shengfeng

3
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,000
Son

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Are you out of your mind?

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,319
They want two thousand yuan

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,439
Just give it to them

7
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,760
None of the Lu family members are good

8
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,239
I can see that now

9
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,079
Look at this

10
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,079
This little girl is pretending to be mysterious

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,599
You didn't do it willingly

12
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,519
Put the bride price down

13
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,159
Get out of the Qi family immediately

14
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,040
Get out, yes

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Get out quickly, leave the bride price

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,479
Mom

17
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,919
I don't want my sister to leave

18
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,560
Sister

19
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,800
Don't you like me?

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,240
Then stay, okay?

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,520
Alright, alright, alright

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,599
She doesn't want to be your stepmother

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,080
I don't want my sister to leave, let go, mom

24
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,039
Mom, can we discuss this?

25
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,719
What is there to discuss?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,319
All that effort was for nothing

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,719
I've been running around

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,199
Married such a person

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,080
Shanshan

30
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,639
Child

31
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,080
Shanshan

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,919
The child fainted

33
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,360
Her room is over there

34
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,800
Mom, I'll take care of Shanshan first

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,479
This, this

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,080
Shanshan

37
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,520
Shanshan, wake up

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,080
Look at Dad, Shanshan

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
If she doesn't wake up soon

40
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,520
we'll have to take her to the hospital

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,520
and let the doctor cut open her stomach to check

42
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,439
where the problem is

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,639
I'm awake

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,080
Shanshan, are you tricking Dad again?

45
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,560
Sis, although my stomach doesn't hurt anymore

46
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,120
I still can't sleep

47
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,080
I need Sis to lull me to sleep

48
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,919
So you don't need Dad anymore?

49
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,919
San'er

50
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,439
Come out for a moment, I need to talk to you

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,039
Dad is going out for a bit

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,639
Wait for me for a while

53
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,159
Sister

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,840
You are my new mom, right?

55
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,680
New

56
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,840
Where is your own mom?

57
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,840
I never had a mom

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,400
That day, Aunt said I would have a mom

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,639
She told me to buy things for the new mom

60
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,599
So when the new mom comes

61
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,759
Dad won't abandon me

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Is your Aunt usually nice to you?

63
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,040
Aunt said I am unnecessary

64
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,560
Sister

65
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't want to stay and be my mom

66
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,560
Is it because you don't like me?

67
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,279
The way I am

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,839
Aren't you scared?

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,279
I actually like you the way you are

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,480
Alright, now you lie down first

71
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,160
I'll go wash my face

72
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,839
You lie here and wait for me

73
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,240
What's going on inside?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,399
Is she staying or leaving?

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,399
Look at that family.

76
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,279
None of them are easy to deal with.

77
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,959
Acting all mysterious today.

78
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,920
She's very cunning.

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Can you handle her?

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,879
How about this?

81
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,759
Tell her to leave the betrothal gift and go.

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Mom.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
How about letting her stay tonight?

84
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,079
It's late at night.

85
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,240
It's not safe for a girl to be outside.

86
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,720
How can that be? Let her stay with us.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,959
Yes, yes.

88
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,040
Try hard and give mom a big, healthy grandson.

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
She won't leave once she has a child.

90
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,600
Mom, what are you thinking?

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
This is just the first meeting.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,160
Still shy in front of mom.

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,720
Hurry up, go, go.

94
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,439
Go, go.

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Hurry up.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Quickly.

97
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,600
Go in.

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Shanshan is asleep

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Well,

100
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,079
why don't you stay here tonight?

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,079
Don't worry, I don't mean anything else.

102
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,879
It's so late.

103
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,600
It's not safe for a girl to be outside alone.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
Thank you

105
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,319
About you and me getting married

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,279
Didn't you discuss it with your parents?

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,519
They are not my parents

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
They are my uncle and aunt

109
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,959
I was tricked into coming back from school

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,319
Later I found out

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
They took the bride price and made me marry

112
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,439
I refused, so they locked me up

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
I was planning to escape today

114
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,600
Unexpectedly

115
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,600
Here you are, delivered to my door

116
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,199
I really didn't know about this before

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,959
I am truly sorry

118
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,560
If you want to leave

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,759
I have no problem with that

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,279
So upright

121
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,839
Then why did you spend two thousand yuan

122
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,480
to buy a wife you've never met?

123
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,480
My original intention in spending two thousand yuan

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
was definitely not to buy a wife

125
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,240
At my age

126
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,439
and with a child

127
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,839
the bride price is my sincerity

128
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,759
My mom is so old

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
worrying about my marriage

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,560
That day, the matchmaker came to talk about it

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,279
said you are a college student

132
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,800
and willing to marry here

133
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,240
Since you mentioned the bride price

134
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,920
I think there's no problem

135
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,759
Mom

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
This new bride is not acceptable

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,519
Why not

138
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,639
You said she

139
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,399
is a college student

140
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,399
Not acceptable

141
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,279
Find another bride for the third brother

142
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
I, I, I

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,759
I'm telling you

144
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,480
If you dare to cause trouble

145
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,120
I'll deal with you

146
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,040
Did you hear me

147
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,839
I heard you hit your ex-wife.

148
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,720
How could a grown man like me hit a woman?

149
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,920
What about Shanshan's mom?

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,879
Where did she go?

151
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
Shanshan is my older brother's child.

152
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,519
My brother and sister-in-law passed away early.

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,600
So I've been taking care of her ever since.

154
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,480
I've never been married.

155
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,199
And I've never had a woman.

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
Then how did Shanshan end up with you?

157
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,720
You're a grown man.

158
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,759
Shouldn't your brother and sister-in-law have taken care of her?

159
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,160
My second sister-in-law always said Shanshan had a tough fate.

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,879
She blamed Shanshan for my brother and sister-in-law's deaths.

161
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,199
As a college student, you surely don't believe in such things, right?

162
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,079
The most pitiful one is still Shanshan.

163
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,560
Isn't Shanshan pitiful?

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,839
I understand.

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,679
Your second sister-in-law really has her ways.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
My second sister-in-law never had children.

167
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
She said

168
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,399
It was Shanshan who cursed her.

169
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
That's why she couldn't have children.

170
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,799
Anyway, she was always superstitious.

171
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,159
You haven't told me yet

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,919
What are you going to do next?

173
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,960
Because you didn't volunteer

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
If you want to leave

175
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,039
It's really not a problem

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,639
Is there anything you need help with?

177
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,360
I can help you

178
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,000
I definitely have to leave

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,919
I still need to go back and continue my studies

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,159
However

181
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,519
Can I stay at your place?

182
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,480
You

183
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,039
Are you willing to stay?

184
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,399
Because I voluntarily dropped out of school

185
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,559
It's quite troublesome to go back to school

186
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,440
During this period

187
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,320
I can help take care of Shanshan first

188
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
I'll leave after my issues are resolved

189
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,039
Alright

190
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,279
Okay

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Keep the money with you for now

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
We'll talk about it when you need to leave

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,039
After all, your current situation is related to me

194
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,480
Once you have things arranged

195
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,639
Leave after you're settled

196
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,639
During this period

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,639
Shanshan will be in your care

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Do you have any other difficulties?

199
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,759
In the future

200
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,480
In front of my family, we

201
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Understood

202
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,919
During this period, we'll act as a couple in public

203
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,720
I'll be leaving in a while

204
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,679
Please say a few words for me

205
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,879
Alright, it's settled then

206
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,159
These are all new

207
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,240
They were originally prepared for you

208
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,240
And this

209
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
Use this tonight.

210
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,360
There are some clothes in the cabinet.

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
Although they are old,

212
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,639
they are all clean.

213
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
You should stay with Shanshan first.

214
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,399
Get some rest early.

215
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,519
I'm leaving now.

216
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,120
Thank you.

217
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,039
By the way,

218
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,559
You can take a bath in the yard.

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,080
Get some rest early.

220
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,039
This person is okay

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,519
For the sake of the child, I'll stay here for a few days

222
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,559
Anyway, I can't go back to Aunt's house

223
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,399
Poor little thing

224
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,399
I hope you have a better future

225
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,600
Don't be like me

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,559
It's already midnight.

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,440
They must all be asleep.

228
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,200
I-I-I

229
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
I thought you were already asleep.

230
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,720
San'er

231
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,879
What are you doing, making noise in the middle of the night?

232
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,200
Mom, I accidentally fell just now.

233
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,039
Are you okay?

234
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,639
I'm fine.

235
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:44,840
Mom

236
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,759
What are you doing? I'm taking a bath.

237
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,879
How about I go first?

238
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm a bit tired today.

239
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Go, go, go, hurry up.

240
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,320
San'er,

241
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,679
The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel.

242
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,039
We spent two thousand on the bride price to get a wife.

243
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,039
And now she sleeps in a separate room.

244
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
What is this supposed to be?

245
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,080
She just got here and already kicked the man out to sleep alone.

246
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,519
I won't stand for this.

247
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,879
When will I get to hold a grandson?

248
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,320
Don't let her have a temper like your second sister-in-law.

249
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,120
Your second sister-in-law is like that because we owe her.

250
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,480
It's because your second brother can't have children.

251
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,360
But Lu Ran, we don't owe her anything.

252
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,279
We married her into the family.

253
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,279
We are hoping

254
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,519
she can give us a big, healthy boy.

255
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,000
Did you hear what I said?

256
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
I heard you, Mom.

257
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,639
I understand.

258
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,759
You understand nothing.

259
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,080
Look at her, she's so shrewd.

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,039
Alright, Mom.

261
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,519
I'm a grown man.

262
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,519
I'm taking a bath inside.

263
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,480
It's awkward for you to be outside.

264
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,720
I gave birth to you, there's nothing I haven't seen.

265
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,279
Alright, alright.

266
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,799
I'm telling you,

267
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,679
after you finish your bath,

268
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,720
if you don't go into her room,

269
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,679
I'll go into her room and drag her out.

270
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,480
Don't look

271
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,559
Then keep washing

272
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,360
I'll fight you to the end

273
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,600
You won't die a good death

274
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,399
Dad

275
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,919
I don't want sister to leave

276
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,399
I like sister

277
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,440
Thank you

278
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,519
Sorry

279
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,559
My mom and the others are watching outside

280
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Maybe tonight I have to

281
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,159
But I'll sleep on the floor

282
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll turn off the light now.

283
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,639
Sleep now

284
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,559
Go, go, go, go

285
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,400
Do you think they can't see us?

286
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,720
Definitely

287
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
Keep your voice down

288
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,519
Why aren't they making any noise?

289
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
I saw the third one go in

290
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,759
Did they go in?

291
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,119
Could it be

292
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
Shanshan can't move freely inside

293
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,279
This won't do, I'll go get the child out

294
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,200
Mom, what are you doing going in now?

295
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,000
Why is there no movement?

296
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,400
Mom

297
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,799
Could they be teaming up to trick us?

298
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,559
I said the third one has a blockhead

299
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,519
How did he figure it out?

300
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,880
Mom and sister-in-law are eavesdropping

301
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,200
What should we do?

302
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,079
A big healthy boy is on the way.

303
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,559
No.

304
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,640
This rhythm is off, let me do it.

305
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,880
You know quite a lot

306
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,599
Let's go, let's go

307
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,160
I'm leaving. Go to sleep.

308
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,519
You poor little thing

309
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,920
I hope both of us

310
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
can find a good place to belong

311
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,200
Third brother, are you done yet?

312
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
You've been making noise since early morning.

313
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
What are you fussing about?

314
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,960
I'm making a dressing table for Lu Ran.

315
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,759
The one we got for two thousand is really different.

316
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,160
I wouldn't bother our second brother like that.

317
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,440
This new daughter-in-law doesn't get up early in the morning

318
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
Waiting for me to serve you

319
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,000
Hurry up and get up

320
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,200
What are you doing

321
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,319
Mom

322
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,799
I saw that Lu Ran had trouble packing things

323
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
So I used the old cabinet at home

324
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,440
And turned it into a dressing table for her

325
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,119
A dressing table

326
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,200
Your mom has never used this thing

327
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,079
My son is really capable

328
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,079
Really knows how to care for his wife

329
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,640
Mom

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,880
You just spoil her, you'll see

331
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,119
Get up quickly

332
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,480
Wipe your sweat.

333
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,519
I'll use that.

334
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,720
The old cabinet at home.

335
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,079
I turned it into a dressing table for you.

336
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:51,880
Try it.

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,319
If it doesn't fit, I'll change it again.

338
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,119
Thank you.

339
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,519
It's nothing.

340
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,920
Just a small thing.

341
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,079
Actually, you don't need to go through so much trouble.

342
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,440
By the way,

343
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,559
Take this money.

344
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,279
If there's anything needed at home,

345
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:10,960
just buy it.

346
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,920
I have money.

347
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,799
I still have that two thousand yuan.

348
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,440
We'll talk about that money later.

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,359
Shanshan and everything at home

350
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,240
all need money.

351
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,599
And you just arrived,

352
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,839
without bringing much.

353
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:22,799
Take it.

354
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,319
Alright.

355
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
I'll keep track of the expenses for you.

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,680
That

357
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,480
Later, mom and second sister-in-law

358
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
will definitely ask you for money

359
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
Just say that I have already taken back the bride price money

360
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:43,839
Okay

361
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,440
I still have a few orders to finish in my shop

362
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,200
I have to go

363
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,720
Then why are you still making the dressing table

364
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,519
Hurry up, hurry up

365
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
It's fine, my brothers are all here

366
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,400
It won't make a difference

367
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:55,960
Then I'm leaving

368
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,119
Did you have breakfast

369
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,599
I

370
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,119
I brought some pancakes

371
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,599
You're just eating that little

372
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,400
Usually, the shop is quite busy

373
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,279
So eating this is faster

374
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,039
I'm used to it

375
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,559
Don't worry, I will take good care of Shanshan.

376
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,119
Alright, I'm leaving now.

377
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,119
Mom, sister-in-law

378
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,480
This newly married daughter-in-law

379
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,200
Just woke up at this hour

380
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,599
Doesn't cook, wants to eat ready-made food

381
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,039
Mom, I'll go cook now

382
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,319
Mom

383
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,359
You say she looks like a delicate college student

384
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,400
Can she cook?

385
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,160
What's wrong with being a college student?

386
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,079
A college student married into our Qi family

387
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,799
is our Qi family's daughter-in-law

388
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,559
If she can't cook, she should learn

389
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
We must make her obedient

390
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,319
Yes

391
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,119
Mom, you're so amazing

392
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,039
Alright, alright, shut up

393
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,039
That's a water tank

394
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,319
Sister-in-law

395
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,599
Yes, yes, that's a vegetable washing basin

396
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,000
The vegetables are at the bottom of the basin

397
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,240
If there's anything you don't know

398
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,200
just ask me

399
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,319
Alright

400
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,319
Our mom

401
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,839
She's just an old rural lady

402
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,079
What does she know

403
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,599
When I first joined the family

404
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,799
I was also troubled by her like this

405
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,720
Tell me

406
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,400
You're a good college student

407
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,599
Why did you marry back into the village

408
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,440
I feel bad for you

409
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Yesterday

410
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,200
Your second brother went to pick up the bride

411
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,559
He fell and got hurt all over

412
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,400
Poor thing

413
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
He's still resting in the room

414
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,559
We owe the team fifty yuan

415
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,039
We don't know what to do

416
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,279
That day, second aunt said I would have a new mom

417
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,519
She told me to buy things for the new mom

418
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,799
Is your second aunt usually good to you

419
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,240
Second aunt said I'm unnecessary

420
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,880
Sister-in-law

421
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,599
Where did you go yesterday
