19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,500
What is the universe?

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,300
It is so cold upon the imagination

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,340
that we must try every month

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,900
to explore it.

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,620
- One of today's wonders.
- Sister-in-law.

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,540
Sister-in-law.

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,380
Second Brother, why are you here?

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,860
Shengfeng's workshop is about to collapse.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,740
What's going on?

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,380
No time to explain. Let's talk on the way.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,300
Okay.

30
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,380
Second Brother, slow down.

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,300
Slow down.

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,540
Shengfeng,

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,260
why are you here?

34
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,380
Second Brother just told me.

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,520
Has the specification been confirmed?

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,820
This should be it,

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,100
but it's just a guess.

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,340
What's the delivery deadline?

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,820
Yesterday.

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,060
So we've breached the contract.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,060
Why are you sitting there?

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,380
Quick, show me the order

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
from Zhou Huacheng.

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,140
This is it.

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,300
If we lose this order,

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
the deposit, the penalty,

47
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,980
and the costs of manpower and resources

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,260
will be enough to crush us.

49
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,500
No way.

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,900
We must get the order

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,940
from Shuguang Group back.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,900
I'll go to Shuguang Group first.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,380
No matter what,

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,420
you need to

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,980
bring the correct goods

56
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,220
to Shuguang Group to find me.

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,380
Alright.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,380
I'll check the goods

59
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,700
and see if I can adjust them.

60
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,020
Alright.

61
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Brother Qi, Brother Qi.

62
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,180
Brother Qi.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,540
Brother Qi, Ran,

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,420
something happened.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,660
I got the latest specifications,

66
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,540
but I heard another supplier

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,660
started to supply today.

68
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,580
They used

69
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,340
the batch of goods we delivered yesterday.

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,860
This is exactly the same as Zhou Huacheng's.

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,260
Ran!

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,420
Everyone,

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,640
let's adjust the process

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,620
of the previous goods

75
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,660
for secondary processing.

76
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,080
Zhou Huacheng's order is still in progress.

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,820
It's not enough.

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
Let's modify the wrong batch

79
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
and send it to Shuguang.

80
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,260
Ms. Bai, please sit.

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,420
Manager Fang,
why hasn't the batch arrived?

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,580
The supplier who was supposed to deliver

83
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,620
breached the contract.

84
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,900
I found another one.

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,740
Another one?

86
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,260
The previous one was too unreliable.

87
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,820
Luckily, I found

88
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,900
a better one in time.

89
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,460
Alright,

90
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,020
can the samples arrive on time?

91
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,980
Rest assured. They'll be here soon.

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,460
Manager Fang, you should be well aware

93
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,180
that Chairwoman Bai values this project.

94
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,740
Don't worry,
I take it even more seriously.

95
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,140
How much longer do I have to wait?

96
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,940
Lu Lan?

97
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,460
Mr. Zhou, you have a poor memory.

98
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,900
Lu Ran.

99
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,820
Ran, Ran, Ran.

100
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,900
Maybe one day you'll go to jail,

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,060
and your memory will improve.

102
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,420
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

103
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,680
You're here to deliver goods too?

104
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
What?

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,020
Only you can have cooperation,

106
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,180
not me?

107
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,660
Are you the supplier?

108
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes.

109
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,420
I'll go call the bosses.

110
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,580
Hurry up.

111
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,820
Ms. Bai, Mr. Fang, the supplier is here.

112
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,740
They're downstairs.

113
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,780
Ms. Bai, after you.

114
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,740
They're here.

115
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,740
Mr. Fang.

116
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,460
Long time no see.

117
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,260
Lu Ran.

118
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,460
Mr. Zhou,

119
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,860
this is the project leader,

120
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,300
Ms. Bai.

121
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,860
I thought she was a fairy.

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,100
Zhou Huacheng.

123
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,540
Ms. Bai.

124
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
This is...

125
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,820
Lu Ran,
the one who breached the contract.

126
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,100
Hello, I'm Lu Ran.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,900
I'm also here to submit samples.

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,420
I'm already aware of your situation.

129
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,780
You breached the contract.

130
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,130
So we won't look at your goods.

131
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,420
Our legal team will contact you later

132
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,500
for the penalty.

133
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Ms. Bai, this time it's really...

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,100
I don't want useless explanations.

135
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,420
- Let's see the goods.
- Okay, come on.

136
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,780
Make way, make way. Come on.

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,420
Take a look.

138
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,660
We guarantee the quality is absolutely fine.

139
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,100
Aren't these samples?

140
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,220
Why so many?

141
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,900
It's about sincerity. The more, the better.

142
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,380
Come on, I'll open one for you.

143
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,900
Take a look. Absolutely no issues.

144
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,780
The goods are fine.

145
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,380
See?

146
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,740
(The quantity is much more than

147
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140
what's on the workshop's delivery list.)

148
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,380
Since the goods are fine,

149
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,460
Ms. Bai,

150
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,900
let's sign the formal contract

151
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,660
with Mr. Zhou today.

152
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay.

153
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,540
Only the top layer?

154
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,820
Why not check deeper?

155
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,220
This...

156
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,500
Mr. Zhou's goods will pass any inspection.

157
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,180
As for you,

158
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,800
- delayed the delivery.
- Check the rest.

159
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,460
Your boss isn't here yet.

160
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Is this your attitude?

161
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,420
Well...

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,940
You don't need to check the rest.

163
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,860
Let them inspect.

164
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,780
No, this... this...

165
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,140
Ms. Bai, there's a problem.

166
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,780
What problem?

167
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,660
Only the batch on the top is qualified.

168
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,900
The rest are all substandard.

169
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,500
Well...

170
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,540
Well... It's a misunderstanding.

171
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,060
Sell shoddy goods as quality ones.

172
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,660
Fang Hongyang,

173
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,580
is this the supplier you found

174
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,060
for such an important project?

175
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,180
Is this what you call reliable?

176
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,700
No, Ms. Bai, let me explain. He...

177
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
Things have come to this.

178
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,980
This is the result.

179
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,140
What's there to explain?

180
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,220
- Ms. Bai.
- Ms. Bai, let me finish.

181
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,820
Please take a look at our samples.

182
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,900
I know,

183
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,340
we indeed failed to
deliver the samples on time.

184
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,420
That's indisputable.

185
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,460
But the current problem is

186
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,240
the steel factory can't take the order,

187
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,700
and no factory can handle

188
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,300
such a large volume in the short term.

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,300
If we customize it in other provinces,

190
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,730
the transportation cost will be high,

191
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,460
which is not good for Shuguang.

192
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,060
Why not give us a chance?

193
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,340
Please give us a chance.

194
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,220
Shut up.

195
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,140
Ms. Bai,

196
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,780
we brought samples,

197
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,100
and we've pre-produced a batch as an apology.

198
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,700
If you're willing

199
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,260
to give us this chance,

200
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,660
you can inspect the goods first,

201
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,780
then pay the deposit.

202
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,700
If you're not satisfied,

203
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,260
we'll pay the penalty based on the contract.

204
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,220
I know,

205
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,260
the purpose of signing the contract

206
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
is to supervise production

207
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,620
and ensure the production efficiency.

208
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,380
It's not just about the money.

209
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,940
Where are the goods?

210
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,060
Outside.

211
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,500
Let's go take a look.

212
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,700
Follow me.

213
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,780
Ms. Bai.

214
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,620
Didn't you promise me
everything was fine?

215
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,380
I thought it'd be okay to add a little...

216
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,460
Get out!

217
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,380
Okay.

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,980
Let's go!

219
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,900
Okay.

220
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,980
Ran.

221
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,580
We're here.

222
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,900
Here, the goods.

223
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,580
Did we make it?

224
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,780
Impressive.

225
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,340
The goods meet our specifications.

226
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,900
Excellent craftsmanship, up to standard.

227
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100
Coordinate with my staff

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,420
to move the goods to the workshop.

229
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,780
I need the next batch in five days.

230
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,860
No problem.

231
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,500
I hope the delivery will be on time.

232
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,700
Got it, Ms. Bai.

233
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,840
Where should we put them?

234
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,020
Okay, that's fine.

235
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,380
Lu Ran, I need to talk to you.

236
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,620
Come inside with me.

237
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,580
Lu Ran,

238
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,620
you're about to go back to study.

239
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,940
Why are you still entangled with them?

240
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,220
Helping them secure orders, negotiating...

241
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,820
Senior Fang,

242
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,700
why don't you tell me first

243
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,780
why you're using such underhanded methods

244
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,860
to harm Qi Shengfeng?

245
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,700
Lu Ran, I did all of this for you.

246
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,620
For me?

247
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,620
I like you.

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,740
I don't want you to stay connected to him.

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,500
I want him to disappear from your world.

250
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,540
I don't want to lose you again.

251
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,820
I want you to come back to me.

252
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,300
Even if...

253
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,500
you've been married, I don't mind.

254
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,180
Who are you to mind?

255
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,180
Let me tell you again,

256
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,220
Qi Shengfeng is my husband.

257
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,420
Harming him is the same as harming me.

258
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,900
Lu Ran, you are a college student,

259
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,780
dignified, knowledgeable, and cultured.

260
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,620
You have a bright future ahead of you.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,860
Why would you be with

262
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,340
a rural blacksmith?

263
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,220
I know what I want.

264
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,580
I don't need anyone

265
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
pointing fingers at my life.

266
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,540
Listen,

267
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,980
I am very happy now.

268
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,300
You're not part of my life.

269
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Please stay out of it.

270
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,100
Lu Ran, I understand you.

271
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
If you're voluntary,

272
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,660
tell me, and I'll help you.

273
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,140
I'll help you continue your studies.

274
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,620
Who said I'm not here voluntarily?

275
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,260
Yes,

276
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,820
I do want to continue studying,

277
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
but choosing to be with someone I like

278
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,420
doesn't conflict with it.

279
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,820
What did you say?

280
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,220
You like...

281
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,060
You like Qi Shengfeng?

282
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,380
Yes,

283
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,420
I like Qi Shengfeng.

284
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,100
I stay with the Qi family

285
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,740
because I want to be with him.

286
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,620
I have never regretted marrying him.

287
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,580
Lu Ran, you worked so hard
to get into college.

288
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,380
Why would you want to be with him?

289
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,220
You're throwing your life away.

290
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,300
All your studying is wasted!

291
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,500
Fang Hongyang,

292
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,300
it's your studying that's wasted.

293
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,980
Haven't I been good to you?

294
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,700
Where am I inferior to him?

295
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,060
I am the son of a city leader,

296
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,380
a college student,

297
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,060
the general manager of Shuguang Group.

298
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,340
- I'm...
- Just one thing,

299
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,180
Qi Shengfeng would never use dirty tricks

300
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,140
to harm others.

301
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,620
Lu Ran, I can explain it.

302
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,700
- Let go!
- Lu Ran.

303
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,860
Listen to me.

304
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,460
Manager Fang,

305
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,340
Lu Ran has made it clear.

306
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,140
Please stop pestering her, okay?

307
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,460
Lu Ran.

308
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,300
(Lu Ran,)

309
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,980
(you're an orphan with no parents.)

310
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,300
(How dare you turn me down?)

311
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,900
(How dare you talk to me like that?)

312
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,140
(Qi Shengfeng, Lu Ran,)

313
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,980
(two overconfident fools.)

314
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,140
Lu Ran,

315
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,620
did you hear everything?

316
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,740
No, I didn't.

317
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,680
Let's go back to the workshop.

318
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,600
You told me not to meddle in it.

319
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,840
Now you're asking me to go back.

320
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,340
You've helped us so much.

321
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,980
Everyone is waiting for you there.

322
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,860
Alright.

323
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,260
I can go back to see them.

324
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,360
Then I'll take you back.

325
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,420
No need, I've got legs. I'll walk.

326
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,340
Lu Ran, don't walk. I have a car.

327
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Does it make you special?

328
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,200
Thanks to Ran,

329
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,140
(Shenghua Mold, Pursue Excellence)
we've made it.

330
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,220
Otherwise, our factory

331
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,140
would've been finished.

332
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,060
Indeed.

333
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,180
Ran,

334
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,000
how did you know

335
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,890
Zhou Huacheng sold shoddy goods
as quality ones?

336
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm also wondering.

337
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,340
Before I left,

338
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,220
I checked our delivery notes to Zhou Huacheng

339
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,660
and compared them
with the quantities on site.

340
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,740
They didn't match.

341
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
They can't produce

342
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,420
products of our quality.

343
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,340
Yes.

344
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
Ran, you're really smart.

345
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,380
- Indeed.
- Yes, Ran is clever.

346
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,340
Although we've secured

347
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,900
the order from Shuguang Group this time,

348
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
the delivery time is very tight.

349
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,300
You must ensure both the quality and quantity.

350
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,020
Let's get to work quickly.

351
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,060
I'll head off now.

352
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,020
Take care, Ran.

353
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,860
Brother Qi,

354
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,100
did you upset her?

355
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,460
She doesn't seem to want to deal with you.

356
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,100
None of your business.

357
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,060
Go check the quantities.

358
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,120
See how many are missing.

359
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,980
Modify the goods

360
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,220
or melt down and recast them.

361
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
I'm just concerned about you.

362
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,660
Do I need your concern?

363
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,780
We don't have much time.

364
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,460
Take shifts if you're tired,

365
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,100
- but quality must be ensured.
- Okay.

366
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,540
Aren't you confident in our work?

367
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,500
- Good.
- Let's go.

368
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,420
- Go ahead.
- Go, go.

369
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,220
Ma Qiang.

370
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,310
- Brother Qi.
- Sit down.

371
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,300
Brother Qi,

372
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,980
this time it's my fault.

373
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,660
It's all my fault.

374
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,740
If something happens,

375
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,700
the workshop will really be gone.

376
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,260
I can't face staying here anymore.

377
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,780
Once this order is done,

378
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,620
I'll leave the workshop.

379
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,260
The problem isn't solved yet.

380
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,180
Instead of thinking about how to fix it,

381
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,220
you want to run away, huh?

382
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,540
Brother Qi, I really don't mean it like that.

383
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,500
I know.

384
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,220
Don't forget,

385
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,780
we're brothers.

386
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,380
Brothers face problems together

387
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,220
and find solutions together.

388
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,260
What's most important now

389
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,740
is figuring out how to make up for it.

390
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,660
Brother Qi,

391
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,980
got it.

392
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,340
I'll work hard.

393
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,100
Such a thing won't happen again.

394
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,660
I'll get back to work.

395
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,420
Wishes within the sunlight become warm.

396
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,620
And the heat causes most materials...

397
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,540
Lu Ran,

398
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,780
Lu Ran.

399
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,860
Why are you here?

400
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,180
I need to talk to you.

401
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,100
Can you open the door first?

402
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,340
Just say it here.

403
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,740
I like you.

404
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,860
You say you like me,

405
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,540
but why won't you let me
handle your affairs?

406
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,260
You even found a place for me to move out.

407
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,980
What do you mean by saying all this now?

408
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,260
I just wanted to find you

409
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,460
a quiet place to study.

410
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,140
I was afraid we would disturb you.

411
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,660
Are you upset because of this?

412
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
Did you discuss

413
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,140
this matter with me?

414
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,660
Did you ask for my opinion?

415
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,820
I wanted you to realize

416
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,980
your wish to return to school.

417
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,100
I didn't think that much.

418
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
Then why are you coming to me now?

419
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,600
Just because of the order from Shuguang?

420
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,060
Are you here to thank me?

421
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,180
Of course not.

422
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,540
Actually,

423
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,540
what you said to Fang Hongyang...

424
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,500
I...

425
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,420
I overheard it.

426
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,900
If you hadn't, you wouldn't have come.

427
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,220
I would definitely come.

428
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,380
I had decided long ago

429
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,380
to come find you after your exams.

430
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,300
Can you open the door first?

431
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,940
Promise me something first.

432
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,500
Promise me, then I'll open it.

433
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,820
Open the door first.

434
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,020
I'll agree to whatever you say.

435
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,700
Go... go ahead.

436
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,620
Can you promise me

437
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,500
not to shoulder everything alone
in the future?

438
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,780
Discuss things with me.

439
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,620

440
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,760
