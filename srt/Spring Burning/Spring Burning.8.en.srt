1
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,960
How did everyone end up behind me?

2
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,039
And no one said a word.

3
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,199
Dad did it on purpose.

4
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,639
Shanshan

5
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,159
They've been sent to the police.

6
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,199
Doctor Zhang's character is questionable.

7
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,280
This pharmacy definitely can't let him continue running it.

8
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Lu Ran

9
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,479
Actually, I planned a long time ago

10
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
to take you to the town

11
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,240
If we had moved earlier

12
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
you wouldn't have suffered so much

13
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,520
Didn't you say

14
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,919
I could leave whenever I wanted?

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,919
Why plan to move me?

16
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
I... I am serious

17
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,840
No, I mean

18
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
If you want to leave, I

19
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,960
I... I can

20
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
You want me to leave, that is

21
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,919
I don't

22
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,800
I haven't finished my school matters yet.

23
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,719
I won't leave so soon.

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
Then you should settle down first.

25
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,840
You haven't told Mom and Second Brother about this yet, right?

26
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,319
Let's talk about it once it's done.

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
Mom will worry if she knows.

28
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,319
Let's go to town tomorrow to buy some things.

29
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
We need to take Shanshan with us.

30
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,599
We can't leave her alone at home.

31
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay.

32
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,479
Let's go, I'll take you to town for some fun.

33
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,159
Let's go.

34
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,879
Take it slow.

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
My second child is innocent.

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
My second child can give birth.

37
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,560
That witch Tan Hong

38
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,199
is flirting with Doctor Zhang from the town.

39
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,759
She deceived my second child.

40
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,920
You should tell the village later.

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,680
Alright, alright.

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,639
Don't worry, Aunt.

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't worry, Aunt.

44
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,120
What are you doing?

45
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,720
Looking so pathetic.

46
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,439
It's just a wife.

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
Mom will find you a better one later.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
A hundred times better than her.

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Why haven't you left yet?

50
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,319
You're so slow packing your things.

51
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
What do you want to do?

52
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,639
What trick are you trying to pull again?

53
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,199
Get up

54
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,399
Don't mind her

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
Now you know how to act pitiful

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,800
You know how to flirt with my son

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,279
How were you before

58
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,879
You used to boss my son around

59
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,160
I've been your daughter-in-law for so many years

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,600
How can you be so heartless

61
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm heartless

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,560
You wanted to sell Shanshan, I didn't even argue with you

63
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,639
It's good enough that I didn't report you to the police

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,959
Pack your things and get out of our Qi family

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,639
Hurry up

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,279
Don't move

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Bring it over, bring it over

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
Let me see if you stole anything

69
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,199
What things from our Qi family

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
What could I take

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,639
You've been stingy with me for so many years

72
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,959
I'm stingy

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,920
You're obsessed with money

74
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,839
You have a bad heart

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
You're biased

76
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,279
You got a wife for the third son

77
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,360
You took two thousand yuan

78
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm biased

79
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,680
You're a college student

80
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,000
Other college students

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
Are you as good-looking as Lu Ran

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,399
Are you as kind as Lu Ran

83
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,519
Isn't it just because I can't have children

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,639
Yes

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
Not only because you can't have children

86
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,720
But also because you wronged my son

87
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,720
You have a bad heart

88
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,079
The shop in town

89
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,160
Is almost ready

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,600
Once the machines arrive

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,959
We can start production

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,319
Lu Ran

93
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,040
Let's go

94
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
Can you stop following me?

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
You're so annoying!

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,920
Brother Huacheng

97
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,199
Lu Ran is stealing your business

98
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,639
It has nothing to do with me

99
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,519
Besides,

100
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,439
It's just one deal, right?

101
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,360
One deal

102
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,519
You call this one deal?

103
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,120
I got scolded by my dad

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
My dad got scolded by his boss and had to write a report

105
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,040
Our whole family gets a headache when we see your Lu family

106
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,879
We get a headache now

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,079
I'm telling you, we're done

108
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,680
It's not that serious, right?

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,600
What do you think?

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
But

111
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,040
I'm pregnant with your child

112
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,399
You, you

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,639
You're pregnant

114
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,600
He, he can't have children either

115
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,879
We're not a good match

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,079
Stop talking, it's so annoying

117
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,800
What if I say

118
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,759
I can help you get your business back

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,560
Qi Shengfeng wanted to marry me at that time

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,959
He even prepared a dowry of two thousand for me

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,439
It's just because I didn't want to marry him

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,560
He settled for marrying Lu Ran

123
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,560
He loves me wholeheartedly

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,439
After I married you

125
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,319
I told him

126
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,199
To give the business back to you

127
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,759
He will definitely listen to me

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,199
Also

129
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,720
The house Lu Ran's father left her

130
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,279
Is now part of my dowry

131
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,879
Where's the waiter

132
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Waiter

133
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,480
Where is everyone

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,439
Waiter

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,240
Lu Ran

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,439
Lu Ran

137
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,560
Qi Shengfeng

138
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,600
You love her to death

139
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,959
I don't even know her

140
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,199
Lu Qianqian

141
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,399
You really have an imagination

142
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,200
Lu Ran, do you have any shame?

143
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
Pretending to be a ghost to scare people before

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Now you know how to eavesdrop on others, huh?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,519
What

146
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
Already started flirting with men

147
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,799
Let me tell you

148
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,720
This person can fake death to escape marriage

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
Better keep an eye on her, don't let her run away

150
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,600
Our own family matters

151
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,960
No need for outsiders to worry

152
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,759
You don't need to spread rumors everywhere

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,039
Ruining others' reputation

154
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,000
We have things to do, let's go

155
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,679
What

156
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,159
Bringing your man to town to see the world

157
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,159
I advise you to go back quickly

158
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,720
The bosses in town are all Hua Cheng's men

159
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
With just one word from him

160
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,279
You will have to walk back tonight

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
We now live in the town.

162
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,200
Brother Huacheng

163
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Didn't you say you would take me to buy clothes?

164
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes.

165
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,159
My dad also bought a lot of things for my mom.

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,639
They're all in the car.

167
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,600
What else do we need?

168
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Let's buy everything at once.

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,279
Let's go, Shanshan.

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,360
Let's go.

171
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,919
Be careful.

172
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,759
You, you, you, did you push someone?

173
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,120
Come on, Shanshan, let's go.

174
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,279
She bullied me, and you didn't speak up for me.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,039
Speak up for you? I'll hit you.

176
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,879
You want to hit me?

177
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,039
If it weren't for you,

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,080
Didn't you say this had nothing to do with your cousin?

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Didn't you say Qi Shengfeng liked you?

180
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,360
No, you woman,

181
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,519
Why are you full of lies?

182
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,440
If it weren't for you,

183
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,320
Would I be looked down upon by a blacksmith?

184
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,159
Zhou Huacheng

185
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,000
You are the son of the town committee secretary.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
You have so many businesses in your hands.

187
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,279
And so many brothers.

188
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,000
You

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,679
You are looked down upon by a blacksmith.

190
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,679
You blame me.

191
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't you feel ashamed?

192
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
I liked you at that time

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,399
because you were brave and resourceful.

194
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,480
That's why I wanted to marry you.

195
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,639
What have you become now?

196
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,320
Fine.

197
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,759
Marry whoever you want.

198
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,759
Fine.

199
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Not getting married is fine.

200
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,200
If my parents find out,

201
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,159
they'll make a scene at the police station.

202
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,000
Accuse you of being a hooligan.

203
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,279
I, I acted on impulse.

204
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
I spoke without thinking.

205
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
What I just said was nonsense.

206
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,919
Of course, I want the baby in my belly.

207
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,480
Right?

208
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,559
Sit.

209
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,080
Calm down.

210
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,600
I know business is tough right now

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Even the stable orders for oxygen tanks were taken

212
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
We need to find some profitable work

213
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah

214
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
But it's not easy to find such work

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,960
What about Qi Shengfeng and his group

216
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
Didn't they set up a mold factory

217
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,960
That's profitable

218
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
But it's not easy for us to set up now

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,200
Why is it not easy

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,919
If they can take our orders

221
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,360
Can't we take theirs

222
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,440
Scold me

223
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,399
Wrong, wrong

224
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,480
Hey, waiter

225
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,159
Hurry up

226
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,279
Serve the dishes

227
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,159
It's here

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,919
Dad, is this our new home?

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,639
Yes, this is our new home.

230
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,600
Then hurry up and show us around.

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,720
Let's go.

232
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Is it here?

233
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,759
Here, yes.

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,320
This is our room.

235
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,559
This is the living room

236
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,279
This is the room for our mom

237
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,840
Shanshan is here

238
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,159
I also saved one for our second brother

239
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,039
You also have a room on the third floor

240
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,720
Take a look at our room

241
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,399
These books

242
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,879
Aren't you going back to college?

243
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,159
I asked the bookstore

244
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,840
These are all college study materials

245
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,720
You look at them first

246
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,320
If it's not enough, I'll find more for you

247
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,879
These books are hard to find.

248
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,120
About going back to school,

249
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,279
We'll figure it out slowly.

250
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,559
But don't fall behind on your studies.

251
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Qi Shengfeng, thank you.

252
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,000
You don't need to thank me.

253
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,360
We

254
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,799
are family, aren't we?

255
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
Aren't you afraid that after I go to college,

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,519
I'll leave you?

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,320
No matter what choice you make,

258
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,919
I'm sure you have your reasons.

259
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
What I can do

260
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,480
is support all your choices.

261
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,279
There's a large rooftop upstairs.

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,159
Do you want to check it out?

263
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,039
Okay.

264
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,879
Come on, Shan Shan.

265
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,159
Shan Shan, let's go.

266
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,960
I want to read here.

267
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,279
Alright.

268
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,879
Let's go.

269
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,960
It's so comfortable here.

270
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,879
I knew you would like it.

271
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,679
But to set up this place,

272
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,159
you must have spent a lot of money.

273
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,279
These are all necessary things.

274
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,799
I've been working all these years.

275
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,120
I managed to save some money for us.

276
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,240
Setting up a new home is no problem.

277
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,600
I know.

278
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,240
To set up for us.

279
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,399
See if anything is missing, just buy it.

280
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,159
We'll go after he leaves.

281
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,120
Okay.

282
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,440
The kitchen is fully equipped.

283
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,240
I'll tidy up later.

284
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,679
Then I'll start cooking.

285
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:29,759
Okay

286
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,879
Well, but

287
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,840
I have to go back to the shop later

288
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,799
We'll eat when you get back

289
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,919
Alright

290
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,039
I'll be back soon

291
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay

292
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm leaving then

293
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,039
Be careful

294
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,639
It's okay

295
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll be back soon

296
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,720
Where are we going?

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,279
Taking you to buy groceries.

298
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,160
Okay.

299
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
What do you want to eat today?

300
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,240
Braised pork.

301
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,799
Okay.

302
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,720
Anything else?

303
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,599
Vegetables.

304
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Okay.

305
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Let go of me.

306
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,000
This batch of goods has been delivered.

307
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,559
Today's order needs to be expedited.

308
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,519
Tell the brothers.

309
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Alright, bro. Don't worry.

310
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,559
I'll explain it clearly to the brothers.

311
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,920
Your sister-in-law must have finished cooking.

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Let's go back together after eating.

313
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,559
Alright, bro.

314
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,759
Why is the door closed in broad daylight?

315
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,559
Lu Ran.

316
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Lu Ran, I'm back.

317
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,519
Sister-in-law.

318
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,359
Lu Ran.

319
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,039
Sister-in-law.

320
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,599
Bro, do you hear that sound?

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,440
Shanshan

322
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:08,720
Shanshan, Shanshan

323
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,359
Shanshan

324
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Shanshan

325
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,400
What's wrong?

326
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,440
Where's mom?

327
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,519
Mom was taken by bad people.

328
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,720
Brother, there's a note.

329
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,000
If you want the child,

330
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,799
come to the old site of the Zhen Nan Brewery.

331
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,400
Brother, the child.

332
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,039
Take care of Shanshan.

333
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,200
Brother, be careful.

334
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,119
Shanshan

335
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,119
Don't be afraid.

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,759
Don't be afraid, Shanshan.

337
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,519
It's okay.

338
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,240
Don't be afraid.

339
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,319
Big brother, it's done.

340
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You call this a success?

341
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,240
You call this a success?

342
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
Call this a success?

343
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm completely falling apart.

344
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,160
I can't even read.

345
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,839
Shouldn't the daughter stay home to report?

346
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
You illiterate fool.

347
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
His daughter is so young, what if she gets lost?

348
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
I tied his daughter up in the kitchen.

349
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,000
She definitely won't get lost.

350
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,759
Brother, if Qi Shengfeng doesn't come,

351
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,359
we tied her up for nothing.

352
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,680
Should I go back and change it?

353
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,559
I'm really impressed.

354
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
A mother and a daughter,

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,640
you managed to mix them up.

356
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,440
Aren't they the same?

357
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,119
Same in what way?

358
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,440
Same in what way?

359
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,839
She just got married.

360
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,279
Will Qi Shengfeng give me the factory for her?

361
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,359
Use your brain, brother.

362
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,880
What are you mumbling about?

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,079
What are you saying?

364
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,279
Qi Shengfeng won't trade the mold factory for me.

365
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,319
You're right.

366
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:31,839
Okay.

367
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,079
You're still being arrogant at this moment.

368
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,119
Don't be impulsive, don't be impulsive.

369
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
Block it, block it, block it.

370
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,559
Zhou Huacheng.

371
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,480
You, you, you.

372
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,039
Stop him, stop him.

373
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,880
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

374
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,079
A gentleman uses words, not fists.

375
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,079
No, no, look here, look here.

376
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,200
If you touch her again today,

377
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,039
there's nothing more to discuss.

378
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,440
Okay, I'll give it to you.

379
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,079
What exactly do you want?

380
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,640
It's nothing, really.

381
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,440
It's very simple.

382
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,079
Give me your small factory.

383
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,680
Then this matter will be settled.

384
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay.

385
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,240
Let her go, and the shop is yours.

386
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,960
Alright, alright, alright.

387
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,799
The stuff, the stuff.

388
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,960
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Good, good.

389
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,240
Hurry up, you guys. Pen.

390
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,119
Let go.

391
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:12,839
That.

392
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,880
Put your fingerprint here.

393
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:28,759
Give it to me, give it to me

394
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,480
Alright, alright, alright

395
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,279
Straightforward, Boss Qi

396
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,640
Let's do it this way

397
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,759
Cash on delivery

398
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,720
Boss Qi

399
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,720
Go

400
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Release them, release them, release them

401
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,160
No, no, no

402
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,759
Why are you stopping me?

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,720
Sorry, sorry

404
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,160
Sorry

405
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,920
Why are you stopping me?

406
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,279
Go, go, go

407
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,119
You are hurt.

408
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,799
It's okay now.

409
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,839
It's okay now.

410
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,640
Were you okay just now?

411
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,519
Why are you so foolish?

412
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
How could you give the shop to him?

413
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,200
The shop is not as important as you.

414
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm sorry

415
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm sorry

416
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm sorry
