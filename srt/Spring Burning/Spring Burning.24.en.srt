=Episode 24=

19
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,200
Luckily, we spotted the issue in time

20
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,510
and postponed the project,

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,310
so the collapse is confined to a small area.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,120
Just one worker got slightly injured.

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,150
The workers are okay. That's a relief.

24
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,270
Yeah.

25
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,790
I came to see you

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,120
mainly for two things.

27
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,510
First, about the bridge project of Shuguang.

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,560
It's under review now.

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,950
We've postponed the timeline,

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,150
so we'll still need lots of steel.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,360
Even though we broke the contract first,

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,320
we hope to work with you again.

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,120
You helped us

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,240
to get many orders

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
through connections.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm willing to keep cooperating.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,390
The second thing.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,180
After Secretary Tong's investigation,

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
we found...

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,230
This was my mother's keepsake,

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,270
but my aunt claimed it was lost.

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,230
They've been brought to justice now.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,390
And Grandma was deeply affected

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
by this.

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,760
After the investigation,

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,310
she learned this safety lock

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,830
must be your mother's relic.

48
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,320
So she wants to meet you.

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Grandma...

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
Our cross-river bridge project

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,990
is progressing well in many cities.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,030
The Steel Association and Shuguang Group

53
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,190
are holding Steel Conference.

54
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,390
The venue is confirmed.

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,760
It's in our headquarters.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,150
And they'd like to invite you

57
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,360
to give a speech,

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,080
sharing industry insights.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Okay.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,830
Understood.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,600
Qi Shengfeng and Lu Ran
are on the guest list.

62
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,760
Is Lu Ran willing to see me now?

63
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,100
(You're Invited to the Steel Conference.)

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,830
Have some fruit.

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
If you still don't want to see her,

66
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,230
we don't have to go.

67
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,470
Why shouldn't we go?

68
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,750
We earned this invitation

69
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,710
fair and square.

70
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,790
Why shouldn't we go?

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,270
It's time I faced her.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,870
Sweet.

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,760
I'll get back to work.

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,080
With that new machine, production has

75
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,700
- doubled.
- Director Wang, welcome.

76
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,290
(The 6th FengXi Steel Conference)
Yes.

77
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,270
So you should invest.

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,270
- We will.
- Right?

79
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,190
Director Li.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
- Long time no see!
- Director Qi.

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,800
Ms. Chen.

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,830
- Hi.
- Please, come in.

83
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,870
Long time no see!

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,950
- This way.
- Shengfeng.

85
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,080
- About the machine upgrade,
- Director, come in.

86
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,270
- the new nozzle tech.
- This way, please.

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,510
How'd you pull that off?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
Honestly, you're a grown man.

89
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,590
You can't just ask for
trade secrets outright.

90
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,150
Look,

91
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,270
you two need to collaborate.

92
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,600
Handle what you can yourselves.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,510
Don't dump everything on me.

94
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,080
- Got it.
- Understood.

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,540
Since when are you familiar with Shengfeng?

96
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,160
Mr. Liu.

97
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,480
Director Qi.

98
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,360
No, no.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Director Qi. Director Qi.

100
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,280
Director Qi.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,120
I heard that

102
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,200
after the tech upgrade,

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,750
both quality and output

104
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,030
have improved a lot.

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,550
Yes.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,600
You guys chat first.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
Right? In the future, we...

108
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,350
She and I are familiar,
you can get back to work.

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Okay.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,960
I understand.

111
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,800
Lu Qianqian got your hopes up
for nothing.

112
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,910
- I'll cooperate with the DNA test.
- Mr. Li.

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,600
Thank you.

114
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Thank you.

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,080
(Mom...)

116
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,030
(Could she really be my grandma?)

117
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,870
Lu Ran.

118
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,340
(DNA Report: Individuals No.1 and No.2
confirmed as relatives.)

119
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,480
It's her.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,390
It really is her.

121
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,800
(Accounting Office)
God...

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,470
I treated her so terribly before.

123
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,640
I pushed her into a corner.

124
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,230
I...

125
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,870
I...

126
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,880
What should I do?

127
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
I have things to do. I'll head out first.

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,480
Simeng!

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,910
What are you doing?

130
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,120
She's my daughter's child.

131
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,000
I have to acknowledge her.

132
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,640
Don't be angry.

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,080
Chairwoman Bai...

134
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm just your adopted grandchild.

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,510
I have no right to be angry.

136
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,000
Simeng, what do you mean?

137
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,230
You misidentified your granddaughter.

138
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,720
That Lu Qianqian

139
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,950
threw the Shuguang Group into chaos.

140
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,950
I warned you repeatedly,

141
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,320
but

142
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,080
you wouldn't listen.

143
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,680
You even made me clean up her mess.

144
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,030
She did so many outrageous things,

145
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,990
yet you kept covering for her.

146
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,470
When the project timeline failed,

147
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,440
you blamed me instead.

148
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,110
Simeng, I'm not blaming you.

149
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I never dared to go out
and play as a kid.

150
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
I had no friends,

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,080
but endless homework.

152
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,390
My biggest wish every day

153
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,990
was to make you proud of me.

154
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,630
But no matter how hard I tried,

155
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,950
you were always so harsh.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
I could never satisfy you.

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,360
Was I really that inadequate...

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,560
Or was it just because

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,440
I wasn't your real grandchild?

160
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,230
Now that you've found
your real granddaughter,

161
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,710
I've become a joke.

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
One leaves, another comes.

163
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm just... tired.

164
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,560
Simeng.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,550
Simeng, listen to me.

166
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,560
Listen.

167
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,470
You're right.

168
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
I was too harsh on you in the past.

169
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,720
But it's because I see you
as my granddaughter

170
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,920
that I treated you that way.

171
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,710
Really.

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,390
I've never thought of you

173
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,870
as a replacement for them.

174
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,910
Haven't you?

175
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,830
Never.

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,590
Then think about my name.

177
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,400
Bai Simeng.

178
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,470
Grandma!

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,520
Grandma!

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Grandma.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,920
Simeng.

182
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,520
I've watched you grow up.

183
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,320
You are my granddaughter.

184
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,230
I'm sorry, Grandma.

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,400
I just...

186
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,750
I lost control earlier.

187
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,950
I...

188
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,280
Did I do something wrong?

189
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,750
You were just caught up in the moment.

190
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,320
You didn't mean it.

191
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,350
This is my fault.

192
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,110
I really...

193
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,230
didn't consider Simeng's feelings.

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,230
But you know the truth best.

195
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,400
In my heart,

196
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,710
Simeng has always been
the Shuguang Group's heir.

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,080
That has

198
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,830
never changed.

199
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,470
Have some tea.

200
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
Grandma's been hospitalized.

201
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,110
How Chairwoman Bai treated Lu Qianqian

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,470
clearly affected you.

203
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,040
I didn't expect

204
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,080
you'd come to me.

205
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,920
I am here to ask you to visit Grandma.

206
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,470
I hate saying this,

207
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,680
but I know

208
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,800
that after losing your mother,

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,870
Grandma stayed in Anshi
to search for her.

210
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,040
She headquartered Shuguang Group here

211
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,680
just to find her daughter.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,680
All these years,
she's spent resources, effort...

213
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,960
Not a single day without longing

214
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,350
or searching for your mother.

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,520
It's been so hard for her.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
At first, she wasn't some tycoon.

217
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,680
Her means were limited.

218
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,110
It was like searching for a needle in the sea.

219
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,440
Later, the company succeeded,

220
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,990
but after so many years,

221
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,630
who knows what that child

222
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,990
looks like now?

223
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,920
Why tell me this?

224
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,440
Aren't you afraid if I reunite
with Bai Chunran,

225
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,520
it'll threaten your position?

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm afraid, of course.

227
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,800
I've worked tirelessly for the group,

228
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,990
dedicating myself.

229
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,800
I've always feared
the day the real heir returns

230
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,110
and I'm left with nothing.

231
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,950
Lu Qianqian terrified me.

232
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,720
But Grandma raised me.

233
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,110
That love is real.

234
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,190
And Lu Ran,

235
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,990
I know who you are.

236
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,750
If Grandma wants to
give Shuguang Group to you,

237
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,080
I won't object.

238
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,110
Because I know
you can make the group better.

239
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm only interested in what I earn myself.

240
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,110
You haven't decided
whether to see her, right?

241
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,400
I agreed to the DNA test before

242
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,350
just to fulfill my mother's last wish.

243
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
When she got lost, she was so little.

244
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,520
She must have wanted to find her mom.

245
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,320
But now knowing

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
my grandmother is...

247
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,350
I just can't accept it.

248
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,990
I don't like Bai Chunran.

249
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,400
She'd stop at nothing

250
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,230
to drive us into a corner.

251
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,920
She's nothing like the kind grandmother

252
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,550
Mom used to tell me about

253
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,630
when I was a child.

254
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,230
But she might be

255
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,830
the only blood relative you have left.

256
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
And like you said,

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
your mother would've wanted

258
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,470
to find her own mother.

259
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,070
Lu Ran,

260
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,750
whatever choice you make,

261
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,750
I'll support you.

262
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,590

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,400
Then come with me.

266
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,470
Okay.
