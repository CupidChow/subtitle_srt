19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,340
(The 4th Provincial University Games
are held at our school.)

20
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,390
Since we're here, why not ask?

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,920
If there's a chance to go back,

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,280
there's no need to take the Gaokao.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,590
You should fight for it.

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,230
What if they change their minds?

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,720
You're a good student.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,510
No school wants to see
a good student drop out.

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,550
Mom, go on, go ask.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,920
Alright, I'll go ask.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
Go ahead.

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,350
Let's go, Shanshan.

31
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,630
Teacher Wang,

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,950
it's about what I mentioned to you before.

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,310
You're my advisor.

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,440
I didn't know who else to turn to.

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,160
Even though I dropped out,

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,880
I had special circumstances at the time.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,390
And I've been studying this whole time.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,270
I've never fallen behind in my studies.

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,550
Could you give me another chance?

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,110
Alright, Lu Ran.

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Since you say
you've never stopped studying,

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
I'll give you a chance.

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,950
Take a make-up exam in half a month.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,550
If you pass,

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,550
I'll let you continue your studies.

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,950
Okay.

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,710
Thank you, Teacher Wang.

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,630
Go ahead.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,830
We're home.

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,870
I've tried so many times before,

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,840
and they never agreed.

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,200
But today they said yes.

53
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,160
I think

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,950
- he must've seen your sincerity.
- Grandma.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,870
Now the priority is to focus on your studies.

56
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,990
Put aside other things.

57
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,270
I'll work hard this time.

58
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,830
I'll seize the opportunity.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,160
What's going on?

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,440
Mom, I can continue my studies.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,920
Studies, studies,

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,340
that's all you think about.

63
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,760
Can studying put food on the table?

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,990
Oh my.

65
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,350
What time is it? Go cook.

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,350
I'll go cook now.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,710
Braised pork for dinner.

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay.

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
Wait for me.

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,270
Is she really going back to school?

71
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,000
If she gets educated,
will she still be with you?

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,190
Mom, don't worry.

73
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,160
It's fine.

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Here.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,900
I'll help her with the cooking.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,880
Studies, studies.

77
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
You're here.

78
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,880
I was just about to tell you,

79
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,350
I need to focus on my studies recently.

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,710
I thought about it,

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,510
and I'll find a helper

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,800
to assist at home.

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,670
Okay.

84
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,390
And one more thing,

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,610
Shanshan is almost
ready to start school.

86
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,800
We need to find a school for her.

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,520
Alright.

88
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,990
How about this,

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,600
tomorrow we'll first
look at schools for her.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,880
Then I'll see

91
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,320
if there's a suitable helper.

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
Lu Ran,

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,200
I've found a place for you outside.

94
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,110
You should move out.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
Qi Shengfeng, what do you mean?

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,970
From now on, don't worry about

97
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,950
family matters

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,880
and workshop matters.

99
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,880
Just focus on preparing for your exams.

100
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,680
So you're asking me to leave?

101
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,430
No,

102
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,030
it's just that
your priority should be studies.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
We'll talk about other things later.

104
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,510
Come on, let me help you.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,600
You can go. Attend to your things.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,520
We'll handle it.

107
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,680
Go on, go on, go on.

108
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
Here, have some eggs, Shenggong.

109
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,190
Do they taste good?

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,350
I'm full. You guys take your time.

111
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,350
What's wOld Zhou?

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,400
Nothing, Mom.

113
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,670
It's fine.

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Let's eat.

115
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,110
Second Brother,

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,470
I'll sleep with you tonight.

117
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,240
Are you waiting for Dad to come in?

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
No.

119
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,270
Who's waiting for him?

120
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Are you angry?

121
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
No.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
Go to sleep.

123
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,590
With your Beanie.

124
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,590
(I almost forgot)

125
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
(that our marriage is fake.)

126
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,710
(But after living together for so long,)

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,160
(I almost started to believe)

128
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,750
(that I was really part of this family.)

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,640
Qi Shengfeng,

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
come here for a moment.

131
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,480
Here is the bride price

132
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,790
and all the money you gave me.

133
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,710
It's all here.

134
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,280
Take it.

135
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,000
If you need money later,

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,910
just let me know.

137
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,830
No need.

138
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
I've made some money

139
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
from our business recently.

140
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
And here's the account I kept

141
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,740
of the money you gave me.

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,320
Lu Ran, just take it.

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
You'll need them in the future.

144
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
Don't return it.

145
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,030
I'm moving out.

146
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,660
We'll have nothing to do with each other.

147
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,350
You're giving me the dowry.

148
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,090
Are you trying to marry me?

149
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,040
Lu Ran.

150
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm telling you, don't follow me.

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,920
I said I didn't need you here.

152
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,870
It's on my way.

153
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,960
I rented a place myself.

154
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,880
No need to trouble you.

155
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,600
I've rented a place for you

156
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,990
and got everything set up.

157
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,830
But we have no relationship.

158
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,320
I can't live in your place.

159
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,070
It's fine.

160
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,230
Don't overthink it.

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,150
Your main focus now is to study hard

162
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,230
and get into university.

163
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,470
And after university?

164
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,560
After that, there's a brighter future.

165
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,320
This place is close to our home.

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,830
You can resort to me if you're in need.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
Wouldn't you accompany me?

168
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
Why do you stop?

169
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,040
We're here, this is the place.

170
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,670
If you have anything in the future,

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,630
just let me know.

172
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,680
I'll come over.

173
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,950
For now, just focus on your studies.

174
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,470
Don't worry about anything else.

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,960
And if there's anything,

176
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
just come find me anytime.

177
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,320
I... I'll come over.

178
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,310
I...

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm leaving.

180
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,590
I did say I'd leave
once I go back to school,

181
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,080
but times have changed.

182
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,510
Besides,

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,870
I haven't gone back to school yet.

184
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
Why send me away in such a hurry?

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,950
You've even prepared the place.

186
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,440
You've already planned all this!

187
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,920
You've really got everything set up.

188
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,450
You've always
wanted to send me away, huh?

189
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,950
Dad, Dad, you're back.

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
- Shanshan.
- Dad, where's Mom?

191
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,630
She has exams coming up.

192
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,030
She needs to focus on her studies now,

193
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,280
so she can get into university.

194
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,680
But why does Mom have to leave?

195
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,560
I don't want her to leave.

196
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Shanshan,

197
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,390
shouldn't we support her

198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,630
in what she wants to do?

199
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,950
Let's go.

200
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,440
Where did Lu Ran go?

201
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,200
With her luggage?

202
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,120
What's going on?

203
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,150
Mom,

204
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,480
Lu Ran might be...

205
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,200
Mom went to study.

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,510
You... go inside and play.

207
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,430
Go on.

208
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,440
The house is too chaotic,

209
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,120
so I found her a place outside

210
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,350
where she can study in peace.

211
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
What do you mean?

212
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,840
She hasn't even started university yet,

213
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,870
and she's moved out?

214
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,800
What's going to happen
when she does start?

215
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,110
Shengfeng, let me tell you,

216
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,870
"A woman's virtue
lies in her lack of talent."

217
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,470
When will you ever wise up?

218
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,100
Mom,

219
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,910
it is a rare opportunity for her.

220
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,750
Studying outside in peace is good for her.

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,520
I think you're just bewitched.

222
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,910
You'll be crying when she runs away.

223
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,200
I have to go bring her back.

224
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,440
Mom, no...

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,520
- Mom!
- Mom!

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
What?

227
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
Shengfeng,

228
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,630
I told you not to let Mom know.

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,320
Once she knows, she'll flip the roof.

230
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,800
Mom, don't meddle in their relationship.

231
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't drive Lu Ran away again.

232
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,800
Shut up! None of your business.

233
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,950
Mom,

234
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,240
she won't leave.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,720
I just found her a place outside

236
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,950
to study in peace.

237
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,900
(Happiness)

238
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,950
Go, go cook.

239
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,120
Mom, I'm pregnant.

240
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Isn't it inconvenient?

241
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,870
You're so precious.

242
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,870
I've been there before.

243
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,920
You think you're a princess.

244
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,630
Your Lu family is really a jinx.

245
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,150
As soon as we got involved with you,

246
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,590
Old Zhou was investigated.

247
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,830
And the delivery business
isn't doing well.

248
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,440
The workshop we set up is half-dead.

249
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,520
How could Huacheng be so blind

250
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,590
to marry a useless thing like you?

251
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,160
And you're giving me attitude.

252
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,000
If you don't give birth to a son,

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,350
see how I deal with you.

254
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,080
Your sister could get into university.

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Why can't you?

256
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,950
Fang Hongyang from Shuguang Group

257
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,560
is Lu Ran's classmate.

258
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,590
Now,

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,590
he's taking care of
Qi Shengfeng's business.

260
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,470
Tell me, what can you do?

261
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,600
Wait, Mom,

262
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
what did you just say?

263
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,830
He is taking care of
Qi Shengfeng's business?

264
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,950
Who told you that?

265
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,230
Old Zhou said so.

266
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,470
You're supposed to cook.

267
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:20,580
(Anshi Shuguang Group Co., Ltd.)

268
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,430
Manager Fang,

269
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,790
Manager Fang.

270
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,670
You are?

271
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Hello, I'm Lu Ran's cousin.

272
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,480
When you came to look for Lu Ran,

273
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
we met.

274
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,710
I remember.

275
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,040
What's the matter?

276
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,470
Can we talk somewhere private?

277
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,940
- My office.
- Okay.

278
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,590
Hang herself to escape marriage?

279
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,520
Yes, Lu Ran almost died.

280
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,650
The Qi family said

281
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,400
even if she died,
they'd take her body back.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,680
My sister tried to escape on the way,

283
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,110
but they caught her again.

284
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,320
The Qi family is terrible.

285
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,870
My sister lives worse than livestock there.

286
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,960
My mom couldn't stand it anymore

287
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,390
and went to argue with them,

288
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,630
but she's no match
for the old lady in the Qi family.

289
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,800
Yes, yes.

290
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,190
That old lady is a shrew.

291
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,520
My sister is too soft-hearted.

292
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,590
Even though she's suffered so much,

293
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,080
she doesn't dare tell outsiders the truth.

294
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,640
So...

295
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,560
did your sister send you to find me?

296
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,350
My sister said

297
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,830
you're a good person,

298
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,270
but she doesn't dare come to you

299
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,040
or tell you too much.

300
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,200
I heard you and Qi Shengfeng

301
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,630
are working on a big deal together.

302
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,070
My sister said

303
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,830
you must not cooperate with them.

304
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,630
I can help you find someone more reliable.

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,960
A more reliable one?

306
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,590
Who?

307
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,870
Zhou Huacheng,
the son of the town party secretary.

308
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,280
Party Secretary Zhou,

309
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,870
your father must know him.

310
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,510
Yes, he does.

311
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,190
Zhou Huacheng has a mold factory.

312
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,350
Cooperating with him
is definitely no problem.

313
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,280
We have very high requirements for quality.

314
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,560
Can you meet them?

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,720
I can take you to see.

316
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,200
Alright, let's go.

317
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,120
Okay.

318
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
Manager Fang!

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,800
Excuse me,

320
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,990
wait for me outside.

321
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
Okay.

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,800
Manager Fang, I'll wait for you outside.

323
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,510
What happened?

324
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,640
Manager Fang,

325
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,870
the product information from the manufacturer

326
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,280
seem to be wrong.

327
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,830
This is the correct one.

328
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,190
This...

329
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,830
How could you make such a mistake?

330
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,030
Should we send the correct one over?

331
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,000
They will inspect the samples
in two days.

332
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,910
I'll handle this.

333
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,150
Keep your mouth shut about this.

334
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,600
Okay, okay.

335
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,360
Here.

336
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,800
Also, you asked me to keep an eye on the Qis.

337
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
A young woman moved out this morning.

338
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
Here's the new address.

339
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,360
She moved out?

340
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,640
Good, you can go now.

341
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,700
(118 Qianjin Rd, Pujiang District, Anping)

342
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,390
Lu Ran moved out.

343
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,920
Wu, you in?

344
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,790
A 6.

345
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,830
- Want it?
- An 8.

346
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,320
Do you want it? Do you want it?

347
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,720
- I'll take it.
- Play this.

348
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,270
A 10.

349
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,670
Take me on, come on.

350
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,790
Come on, come on.

351
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,310
- Clean up, Fang Hongyang is here.
- Who?

352
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,830
Fang Hongyang from Shuguang Group.

353
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Hurry up and clean!

354
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,110
Okay, okay.

Sunflower seeds.

356
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,740
(Xinguang Mold Factory)
Table, hurry up!

357
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,120
Is this okay?

358
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,400
Look at you.

359
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,030
Stand straight.

360
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,160
Chair.

361
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
Go, go, go.

362
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,600
Everyone, be serious.

363
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,640
Okay.

365
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,880
this way, please.

366
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,950

Fang Hongyang,
the manager of Shuguang Group.

this is Zhou Huacheng I mentioned.

Please, this way.

373
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,560
Watch your head.

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,830
We have everything arranged properly here,

376
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,320
right?

377
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,840
Mind your head.

378
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,990
Be careful.

379
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,240
Are we signing the contract?

380
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,080
The sample contract.

381
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,710
Alright, alright.

382
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,030
Manager Fang,

383
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,590
didn't you already sign a contract

384
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,670
with Qi Shengfeng?

385
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,110
Their specifications are incorrect.

386
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,430
You produce according to the correct ones.

387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,910
What about the formal contract?

388
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,590
When it's time to deliver,

389
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,110
if your specifications

390
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,150
are correct, unlike Qi Shengfeng's,

391
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,430
and your prices are cheaper,

392
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,450
won't the business naturally

393
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,390
be yours?

394
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,310
- Thanks, Manager Fang.
- Thanks.

395
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,230
Thanks, Manager Fang.

396
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,830
Let me be clear upfront,

397
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,880
our Shuguang Group

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
has very high requirements
for product quality.

399
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,360
You can rest assured,

400
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
our craftsmen here are highly skilled,

401
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,030
professional.

402
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,080
Alright,

403
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,360
work hard.

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,400
Alright.

405
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
Let me see you out.

406
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,010
Take care.

407
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,330
- Manager Fang.
- Manager Fang.

408
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,270
This way.

409
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,430
- Brother Zhou.
- We made it!

410
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,710
We made it!

411
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,750
- Come on.
- Let's play.

412
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,760
- Keep going.
- Come on.

413
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Come on, come on.

414
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,110
- Come on.
- Where were we?

415
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,310
- Help me.
- I'll do it.

416
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,350
We made it.

417
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,070
Cards, cards, cards.

418
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,350
- Play cards.
- Hurry up.

419
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,680
What was the setup?

420
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,600
Like this?

421
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,750
Come on.

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Shuffle again.

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,590
We're not leaving until we lose today.

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,270
Have some sunflower seeds.

425
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,920
- Come on, let's start.
- Come on.

426
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,240
I want Mom.

427
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,000
