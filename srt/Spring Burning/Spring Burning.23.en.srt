=Episode 23=

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,070
Mr. Wang, all aspects have been

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,920
professionally tested.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,840
The density and quality
of these pump shafts

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
already exceed international standards.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,680
Good.

24
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,840
I originally thought
you'd act out of desperation,

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
but your technology

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
is truly exceptional.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,310
Let's do this.

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,250
I'll sign the production contract
with you today.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,230
Have the first batch of goods ready
in seven days.

30
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,920
That's fantastic, Mr. Wang.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,320
By the way,

32
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,710
since Director Qi isn't here,

33
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,950
can you two make the decision?

34
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,360
Of course.

35
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,360
It's not that he doesn't care.

36
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,670
It's just that our factory recently...

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,600
- Mr. Wang.
- I understand.

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,840
Your factory

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,550
has indeed
had some difficulties recently.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
But my order

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,480
can't be delayed.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
Mr. Wang, rest assured.

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,970
- Okay.
- Nice working with you.

44
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,520
- My pleasure.
- Wish our cooperation succeeds.

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,800
- Nice working with you.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,880
- Take care, Mr. Wang.
- Take care.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,400
Goodbye.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,320
Okay.

49
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,110
Ms. Bai,

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,710
we don't understand
Shuguang Group's motive

51
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,990
for doing this.

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
I deeply regret

53
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,480
the supplier replacement.

54
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,040
Our cooperation has been flawless.

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,710
Why replace our products?

56
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,440
Our reputation
has always been excellent.

57
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,710
I was originally
in charge of this project,

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
but ironically,

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm now struggling to protect myself

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,880
and have no say

61
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,440
in this matter.

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,880
Did something happen?

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,270
Can you tell us?

64
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,960
Chairwoman Bai's long-lost granddaughter

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,880
has been found.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Now Grandma dotes on her excessively.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,390
She's now the project leader

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,040
and insists on replacing you.

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,600
I can't stop her.

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,000
But our steel factory

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,040
has had no problems
with this collaboration.

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
Why replace us, even if

73
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,950
it means breaking the contract?

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,600
You must have some conflict with her.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Her husband is Zhou Huacheng.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,480
Are you saying

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,710
Chairwoman Bai's granddaughter
is Lu Qianqian?

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,790
Ms. Bai,

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,160
I suspect that Lu Qianqian

80
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,640
isn't Chairwoman Bai's
biological granddaughter.

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,830
What do you mean?

82
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,880
You may not know

83
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,880
that Lu Qianqian is my cousin.

84
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,270
I'm familiar with her maternal family.

85
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,190
But Lu Qianqian

86
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,710
did present Grandma's token.

87
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
A token?

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes,

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,200
she wears a longevity lock

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,070
identical to

91
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,320
what Grandma's lost daughter wore
when she disappeared.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,030
This is the only thing your mother left.

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,440
Keep it safe.

94
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,360
Dad!

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,510
Dad, what's wrong?

96
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,350
Wake up!

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,440
Could you

98
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,150
show me that longevity lock if possible?

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
Sure.

100
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,440
I've already started
investigating Lu Qianqian.

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,870
As I know, the Jianhong Steel Factory

102
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,030
she works with

103
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,270
has unstable product quality.

104
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,200
I've already sent

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
- their products for inspection.
- What's wrong?

106
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,440
- Nothing.
- I've been worried

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,950
that even if problems exist,

108
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,760
Grandma would still protect her.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,590
But if she's an impostor,

110
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,630
I can provide more

111
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,100
of Lu Qianqian's personal information

112
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,030
for a deeper investigation.

113
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Qianqian,

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,600
here you are.

115
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,870
Thank you.

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,470
- Come on.
- Thank you, Grandma.

117
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,510
Grandma, eat this.

118
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,680
Good, good.

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
Eat it.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,030
Sister Simeng,

121
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,510
why haven't you been
managing company affairs lately?

122
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
Have you been unhappy

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
since I arrived?

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Although Qianqian hasn't been here long,

125
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,510
- she's learning quickly.
- Yes.

126
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,910
Everyone can see that.

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,600
Yes.

128
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,830
However, Simeng,

129
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,470
Qianqian is new to our company.

130
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,350
There's still a lot

131
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,080
she doesn't know.

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
So you need to mentor her more.

133
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,270
I can't teach her.

134
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,990
Recently,

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
posing as a partner,

136
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
I contacted Jianhong Steel

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,350
and other company representatives.

138
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,720
I've obtained

139
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,200
substantial evidence
of Lu Qianqian taking kickbacks.

140
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,760
My investigation shows

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,190
they lack the technology

142
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,760
to produce high-quality carbon steel.

143
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,830
Using inferior materials

144
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,400
for bridge construction
would cause unimaginable consequences.

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,520
(Steel Factory Cash Expense Certificate)

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,350
Grandma,

147
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,350
this is your beloved granddaughter.

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,350
She is taking bribes,

149
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,870
oppressing Shantou Town Steel Factory

150
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,350
for personal reasons,

151
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
and selling steel for Jianhong Steel

152
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,270
under the guise of the company.

153
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,580
She takes bribes from both sides!

154
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Grandma, I...

155
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,910
Qianqian is new to corporate interests

156
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,440
and has made some mistakes.

157
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,470
Yes, there was a problem.

158
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,680
But let me

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,880
guide her privately.

160
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,990
Is that okay?

161
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,910
Lu Ran was right.

162
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,470
You still want

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,150
to protect her at this point.

164
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,190
Chairwoman!

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,430
Chairwoman, there's been a breakdown
in the construction team.

166
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,350
Something went wrong!

167
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,350
What happened?

168
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,390
It's the cross-river bridge
construction team.

169
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,590
During construction,
the structure collapsed.

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,350
But the workers
have been taken to hospital.

171
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,440
How could the construction collapse?

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,420
This project uses all experienced
and excellent construction teams.

173
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,030
Why is there such a big accident?

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,290
No matter how experienced they are,

175
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,620
bad materials can ruin everything.

176
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
I have warned before.

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,870
If we use low-quality carbon steel,

178
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,270
problems are inevitable.

179
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,800
Low-quality carbon steel?

180
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
In the project proposal,

181
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,920
I clearly approved

182
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
high-quality carbon steel!

183
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,240
You... didn't know?

184
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,200
When I first inspected the materials,

185
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,590
I found low-quality carbon steel.

186
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,190
I reported this to Manager Lu.

187
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,320
Many witnesses saw this.

188
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,950
Manager Lu said it had been approved
by Chairwoman Bai.

189
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,520
That's why we continued
with the construction.

190
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,280
You used low-quality carbon steel,

191
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,240
but I allocated funds
for high-quality carbon steel!

192
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,590
How dare you embezzle this money?

193
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,710
Grandma,

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,030
oppressing employees,

195
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,030
forming cliques,

196
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,740
using inferior materials
to embezzle funds!

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,750
Grandma, all these schemes

198
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,200
don't look like the work of someone

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,150
who knows nothing.

200
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,950
Bai Simeng, what are you implying?

201
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,750
Are you afraid I'll take your position?

202
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,570
Are you... deliberately kicking me
when I'm down?

203
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,150
Me? Kicking you down?

204
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,070
Enough!

205
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,880
Manager Zheng,

206
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,350
immediately confirm casualty situation,

207
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,560
halt all construction,

208
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,680
and conduct a thorough inspection
of all materials.

209
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,710
Okay.

210
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Lu Qianqian,

211
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,630
any one of these offenses

212
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,630
is enough to send you to prison!

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,900
Bai Simeng,

214
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,200
- stop trying to scare me.
- Alright...

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,300
- Let me tell you...
- Alright...

216
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
Then we'll see.

217
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Grandma,

218
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,990
Lu Qianqian isn't
your biological granddaughter.

219
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
What are you saying?

220
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,950
Chairwoman,

221
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,230
she truly isn't your granddaughter.

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,920
Why?

223
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,750
Tell me why.

224
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,990
Initially, I was afraid
of disappointing you again,

225
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,470
so I wanted to wait
until I found the real young lady.

226
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,830
But I didn't expect
so many things to happen.

227
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,470
Now it's time.

228
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,740
Actually, I've suspected you
for a while.

229
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,470
When I first investigated you,

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,770
all the informants
gave identical statements.

231
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Then I checked your background

232
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,540
and found your prenatal care hospital.

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,600
I did DNA tests between you

234
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
and the Lu family.

235
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,550
Chairwoman,

236
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,630
I even did a DNA test
between her and you.

237
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,080
Here's the report.

238
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,380
(DNA Test Report)

239
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,080
Decades ago,

240
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,470
the Lu family did adopt a girl.

241
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
That girl married their eldest son

242
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,710
but died of illness
years after childbirth.

243
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,830
Her daughter was named Lu Ran.

244
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,430
You mean...

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,160
the Lu Ran

246
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,440
from the steel factory?

247
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,880
Yes, it's her.

248
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,080
Report to the police immediately.

249
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,710
Bring her to justice!

250
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,230
Grandma, save me!

251
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,830
- Slow down.
- Grandma!

252
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,110
Grandma, help me!

253
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,670
I don't want to go to jail!

254
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,000
- I don't want to go.
- Okay, no jail...

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,280
- What should I do?
- No jail...

256
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,990
- What should I do?
- You won't go.

257
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,030
We've stockpiled

258
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,750
too much inventory and raw materials.

259
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,870
Quick! Turn on the radio!

260
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,740
Since China introduced the dual-track system
of commodity pricing in China,

261
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,200
the proportion of steel sold
at non-state-fixed prices

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,320
has risen to 21.6%.

263
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,750
The industry is finally experiencing
widespread growth.

264
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,080
Reports indicate steel prices have risen
from 1,200 yuan per ton

265
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,160
to 2,400 yuan per ton.

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,160
Brother, Ran,

267
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,590
what does this news mean?

268
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,750
Did the materials we stored

269
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,230
suddenly multiply in value?

270
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Then our predicament

271
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
has turned into great fortune, right?

272
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,160
Tremendous fortune!

273
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,870
Wonderful!

274
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,030
But...

275
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,870
if we haven't sold those steel yet,

276
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,990
does that mean we still have no cash?

277
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
Prices rose

278
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,590
because of market demand.

279
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,120
Don't worry.

280
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,950
Shuguang Group will come
knocking again soon.

281
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,040
More orders will follow.

282
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,710
Good!

283
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,870
It's delicious.

284
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,870
- Here.
- Aunt.

285
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,270
- Thank you, Aunt.
- Thank you.

286
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,100
Mom, sit and eat with us.

287
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,830
No need.
I'll eat downstairs with Shanshan.

288
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,800
You can discuss business.

289
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
Thank you, Aunt.

290
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,200
- Thanks for your hard work.
- No trouble.

291
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,200
Brother, honestly,

292
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,080
when I heard the news,

293
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,150
I was shocked.

294
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,840
With our warehouse

295
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,870
full of quality goods,

296
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,280
everyone's coming to us now.

297
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,550
Exactly!

298
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,510
Before we had

299
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,750
to go begging

300
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,030
for orders,

301
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,950
now

302
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,590
they come to us.

303
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,390
Everyone has worked hard.

304
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,520
Let's have a drink.

305
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,910
- Come on.
- Cheers!

306
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

307
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,670
Thanks to Brother Qi and Ran.

308
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,200
No, especially Ran.

309
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,700
She's not even related to us,

310
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,890
but she helps us all the time.

311
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,910
- Exactly.
- What do you mean?

312
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,630
Are we related by blood?

313
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,560
- Brother!
- Aren't you our real brother?

314
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,390
- Yeah.
- Then I'm your real sister-in-law!

315
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,400
We owe it to both Brother Qi and Ran.

316
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
- Together!
- Yeah.

317
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
- Yeah.
- From helping us

318
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,750
get the cart business,

319
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,870
to solving

320
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,080
Shuguang Group's

321
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
order issues,

322
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,790
and now contracting

323
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,630
the steel factory,

324
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,520
all thanks to them!

325
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,630
- That's right.
- Right.

326
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,990
When you had problems
after contracting,

327
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,990
we were careless
and couldn't help you much.

328
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,230
Thanks to Ran
for always supporting Brother Qi.

329
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,590
Since we're all here,

330
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,470
I'll speak from the heart.

331
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,350
Brother Qi, Ran,

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
I used to be

333
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,110
a laid-off blacksmith,

334
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,920
who struggled

335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,710
to feed

336
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
my family.

337
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,350
Thank you

338
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,590
for giving me a chance.

339
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,470
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here now.

340
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,230
Who'd have thought

341
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,040
I, Zhao Wei,

342
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,630
would sit
in a steel factory office today?

343
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,310
Brother Qi,

344
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,470
Ran,

345
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,710
- I'll drink to you.
- Come on.

346
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,680
Let's not stand

347
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,550
on ceremony.

348
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,160
Brother Qi, I toast to both of you.

349
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,550
May our factory prosper

350
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,750
and your love last forever.

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,160
Help yourself.

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,550
Since we're toasting, let's make rounds.

353
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,880
- I'll join.
- You too?

354
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,390
I'll drink up, Brother Qi.

355
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,590
- Just a sip.
- To Ran.

356
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,440
Don't miss me!

357
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,360
Absolutely.

358
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,830
- Go ahead.
- Brother, Ran,

359
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,160
no more words,

360
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
I toast you.

361
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Brother Qi.

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
Brother Qi, will you drink up?

363
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,310
Really?

364
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,470
Good!

365
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,390
- Sit down.
- Have a seat.

366
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,470
Let's eat...

367
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,160
Mom's cooking is excellent.

368
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,310
Okay.

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is there no more alcohol?

370
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,720
Do you want some more?

371
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
I'll get it.

372
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,750
I'll get a few more.

373
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,440
- Thanks, Ran.
- Thanks, Ran.

374
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,160
Here's the wine.

375
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
