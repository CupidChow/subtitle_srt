00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,120
How's it going?

20
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,710
Here's the payroll from accounting.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Take a look.

22
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,080
(Anshi Shantou Town Steel Factory Payroll)
Li Jianguo, Li Jianhua, Li Jianzhong...

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,120
A whole family working at the factory?

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,630
I remember only one family member

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,710
is allowed to work in the factory.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,030
If they're all actually working, fine.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,470
But I checked

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,840
some just collect pay

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,910
without doing any work.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
How bold.

31
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm planning an audit,

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,590
but we can't tip them off first.

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,310
Let them stay complacent.

34
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,840
Good. Also, Qian Fugui has been

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,310
causing trouble lately,

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,430
planning to lead a protest.

37
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,710
With the new factory director

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,310
and more layoffs coming,

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
people are nervous

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
without full details.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,150
A perfect chance to see

42
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,180
who's pulling strings behind the scenes.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,470
How are machine repairs?

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,830
Going well.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,190
Director Li's team arrived early

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,560
and joined the repairs

47
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,400
immediately.

48
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,310
They're excited and motivated

49
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,280
with great efficiency.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Good.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,910
That was smart of you.

52
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,630
Helped Director Li

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,030
and sped up our repairs.

54
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,080
When will you start the production?

55
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,270
In a few days.

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,310
The priority is to

57
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,000
win back the steel factory's

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,920
biggest lost contract.

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,740
(Mom and Dad, Shanshan misses you.)

60
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,030
What's wrong?

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,800
Recently, when we come home,

62
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,800
Shanshan's already asleep.

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,870
When we leave,

64
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,710
she's still not awake.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
We haven't seen her properly in days.

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,870
If I were Shanshan,

67
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,280
I wouldn't like parents like this.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
When I was busy before,

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,800
I was rarely home too.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,290
We should spend time with her.

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,750
I remember when I was little,

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,360
my parents often took me out.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,560
Short trips,

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,270
but

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,430
precious memories for me.

76
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,510
After they passed away,

77
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,270
I'd think back...

78
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,680
I'd also think

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,630
if I

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
ever became a mom,

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
I'd make sure my child

82
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,310
was happy and carefree.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,430
Let's finish up quickly

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,160
and spend time with Shanshan.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,870
Take her out for fun.

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,110
Deal.

87
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,270
Mr. Wang.

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,270
You again?

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,920
I've made myself clear.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
About your small mold factory,

91
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,430
we can talk about cooperation,

92
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,950
but the steel factory is off the table.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,360
Mr. Wang, I know your company needs it.

94
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
I do need it.

95
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,680
But can the steel factory produce it?

96
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,720
Do you know how huge the trouble you caused

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
last month?

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
Mr. Wang, I guarantee

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,390
this will never happen again.

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,530
Guarantee?

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
With what? Tell me.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,560
We'll sign a high penalty clause.

103
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,270
The original contract had penalties in it.

104
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,930
But the account was empty.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
What good was that?

106
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,150
Besides

107
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,390
I don't want penalties.

108
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,680
I want the goods.

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,430
Mr. Wang, take a look.

110
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,870
This is all the assets

111
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,560
the steel factory can mortgage.

112
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,090
If the factory fails to deliver,

113
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,120
my workshop will cover it.

114
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,750
If my workshop can't either,

115
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,120
all this goes to you.

116
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
- What are you doing?
- Get out! Out!

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Go!

118
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,110
Hurry up!

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,440
You'll regret this!

120
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
Just wait!

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,610
Master! Master!

122
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,450
- Trouble!
- What?

123
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,360
The new director's team

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
are at the accounting office.

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
Hurry!

126
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,870
Get the poorest workers

127
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,490
- to protest.
- On it! I'll gather them.

128
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,350
Hurry! Let's go!

129
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,360
Follow me! This way!

130
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,350
- Go.
- Go.

131
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,240
- What?
- They didn't pay us!

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,040
- You can't go in!
- They didn't pay us!

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
- It's them!
- Don't force me!

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
What's going on?

135
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,800
Everyone, calm down!

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
If you can't run the steel factory,

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,190
the Shuguang Group can!

138
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,480
At least they'll pay our wages!

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,470
Exactly! They promised us salaries long ago!

140
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,720
Our families are starving!

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,880
Just pay up already!

142
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,800
Watch your words!

143
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,590
Everyone, calm down! Settle down!

144
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,600
I've received the name lists.

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm fully aware

146
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,680
of the situation.

147
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
Once the accounting team

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,150
finishes accounting,

149
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,270
everyone will get paid.

150
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,350
Are you serious?

151
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,000
- Yeah.
- All talk no action!

152
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,390
You've been promising salaries!

153
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,710
Within one week at most,

154
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,030
you'll all get paid.

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,220
What does a woman like you know about it?

156
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,250
Hey!

157
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,390
Watch your mouth!

158
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,270
Accounting is simple.

159
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,960
I know you,

160
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,560
Liu Shishuai.

161
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,240
Two unexcused absences this month,

162
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,270
plus two late arrivals.

163
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,680
Instead of getting the monthly bonus,

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
you'll get a five-yuan deduction.

165
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,360
Guys, you should thank him

166
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,950
for contributing to our payroll fund.

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,710
This is the new head of accounting

168
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,680
and deputy director of the factory.

169
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,760
Let me introduce myself.

170
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,960
I'm Lu Ran.

171
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,120
Top accounting graduates
from Anshi University

172
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,470
will conduct a full audit.

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,270
Attention, please. Attention please.

174
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,680
The steel factory has resumed production.

175
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,800
The accounting office is finalizing payroll.

176
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,470
Salaries will be issued in seven days.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,910
Wages in seven days!

178
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,350
Did you hear that?

179
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,110
Stop crowding here.
- You can go.

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,630
- Please, leave.
- Leave.

181
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,630
Would the PA system lie?

182
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Back to work, everyone!

183
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,440
- Ran.
- Ran.

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,630
Let's go inside and talk.

185
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,710
Come on.

186
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,700
(Accounting Office)

187
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Teacher Wang,

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,520
thank you so much for helping us.

189
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Don't mention it.

190
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,680
This audit

191
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,510
is a valuable practical experience

192
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,160
for our mathematics students.

193
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,470
I should be thanking you.

194
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,470
Teacher Wang.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
You're being too polite.

196
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,880
Have some water.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,920
Thanks.

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
We're planning to audit

199
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
all the factory accounts

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
from the past ten years.

201
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,790
No problem.

202
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
Let me go make arrangements.

203
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Alright, thank you.

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,690
Take care, Teacher Wang.

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,300
Do you think we'll get caught

206
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,960
moving the account books out?

207
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Don't worry, it's fine.

208
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,870
Ma Qiang moved them overnight.

209
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Right inside the factory.

210
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,350
Those people probably still think

211
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,590
the books are in the office.

212
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,640
Good.

213
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,590
Here, and here...

214
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,230
I thought you'd fallen asleep.

215
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,160
How could I?

216
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,560
With this audit going on,

217
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,560
half the factory wants me dead.

218
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,270
Someone tried to burn down
the accounting office.

219
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,190
Got caught.

220
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,280
Sent to the police.

221
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,240
It's handled now.

222
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,990
You must be exhausted.

223
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,830
Should I take you home to rest?

224
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,400
No.

225
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,110
Where you go, I go.

226
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,990
Brother Qi, Ran.

227
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,470
Trouble!

228
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,080
- What?
- Explain slowly.

229
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,390
About today's shipment.

230
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,390
Our transport team

231
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,950
abandoned the trucks halfway.

232
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,110
Workers are protesting
and blocking operations.

233
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,350
Don't worry, it's handled.

234
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,750
Brother Qi, Ran.

235
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,400
Those transport scoundrels

236
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,990
dumped loaded trucks on the roadside,

237
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,110
but Brother Shenggong sent two groups.

238
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,590
One is guarding the goods.

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,910
One seized the transport team

240
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,910
and took their keys.

241
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,920
About the transport team?

242
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,950
Fire them all.

243
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,830
Brother Qi,

244
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,440
the repaired machines

245
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,320
have greatly improved efficiency.

246
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
This week's output equals

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,350
a whole month's production before.

248
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,550
Exactly,

249
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,560
all machines are fixed.

250
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,890
And the transport team is back.

251
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Production can resume fully now,

252
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
both manufacturing and

253
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
logistics.

254
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,630
What's next?

255
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
After the audit finishes,

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,800
we'll start personnel restructuring.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,870
- Got it.
- Yes.

258
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,990
Then we'll expand production

259
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,200
to secure more contracts.

260
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,830
We'll head out now.

261
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,870
- Go ahead.
- On it.

262
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,790
- Got it.
- Bye.

263
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Let's get back.

264
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,040
Back to work.

265
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,830
How are we supposed to survive?

266
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,560
No wages for months.

267
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,400
Exactly! Just bullying us workers.

268
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,790
Yeah.

269
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,870
I heard

270
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,320
many got taken away recently.

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
Probably all the corrupt ones.

272
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,440
The director's been interviewing people.

273
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,440
Many left jobless afterward.

274
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,710
Are we...

275
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,830
the next?

276
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,630
What should we do then?

277
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,190
Can't leave empty-handed.

278
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,750
Gotta take something.

279
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,390
Why fire me?

280
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm their supervisor!

281
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,950
I've worked here for over ten years!

282
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,800
More like idled for ten years.

283
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
How could you idle that long?

284
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,200
Never did any real work,

285
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
just bossed us around all day.

286
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,520
None of your business!

287
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,950
Exactly!

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,920
Just leave already!

289
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,480
Collecting pay for no work.

290
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,280
The director made the right call firing him.

291
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,550
Indeed.

292
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,370
Quality Control Director was taken away.

293
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,190
You know about this?

294
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,390
I know.

295
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,480
He's trying to reduce his sentence

296
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,200
by reporting

297
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,870
that you bought subpar materials,

298
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,080
took bribes from him.

299
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,030
That's why our steel

300
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,360
passed factory inspections

301
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,520
but had crazy return rates.

302
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,750
Director Qi, that's... that's his story!

303
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,120
It was him colluding with
Mr. Sun from Logistics.

304
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,670
He's dumping the blame on me!

305
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,120
Director Qi, it's not true!

306
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,040
Don't believe him!

307
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,230
Then tell me the truth.

308
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,350
Fine. I'll explain everything.

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,650
Making this big of a scene,

310
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,990
even involving city officials.

311
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,160
Isn't this too...

312
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,280
Why hesitate now?

313
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,990
I've arranged everything.

314
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,120
Old Sun, you'd really let

315
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,030
some random blacksmith

316
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,590
treat us like dirt?

317
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,440
The whole management

318
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,990
backs my plan now.

319
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,840
As long as we workers strike

320
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,910
and halt production,

321
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,990
Qi Shengfeng won't stand a chance!

322
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,320
If you side with him,

323
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,400
you're betraying all of us.

324
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
Think carefully.

325
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,720
But...

326
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,200
No "buts"!

327
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,710
They're auditing the books.

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,990
Your family needs those wages.

329
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,920
Fine. I'm in.

330
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,750
Mr. Sun! Mr. Sun!

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,870
What?

332
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,520
Police are here. They want to talk.

333
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,470
Let's go.

334
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
Ask your questions quick.

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
I've got no time for delays.

336
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,680
Luo Guoqiang.

337
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,150
Lately, several staff

338
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,510
got taken in by the police.

339
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,430
You know this?

340
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah. What's it to me?

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,990
Someone reported you

342
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,550
selling factory steel as scrap,

343
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,750
pocketing huge profits.

344
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,680
The arrested man already confessed.

345
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,830
He said you masterminded it.

346
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,200
He just assisted.

347
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
Lies!

348
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,200
Ma'am,

349
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,590
I didn't do this.

350
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,920
Our investigation shows

351
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,160
your family's struggling.

352
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,710
We doubt you could lead such a scheme,

353
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,680
so we're offering you a deal:

354
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,110
Confess everything voluntarily,

355
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
provide physical evidence,

356
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,200
and you'll get leniency.

357
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,720
I have proof.

358
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,870
My own ledger.

359
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,990
I'll hand it over.

360
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,160
Mr. Fang!

361
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,190
Who sent you?

362
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,870
Trouble, Mr. Fang!

363
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,680
Qi Shengfeng's up to something.

364
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,960
The police just took away

365
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,120
dozens of people from the factory.

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,160
All our plan participants.

367
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,520
Keep calm.

368
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,040
Don't panic about minor disturbances.

369
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,750
However many they arrest,

370
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,470
what proof links them to you?

371
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,750
He's auditing the books...

372
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,790
If they...

373
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,710
It's actually good for us.

374
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,750
We want workers paranoid.

375
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,990
Those laborers understand nothing.

376
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,200
We need manufactured chaos,

377
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,200
make them feel besieged. Understood?

378
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
These workers have no clue
what's happening.

379
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,600
They just know
the director is investigating them.

380
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,630
I can throw the fuel on the fire.

381
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,140
At least you're acting like
a deputy director.

382
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,520
Stick to the plan.

383
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,590
- Leave. Now.
- Yes, I'm leaving.

384
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,670
(Worthless fool.)

385
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,280
(Deputy director?)

386
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,240
(In your dreams.)

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Listen, everyone!

388
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,600
You've all seen it.

389
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,790
Ever since Qi Shengfeng

390
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,910
took over the steel factory,

391
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,110
he's ignored us workers

392
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,430
completely.

393
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,350
Worse, he's purged dissenters

394
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,560
and installed his cronies,

395
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,040
showing no mercy.

396
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,350
Now he's having police

397
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,350
arrest our colleagues.

398
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,390
Months without pay,

399
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,800
what's wrong with taking supplies?

400
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,790
- Right!
- Exactly!

401
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,640
Isn't it? It's!

402
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,640
I only took three stools!

403
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,110
They arrest us for that?

404
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,590
- Still no wages!
- Right?

405
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,870
- Exactly!
- Yeah!

406
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,400
Has anyone been paid yet?

407
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,750
- Not a cent!
- Nothing at all!

408
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,110
Families going hungry!

409
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,640
Let's go demand our wages!

410
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
- Confront them now!
- We will get our pay!

411
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,670
Move out!

412
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,560
Accusing us of nepotism?

413
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,630
Fine.

414
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,280
What's your name?

415
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,190
Everyone,

416
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,560
this is Qian Ronghua,

417
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,390
nephew of Chief Qian Fugui.

418
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,430
Qian has eight relatives in our factory,

419
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,560
four just collecting paychecks without work.

420
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,280
How does she know?

421
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,520
Not just Chief Qian.

422
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,350
We've checked

423
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,510
all the ghost workers.

424
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,750
(Folder)
116 in total.

425
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
116?

426
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,220
- That many?!
- Unbelievable!

427
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
97 clocked in

428
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,800
but never worked.

429
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,550
8 unqualified

430
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,590
'managers'.

431
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,720
Should they earn money

432
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,750
like you?

433
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,510
- No way!
- Hell no!

434
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,680
- Why them?
- Why them?

435
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
We've worked so hard.

436
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,880
These days,

437
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,390
we've been auditing
the factory's old accounts

438
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,960
and verifying the employees.

439
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,880
But shockingly,

440
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
someone tried to

441
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,160
burn the ledgers with people!

442
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,270
It's so vicious.

443
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,190
What is this called?

444
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,870
Murder and arson!

445
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,830
After the audit,

446
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,150
serious cases went to the police.

447
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,320
For the rest?

448
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Director Qi says

449
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,630
clean slate and a fresh start.

450
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,150
Let's rebuild this factory

451
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,430
together!

452
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,720
Seriously?

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,030
No consequences at all?

454
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,760
I don't buy it.

455
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,830
We haven't even been paid!

456
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,240
Since when can we trust her?

457
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,830
Are you accusing me of favoritism?

458
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Lately,

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,960
the factory keeps having strikes.

460
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,760
I want to tell everyone,

461
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,590
these shipments don't just
appear out of thin air.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,110
It's these few people

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
working day and night,

464
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,430
working overtime to get them done.

465
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,190
Once the payment arrives,

466
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,150
we can pay everyone's wages.

467
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,800
From now on,

468
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,830
all employees keeping production going

469
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,590
will get a pay raise,

470
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,830
plus an extra 100 in bonuses.

471
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,550
This won't do. We need a solution.

472
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,800
What can I do?

473
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,040
We'll issue payments today.

474
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,000
From now on,

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
20% of annual profits

476
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,630
will go to worker bonuses.

477
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
More work, more rewards.

478
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,800
Bonuses? Unheard of!

479
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,110
Unheard of!

480
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
What they're holding

481
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,150
are the audited ledgers.

482
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,960
Today's promise is sealed

483
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,720
by burning the old books.

484
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,790
The books.

485
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,320
It's burning. It's burning!

486
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,750
Yes!

487
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,400
This...

488
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,600
It's really burning!

489
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,240
And they're just letting it go?

490
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,880
They lit it up!

491
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,070
They lit it up!

492
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,480
It's burning!
It's really on fire!

493
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,400
It's burning!

494
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,720
Look! It's really burning!

495
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,570
Shantou Town Steel Factory Balance Sheet.

496
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,160
Good! Good!

497
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,150
There's hope now!

498
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,000
There's hope now!

499
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
We'll get wages, plus bonuses!

500
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,030
Good! Good! Good!

501
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,190
Finally, real action!

502
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,430
We're getting paid!

503
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,440
We'll have money at last!

504
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,720
- Good!
- Great!

505
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,320
There are bonuses too!

506
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,670
(Shantou Town Steel Factory)

507
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,230
Mr. Fang! Mr. Fang! Mr. Fang!

508
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,510
It's been so long. What happened?

509
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,670
They're already rioting!

510
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,340
- Go in!
- Let's go!

511
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,830
(The steel factory is in chaos.)

512
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,670
(Qi Shengfeng…)

513
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,880
(Your downfall is finally here.)

514
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,790
Good! Good! Good!

515
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,560
There's hope now! There's hope now!

516
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
Pay back our hard-earned money!

517
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,280
This factory ruined our jobs!

518
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,770
(Work and a living!)
Pay us back!

519
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,040
Pay back our hard-earned money!

520
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,430
Pay back our hard-earned money!

521
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,860
Pay back our hard-earned money!

522
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
Pay back our hard-earned money!

523
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,350
Pay back

524
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,960
- our hard-earned money!
- Director Qi!

525
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,110
You've been accused of
firing staff without cause.

526
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,270
How do you respond?

527
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,030
Director Qi, you favor cronies here.

528
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,000
Doesn't this betray

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,480
your promises to the workers?

530
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Director Qi, you still haven't
paid back wages.

531
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,870
