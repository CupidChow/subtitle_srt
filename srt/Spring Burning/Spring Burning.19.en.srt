19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Confession leads to leniency.

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
You misunderstood me.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,280
Bai Simeng came to see me earlier.

22
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,560
All the brothers were present,

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
so it wasn't convenient to talk.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,230
She wanted me to be Vice President
at Shuguang Group

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
with a very high salary.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,590
She even said
I could bring the brothers along.

27
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,920
This would significantly

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,310
improve the brothers' situation.

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,870
What do you think?

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,760
Didn't we already agree?

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,900
We're bidding for

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,990
the steel factory
because we see its future potential

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,680
and those thousands of workers' jobs.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
I won't abandon our long-term plans

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,990
for short-term gains.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,510
If Shuguang Group would
retain the workers,

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,600
even I would be tempted,
not to mention you.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,910
You mustn't waver.

39
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,530
We're committed
to taking over the steel factory.

40
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,200
Alright, alright. Got it.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
I'll head back first.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,480
Let's discuss the steel factory again.

43
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,510
But we've already covered everything.

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,920
Let's talk some more.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,270
Fine.

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,390
Let's revisit the steel factory plan.

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,230
Lu Ran,

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,550
Shanshan misses you.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,990
Just Shanshan?

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,880
I miss you too.

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,550
How about moving back?

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,950
The house doesn't feel like home

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
without you.

54
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,400
But now, we...

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
I know.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,750
We're dating.

57
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,160
I'm still on probation.

58
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,480
I'll keep sleeping on the floor.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,080
Move back, okay?

60
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,790
Fine.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
I'll pack your things.

62
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm tired today.

63
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's rest first.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,760
We'll pack another day.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,830
So we...

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,160
Let's go.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Grandma,

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Fang Hongyang's progress has stalled.

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,110
From what I've learned,

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,510
Party Secretary Fang
already favors Qi Shengfeng.

71
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,240
I tried recruiting Qi Shengfeng

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,160
as Vice President,

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,790
but I was rejected.

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,160
I wonder

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,440
how Qi Shengfeng,
a small workshop owner,

76
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,590
can compete with our Shuguang Group.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,240
And how did he

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
persuade Party Secretary Fang?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,040
Qi Shengfeng's wife, Lu Ran,

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,960
is a college student.

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,510
I believe

82
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,830
she's the decision-maker.

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,150
She proposed retaining existing workers

84
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,430
and presented several

85
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,910
factory restructuring plans.

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Lu Ran...

87
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,350
Well then,

88
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,080
Simeng,

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,320
take the contract directly
to Party Secretary Fang.

90
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll handle the rest.

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,280
Okay, Grandma.

92
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,830
I'll draft the contract immediately.

93
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,950
Greetings, Governor Jia.

94
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,390
This is Bai Chunran from Shuguang Group.

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,120
May I have two minutes?

96
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,760
I need to report about

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,470
our steel factory acquisition plan.

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,640
Party Secretary Fang,

99
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,880
this is ultimately your decision.

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,440
Is it Shuguang Group or Shengfeng?

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,120
- Hello.
- It's me.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Governor, please say.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Yihui,

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,390
I've always trusted

105
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,800
your judgment.

106
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,760
But Shuguang Group

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,760
is our province's major taxpayer

108
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,390
providing countless jobs.

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,190
How could you consider
a blacksmith workshop owner

110
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
as a competition?

111
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,150
Tell me what you think.

112
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,950
Whatever your relationship

113
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,080
with this young man,

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
you must make the right judgment

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,910
on major issues.

116
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,560
You'll be held accountable
if anything goes wrong.

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,640
It's all right.

118
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,240
Now recite
"Thoughts on a Tranquil Night".

119
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,870
Director Qi,

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,830
what's your first priority

121
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,080
after taking over the steel factory?

122
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,750
Me?

123
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,350
I'll repair all broken machinery

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,510
and expand production.

125
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,680
My first task will be

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,350
rooting out all corrupt elements.

127
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,270
It'll boost worker morale

128
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,190
by showing

129
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,680
better work equals better pay.

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Don't neglect your studies.

131
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,470
Don't worry.

132
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,350
My course load is light now,

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
and I'll start internships

134
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
next semester.

135
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,910
We've been too busy lately.

136
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,830
We neglected Shanshan

137
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,000
and this home.

138
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,440
Leave family matters to me.

139
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,830
You focus on your work.

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,590
Mom and Dad,

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,800
I study hard on my own.

142
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,710
You don't have to worry about me.

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
You can do big things

144
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,270
and help lots of people work.

145
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Let me see.

146
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,360
There's one more sentence.

147
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,280
Director Qi.

148
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,310
Secretary Zhang,

149
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,440
why are you here?

150
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,320
Director Sun requests your presence
at the steel factory office.

151
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,880
Please have a seat.

152
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Director Sun,

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,390
speak plainly.

154
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,670
We...

155
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,200
We can accept that.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,920
Ms. Bai, you're here.

157
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Please, have a seat.

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,920
Party Secretary Fang, you're too kind.

159
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,470
Sit down.

160
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,120
This is our Shuguang Group's

161
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,990
previously discussed
cooperation agreement.

162
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,120
Please review.

163
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,040
Okay.

164
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
Party Secretary Fang and I

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
stayed up all night.

166
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,230
We decided to entrust the factory...

167
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,990
to you.

168
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,830
Wonderful.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Shengfeng,

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,880
this is great.

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
Director Sun, thank you.

172
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,520
Thank you.

173
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,040
Here's the thing, Ms. Bai,

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,950
after careful consideration,

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,630
we've decided

176
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,680
not to sign with Shuguang Group for now.

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,230
You chose Qi Shengfeng?

178
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,590
Young people...

179
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Of course, of course.

180
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes.

181
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,520
Understand.

182
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,710
We understand completely.

183
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Governor, rest assured.

184
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,030
Alright.

185
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,320
Okay, thank you, Governor.

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,240
I'm going to hang up.

187
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
Okay.

188
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,310
Hongyang,

189
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,670
I had high hopes

190
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,440
for you in this project.

191
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,750
But you've disappointed me.

192
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,110
Chairwoman...

193
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,750
The steel factory project

194
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,590
is both an opportunity

195
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
and a liability.

196
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,120
Right...

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
We all know there are many problems

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
in the factory.

199
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,680
Qi Shengfeng might fail

200
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,990
to manage it properly.

201
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,230
When he does,

202
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,710
the factory will still be ours...

203
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,350
Keep monitoring the situation.

204
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,990
Okay, I'll do it...

205
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880
You go first.

206
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,550
Grandma,

207
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,400
Fang Hongyang uses underhanded methods.

208
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,920
But you act properly.

209
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,400
Did you secure the project?

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,750
Forgive me, Grandma.

211
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,040
Don't look so defeated.

212
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,520
The final victory isn't decided yet.

213
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,670
Lu Ran,

214
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
this is

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
the international exchange program

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,080
application I mentioned.

217
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,630
Although you've missed a semester,

218
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
your academic achievements

219
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,560
still impress me.

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,460
(Exchange Notice)
I hope you'll study hard abroad

221
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,160
and bring back new knowledge
and experience.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Teacher Wang...

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,790
- I...
- Lu Ran,

224
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,990
this opportunity is rare.

225
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,790
It wasn't easy for me

226
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,230
to obtain it for you.

227
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,870
Please consider it carefully.

228
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay, Teacher Wang,

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
I'll think about it.

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,400
Here.

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,920
Here you are.

232

(Party B: Qi Shengfeng)

234
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,350
Let's go home.

235
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,880
Wait.

236
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,750
While steel factory staff

237
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,950
don't recognize us yet,

238
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,160
let's investigate.

239
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,710
Agreed.

240
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,470
Let's go.

241
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,200
(The accounting room door left open
with staff sleeping?)

242
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,920
Drink up.

243
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
The delivery deadline passed ages ago.

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,300
And they kept me waiting.

245
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,270
I'll have to deliver it later.

246
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,560
(Drinking during work hours?)

247
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,560
Uncle, you're here.

248
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,080
As soon as the new factory director's
funds arrived,

249
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,560
pay my family members first.

250
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,070
Uncle,

251
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,620
but Aunt's family just holds
nominal positions

252
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,600
without working.

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,110
With the new director...
Should we wait a few months?

254
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,830
Fool.

255
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,960
Delay months

256
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,520
and the money might disappear.

257
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Right.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
And...

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
Uncle, don't worry.

260
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,040
I know who to pay first.

261
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,750
Good.

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Don't worry.

263
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,030
Good, I'm leaving.

264
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,150
Okay, take your time.

265
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,070

271

is rotten to the core.

272
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,200
Only by cutting out the corruption

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,680
can it be healed.

274
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,630
Great news...

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,040
Our Qi family

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,950
actually saved the steel factory.

277
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,160
This time,

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560

Mom, what does it mean to study abroad?

284
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,920
It means

285
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,240
studying overseas

286
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,400
at better schools.

287
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,630
My teacher gave me

288
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,040
this exchange program notice

You should ask my opinion.

Here's the thing, Director Qi.

378
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,310
The machines in our factory are

379
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,760
the same model as yours.

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,240
Recently, they've been malfunctioning.

381
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
He contacted the agent for repairs.

382
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,480
But the agent said he couldn't fix them.

383
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,110
He can only replace them from overseas.

384
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,230
No other options left.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,590
If you're willing to repair them,

386
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,760
we're ready to pay.

387
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,390
Directors Sun and Li,

388
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,350
you should both understand.

389
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,670
This isn't about money.

390
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,270
Right.

391
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,590
Your two factories

392
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,430
were originally competitors.

393
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,670
That's not what I meant.

394
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,550
It's that we've just taken over
the steel factory.

395
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,080
There's a tough battle ahead.

396
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
I truly have no time to spare.

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,880
Li,

398
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,320
Shengfeng isn't making excuses.

399
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,190
- Yes, I understand.
- Shengfeng.

400
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,280
Director Li, here's the thing.

401
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,110
When we reorganize the steel factory,

402
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,520
we'll need machine maintenance too.

403
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,880
Would you consider

404
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,590
sending your veteran masters over?

405
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,080
Although we don't have time
to repair yours,

406
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,510
we could train your masters

407
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,590
in the meantime.

408
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,820
That way,

409
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,850
when your factory machines

410
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,750
break down in the future,

411
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,420
your own masters
will be able to fix them.

412
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,800
Who's this? Does her word count?

413
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,870
She's my wife. Her word counts.

414
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,350
This is the real boss behind the scenes.

415
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,230
Mrs. Qi,

416
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,830
you two are lifesavers.

417
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,960
Absolute lifesavers.

418
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,830
We don't want to see local enterprises

419
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,440
always relying on foreign technology.

420
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,760
Since we have this expertise,

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
you can send people

422
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,390
whenever you need them.

423
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,310
No wonder the young people could
defeat Shuguang Group

424
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,350
and take over the steel factory.

425
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,080
Director Qi, in that case,

426
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,110
whatever I can do for you later,

427
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,030
just let me know.

428
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,350
I'll do my best.

429
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,630
Learn from
the young people's efficiency, okay?

430
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,320
Alright.

431
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,200
- We won't disturb you further.
- Well,

432
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,670
when can our people come for training?

433
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
Our plan is to start repairs next week.

434
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,990
From Monday to Sunday,

435
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,110
you can send people at any time.

436
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,580
You see?

437
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,380
- Learn from this.
- We should drink together someday.

438
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,590
We must arrange this.

439
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,270
- How decent of you.
- Take care.

440
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,830
- How decent of you.
- We're leaving.

441
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,920
Listen, you've got prestige.

442
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,020
- Let's go.
- Others can't do it.

443
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,630
Let me continue explaining

444
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,880
- my repair plan.
- Okay.

445
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,750
My proposal is

446
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,910
