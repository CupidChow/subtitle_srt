Lu Ran.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Lu Ran!

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,270
- What's wrong?
- Is Shanshan here?

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
No, she isn't.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,270
Shanshan insisted on seeing you
this afternoon.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Mom lost track of her for a second

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,470
and she vanished.

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,890
I've searched everywhere
and found nothing.

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,230
Check your workshop.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,710
Right. The workshop.

29
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,000
- The workshop.
- Let's go.

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,880
Come on.

31
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,670
Shanshan!

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,230
Mom!

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,710
Brother Qi, Ran.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,430
You're finally here.

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,950
Shanshan came crying earlier.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,190
It scared me.

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,470
I sent someone to find you,

39
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,450
but your house was empty.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
How could you run away alone?

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,900
Do you know how dangerous it is?

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
I want you.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm here.

44
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,880
She's sleeping soundly.

45
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,390
Let's not disturb her tonight.

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,630
Fine.

47
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,760
I'll pick her up tomorrow morning.

48
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,950
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,300
(Factory Director's Office)

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,920
We're a small business.

51
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,590
If you keep delaying payment like this,

52
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,710
we won't survive.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,080
Shengfeng, we're old friends.

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
The factory's struggling right now.

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,630
I've managed to allocate 20,000 yuan.

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll recommend good projects
to you later.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,600
- Brother Qi.
- Brother Qi.

58
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,200
How is it? Did you get it back?

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,880
Only 20,000.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,520
20,000?

61
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,150
Brother, 20,000 won't be enough.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,510
Our next order needs

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,350
at least 50,000 yuan in raw materials.

64
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,760
What should we do?

65
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,920
If the steel factory doesn't pay

66
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,930
and we can't deliver on time
without raw materials,

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,650
we'll have to pay penalties

68
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,120
for breaching other orders, right?

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,870
Yes.

70
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't worry about this.

71
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,990
I'll collect final payments
from other partners.

72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,160
All funds will go

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,510
to raw materials.

74
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,030
The machine can't stop anyway.

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,110
Right.

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,440
Let's do that.

77
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,360
By the way, Brother,

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,630
we're delivering to Shuguang Group
the day after tomorrow.

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
Big companies like them

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,470
won't delay payment.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,070
Once we submit the samples,

82
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,240
we'll get paid.

83
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,270
Good. Rest assured, Brother.

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,120
No company has ever
rejected our samples.

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,630
Remember to strictly follow procedures

86
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,950
with big clients.

87
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,080
Don't make any mistakes.

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,800
- Got it. Don't worry, Brother.
- Okay. Don't worry.

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,390
- Then we'll continue.
- Alright. Keep working.

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,750
Be careful, Brother Qi.

91
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,270
Mom,

92
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,920
I remembered Dad's workshop

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
from the time you took me there.

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
You have a good memory.

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,590
But if you

96
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,150
wander off alone again,

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll spank you.

98
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,510
But I couldn't find you...

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
Lu Ran.

100
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,350
You moved out?

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Senior Fang?

102
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,830
I owe you an apology.

103
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,470
I was rude last time.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,220
I'm studying here
to prepare for exams.

105
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,470
To get back into college?

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, a chance to take the exam.

107
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,710
Very good.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,910
I'm glad you didn't waste my efforts.

109
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,950
You spoke up for me?

110
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,510
Just a small favor.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,800
Won't you invite me in?

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's go.

113
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,440
Come in for tea.

114
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,240
Play outside.

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
Come in for water later.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Senior, have a seat.

117
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,600
Lu Ran,

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,510
since you've moved out,

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,760
why is this child still with you?

120
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,470
It'll distract you from studying.

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,710
You need to focus.

122
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,320
Let me be blunt.

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,030
Since you moved out,

124
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,910
you should make a clean break

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
and sever it completely.

126
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,710
Actually, if you need

127
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,800
anything at school,

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
just tell me.

129
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,230
It's convenient.

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,880
- Shanshan!
- Dad, you're back!

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm back.

132
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,470
Senior, please wait a second.

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,640
Where's Mom?

134
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,920
Shengfeng, why are you here?

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,870
I'm here to pick up Shanshan.

136
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,200
I wanted you to study,

137
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,470
but last night...

138
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,160
Pick up the child?

139
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,550
Come in and sit down.

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
He...

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,080
He just stopped by and came in.

142
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,080
Shanshan, come home with me.

143
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,880
- Mom needs to study.
- No,

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
- I want Mom.
- Shanshan!

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,080
Go with Dad. I have to study.

146
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,390
No,

147
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,390
I want to stay with Mom.

148
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,080
Go back with him.

149
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,070
How about letting her stay
with me for another day?

150
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,200
You can pick her up tomorrow.

151
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,030
I want to stay with Mom forever.

152
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
I have something to deal with,

153
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,320
so I'll be away for a few days.

154
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Perfect.

155
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
Shanshan is well-behaved,

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,150
and she can stay longer.

157
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,680
I don't mind taking care of her.

158
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,830
Shanshan, be good.

159
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
Don't bother Mom with studying.

160
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,200
Dad, don't worry.

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,550
I'll be good.

162
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,830
I won't bother Mom.

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Then...

164
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,750
I'll go.

165
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay, then I won't see you out.

166
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,710
Senior,

167
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,040
I need to study
and take care of the child.

168
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,560
I can't entertain you.

169
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,040
Understood. I'm leaving.

170
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,990
Study hard, I'll visit another time.

171
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,430
By the way,

172
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,040
contact me anytime

173
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,070
about school matters.

174
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,160
It's convenient.

175
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,790
Let's go.

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,880
Mom,

177
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,030
did you leave because of that bad uncle?

178
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,160
Is that why Dad's sad?

179
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,440
Who told you that?

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,920
I figured it out.

181
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,920
You think you know?

182
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,630
After I left,

183
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,990
was Dad unhappy all day?

184
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,230
Here, drink some water.

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,200
You're sweating.

186
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Are you hungry?

187
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,590
You guaranteed this would work.

188
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
Brother Cheng,

189
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,160
Qi Shengfeng's workshop
has experienced masters.

190
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,320
We've only hired temporary workers.

191
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't find experienced ones
for a while.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,920
- Yes.
- Our craftsmanship can't compare.

193
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
Why don't we have masters?

194
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,360
Why don't we have masters?

195
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,630
- I...
- Why?

196
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,950
I'm losing it!

197
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,270
Qianqian, go ask Lu Ran

198
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,660
to borrow masters from Qi Shengfeng.

199
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,950
Me?

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
Ask Lu Ran?

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,520
Let's finish it first.

202
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,560
Brother Cheng,

203
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,120
we just kidnapped her.

204
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
I even hit her.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,750
Now I ask her for help?

206
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,750
I may be shameless,

207
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,790
but she's not stupid.

208
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,480
You're the idiot!

209
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,280
If we don't finish this,
we'll all be doomed!

210
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,830
Zhou Huacheng,

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
I got you this deal!

212
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,510
So what?

213
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,110
Unfinished work means nothing, right?

214
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Besides, I'm supporting you

215
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
and your child, right?

216
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,200
Yes or no?

217
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,830
There's a way.

218
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,760
Shenggong.

219
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,430
Why are you here?

220
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,800
Good news.

221
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
Hurry, get out.

222
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,640
Let's go.

223
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Let go.

224
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,440
How many times have I told you?

225
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,710
We can't let them know
about our cooperation.

226
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,630
Why do you keep coming here?

227
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,670
Qi Shenggong,

228
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,940
are you afraid of Shengfeng

229
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,910
and Lu Ran?

230
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,830
Don't talk nonsense.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,920
Who said that?

232
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,160
State your business.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,990
A new order has come in.

234
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,630
It pays above market rate.

235
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,560
We need
Qi Shengfeng's workshop to get it.

236
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,520
I don't know much about them
at the workshop.

237
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,200
Why not ask them yourself?

238
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,120
Nonsense!

239
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,020
Based on my relationship with Lu Ran,
if I go there,

240
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,950
will they agree?

241
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,350
Can you run the cart business
on your own?

242
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,230
Did I make you money or not?

243
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,080
You wouldn't make that much without me.

244
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,470
Let me take a look.

245
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,750
This is a contract in duplicate.

246
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,630
Give me one after you sign.

247
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,800
- So much money.
- Give me that money.

248
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,630
I need to place orders.

249
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,840
I'll keep it safe.

250
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,190
- I'll give you 10,000.
- Stop it.

251
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,950
Don't crease it.

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,240
(Shanhai Construction Contract)

253
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
I'll try.

254
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,430
Just twist it.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
Busy?

256
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,470
- Mr. Fang.
- Mr. Fang.

257
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,040
Mr. Fang.

258
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,650
What brings you here?

259
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,080
We were about
to deliver to Shuguang Group,

260
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,940
and you're here.

261
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,510
I'm in town on business.

262
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,720
So I came to inspect the goods.

263
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,870
This saves you a trip, right?

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,850
Thanks for your hard work.

265
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,200
Let me see the contract.

266
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,230
It's inside.

267
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,480
Please go in and sit down.

268
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Okay.

269
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,870
Brother Zhao, I'll handle this.

270
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,400
- You continue to work.
- Go ahead.

271
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,420
Don't worry, Brother Zhao.

272
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,280
Okay.

273
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,350
Manager Fang, please sit.

274
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,590
I'll get it.

275
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,350
Here, please take a look.

276
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,790
Manager Ma,

277
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,420
please bring the samples
and let me take a look.

278
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,670
Just call me Ma.

279
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,590
I'll fetch them.

280
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Manager Fang,

281
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,470
here are our samples.

282
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,120
- Please take a look.
- Ma, sit.

283
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,520
How about it?

284
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,390
Good.

285
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,280
This is worthy
of Director Sun's recommendation.

286
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,470
Ma,

287
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,110
I need a favor.

288
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
You're too polite.

289
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,400
Just give the order.

290
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,910
Our batch of goods is very urgent.

291
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,990
The mass production

292
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
will start immediately,
but the leader is away

293
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,920
and can't sign for it in time.

294
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,750
Can you begin mass production first?

295
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,030
Mass production? Easy.

296
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,870
I'll get the form.

297
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,790
Wait...

298
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,470
The problem is

299
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,950
the leader handles approvals.

300
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,270
He's on a business trip
and asks me to inspect the goods.

301
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,280
I can't sign.

302
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,870
If I could,

303
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,400
it'd be simple.

304
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,350
Look, your goods have passed inspection.

305
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Start production now.

306
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,710
I'll process the paperwork

307
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,800
when he returns.

308
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,710
This...

309
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,560
Should I ask Brother Qi?

310
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,360
Ma,

311
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
don't you trust me?

312
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,550
Otherwise,

313
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,870
I'll write a note.

314
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,390
No need, Manager Fang.

315
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,710
Of course, we trust you.

316
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,030
Director Sun recommended you personally.

317
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,720
And considering your father,

318
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,030
you won't betray us.

319
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,750
We'll start this afternoon.

320
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,790
Do you think it's okay?

321
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,200
Manager Ma, you'll go far.

322
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,440
I have something to do,
so I'll leave first.

323
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,370
Hurry up the production.

324
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, I'll walk you out.

325
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,080
Good, speed matters.

326
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

327
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,830
Please be careful.

328
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,340
(Safety Production)

329
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,790
Brothers!

330
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,960
- Shenggong.
- Shenggong.

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,440
- Shenggong.
- Qiang, come here.

332
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,080
Pour water for Shenggong.

333
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

334
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,920
Factory's swamped.

335
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,040
I brought us

336
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,200
a great job.

337
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,590
Look, can we take it?

338
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,640
A great job?

339
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Very good, Shenggong.

340
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,150
- Look.
- Let me take a look.

341
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,050
How's your day been lately?

343
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,710
- Busy.
- Is that so?

344
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,320
Liu, look carefully.

345
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,880
- Don't miss issues.
- Alright.

346
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,180
(Appendix: Custom Specifications)

347
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,920
These specs resemble Shuguang Group's,

348
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,670
but they pay more.

349
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,080
How do you know that?

350
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,280
Shenggong,

351
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,710
where's this from?

352
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,790
Shengfeng mentioned cash flow problems

353
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,520
in our workshop a few days ago.

354
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
A friend brought this today.

355
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,280
I thought it was a great job,

356
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,110
so I came here.

357
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,630
But there's one thing.

358
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
It's urgent.

359
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,880
So

360
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,590
they'll pay more money.

361
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,270
Let me take a look.

362
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,510
Count it.

363
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,360
This much?

364
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,510
Urgency pays.

365
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,230
This...

366
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,910
Okay, Shenggong.

367
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,110
We'll take this job.

368
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,480
Okay, very good.

369
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,080
Brothers, come on.

370
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,160
Come over here!

371
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,720
Come here!

372
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,200
We won't rest tonight.

373
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Shenggong.

374
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,920
Shenggong sent us a great job.

375
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,080
Let's speed up

376
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
and get more helpers.

377
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,800
Rotate shifts

378
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,720
to handle this

379
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,750
and Shuguang Group's order

380
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,590
at the same time.

381
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,390
Surprise Brother Qi later.

382
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,400
- Do you agree?
- Yes, no problem.

383
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,430
Let's work harder.

384
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,750
Fine, very good.

385
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,000
Shenggong, we'll start now.

386
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,960
Let's do it.

387
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,110
Shenggong, take a rest.

388
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,350
Thank you.

389
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,240
No need...

390
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,790
Shenggong, let's go inside.

391
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,710
Okay.

392
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,710
Slow down.

393
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,270
Be careful.

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,950
There's still one crate.

395
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Shenggong,

396
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,750
we haven't finished this batch.

397
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,520
Why are you in such a hurry to move it?

398
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,640
Didn't I tell you?

399
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,830
The client needs it urgently.

400
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,480
Consider this morning's deposit
as payment for this batch.

401
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
This is so strange.

402
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,050
I've never seen anyone
collect goods like this.

403
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,480
Appreciate your hard work

404
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,800
for working overtime.

405
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Shenggong!

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm heading out first, guys.

407
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,320
Take care.

408
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,350
Alright, Shenggong.

409
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,960
We'll keep working.

410
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,030
You go get some sleep.

411
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,890
Thanks for your hard work.

412
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,910
You've worked hard too.

413
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,040
I'll nap for a bit.

414
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,270
You rest.

415
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,800
Good. Very good.

416
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,480
The craftsmanship of Qi Shengfeng's workshop
is beyond reproach.

417
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,800
Shuguang Group will definitely
be satisfied.

418
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,400
See?

419
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,270
Whose wife?

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,030
Only my wife could come up with

421
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,280
this idea of having Qi Shengfeng
make samples for us.

422
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,840
Right?

423
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
Right. She's amazing.

424
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,010
- She's amazing.
- She's good.

425
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,070
- Isn't she awesome?
- Awesome.

426
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,990
Awesome.

427
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,870
You deliver early

428
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,150
and our prices are low.

429
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,590
They'll surely sign with us.

430
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,800
Here's the plan.

431
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Put what we made underneath,

432
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,000
and put theirs on top.

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,060
Make it look more plentiful

434
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,150
and show our sincerity.

435
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Will this work?

436
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
Why wouldn't it?

437
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,310
His contract is wrong.

438
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,230
Once he's ruined,

439
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,310
where will
the blacksmith workshop masters go?

440
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
They'll all come to us.

441
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,190
Just thinking about
their workshop working overtime,

442
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,320
wasting raw materials with no buyers...

443
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,030
So satisfying.

444
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,870
Yeah, satisfying.

445
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,310
So satisfying.

446
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,040
You're the best.

447
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,110
Clever solution.

448
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,440
- Come here.
- She's amazing.

449
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
See this.

450
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,360
Right.

451
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,240
Many large cities
are anything but beautiful.

452
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,430
Streets are littered with trash.

453
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,870
(I wonder how Qi Shengfeng's doing.)

454
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,150
(The workshop rent is so tight.)

455
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,150
(That heartless guy even kicked me out.)

456
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
(Why should I care about him?)

457
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,480
In this trash,

458
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,630
however, there is still something
that can be useful,

459
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,830
which is just thrown away as waste...

460
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,000
Hello, Mr. Qi.

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,070
- Mr. Qi, you're back.
- Mr. Qi.

462
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,920
Mr. Qi, you're back.

463
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,430
Brother Qi.

464
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,470
Alright, Brother.

465
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,910
What goods are you making?

466
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,510
Brother, you didn't know.

467
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,000
While you were away,
we got an urgent order.

468
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,210
Yeah, Manager Fang came yesterday too.

469
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,960
He said he was very satisfied
with our goods

470
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
and asked us to mass produce quickly.

471
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,080
This fast?

472
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,820
- Yeah.
- Was the acceptance form signed?

473
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,120
Signed...

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Not signed yet.

475
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
Does the urgent order have a contract?

476
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,160
Yes, it's in the office.

477
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,400
Alright, get back to work.

478
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,320
Okay.

479
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,470
Go on.

480
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,630
Brother, why are you here?

481
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,750
Shengfeng,

482
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
you should rest.

483
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,190
Look at those dark circles.

484
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,800
You have to take care of yourself.

485
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,430
Brother, here's the contract.

486
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,480
I brought a big job here today.

487
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
What big job?

488
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,560
I've been here all night.

489
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,960
These specifications look just like
Shuguang Group's.

490
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,670
Right, I thought it was strange too.

491
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,160
But they needed it urgently.

492
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,630
They even took a batch last night.

493
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,830
Who's ordering these goods?

494
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,670
I... I don't know.

495
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,320
Shenggong brought the contract.

496
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,440
Shenggong.

497
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,160
Brother, what friend

498
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,700
would need such a big batch so urgently?

499
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,590
Zhou... Zhou Huacheng.

500
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,350
Hurry! Tell them to stop!

501
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,270
Okay.

502
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,390
Brother, don't you know

503
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,200
- we have a history with him?
- Everyone stop!

504
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Why would he place orders with us?

505
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,480
I... How should I know

506
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,910
you had issues with him?

507
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,040
He paid upfront and provided a contract.

508
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,440
Ma, you reviewed the contract too.

509
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,400
We only started production
after you confirmed it was fine.

510
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,310
Shenggong,

511
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,160
doesn't Zhou Huacheng
have his own factory?

512
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,020
Why would he give us

513
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,400
such a similar order?

514
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,390
This is too coincidental.

515
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm not sure if there's a problem now.

516
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,550
Bring me Shuguang Group's contract.

517
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,600
- Okay.
- Zhao Wei,

518
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,870
go investigate where Zhou Huacheng's goods
were delivered.

519
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,800
Got it.

520
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,470
Brother, here's
Shuguang Group's contract.

521
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,300
(Custom Specifications)

522
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,960
The specs don't match.

523
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,950
Impossible.

524
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,950
Brother, take a look again.

525
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,960
Did anyone tamper with it?

526
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
No.

527
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,280
No one touched it.

528
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
Brother, I remember.

529
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,370
When Manager Fang came yesterday,
he asked to see the contract.

530
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
I showed it to him.

531
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,270
Isn't he Party Secretary Fang's son?

532
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,630
He wouldn't harm us, would he?

533
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,580
These two contracts
have different specifications.

534
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,190
I don't get it.

535
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,230
What's going on?

536
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,120
Shenggong,

537
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,350
the client contracted both us

538
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,710
and

539
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,320
their factory.

540
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,590
Now the order is wrong.

541
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,190
Everything we made previously is wrong.

542
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,960
We don't even have any evidence now,

543
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,630
what should we do?

544
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,430
That is to say,

545
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,150
I even made you
help produce Zhou Huacheng's order?

546
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
No...

547
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,270
What should we do?

548
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,800
If this is true,

549
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,910
our factory will be finished.

550
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,800
Brother, what should we do?

551
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,600
Here's the thing.

552
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,480
You take Shuguang Group's contract
to them,

553
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,190
say that we lost the original specs,

554
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,320
and ask for another copy.

555
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
Okay, I'll go now.

556
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,360
Shengfeng.

557
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
Did I cause trouble for you all?
