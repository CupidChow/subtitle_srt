00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,920
Thank you, Director Sun.

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,910
So what you're saying is,

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,840
the steel factory is currently poorly managed

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,080
and will be contracted out.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
After the contract,

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
due to the high rate of machine damage,

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,760
you plan to introduce
the semi-automatic ones,

72
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,160
so a large number of workers will be laid off.

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,270
Based on the current development trend,

74
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,510
that's the case.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,190
So many people rely on

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,760
the steel factory for a living.

77
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,640
So many layoffs at once...

78
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,440
What can we do?

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
Director Sun,

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,920
why did you ask Shengfeng to come today?

81
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,270
It's about this matter.

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,600
You see,

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,040
so many workers
are facing layoffs right now.

84
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,390
Shengfeng is a technical person.

85
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,880
You can repair the machines.

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,630
If you fix them,

87
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,990
the workers won't be laid off.

88
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,350
Of course, I know

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,080
we still owe you money.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Director Sun,

91
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,760
no need to worry about that.

92
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,000
Back when my workshop was just starting,

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,080
you helped me a lot

94
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,270
and gave me many orders.

95
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,760
Those were just small favors.

96
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,950
I've looked into

97
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,910
the machines before.

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
There are indeed many issues.

99
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,120
Many precision parts
are imported from abroad,

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,800
so they're very expensive,

101
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,510
and the costs are high.

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
It's a tough situation.

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,880
I have an idea.

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Can we dismantle the old machines,

105
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,790
then check

106
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,870
which parts are still intact and usable,

107
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,880
and reassemble them

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,200
into a new functional machine?

109
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,600
This way,

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,270
we can save on the cost of buying new parts.

111
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,560
However,

112
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,630
the final number of machines put into use

113
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,480
would be reduced.

114
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,320
This... this... this could work!

115
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,870
Can you do it?

116
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,590
This is indeed a good idea.

117
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Ensure some machines
are put into production,

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
though the number of machines

119
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,760
will definitely be reduced.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,390
For every machine you save,

121
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,390
I can save a worker.

122
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,270
Then let's give it a try.

123
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,630
I'll do my absolute best.

124
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,200
Please, it's worth trying.

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
But the issue remains,

126
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,710
we have no money.

127
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,990
Director Sun,

128
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
this isn't about money.

129
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,180
Let's focus on repairing first.

130
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,230
Alright.

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,780
I'll see the municipal leader

132
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,320
to request two machines to dismantle

133
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,590
for your experiment.

134
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,750
Good.

135
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,350
Here, have some water.

136
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Listen,

137
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,910
now you're talking about
reassembling machines.

138
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,950
Can you guarantee you can pull it off?

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,200
If I promise them the results

140
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,880
and you fail,

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,910
you'll only humiliate yourself.

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,520
And another thing,

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,320
once these machines are dismantled,

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,950
what if they can't be fixed?

145
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,760
They'll truly become scrap metal.

146
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
Everything you're saying now

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,710
is frankly useless.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Better to go back

149
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,320
to see if the machines
can actually be saved.

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,750
Understood?

151
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,190
Shuguagn Group is arriving in 3 days

152
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,150
to sign the contract with your factory.

153
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,070
Before they get here,

154
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,120
you at least have time

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,390
to save half the workers.

156
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,310
Got it?

157
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,590
So… so your suggestion is…

158
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,910
I should find people
to dismantle the machines?

159
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,960
Go, go.

160
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,430
Oh, and Mr. Zhou,

161
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,680
you said your son works
at Shuguang Group.

162
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,390
Could you pull some strings
to ease the process?

163
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,030
Enough, enough. I've heard you.

164
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,510
Go work on your machine puzzle.

165
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,150
Audacious.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,390
Now you're giving me tasks?

167
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,750
Here, lend a hand.

168
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,670
Alright, alright.

169
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
How is it?

170
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,720
The issue seems to be
the gear system in the lathe.

171
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
Cut the power. I'll inspect it.

172
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,400
Okay.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,920
Alright.

174
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,030
The technicians mentioned this gear

175
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,880
has been jamming occasionally,

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,200
but the part itself looks intact.

177
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,150
Let's see if Mr. Qi can clean
and reassemble it.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Aren't these just the most basic steps?

179
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,800
Director Sun, we can't even fix it.

180
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,080
How can he possibly fix it?

181
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,830
- Mr. Li.
- Keep quiet.

182
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,950
The more basic the task,
the more critical it is.

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,120
He's adjusting the gear meshing.

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,390
It's the most crucial step.

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Only when it's properly calibrated

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
can the lathe be operated.

187
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,830
Whether the machine runs or not

188
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,440
hinges on these gears.

189
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,910
We with decades of experience
couldn't fix it.

190
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,070
Qi, if you actually pull this off,

191
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,440
I'll call you "Master".

192
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,830
Enough. Don't tease him.

193
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,590
The gear system's already repaired.

194
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,160
It should be fine now.

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,050
Let's test it.

196
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,940
- Go ahead.
- On it!

197
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,840
Here, sir.

198
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,430
Be careful.

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
The power is up.

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,590
Something happened, Director.

201
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,100
They're causing trouble again.

202
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,950
We need you there.

203
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,130
We'll leave it to you.

204
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,680
Qi, young man. Don't get too cocky.

205
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,400
Mr. Li, maybe it's not...

206
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,400
Why are you here?

207
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,710
No mister.

208
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
Just Lu Ran, here to deliver food.

209
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,560
Did you eat already?

210
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,640
I have.

211
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,950
Good. Sit over there.

212
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,040
- Let me.
- No, it's too dirty.

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,400
Here.

214
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,440
What do we have today?

215
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,830
Open it and you'll know.

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,760
It's still warm.

217
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,350
Yours always tastes better.

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,630
Just focus on the repairs.

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,110
Don't worry about me and the workshop.

220
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,950
Hitting a snag?

221
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,470
The machine's overall integrity is solid.

222
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,080
The seal ring is loose,

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,230
but that's negligible.

224
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,390
The gear system was faulty,

225
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,320
but I've fixed it.

226
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,000
No...

227
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,990
It can't just be the gears.

228
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,520
If the issue were only there,

229
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,400
the machine would've made violent noises.

230
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,680
Something else is wrong.

231
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,870
What is it?

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,990
Many people are watching.

233
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,710
Who is watching?

234
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,320
Besides, what if they are?

235
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,870
We're married.

236
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,680
I believe you can fix this.

237
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,590
Go for it.

238
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
Take your time.

239
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,680
I've been working all the morning.

240
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,560
I am pretty hungry.

241
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,980
(Safety Production; Civilized Production)

242
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,590
Brother Qi,

243
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,710
Brother Qi,

244
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,560
we need to recheck the lathe's bearings.

245
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,520
The bearings might be faulty.

246
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,320
You're right.

247
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,440
Ma Qiang, swap in the bearings
from that machine.

248
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,030
- See if they work.
- Got it.

249
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,950
It won't help.

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,040
Those bearings don't work either.

251
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,080
We can fix the broken outer rings
on the bearings.

252
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,230
But if the bearings are broken,
we need new ones.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,630
The domestic market

254
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,350
doesn't have suitable replacements.

255
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,950
Then we'll have to try making our own.

256
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,080
Five years ago,

257
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,160
when I was cocky, I tried that too.

258
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,200
But the precision requirements
are too high.

259
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,990
Foreign technology

260
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,750
is years ahead of us.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,710
How could you crack this problem easily?

262
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,080
It's practically an impossible task.

263
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,880
Let's go.

264
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,200
Brother Qi, what do we do now?

265
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,470
Let me test you on a few words.

266
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,280
Spring.

267
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,070
Spring.

268
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Flower.

269
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,920
Correct.

270
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
Blooming.

271
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,470
You can do it.

272
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,950
Study.

273
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,280
That is "Study".

274
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Blooming.

275
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,240
Correct.

276
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,710
Dad.

277
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Dad.

278
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,910
- Mom.
- I'm back.

279
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,830
Dad!

280
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,190
Shanshan.

281
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,520
How's the machine repair going?

282
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,710
Put more effort into it.

283
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,270
I've heard

284
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,390
if the machines aren't fixed,

285
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,470
all the workers will lose their jobs.

286
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,470
With families to support,

287
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,080
what will they do?

288
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,470
Did you run into a problem?

289
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,710
The bearing precision is too high.

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
We've tried several times and failed.

291
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,070
I know geometry.

292
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
I can help you calculate the precision.

293
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
That's perfect.

294
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,800

Qi Shengfeng! Qi Shengfeng!

314

Qi Shengfeng! Qi Shengfeng! Qi Shengfeng!

315
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,320
Brother Qi, let's head over now, okay?

316
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,180
Got it, Brother Qi.

317
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,020
- Go for it!
- Okay.

318
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,860
- See you.
- Go ahead.

319
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,280
- Go ahead.
- Go for it!

320
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
Bye, guys!

321
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,230
Brother Qi, take care.

322
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,030
The biggest problem we face now

323
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,610
is the machine damage rate.

324
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,200
We'll introduce the most advanced ones.

325
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,590
Brother Qi, Ms. Bai is here.

326
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,750
Ms. Bai came to inspect our work.

327
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,670
Ms. Bai.

328
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,470
You've been repairing the machines for free

329
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,320
to save the steel factory jobs.

330
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,520
Yes.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,950
I'm impressed.

332
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,550
But I also heard

333
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,990
you want to use automated machines.

334
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,600
That's right.

335
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,950
Technological progress
is the real solution.

336
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,510
However, I can apply to the group

337
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,350
to keep some machines and positions

338
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,470
on the condition that you fix them.

339
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,040
Ms. Bai, don't worry.

340
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,520
We will fix them.

341
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
Good. I'm looking forward.

342
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
Time is running out.

343
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,360
- Get to work.
- Okay.

344
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,590
Here's the thing,

345
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,830
Party Secretary Fang kept emphasizing

346
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,750
that we should keep some workers,

347
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,830
and that some machines can be fixed

348
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,110
and still generate some value.

349
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,520
What's your take

350
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
on this issue?

351
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,120
- No machines.
- I...

352
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,590
No workers either.

353
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,400
Hongyang,

354
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
I really didn't expect

355
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
you and your father's stance

356
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,320
to be so different on this.

357
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,670
In my position,
I must act accordingly.

358
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,000
As Shuguang Group's manager,

359
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,150
I must prioritize the company's interests.

360
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,600
Grandma,

361
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,000
I actually think

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,960
we could keep some machines and jobs.

363
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,790
If the repairs go well,

364
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,240
we can start production right away

365
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,670
after taking over the steel factory.

366
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,720
It'd reduce our initial investment.

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Ms. Bai,

368
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
you might not know the factory well.

369
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,800
Forget whether the machines can be fixed.

370
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,110
The current workers

371
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,560
all got in through connections.

372
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,670
The management system is a mess.

373
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,960
Otherwise,

374
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,080
the factory wouldn't be in this state.

375
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,040
Manager Fang, that's too extreme.

376
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,110
If we're paying salaries,

377
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,390
why not hire top graduates

378
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,560
from technical schools instead?

379
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,240
In the future,

380
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
automated machines

381
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,830
will be a long-term strategic investment.

382
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,590
But replacing all the machines at once

383
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,670
would strain the group's cash flow.

384
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,200
Moreover, as a key enterprise

385
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,110
in the city now,

386
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,630
we can't abandon humanistic care.

387
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,480
A full layoff

388
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,560
would affect thousands of families.

389
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,270
Ms. Bai,

390
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,080
I contacted my university classmate.

391
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
He's the sales manager
for the new machines.

392
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,070
He trusts me

393
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,550
and believes in the Shuguang Group,

394
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,430
so he can let us pay
in installments.

395
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,040
As for the humanistic care

396
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
and our group's pressure you mentioned,

397
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,190
Chairwoman Bai has the final say.

398
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,270
Grandma,

399
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,150
you've done exceptionally well.

400
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,360
It's settled then.

401
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,590
Complete the signing asap.

402
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Okay?

403
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,070
You may leave.

404
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, Chairwoman Bai.

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,920
Yes, Grandma.

406
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,080
Let's close the deal today.

407
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,640
Okay.

408
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,110
Have the contracts been sent over?

409
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,270
Director Sun, Party Secretary Fang,

410
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,190
please have a seat.

411
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,600
Okay, let's sit.

412
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,560
Let's review the contract first.

413
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
Mr. Fang, our group

414
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,520
is willing to give opportunities,

415
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,590
but your machines really weren't fixed.

416
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,320
Shameful, truly shameful.

417
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,080
Brother Qi,

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,760
the bearings are installed.

419
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,400
Let's start it up.

420
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,470
We made it!

421
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,150
Amazing!

422
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,830
- It's fixed!
- Finally fixed!

423
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,830
Stop hugging already.

424
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,670
Shuguang Group is here to sign the contract.

425
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,640
What?

426
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,830
Brother Qi, I'll watch the machine.

427
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
I'll leave it to you.

428
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,750
Okay.

429
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,960
Old Fellow, you're really something.

430
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Gentlemen,

431
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,150
we've reviewed the contract. No issues.

432
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,840
Please sign it.

433
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,060
(Legal representative: Bai Simeng)

434
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Director Sun! Director Sun!

435
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,720
Director Sun!

436
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,240
The machines are fixed!

437
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,420
People won't lose their jobs!

438
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,430
Really?

439
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,470
Yes.

440
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,840
Director Sun,

441
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,040
we've confirmed the contract,

442
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,590
but I haven't signed yet.

443
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,280
Ms. Bai promised earlier

444
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,830
that if the machines were fixed,

445
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,390
both machines and jobs would stay.

446
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,040
Wasn't that just politeness?

447
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Shuguang Group's plan is a full overhaul.

448
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,750
Now that the machines are fixed,

449
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,480
these contract terms

450
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,390
may need to be revisited.

451
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,670
Ms. Bai,

452
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,200
you personally promised me

453
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,110
to keep the workers
if we fixed the machines.

454
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
After thorough consideration,

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,000
we've decided to replace the machines.

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,630
New machines don't mean cutting staff.

457
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,800
We're in a meeting.

458
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,950
Director Sun,

459
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,910
since when can anyone just walk in?

460
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,430
Shengfeng,

461
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,040
you all go back first.

462
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,110
We'll handle the laid-off workers

463
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,590
with appropriate compensation.

464
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Director Sun.

465
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,640
We invested heavily
to acquire your factory

466
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,960
and upgrade the machinery

467
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,000
for its long-term growth.

468
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,480
The restructuring is part of that.

469
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,480
Hope you'll understand.

470
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,230
I understand.

471
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,430
Party Secretary Fang...

472
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,030
Brother Qi.

473
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,350
Screw Shuguang Group!

474
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,630
They don't keep their word!

475
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,470
Brother Qi...

476
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,030
