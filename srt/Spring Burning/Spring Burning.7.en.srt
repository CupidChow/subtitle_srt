1
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,319
Doctor

2
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,879
Doctor, Doctor

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,439
Come, come, come

4
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Quick, quick, quick

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
Put it here first, put it here

6
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,000
Let me see

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,359
Let me see what's wrong

8
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,280
She, she

9
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,400
She has an upset stomach

10
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,079
Upset stomach

11
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,120
What did she eat today

12
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,159
It seems like something

13
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,920
Some spoiled meat

14
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,319
Yes, spoiled meat

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Ate spoiled meat

16
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,079
Then just let her in the bathroom

17
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,319
Squat for a while and she'll be fine

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
Shouting here is scaring everyone

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,159
Squat for a while

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,879
Go to the bathroom and squat for a while, she'll be fine

21
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,080
By the way, get a blood test or something.

22
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,759
Are you hungry?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
Do you want me to buy you something to eat?

24
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,759
No, I don't have an appetite.

25
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,400
You have to eat even if you don't have an appetite.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Look at you, you're so weak right now.

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,159
Alright, I'll listen to you.

28
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,120
That person just now looked like Second Sister-in-law.

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,639
She didn't seem right before she left today.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,599
She wouldn't be running like this if she wasn't upset, right?

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Did you see it wrong?

32
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,520
Slow down, hurry!

33
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,560
Follow and check it out.

34
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,199
You

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,159
What's wrong?

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,159
Come, take it slow.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,759
Where did the second sister-in-law go?

38
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,879
There have been quite a lot of changes here in the past few years.

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,879
I can't tell where she went either.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,719
You've been here before.

41
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,400
Yes

42
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,159
Previously, I brought my second brother to see a doctor

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
because he couldn't

44
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,080
have children

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,879
Let's go, let's head back.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,280
Do you have any abortion pills here?

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Abortion pills

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,159
You are pregnant

49
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,199
You're crazy!

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,479
If I were pregnant, why would I come to you?

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,319
That's the second son of the Qi family.

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,639
He got another woman pregnant.

53
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,240
Let people know that it's not him who can't have children.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,319
Ugh.

55
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,080
Jinx.

56
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,439
Then why do you need abortion pills?

57
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,439
It's my third son's wife.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,280
I can't get pregnant, why can she?

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
Ever since she joined the Qi family,

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,439
she's been targeting me everywhere.

61
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,680
Causing chaos in the household.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
If she really has a child,

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,759
how can I continue living?

64
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,719
So that's what's going on.

65
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you trying to end the Qi family's lineage?

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
Do you have it?

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,840
Yes, I do.

68
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,560
It'll cost extra.

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,360
Alright, alright

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,319
Let me check, as long as there is

71
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,319
Let's go

72
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,040
Take it yourself.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,199
Why are there no labels?

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,959
Which one is it?

75
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,959
That one.

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,720
Which one?

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,240
That one.

78
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,720
What are you doing?

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Are you crazy?

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
It's just the two of us in this room.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Why are you afraid with the door closed?

82
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,319
You...

83
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,399
No matter what, I still have a man.

84
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,480
Quite feisty

85
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,959
What are you doing?

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
I told you to make soup for the third brother's wife

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,279
Where's the soup

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,959
Inside

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Take it over

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,720
Mom

91
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,560
I think it's better to let the third one carry it himself

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,879
Why?

93
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,040
It helps to improve relationships.

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Yes, yes, yes.

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,639
You're still the smart one, good wife.

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,040
San'er

97
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,240
Mom made soup for Lu Ran.

98
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,560
Come out and serve it.

99
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,959
Mom will sleep with Shanshan tonight.

100
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,199
You don't need to worry.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Lu Ran

102
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,279
Come

103
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,439
How are you feeling? Better?

104
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,439
Mom made you chicken soup

105
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,439
I let it cool down for you

106
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,279
Come, I'll feed you

107
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,319
How is it?

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
Mom's cooking is really good.

109
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,480
That was

110
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,759
when I was a child

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,959
our family was poor

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,879
Mom would always buy those meatless bones

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,959
to make soup for us

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,759
It could be considered a meat dish

115
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,680
Then you sleep a little longer.

116
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,879
Lu Ran, what's wrong? Lu Ran

117
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,120
So hot

118
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,000
What

119
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,839
So hot

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
It's so cool

121
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,839
Wha- Wha-

122
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,560
What

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,360
Lu Ran, Lu Ran

124
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,279
This isn't right for us

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,600
We can't do this

126
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,679
Why not?

127
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,000
I feel so uncomfortable.

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,559
We are in a fake marriage.

129
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,960
Once you settle down, you have to leave.

130
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,159
I can't ruin your reputation.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They are actually in a fake marriage.

132
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,360
No, no

133
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,600
Mom, Mom

134
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,720
What's wrong?

135
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
Did you put something in her soup?

136
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
She doesn't have much of an appetite.

137
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
I made her a bowl of meat soup

138
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,240
What's wrong with her?

139
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,440
No

140
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll go to the village to find a doctor

141
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,399
Please take care of her for me

142
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,200
Third Brother

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,679
Go back to the room and take care of your wife.

144
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,799
I'll go with your second brother, that's enough.

145
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,679
We, we will go.

146
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,600
Thanks to second brother and second sister-in-law.

147
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,279
Hurry up.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,519
Go, go, go. I'm getting dressed, getting dressed.

149
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,799
Get dressed, quickly, quickly.

150
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,080
Mom, help me boil some hot water.

151
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm afraid she'll catch a cold.

152
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,919
Okay.

153
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,639
What's going on here?

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,600
You're awake.

155
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:43,840
You

156
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,279
Come

157
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,120
Why did you tie me up?

158
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,080
You were noisy and disruptive yesterday.

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,159
So I

160
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
I hit you.

161
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
No, that didn't happen.

162
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
But it was close.

163
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,279
I did it to protect myself.

164
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll untie you.

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,440
How did I tie it yesterday?

166
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,440
It's really tightly covered.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
How scared are you of me?

168
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
You must be really hot.

169
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,159
I put in a lot of effort yesterday.

170
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,240
Just to tie you up.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
Didn't you say you were going to get a doctor for me?

172
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,480
Why hasn't the doctor come yet, even though it's already dawn?

173
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,200
Second brother and sister-in-law went to find a doctor.

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,679
Why haven't they come yet?

175
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:44,960
Come down.

176
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,919
Are you hot?

177
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,919
Alright.

178
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,080
Third brother, third sister-in-law.

179
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,960
Come out quickly, the doctor is here.

180
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,759
Doctor Zhang, have a seat. Alright, alright.

181
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,320
Sit, sit, sit.

182
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Come out quickly, come out quickly.

183
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,080
Come and let the doctor take a look.

184
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,799
Sit, sit, sit.

185
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,240
The general situation,

186
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,440
I have already heard about it.

187
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,799
Come.

188
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,639
Reach out your hand

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,519
This is a pregnancy pulse.

190
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
It's been over a month.

191
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,200
Congratulations, congratulations! That's wonderful.

192
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,519
Our Qi family is finally blessed with good fortune.

193
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,159
Good news, good news.

194
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you, thank you.

195
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,159
The child is fine, right? Yes, fine.

196
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,200
I... I can't be pregnant.

197
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,679
Doctor Zhang, could you have made a mistake?

198
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,840
So you don't trust me?

199
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,080
Go find someone else then.

200
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,159
No, no, no.

201
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,399
Doctor Zhang, Doctor Zhang.

202
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,840
What's going on with you two?

203
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,399
Doctor Zhang is a renowned doctor in our town.

204
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,759
Could he be wrong?

205
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,799
Sit down quietly.

206
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,559
Sit down and let the doctor check, Mom.

207
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,759
What are you doing?

208
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,279
How do I say this?

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,399
This, this, this...

210
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,679
Speak properly.

211
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,519
Don't dawdle.

212
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,639
They haven't consummated the marriage.

213
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,000
Their marriage is fake.

214
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,519
What nonsense are you talking about?

215
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,200
What did you say?

216
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,639
If you don't believe me, ask the third brother.

217
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,440
San'er

218
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,080
Did you two sleep together?

219
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:35,519
Mom

220
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,639
We know our own business.

221
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,279
You don't need to interfere.

222
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,279
Did you hear that, Mom?

223
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,879
San'er wouldn't lie.

224
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,279
He didn't admit it.

225
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,320
He just didn't sleep with her.

226
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,200
Stop talking.

227
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
Whose child is in your belly?

228
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,799
Shut up.

229
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
Are you done talking?

230
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,879
Tell me the truth, mom.

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,919
Did you two sleep together?

232
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,279
Say

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,360
No

234
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,519
Are you out of your mind, Mom?

235
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,240
Mom

236
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
You have brought shame to our Qi family.

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,519
Two thousand yuan

238
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,759
Two thousand yuan to marry a college student

239
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,320
Good for you

240
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
You and she are deceiving your mother together

241
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,960
She has made a fool out of you

242
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,360
I am not pregnant

243
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,399
I have not done anything to betray Qi Shengfeng

244
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,759
Look at her

245
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,679
Still arguing

246
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,279
What kind of spell has she cast on you?

247
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,639
Third brother

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,039
I'm telling you

249
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,960
If you don't make her leave our Qi family

250
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,759
I

251
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,200
I

252
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,480
I will kill myself

253
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,159
Mom

254
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,080
Fine, I will leave

255
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,360
Calm down, calm down

256
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,919
Don't go

257
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,360
This has nothing to do with you

258
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,200
Calm down

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,159
It's okay, it's okay, calm down

260
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,120
It's okay, it's okay

261
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,919
I will beat you to death

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,039
You are a bad person

263
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
I won't let you speak ill of my mom, Shanshan

264
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
Shanshan, what are you doing?

265
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,000
My mom wouldn't do anything bad

266
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,960
You are the bad people

267
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,559
Shanshan, be good

268
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,879
Go back to your room

269
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,000
Mom, I won't go

270
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,759
I will help you fight the bad people

271
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,320
Mom, don't go

272
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,159
Lu Ran, Mom

273
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,679
Lu Ran

274
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,000
Mom

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,559
Lu Ran

276
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,000
You let her go, Mom

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,159
Don't come back again, calm down

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
Calm down, Mom, Mom

279
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,360
Stop making a fuss, okay?

280
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,080
Let's figure things out first

281
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Lu Ran is my wife

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
I know her character very well

283
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,240
Second Brother, help me look after Shanshan

284
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,120
Mom

285
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,600
Shanshan

286
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,840
Oh my ancestors

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
Mom, Mom

288
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,759
Mom, Mom, Mom

289
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,600
Which deity did our Qi family offend?

290
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,679
Settle the bill for me first, hurry up

291
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
You, pay the doctor

292
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
Settle what? I don't even have a grandson anymore

293
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:53,879
Mom

294
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,960
If we don't pay, we came for nothing

295
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Shanshan is still here

296
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Let's go, let's go, let's go

297
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,120
Don't scare Shanshan

298
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,440
Don't cry, Shanshan

299
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,639
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

300
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,519
Let's go, go

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Mom will be back soon

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,720
Don't, don't default on the bill

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,240
Get out, get out

304
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,279
What does our family matter have to do with you?

305
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:08,840
Alright, Mom

306
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,919
Really, calm down

307
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,399
What doctor? Don't cry, don't cry.

308
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,639
Don't cry, okay?

309
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,120
Lu Ran

310
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,360
Lu Ran

311
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,360
Lu Ran

312
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,039
Why are you here?

313
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,919
I thought you wouldn't come.

314
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,159
I wasn't with anyone else.

315
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,679
And I'm not pregnant.

316
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,279
I know, of course I know.

317
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
I just don't understand.

318
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,720
What you just implied.

319
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,960
I don't doubt you.

320
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,000
There's something

321
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
I guess you already know

322
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,680
It's time to tell you now

323
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,720
I know

324
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Didn't we agree

325
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,119
that after you settle down

326
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,680
you can leave anytime

327
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,680
But you don't need to

328
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,240
use your innocence as a bargaining chip

329
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,200
Qi Shengfeng, are you stupid

330
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,640
You don't think

331
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,119
I would use Dr. Zhang

332
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,559
to falsely claim I'm pregnant

333
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,440
to leave the Qi family, do you

334
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,759
You didn't say anything just now

335
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,160
and just gave me the betrothal money and ran

336
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,640
I thought

337
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,759
you just left like that

338
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,839
What

339
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,160
Can't bear to see me go

340
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,240
Of course, I hope you can

341
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,359
You

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,839
I think

343
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,759
there's something wrong with this

344
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,079
It's obvious

345
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,279
someone wants to drive me out of the Qi family

346
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,400
So you mean

347
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:11,799
No

348
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,720
You're not using this as an excuse to leave

349
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,319
I found out

350
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,559
You're just stupid

351
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,599
This Dr. Zhang has a problem

352
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,960
The one treating Second Brother is Dr. Zhang

353
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,799
We saw Second Sister-in-law in town yesterday

354
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,799
Didn't we lose track of her near Dr. Zhang's shop?

355
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,359
Second Sister-in-law and Dr. Zhang

356
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
They want to team up to kick you out

357
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,440
I can't be sure about that

358
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,440
I remember you said before

359
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,519
Second Brother's illness is treated by Dr. Zhang

360
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,440
Did he go to the hospital for a check-up later?

361
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
Mom has always trusted Dr. Zhang

362
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
Dr. Zhang said Second Brother's illness

363
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,079
Even if he goes to the hospital, it would be a waste of money

364
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,680
Plus, Second Sister-in-law keeps crying and making a fuss

365
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,839
Second Brother feels embarrassed

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,039
So he hasn't gone to the hospital

367
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,279
Then

368
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,799
You mean

369
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
Second Brother's illness might be

370
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,839
I don't know about Second Brother's situation

371
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,119
So I didn't dare to speak recklessly

372
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,519
But now hearing you say this

373
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,000
I think it's possible

374
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,759
What should we do now?

375
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,880
Let's go confront Dr. Zhang

376
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:28,839
Let's go

377
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,599
Brother Qi, Sister-in-law

378
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,599
Be honest

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Brother, Sister-in-law

380
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,599
You know why we're looking for you, right?

381
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,079
You and Tan Hong conspired to kick me out

382
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,319
She confessed

383
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,000
She said you were the mastermind, for money

384
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,160
Soon we'll take you

385
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
to the station to talk

386
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,279
Taking money for false diagnoses, slandering women's reputations

387
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,319
That's enough to get you a few years

388
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
It's all Tan Hong's slander

389
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,319
She thought you were pregnant

390
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,839
That's why she asked me to give you abortion pills

391
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,799
Also

392
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,640
Last night she came over in a hurry

393
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,880
and gave me fifty bucks

394
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,559
She told me to diagnose you as pregnant

395
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,799
She did everything

396
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,079
It has nothing to do with me

397
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,559
Then if she's not pregnant

398
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,160
what happens if she takes abortion pills?

399
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,319
Not pregnant

400
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,160
Then there's no big problem

401
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,119
At most, just a stomachache

402
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,799
If her health isn't good

403
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,839
she might bleed a little

404
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Rest for a couple of days and she'll be fine

405
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,839
No, no big deal

406
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,559
Won't there be a feverish feeling all over?

407
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
Feverish feeling all over

408
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,480
No

409
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,640
That's all

410
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,400
That's all aphrodisiac symptoms

411
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,599
Take out the medicine and let me see.

412
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,559
Hurry up.

413
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:39,599
Hurry up.

414
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,720
I put all the abortion pills here.

415
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:44,640
Look.

416
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,000
There are still several packs left.

417
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,599
This is all...

418
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,000
Why is this pig breeding medicine?

419
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
Oh no, I put the wrong cartridge.

420
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,079
You quack, sister-in-law, sister-in-law!

421
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,000
Fraud, sister-in-law, stop hitting!

422
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,759
Quack

423
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,319
Today, we brothers

424
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,960
That's enough

425
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
We'll deal with you properly

426
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,279
I've said everything I needed to say

427
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,119
That's all there is to it

428
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,640
Mom, he, he, he

429
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,519
He tricked me

430
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,759
Don't believe him

431
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,279
What kind of person is Lu Ran?

432
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,400
Ever since she came to our house

433
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,519
She ran away from the wedding and cheated us out of the bride price

434
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,799
She even had a fake marriage

435
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,519
What do you want to do?

436
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,079
Are you involved with him?

437
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,079
No

438
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,519
How can you turn your back on people so quickly?

439
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,599
Let me tell you

440
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,720
Everything was orchestrated by Tan Hong

441
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,160
What are you talking about?

442
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,079
Yes, I'm telling you

443
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,759
And also

444
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,440
A few years ago

445
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,559
Tan Hong found out herself

446
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,480
She couldn't have children

447
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,079
Afraid of being kicked out by the Qi family

448
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,440
Then she insisted I say

449
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,279
That it was the second Qi brother who couldn't have children

450
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,000
She even gave me a hundred yuan

451
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,519
What did you say? Say it again

452
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,519
It was her who couldn't have children

453
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,599
No, not you

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,319
It's been so many years

455
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,480
Don't you know what kind of person I am?

456
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,759
Mom, he framed me

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Mom, Mom

458
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,200
He framed me

459
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,200
Mom

460
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,359
Let Second Brother go to the hospital for a check-up, then it will be clear

461
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,039
No way

462
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,640
Why not?

463
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,319
I

464
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,039
Tell me why not

465
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,960
I

466
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,839
You

467
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,799
All these years

468
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,920
you've been bossing my son around in our house

469
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,599
I thought our family owed you

470
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,160
I tolerated you

471
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,279
and you even framed the third daughter-in-law

472
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,559
My son treated you so well

473
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,000
and you did such a thing

474
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,319
Have you no conscience?

475
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
Wife, tell me the truth

476
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,519
Can we live a good life together?

477
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
No way

478
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,480
This witch has a rotten heart

479
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,279
Mom, I just want to live a good life

480
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,119
Mom

481
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,440
Son

482
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,200
Mom

483
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,039
The wife Mom found for you

484
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
Mom is sorry to you

485
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,039
It's not your fault, Mom

486
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,359
Mom is sorry to you

487
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
Divorce, definitely divorce

488
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,039
Mom

489
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,680
This witch

490
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,519
You are a hen that can't lay eggs

491
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,319
And you blame my son

492
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,160
I

493
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,039
I can't lay eggs

494
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,000
I can't lay eggs

495
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,519
I'm telling you

496
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,920
Your son is a wimp

497
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,599
He is definitely a wimp too

498
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,079
Otherwise, why wouldn't his wife sleep with him

499
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,920
Your Qi family is destined to have no descendants

500
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,319
You, you, mom

501
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,880
Mom

502
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,799
Aunt, mom

503
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,440
Aunt, mom

504
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,279
Mom

505
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:37,640
Aunt

506
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,279
Mom

507
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,839
Second brother, hurry

508
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,079
Wait a moment

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,599
Wait a moment

510
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,599
You liar

511
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,400
Mom, mom

512
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,279
Second brother, go back inside, go back inside

513
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,960
You liar

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,680
Come on, Qiangzi

515
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,640
Take him to the police, get up

516
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,279
Get up

517
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,839
No, I, go

518
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,119
Didn't I finish talking

519
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,480
On Shengfeng's wedding day

520
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,640
Shanshan got lost

521
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,799
I saw a figure at the human trafficker's place

522
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,720
Was it you

523
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,799
That person that day was you

524
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,000
I knew it

525
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,880
You came here just to oppose me everywhere.

526
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,720
You protect that little girl.

527
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,119
I'm telling you.

528
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,960
The fortune teller told me.

529
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,880
She has a fate that brings misfortune to her parents.

530
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,039
I can only get pregnant if she is gone.

531
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,759
You are such a fool.

532
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
You raise her as your own daughter.

533
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,559
Sooner or later, she will bring you misfortune.

534
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,119
And bring you misfortune again.

535
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:34,920
Lu Ran, don't mind her.
