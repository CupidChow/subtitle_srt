=Episode 21=

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,900
The workers are on strike,

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,320
marching through the streets
with banners.

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,620
They call Qi a heartless director

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,660
and you...

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,580
Look, there aren't even any guards
at the gate.

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,260
Today, our Shantou Town Steel Factory

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,100
is undergoing a major restructuring.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,740
Next, Director Qi Shengfeng

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,460
will address everyone's concerns.

28
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,900
Everyone,

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,500
first of all,
all the parasites in our factory

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,140
have been completely purged.

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,740
There won't be any more opportunists.

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,100
From now on,
those who work harder will earn more.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,300
Merit will decide everything.

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,980
The factory will establish
a full reward and punishment system,

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,510
strictly assigning responsibilities
to individuals.

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,280
Those who perform well
will be promoted and rewarded;

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,300
those who don't
will be held accountable.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,380
If we all work together,

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,380
we can make this factory
bigger and stronger.

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,500
We will achieve greater success.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Let's strive together

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,020
to make this factory thrive.
Do you have confidence?

43
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,900
Yes!

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,020
The factory depends on all of you!

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,420
Good!

46
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,020
Okay, thank you, everyone.

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,220
Thank you for your hard work.

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,180
Good.

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,500
(Great.)

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,420
(haven't let me down.)

52
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,900
The most impressive director ever!

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,220
This is the factory
with the best benefits in the city.

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,820
(Fengxi Daily)
Isn't that Qi Shengfeng?

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,380
They've only just moved into town

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,940
and he's already a director?

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Impressive!

58
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,930
- Incredible!
- Amazing.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,050
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

60
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,670
Sister Chen, your daughter-in-law
is really good.

61
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,040
She actually took over
the steel factory.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,860
She's capable,
but my son is even better!

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,260
Sister Chen,

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,740
my son and daughter-in-law

65
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,020
both work at the steel factory.

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,180
You'll be

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,020
our family's leader now.

68
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,860
Not bad, not bad.

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,100
My nephew is there too, Leader.

70
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,500
Don't worry.

71
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,660
I'll tell my son to look after him.

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,820
- Take care of him.
- Good...

73
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,940
Good!

74
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,980
Very good.

75
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,780
It's been so long since I've seen

76
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,220
the workers this motivated.

77
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,540
Qi,

78
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,300
you and your wife are honestly better

79
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,340
than I ever was.

80
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,060
You really can't underestimate

81
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,700
young people these days.

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,260
Tell me,

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,060
what's your next plan for the factory?

84
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,100
Our next step is

85
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,580
to expand the site,

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,860
increase machinery,

87
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,580
and aim to double annual output.

88
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,580
Good.

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,500
Remarkable.

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,420
That's good.

91
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,260
Qianqian, here.

92
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,540
Have some meat.

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,340
You need nutrients.

94
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,580
I can't handle greasy food right now.

95
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,860
Okay.

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Qianqian,

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,700
you've been staying

98
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,360
at your parents' house for so long
while pregnant.

99
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,780
The neighbors

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,260
are starting to gossip.

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,620
What can I do?

102
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
Zhou Huacheng is a useless loser

103
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,420
drowning in debt.

104
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,380
He takes his anger out on me.

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
If I didn't come back,

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,740
I'd keep getting beaten at his house.

107
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,420
Qianqian, if there's no other choice,
just divorce him.

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,220
Divorce?

109
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,140
It's easy for you to say!

110
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,140
She's heavily pregnant.

111
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,100
Where would our dignity be?

112
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,980
Mom,

113
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,100
how could I remarry

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,380
looking like this?

115
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,460
At least Zhou Huacheng
is Party Secretary Zhou's son.

116
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,740
Even his son can't beat people!

117
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,180
Look at these bruises.

118
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,100
How can you live like this?

119
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,340
Zhou treated me well when he had money.

120
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,460
Maybe...

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,980
let's get some money together.

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,940
Get some money?

123
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,420
If I help pay his debts,

124
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,940
the Zhou family will treat me better.

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,180
By the way,

126
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,940
didn't Lu Ran's mother
leave something behind?

127
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,380
That's right!

128
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,820
How could we forget?

129
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,740
Wait.

130
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,180
Slow down.

131
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,300
Look.

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,780
How much is this worth?

133
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,940
When Lu Ran's mom went missing,

134
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,940
she was dressed nicely.

135
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,780
This peace was the only thing
she carried.

136
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,500
This antique piece

137
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,940
might be worth a fortune.

138
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,820
So

139
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,060
this can be used for a lot of money.

140
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,180
Let's pawn it.

141
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,060
Let's go.

142
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,700
Slow down.

143
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,900
Take it easy.

144
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,900
Chairwoman, are you alright?

145
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,820
Any news about her?

146
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,060
No.

147
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,420
Okay, I get it.

148
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,180
Go.

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,780
Comrade Qi Shengfeng,

150
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,340
no,

151
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,660
Director Qi,

152
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,420
your father partly built
this steel factory,

153
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,020
your brother developed it,

154
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,180
and now

155
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,060
you've saved it.

156
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,340
Director Qi,

157
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
how do you feel?

158
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,660
If it weren't for you,

159
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,780
I'd never have dared
take over the factory.

160
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,060
I didn't know what to do.

161
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,900
I even opposed you initially.

162
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,140
Without you,

163
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,300
I'd not have dared
to take it over either.

164
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,780
You have the skills and the ability.

165
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,540
You never realized how capable you were.

166
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,620
Alright.

167
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,780
Let's focus

168
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,900
on finalizing contracts

169
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,020
with interested companies

170
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,340
and host the signing ceremony soon.

171
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,220
Then we'll invite the media.

172
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,180
The headline will be

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,220
"Shantou Town Steel Factory Revived..."

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,420
Give me a hand.

175
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,340
"Orders Surge, Machines Hum,

176
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Production Increases,

177
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,340
Workers Thrive!"

178
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,380
Good!

179
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,000
Respected Deputy Director,

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
on behalf of the workers,

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,260
I'd like to extend our heartfelt thanks

182
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,100
and a warm hug to you!

183
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,660
Are you thanking me or yourself?

184
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,020
Of course, I'm thanking you.

185
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,180
Put me down first.

186
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,180
Let's get back to work.

187
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,460
(Reasonable Use of Workers and Peasants
in the Steel Factory)

188
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,060
It seems

189
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,180
I've underestimated
these two young people.

190
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,460
Grandma,

191
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,740
Fang Hongyang was taken away

192
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
for inciting worker unrest.

193
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,260
Since his own father won't intervene,

194
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,340
the personal grudge
between him and Qi Shengfeng

195
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,340
has nothing to do

196
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,780
with our Shuguang Group.

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,820
I understand.

198
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,620
Grandma,

199
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,740
since the steel factory contracting
is settled,

200
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,060
should we extend an olive branch

201
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
to restore cooperation?

202
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,020
Do you know

203
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,540
how much profit we're losing

204
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,380
on the cross-river bridge project
because we failed

205
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,420
to secure the steel factory contract?

206
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm sorry, Grandma.

207
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,900
I didn't handle this well.

208
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,980
Continue negotiating the cooperation.

209
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes.

210
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,340
Chairwoman!

211
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,020
Chairwoman.

212
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,980
What's the matter?

213
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,300
So panicky.

214
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,620
Have a look.

215
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,060
Where is she?

216
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,620
Where is she now?

217
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,300
At a Lu family in town.

218
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,460
Hello.

219
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,180
Who are you looking for?

220
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,020
Miss,

221
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,940
do you recognize this longevity lock?

222
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,580
Hurry. Hurry!

223
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,060
Who is this person?

224
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,620
Look.

225
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,980
Who is this?

226
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,900
Dad, you said

227
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,940
Lu Ran's mother was adopted
by my grandparents?

228
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Yes, she came to our family very young.

229
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
This lock was

230
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,740
the only valuable thing she had.

231
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,540
Didn't we pawn it?

232
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,620
That's right.

233
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,780
Right after we pawned it,
someone came here.

234
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,620
That person looked important,

235
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,620
claiming to be from Shuguang Group

236
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,980
helping the Chairwoman find relatives.

237
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,140
Could this be related to Lu Ran?

238
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,980
Given how we treated Lu Ran before,

239
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,260
if she gets recognized

240
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,420
by rich relatives,

241
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,700
she'll definitely make us pay.

242
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,260
Dad, Mom,

243
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,340
I'll tell him I'm...

244
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Is this okay?

245
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,780
What if they find out?

246
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,620
The ones who knew are already dead!

247
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,780
Only we three know the truth now.

248
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,300
Dad, Mom,

249
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,200
this is your daughter's

250
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,300
chance to be rich and powerful.

251
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,660
Our family's real good days are coming.

252
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,460
Let's find ways

253
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,700
to silence those relatives

254
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,620
who know the truth.

255
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,260
Okay.

256
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,500
We'll act separately later.

257
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,420
Okay.

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,380
- Let's go.
- Okay.

259
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,300
Let's go.

260
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,460
Right now.

261
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,200
Our Shuguang Group

262
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,240
has undertaken
the Anshi cross-river bridge project.

263
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,420
Everything is settled.

264
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,000
Next,

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,620
we need you to supply massive amounts
of high-quality carbon steel.

266
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,060
After measurements,

267
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,140
we require at least 100,000 tons.

268
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,620
We can sign a letter of intent first

269
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,180
and proceed progressively.

270
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,380
Wow!

271
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,220
100,000 tons
of high-quality carbon steel.

272
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,980
No wonder Shuguang Group went crazy

273
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,380
fighting for the factory contract.

274
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,020
It's for this project.

275
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,380
This exceeds
the factory's current capacity.

276
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
We need

277
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,700
to plan it well later.

278
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,660
We'll need to expand production lines,

279
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,120
optimize machinery,
and stockpile materials.

280
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,580
Got it, Brother.

281
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,780
That's too much.

282
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,220
This way.

283
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,380
Grandma, she's arriving soon.

284
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,620
Is that so?

285
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,060
Chairwoman.

286
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,700
Qianqian!

287
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,860
Sit down.

288
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,020
Come sit down, sweetheart.

289
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,620
Qianqian...

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,420
Come here.

291
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Sit down.

292
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,900
Sweetheart,

293
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,140
tell me,

294
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,660
how have you lived

295
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,980
these years?

296
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,780
Mom wandered homeless

297
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,940
since childhood

298
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,180
and almost died of illness.

299
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,220
Luckily, my grandparents adopted her.

300
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,780
Later she married Dad,

301
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,900
but remained sickly,

302
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
probably because of

303
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,540
childhood hardships.

304
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,380
It's all my fault.

305
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,980
It's all my fault!

306
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,300
I lost your mom

307
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,740
and I still haven't found her.

308
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,420
Mom died when I was young,

309
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,980
and a few years later,

310
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,580
Dad had an accident.

311
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,300
I became an orphan.

312
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,020
When I was a kid,
I grew up enduring scorn.

313
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,660
But Aunt and Uncle were very kind.

314
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,340
They treated me as their own

315
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,580
and brought me up.

316
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,660
Sweetheart,

317
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,300
it's all my fault.

318
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Can you give me a chance

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,380
to make up for it?

320
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,180
Qianqian,

321
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,940
where's your husband?

322
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Bring him here and show me.

323
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,900
I married Zhou Huacheng,

324
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,340
Party Secretary Zhou's son.

325
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,340
He had several businesses,

326
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,820
including a mold factory.

327
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,220
We were doing quite well,

328
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,300
but one day when we were working

329
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,340
with Shuguang Group,

330
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,260
a leader asked for a batch of goods.

331
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,660
Unexpectedly, they suddenly

332
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,900
cancelled the collaboration

333
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,780
and didn't even pay for the project.

334
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,380
Brother Cheng went bankrupt
because of this incident.

335
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,340
Our days were hard.

336
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,380
I had to

337
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,140
pawn Mom's

338
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,740
only heirloom.

339
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,780
Qianqian...

340
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,580
Simeng,

341
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,100
who handled this project in our company?

342
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,540
Bring the head here.

343
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,620
Grandma, it was me.

344
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
There were two contractors,

345
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,700
but the other partner's quality

346
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,620
is more...

347
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,500
I know that family.

348
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,740
That cunning family

349
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,900
stole Huacheng's business.

350
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,220
I don't know what their background is.

351
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,780
They even used city leaders' influence

352
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,460
to defeat Brother Cheng.

353
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,980
We couldn't compete.

354
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,900
Qianqian,

355
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,100
it's outrageous and utterly humiliating.

356
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
Tell me who did it.

357
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,300
I will avenge you.

358
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,820
I...

359
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,980
Forget it.

360
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,700
What's past is past.

361
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,020
Forget it.

362
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,860
Look how sensible Qianqian is.

363
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,860
She's suffered,

364
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,660
but she's still so open-minded.

365
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,220
But Huacheng

366
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,700
has no business now.

367
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,660
We can't even

368
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,820
afford food.

369
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,220
Don't worry.

370
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,860
I'm here.

371
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,380
I'll support you.

372
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
No,

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I've lived through hard times

374
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,660
and I know the importance
of real competence.

375
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,980
I can't rely on you.

376
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,820
We must be self-reliant.

377
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,700
How about...

378
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,620
you assign us some minor positions?

379
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
We'll work diligently

380
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,660
without fear of hardship.

381
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,820
Qianqian,

382
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,620
how could I bear to see you suffer?

383
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,540
I...

384
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Let me propose this.

385
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,420
Simeng,

386
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,340
why don't we have my grandson-in-law

387
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
learn about

388
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,140
our cross-river bridge project?

389
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,580
Okay, okay.

390
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,500
Let me get involved too.

391
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,980
- No...
- If I do well,

392
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,420
I can share your burdens.

393
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,620
Absolutely not.

394
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,660
Your priority now is
to focus on the pregnancy.

395
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,140
Don't worry.

396
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,820
I'll prioritize the baby.

397
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,740
But with such an excellent project,

398
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,580
I want to learn too.

399
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,780
May I?

400
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,300
You're so eager

401
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,500
to learn.

402
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,700
Fine,

403
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,780
we'll follow your wish, okay?

404
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,660
Grandma, this cross-river bridge project

405
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,300
concerns Shuguang Group's future.

406
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,060
All personnel involved

407
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,900
have decades of experience...

408
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
Yes, yes.

409
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,820
Huacheng and I are unfamiliar
with company operations.

410
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,180
We're truly unsuitable.

411
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,740
Then...

412
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,620
assign us the hardest

413
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,180
and most challenging tasks.

414
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,340
Simeng, let's settle it this way.

415
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,500
As the elder sister,

416
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,380
guide Qianqian and Huacheng properly.

417
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,900
Is that okay?

418
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,260
Thank you, Sister Simeng.

419
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,860
Thank you, Grandma.

420
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,100
No need.

421
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,380
Hello, Chief Lu.

422
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,300
- Hello, Chief Lu.
- Hello.

423
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,180
Lu Qianqian!

424
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,980
Did you dismiss Mr. Liu
from the cross-river bridge project?

425
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,580
Mr. Liu was specially recruited
from state enterprise retirement

426
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,900
with a high salary

427
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,940
to oversee this project.

428
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,740
Who authorized his dismissal?

429
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,780
Bai Simeng,

430
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,820
do you still not understand

431
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,220
who actually leads Shuguang Group?

432
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,060
I dismiss whoever I choose.

433
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,660
Good.

434
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Then tell me,

435
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,300
who will take charge

436
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,540
after Mr. Liu's dismissal?

437
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,340
I've already told Grandma.

438
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,540
Zhou Huacheng

439
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,860
will be responsible.

440
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Grandma agreed.

441
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,420
Grandma only permitted
Zhou Huacheng to learn

442
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,980
as the deputy project manager.

443
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,820
Who authorized him to be in charge?

444
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,340
It's already done.

445
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,660
Grandma!

446
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,100
Good,

447
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,260
I'll hang up first.

448
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,700
What's the emergency now?

449
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,820
Grandma,

450
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,600
Lu Qianqian dismissed Mr. Liu

451
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,780
from the cross-river bridge project.

452
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,450
How can you indulge her recklessness?

453
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,540
I don't oppose
her promoting Zhou Huacheng,

454
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,600
but as deputy at most.

455
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,020
How can a completely
inexperienced newcomer

456
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,900
manage such crucial operations?

457
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,460
Immediately assign
two experienced deputies

458
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,220
to Zhou Huacheng

459
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,900
to ensure project safety.

460
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,860
Let him handle the project

461
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,340
if he wants.

462
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,260
Grandma!

463
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,300
The cross-river bridge project

464
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,140
is the most critical component

465
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,400
of Shuguang Group's future development.

466
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,540
You can't let her sabotage this.

467
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,100
You supervise
and make timely corrections

468
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,300
if needed.

469
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,340
Go now.
