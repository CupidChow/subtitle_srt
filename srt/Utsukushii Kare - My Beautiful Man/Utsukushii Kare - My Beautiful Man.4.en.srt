172
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,467
With what?

173
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:06,233
That was a lie.

174
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:09,134
I'll go! Even if I have to crawl there.

175
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:14,768
I want to kneel down at your feet right now.

176
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,800
But...

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,033
S-S-Sorry.

178
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:28,067
Whether you come or not makes no difference to me.

179
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh, are you Koyama's little brother?

180
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,601
Let's talk over there.

181
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,667
I wanted to talk with...

182
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,733
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

183
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,300
- Th-Th-Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Come again.

184
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,367
I will.

185
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,367
Okay, let's go.

186
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,190
- Careful on your way home.
- Okay.

187
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,590
- Well, on saturday?
- Yes.

188
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,010
What do you guys think?

189
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,030
Let's go.

190
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:05,367
You should've told me from the start that you knew him.

191
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,301
Sorry.

192
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,401
Why are you apologizing?

193
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,668
I should be the one apologizing to you.

194
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:15,899
What?

195
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,920
I didn't know Kiyoi Sou was that sort of person.

196
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:28,367
You haven't touched your food, Hira.

197
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,853
What is that big of a shock?

198
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,167
Oh, no.

199
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,900
Kiyoi was always like that.

200
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,266
But say, was it okay to have Nabe on your birthday?
(T/N: Japanese hotpot)

201
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,201
It's great.

202
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,567
Being with you makes it fun.

203
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,434
Kiyoi would never say something like that.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,300
Here you go.

205
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,700
What?

206
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,367
Happy Birthday.

207
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,020
Thank you!

208
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,367
Can I open it?

209
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,634
Yes.

210
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,199
So cute! A camera strap?

211
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes.

212
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,867
I'll treasure it.

213
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,234
Okay.

214
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,467
I forgot the cake.

215
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,790
- Cake?!
- Sorry!

216
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,067
Wait! You bought a cake, too?

217
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes. I'm going to cherish

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,766
these warm moments.

219
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,567
Sorry. Sorry!

220
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,099
- I'm so happy!
- For you.

221
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,433
- Thank you so much, Hira.
- Are you okay?

222
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,333
Yes. See you. I had a lot of fun.

223
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,600
See you soon!

224
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Okay. Be safe.

225
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,434
University life is pleasant...

226
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,180
I have friends who understand me.

227
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:21,534
And yet, so easily and abruptly...

228
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,499
Like a flash storm...

229
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:30,400
Kiyoi wreaks havoc on my life just as it was starting to come together.

230
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:55,434
[1. What did you think of the play? Kiyoi Sou's performance was wonderful.]

231
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,100
Where are you from, perv?

232
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:09,567
You're so creepy, you stick out.

233
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,767
Hey, not that!

234
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:20,534
"So Kiyo's performance was wonderful."

235
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,167
What...?

236
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,400
I felt I should support you.

237
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,568
After-party.

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,367
Come if you like.

239
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,034
Can I?

240
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,467
I hate what I'm doing...

241
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,167
I don't expect anything...

242
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,367
There's no point...

243
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,800
But...

244
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,833
In the spur of the moment,

245
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:00,066
I found myself awkwardly at an after-party where I didn't know anyone.

246
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,967
Kiyoi never came over to where I was.

247
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,800
I expected that, so I'm not complaining.

248
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,367
Just being able to watch Kiyoi was...

249
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,734
Don't you feel there is something between Kiyoi and Iruma-san?

250
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,032
Like you didn't know.

251
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:21,134
Iruma-san's famous for liking young handsome types.

252
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:22,733
Do you think Kiyoi is of that persuasion, too?

253
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,333
Who knows?

254
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:26,967
- What?
- Does that mean...

255
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,032
Iruma-san is interested in him?

256
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:30,632
They have a point.

257
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:37,432
In high school, Kiyoi never had a girlfriend despite how the girls fussed all over him.

258
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm not hoping for anything with Kiyoi,

259
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:47,234
but... is that actor Kiyoi's boyfriend?

260
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:52,167
Will Kiyoi kiss that man?

261
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,768
Will he do anything more than that?

262
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,833
You're quite a drinker! College student?

263
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,333
Hey! Keep your hands off this naive college student.

264
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,867
He's my little brother's boyfriend!

265
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:18,467
- He is?
- No kidding?

266
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,300
- I think I've seen you before.
- What was your name?

267
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,034
- Hira? Hira-kun?
- Hira-kun.

268
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,499
Leaving already?

269
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,066
Ah, yes.

270
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:33,267
Okay. Come back again anytime.

271
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,267
I drank too much...

272
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:49,100
But it's a lot better to drink myself silly

273
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,033
than be tormented by disgusting thoughts.

274
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,166
Leaving?

275
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,867
What?

276
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,633
I asked if you're leaving.

277
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:05,900
I uh-uh-uh...

278
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,167
Geez, you can be so annoying!

279
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,333
- Are you drunk?
- I'm not drunk.

280
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,066
You okay? Stay on the sidewalk.

281
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,001
Get away! Let go of me!

282
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,567
S-Sorry...

283
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,534
Sorry I took so long.

284
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,099
I don't want that!

285
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,534
Oh, here.

286
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:46,033
Kiyoi seemed so much stronger and more beautiful than in high school,

287
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:52,434
when he was still reaching for something between his dream and reality.

288
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,000
Stop staring at me.

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,567
You're still creepy.

290
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:02,567
S-S-Sorry.

291
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,967
Take it.

292
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,800
[Cafe World | Madness]

293
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,000
Can I come to see you again?

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,533
Stop asking for permission each time.

295
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,754
If you want to come, then come.

296
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,734
Th-Thank you.

297
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,500
We don't go through an agency,

298
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,234
so it's tough getting the word out.

299
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,100
You're having a rough time...

300
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:44,534
It's hard finding a place to rehearse.

301
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,668
A place to rehearse?

302
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:52,267
The place we're using now has walls that are too thin.

303
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,700
How about my place?

304
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,201
What?

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,534
I-I don't know what rehearsals are like,

306
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:06,701
but my place is big, and if I can help in any way...

307
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:12,634
Oh, sorry. I got excited on my own.

308
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,166
Here.

309
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,767
Give me your number.

310
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,401
Why did you change your cell phone number?

311
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,700
W-Water damage.

312
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,300
That's no reason to change your number.

313
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,267
S-Sorry.

314
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,867
So...

315
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,500
What're your plans from now?

316
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,234
I'm going home by train.

317
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:06,100
That's not what I meant...

318
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:11,133
- Oh, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

319
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:16,068
Wh-What train line do you take?

320
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:23,801
Are you dating Koyama's younger brother?

321
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,234
What?

322
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,466
N-N-N-No, I'm not really dating him.

323
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,968
Does that mean it could happen?

324
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,300
Why are you asking?

325
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,666
Why?

326
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,500
D-Does it bother you?

327
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,566
It doesn't bother me at all.

328
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,999
Be my guest. Go right ahead.

329
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,300
Wait! Wait! Well...

330
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,267
Him or me? Who do you like?

331
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,034
What?

332
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,634
Ouch!

333
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:04,868
K-Kiyoi, wait!

334
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:54,433
Will I keep chasing after Kiyoi?

335
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:58,534
No matter how much I pursue him, I can never reach him.

336
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
But he won't let go of my heart.

337
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
It's hard.

338
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,000
It's painful.

339

[Kiyoi Sou]

340
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,700
But still...

341
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,367
I want to be Kiyoi's forever.

342

[Kiyoi Sou]

343
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,600
Hello?

344
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Wrong number.

345
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,067
Yes, I see.

346
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,481
But I'm glad I got you.

347
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,867
Can we go to your place to rehearse?

348
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,500
Sure. No problem.

349
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,000
Do you remember how to get there?

350
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,367
Hira!

351
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,401
Come in.

352
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,801
Are you okay, Koyama-kun?

353
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,234
Koyama-kun developed a fever and collapsed.

354
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:05,867
But we can't stay.

355
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,600
Koyama says he's okay.

356
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,241
But we're worried. So can you take him to the hospital?

357
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,299
Thinking about how I waited so long to hear from a guy like that

358
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,167
made me furious with myself.

359
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,840
I have no idea what he's thinking,

360
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
back then... or now.

361
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,334
"I love you..."

362
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,667
"I can't help it..."

363
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,700
For several insipid years...

364
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,901
all I did was grow up.

365
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:45,601
[Next Episode]

366
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:48,767
I could not forget Hira.

367
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,900
Today, can I stay over?

368
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,967
I want his eyes to look at me again.

369
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:55,200
My heart throbs with hope.

370
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
This feeling...

371
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,934
I love you.

372
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,174
I didn't know yet what it means.
