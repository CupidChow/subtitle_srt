172
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,565
Don't take it out on him just because a girl dumped you.

173
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,366
You're pathetic.

174
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,533
Go buy it for me!

175
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,733
Don't bother. Have one, too.

176
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:59,960
- These were really good last time.
- Let's eat!

177
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,330
- Look.
- Yeah.

178
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,099
"Whose side are you on?"

179
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,970
The apex of the pyramid

180
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,000
began to waver and change.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,930
I'm serious.

182
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,533
Then came a coup d'état.
(T/N: sudden and violent overthrow of an existing government)

183
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,666
What is that?!

184
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,832
Sorry, Kiyoi!

185
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,165
We spilled our juice.

186
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,065
It wasn't on purpose, so let it go, okay?

187
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,333
What're they doing?

188
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,900
Stop with the silly pranks.

189
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,866
Get us juice. We spilled ours.

190
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,399
I'll get it.

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,133
Make it three, Kiyoi. One for Stutz, too.

192
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,966
Hey.

193
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,799
Hey! Listen when I talk to you!

194
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,433
Who do you think you are? Commoner!

195
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,333
Say something!

196
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
It's not like you to get violent.

197
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,300
You tried to help Kiyoi, didn't you?

198
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,533
Help him?

199
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,400
You're wrong, Sensei.

200
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
I didn't save Kiyoi.

201
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700
It's just the opposite.

202
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,299
Because of Kiyoi,

203
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
I was able to help myself.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,765
Ever since childhood,

205
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:23,066
I floated along in filthy water...

206
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,066
Thanks to Kiyoi,

207
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,520
I want to move forward

208
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,900
despite the stagnant air.

209
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,766
Kiyoi...

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Stalker.

211
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,400
Washing with soap left my hair a mess.

212
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,166
No, it's not.

213
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,746
If you touch it, you'd know.

214
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,133
Beautiful...

215
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,066
There you go again.

216
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,200
No camera today?

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,300
No.

218
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,865
It's at home. Sorry.

219
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,233
Stop apologizing.

220
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:10,733
Starting tomorrow, I'll bring it every day.

221
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,533
Don't use it for anything weird.

222
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,366
W-Weird things?

223
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,000
Without asking.

224
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,566
You've done it before, haven't you?!

225
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,532
- Just once.
- I knew it. Creepy!

226
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:29,499
I-I-I'm sorry! Just once!

227
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,866
I felt terrible about it afterward.

228
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,333
I would never hurt you, Kiyoi-kun.

229
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,833
Stop it!

230
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,633
Stop adding "kun."

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,300
Makes it doubly creepy.

232
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,166
All right...

233
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,700
Kiyoi.

234
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:54,566
Do you like boys?

235
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,070
Answer me!

236
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,966
Do you like boys?

237
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't know.

238
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,700
But...

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,866
I don't like other guys.

240
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,800
Or girls.

241
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,333
You're the only one I think is beautiful.

242
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,033
You're the only special one.

243
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,233
Creepy.

244
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
I suppose it is...

245
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,333
Do you want to kiss me?

246
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,533
Go for it.

247
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,433
In your dreams, stupid!

248
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,833
Here.

249
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,580
He might be teasing me again...

250
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:44,366
But I don't care.

251
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,700
Sorry! I had monitor duty.

252
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,066
You're late. Let's go.

253
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,933
From that day on,

254
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:33,233
Kiyoi would sometimes come to my house.

255
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,866
We rarely talked.

256
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,733
The two of us just spent time together.

257
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,606
You finished yours, right?

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Go!

259
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,600
Sorry, sorry.

260
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,266
There is no best way to describe my relationship with Kiyoi.

261
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,790
A relationship forms

262
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,830
when both parties influence each others.

263
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,500
Kiyoi may affect me,

264
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,600
but the opposite could never happen.

265
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,199
Hey! Wait a minute!

266
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,700
Wait!

267
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,432
- Can't wait.
- Wait!

268
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:34,199
- Does it look good?
- Yes.

269
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,590
If anything,

270
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,230
it was one-way, like faith in a deity.

271
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,790
I want to devote myself to Kiyoi

272
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,200
like a devout priest or nun.

273
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,733
I can see the photo in my mind.

274
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,533
You've had this dreamy-eyed look all this time.

275
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,013
What're you thinking about?

276
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,200
I want to become a nun.

277
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Creepy!

278
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,330
Fall ended and winter

279
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,460
was just around the corner.

280
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,400
W-Wait...

281
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,033
But for us...

282
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,300
There was no winter.

283
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,932
Hey! Hey!

284
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,999
- Have you seen it?
- I have!

285
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,265
This is him!

286
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,299
Isn't he amazing?

287
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,899
He looks so handsome! Wearing this year's trendy colors!

288
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,270
The girls were excited because Kiyoi appeared as model in a fashion magazine.

289
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,732
That was how I learned

290
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,990
a talent agency had scouted Kiyoi

291
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,330
during the contest.

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,499
Kiyoi is on his path of choice...

293
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,332
Have you seen yourself, Kiyoi-kun?

294
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,732
You look amazing!

295
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:54,066
Damn that Kiyoi...

296
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,500
Take a look!

297
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
Our secret time was over...

298
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,900
It was time to wake up from my momentary dream.

299
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:07,433
We were like two dots... never overlapping...

300
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,766
The last day of school arrived.

301
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,630
[Congratulations, Graduates]

302
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,910
Hey! Kiyoi!

303
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,120
Sign mine!

304
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,600
Please, please!

305
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,565
Sign mine, Kiyoi!

306
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,365
Later.

307
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:36,200
On my forehead.

308
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:40,065
Shirota... Miki...

309
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:41,532
Sorry about everything.

310
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,133
- Kiyoi!
- Kiyoi! Sorry!

311
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,966
We're really sorry!

312
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,232
Kiyoi-kun!

313
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,333
Kurata?!

314
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,633
Today is our last day...

315
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,900
Can I find the courage I could never summon before?

316
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,134
- I'm leaving.
- Kamejiro, you're a graduate, too! Enjoy your life with Hira.

317
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,266
Kiyoi-kun!

318
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,865
You're coming to the farewell party, aren't you?

319
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,132
I have other plans.

320
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,166
What?!

321
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,300
Bye!

322
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,960
I will go!

323
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,499
Because it's the last time...

324
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:35,200
I want to sear his image into my memory and my heart...

325
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,900
My king.

326
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,133
So you did come, stalker.

327
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:47,866
Sorry.

328
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,266
I don't mind.

329
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,032
When I think it's the last time...

330
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,066
The words fly somewhere far away.

331
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,540
- Kiyoi...
- You know, I...

332
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,100
Sorry...

333
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,666
What is it?

334
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,766
What is what?

335
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:13,500
Don't you have something to say to me?

336
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,466
Something to say...?

337
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,866
What does he mean?

338
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,532
- Forget it.
- S-Sorry!

339
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,340
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,340
I...

341
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,600
I...

342
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,300
See you again.

343
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,833
It was like a kiss of mercy.

344
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,566
"Don't follow me anymore." It felt clear.

345
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:20,600
See... you... again...

346
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,966
Such a simple goodbye.

347
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:28,365
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

348
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:34,466
But the words came from Kiyoi's lips, so I can't let them go.

349
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:37,800
Whether flowers, poison, or blades...

350
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,100
If they come from Kiyoi, all I can do is hold onto them.

351
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,833
Leaving only memories behind...

352
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,300
My king left my world.

353
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,300
A world like that...

354
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,130
can go to hell!

355
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,000
I just got done.

356
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,500
You done, too, Hira?

357
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,840
Tomorrow comes,

358
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,060
even in a world without color.

359
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,266
I'm in front of Building 6.

360
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,766
I'm here!

361
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,665
Hungry?

362
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,832
Uh, yeah.

363
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,433
Okay, let's go!

364
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,733
For several insipid years...

365
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,860
all I did

366
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,600
was grow older.

367
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,666
[Next Episode]
College life is pleasant...

368
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,600
- Happy Birthday.
- I'll treasure it.

369
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,065
He's my kid brother's boyfriend.

370
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:51,232
Like a sudden storm, Kiyoi uproot everything that has begun to grow.

371
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:54,132
- Creepy.
- What?!

372
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,466
What're your plans?

373
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,199
With you, Hira.

374
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,065
Will I keep chasing after Kiyoi?
