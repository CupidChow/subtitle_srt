No.

You're right.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,032
Someone like me...

I guess.

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,466
I don't understand your feelings, either.

even once considered that I love you?

Th-Th-That's...

164

not possible.

165
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,133
I received many messages from Hira.

166
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,865
Every one of them an apology.

167
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,633
Not one showed he understood.

168
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,299
I believed that if I told him how I felt,

169
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,800
we could be together.

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,666
He probably doesn't think that I confessed my feelings to him.

171
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,466
So be it.

172
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll just forget about it.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,165
What kind of man was I?

174
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,465
- I don't remember!
- Even though I wasn't in demand,

175
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:27,133
rehearsals and auditions kept me busy.

176
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,100
I was thankful for that.

179
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,866
I'm so, so sorry.

180
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,199
I know I'm annoying you,

181
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,465
so this will be the last time I contact you.

182
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:57,300
Tonight... at the place where you first saved me,

183
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,100
I will dedicate the night to my love for you.

184
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,833
Today will be the last time I will think about you.

185
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,900
I'm going to...

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,766
put an end to these feelings, too.

187
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,533
Kiyoi-kun...

188
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,099
After we're done, I'm meeting a show producer for dinner.

189
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,865
- Do you want to come?
- We're resuming rehearsal!

190
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:29,266
- Okay!
- Okay!

191
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:32,566
We're going to be running late today.

192
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,632
What? I have plans!

193
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:36,965
Make this the priority. Please.

194
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,566
That's not what the schedule said.

195
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,366
Kiyoi didn't come.

196
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,466
Of course, he wouldn't.

197
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,700
This is... the reality.

198
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,566
I wonder how the world appears...

199
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,466
through Kiyoi's eyes.

200
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,733
I'll move on to a new morning.

201
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,100
And after that, I'll forget...

202
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,180
the love...

203
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,700
of my life.

204
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,466
Kiyo...!

205
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,033
Wait!

206
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,432
I don't want to forget.

207
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,373
I don't want it to be a memory.

208
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:15,400
I know I'm being creepy,

209
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
but...

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,466
I can't lie about my feelings.

211
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,899
Kiyoi is who I yearn for.

212
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,532
He's self-centered and willful...

213
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,950
That's why...

214
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,030
he was my savior.

215
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,099
Everything Kiyoi was...

216
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,600
and everything Kiyoi will be...

217
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,066
I want to embrace it all.

218
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,632
Let go of me!

219
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:40,166
I love you, Kiyoi!

220
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,200
I really did intend to end it today!

221
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,832
But...

222
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,799
then you...

223
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,499
Stop messaging and calling me!

224
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm sorry...

225
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,133
I'm sorry!

226
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,400
But I love you!

227
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,399
I want to forget you...

228
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,020
but I can't when you shove yourself

229
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,560
into my life!

230
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,166
I'm not the "King." Screw you!

231
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,465
That's not what I am.

232
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm an ordinary guy.

233
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,966
I want to be with the person I love.

234
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,866
I want to touch him...

235
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm just an ordinary guy.

236
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,766
Do you have someone...

237
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,800
you love, Kiyoi?

238
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,265
It's you!

239
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:38,966
Stupid, how many times are you going to make me say it?

240
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,700
Really?

241
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,400
I wouldn't lie about something like this.

242
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,766
I kissed you... on graduation day, didn't I?!

243
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:56,933
But you...

244
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:01,233
You didn't even come after me...

245
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,733
even though you kept saying how much you love me...

246
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,533
I couldn't understand!

247
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,766
Why would you...

248
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,399
love someone like me?

249
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,833
I wish I knew!

250
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,733
I really don't know...

251
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,200
You're the one who told me you loved me first.

252
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,966
You gave me that look...

253
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,600
You even kissed me.

254
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,533
But then...

255
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,666
you changed your number.

256
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,166
Do you know how that made me feel?!

257
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,566
Kiyoi.

258
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,465
Screw you, Hira!

259
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,633
Go to hell!

260
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,100
I...

261
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,766
love you so much, Kiyoi, that it drives me crazy!

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,300
I think of you like a god.

263
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,766
I never thought I could have you.

264
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm...

265
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,066
not a god!

266
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,966
Kiyoi...

267
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,700
Can I...

268
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,233
touch you, Kiyoi?

269
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,833
Not if it's the same way...

270
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,633
you did before.

271
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,233

Yes.

295
