00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:20,100
When I was little, I wanted to be an idol.

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,966
Everyone on the TV set was laughing.

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,165
Unlike me, a latch-key boy from a single-parent home

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,333
who was always alone, they all looked happy.

5
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:33,733
I wished I could join them in there.

6
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:38,500
When I was in third grade, my mother remarried.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,600
I now had two kind parents, but my happiness

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
was short-lived.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,600
My brother was born, then my sister...

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,566
Just like that, there was no room for me.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,500
The idols on the TV set

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,370
had screaming fans reaching out

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,360
with all their hearts...

14
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,432
It was sort of scary, but I thought it might be wonderful

15
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:06,000
to be wanted in that way.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,466
If someone wanted me that way...

17
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,033
"I don't know why..."

"I love you."

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,965
- "I can't help myself..."
- Okay.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,266
Try that again. "I love you."

23

I just don't feel it.

25
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,533
"I love you" isn't something Kiyoi would say.

26
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,733

When I saw him,

34

He's quite good-looking.

170
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,932
- What?
- What?

171
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,999
He has a unique air about him.

172
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,980
The type who changes completely when he gets serious.

173
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,633
You don't know anything about Hira...

174
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,933
What should I do?

175
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,699
Why not meet him?

176
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,932
What?

177
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,466
Invite him to the show or something.

178
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,665
I see.

179
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,765
- I want to meet him.
- Me, too.
- That's a good idea.

[Cafe World | Madness]

181
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,099
I can't work in a place like this!

182
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,432
Hey, wait a minute.

183
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,733
My heart feels like it's going to explode.

184
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:47,966
My clenched hands are trembling...

185
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,366
This isn't like me.

186
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,532
That's the look

187
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,966
I wanted to see.

188
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,865
He says he's a fan.

189
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,566
Stalker.

190
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,166
I could see the fervor growing in Hira's eyes.

191
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,799
That same passion he showed before.

192
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,066
- I-I-I-I'm...
- Hira.

What?

195
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:36,300
There's an after-party. Will you join us?

196
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,166
I will.

197
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,666
I felt victorious.

198
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,765
Sorry, Koyama-san's little brother...

199
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,400
you'll have to give up.

200
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,899
S-Sorry...

What?

202
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:02,800
T-T-T-Today I have other plans.

203
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:08,833
Whether you come or not, it makes no difference to me.

204
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,500
Today is my little brother's birthday.

205
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,200
They're going to celebrate together.

206
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,870
Oh... Is that so?

207
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,266
Do you choose him over me?

208
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:38,966
After gazing at me with those eyes?

209
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,400
Do you... resent me that much?

210
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,300
You chose that guy...

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,590
Why're you showing up in front of me again?

212
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,333
Thank you.

213
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,300
Tell me...

214
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,400
Why didn't you say he was your high-school classmate?

215
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,866
Koyama-san seemed so worried that I thought maybe

216
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,833
I'd tease him a bit.

217
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,733
You seemed awfully interested in that guy.

218
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,766
I was? Not the other way around?

219
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,333
Maybe...

220
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,066
you like him?

221
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,566
What?

222
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:24,932
I guess not.

223
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,000
He is Koyama's brother's boyfriend, after all.

224
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,665
I can't understand why...

225
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,066
Koyama-san's brother fell for a guy like that.

226
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,433
What was he like?

227
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,366
From what I hear,

228
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:42,999
he stalked a guy... telling him how beautiful he was.

229
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,165
He took a lot of photos and had no friends.

230
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:48,100
A real creepy one.

231
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,760
But...

232
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,766
you invited him to the after-party?

233
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:05,366
If you're having a hard time saying, "I love you"...

234
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:11,133
Want to practice saying it with me?

235
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,233
You're doing it again. Stop it already.

236
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,299
It's not the same.

237
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,466
Totally different.

238
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:27,032
He can gaze at me, touch me...

239
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,866
but I wouldn't feel a thing.

240
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,432
The one I want is...

241
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:34,966
I-I-I... enjoyed it.

"I love you..."

A duck toy floating all alone in a filthy stream...

247
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,050
Somehow, it reminded me of myself.

248
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,700
Brought to a place it didn't want to be...

249
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
Unable to fit in.

250
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Maybe I can find others like me...

251
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,066
But there aren't.

00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,565
Almost painful to look at her...

260
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,699
But you can't take your eyes off of her!

261
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,765
That's it!

262
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,066
That's the feeling of love!

263
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,000

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,166
Dammit!

00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,300
"Love" sucks!

I want to see him again.

267
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,066
I never want to see him again.

268
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:16,866
Caught between opposite feelings, my angst only grows.

269

270
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,540

Sorry, Hira!

I'm not asking you to be my steady.

I won't ask for anything more than we have now.

No.

Why?!

321

There's no way this won't hurt!

322
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,666
I may be a fool, but that much I know!

323
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,600
It's Kiyoi-kun, isn't it?

324
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,633
The person you loved...

325
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,933
It was Kiyoi-kun, wasn't it?

326
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:26,966
Yes.

327
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:34,200
But he called you a creepy.

328
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,833
He always did.

329
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,733
That's the Kiyoi I loved.

330
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,566
I don't understand.

331

Loving someone without reason

341
