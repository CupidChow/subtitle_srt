You came in late and saved me.

You're creepy.

9

Unlike me, who tries to go unnoticed at the lowest tier,

Don't ever take my photo again!

N-Nothing.

168
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
All these things I can't say that I keep to myself...

00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:48,900
Where is the bathroom?

171
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,833
Oh, sorry...

172
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
I just had a great idea.

173
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,200
What?

174
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,500
This place has a big yard.

175
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,133
Isn't it perfect for fireworks?

176
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,433
Fireworks?

177
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,966
It's our last summer of high school. It's now or never!

178
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,900
Let's invite the girls!

179
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,833
"What day are you free?"

180
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,633
- Stutz! I can't hold it!
- Oh, sorry.

181
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,766
- Too much tomato juice.
- Shut up!

182
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,233
- It's over here.
- Here?

183
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:17,433
- "BTW, Kiyoi is here."
- Hey.

184
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,700
Fireworks with Kiyoi.

185
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,733
Unbelievable.

186
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,833
There, there!

187
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,166
There it goes!

188
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,433
I know what I'm doing!

189
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,633
All this smoke!

190
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,466
- So much smoke!
- Watch the sparks!

191
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:38,870
Aren't you going anywhere during the break, Kiyoi-kun?

192
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,533
- I don't have any plans.
- Then let's go to the beach!

193
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:46,333
- What were you talking about?
- I was saying it'd be nice to go surfing together.

194
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,600
That's a great idea.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,066
Come join us. It's fun!

196
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,033
Really? Let's do it then!

197
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,833
- When should we go?
- The sooner the better.

198
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,400
Man...

199
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,466
It can't be helped. We invited them by saying Kiyoi's here.

200
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,300
I know...

201
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,666
But aren't you disappointed too, Stutz?

202
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
Not really.

203
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,633
Stutz is pretending not to care!

204
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,633
Not at all. He's got it all wrong.

205
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,333
- I'm thirsty.
- Me, too.

206
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,100
- Okay.
- Thanks.

207
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,000
Shirota and the others don't have a clue.

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,766
They can admire Kiyoi all they want,

209
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:29,133
but they can never be him.

210
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,866
Using Kiyoi like a panda plushie

211
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,733
to invite the girls is unthinkable.

212
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,666
Seriously...

213
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,566
I live here, but I want to go home.

214
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,966
What could this feeling be... Rubber Ducky?

215
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,233
- Do you want to do another one?
- I want ice cream.

216
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,400
Ice cream? Okay!

217
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,866
Ice cream.

218
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,600
Go buy us some, Stutz.

219
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,633
Will one person be enough?

220
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:03,433
Yes, we need one more.

221
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,200
I know what to do!

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Steady!

223
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,466
- It's not me!
- Not me either!

224
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,166
Well?

225
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,166
Safe.

226
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,366
What?

227
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,300
So that means...

228
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,500
It's me.

229
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,066
What?

230
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,166
Kiyoi and me?!

231
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,233
It can't be...

232
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,433
Don't go, Kiyoi-kun.

233
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,733
I wanted to discuss our beach outing.

234
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,133
What?

235
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,233
Thanks.

236
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,000
Why don't you go, Kurata-chan?

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,666
- Good idea.
- You go.

238
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:45,366
She's like me... at the bottom of the pyramid.

239
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,633
Isn't that great, Stutz? You get to talk to a girl.

240
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,966
I-I'll go by myself.

241
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,233
What?

242
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,766
It'll be hard for her wearing a Yukata.
(T/N: summer kimono)

243
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:03,333
Listen to Stutz acting all cool!

244
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,700
Who knew?!

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,833
Stop it, you guys!

246
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,366
I'm okay with being a gofer.

247
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,900
I can't stand the atmosphere in that room.

248
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,166
I wonder if he's going to the beach...

249
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,066
It doesn't matter how handsome or pretty anyone is.

250
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:35,633
No one makes my antenna react like Kiyoi does.

251
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:39,600
Kiyoi is the only one I feel this way about.

252
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,166
Why are you just standing there?

253
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,866
What?

254
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,400
Aren't you going to the store?

255
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,533
Y-Yes.

256
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:59,500
Kiyoi is someone special, after all.

257
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,466
It's so hot...

258
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,800
S-Sorry.

259
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Why are you apologizing?

260
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,040
The heat isn't your fault.

261
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,133
Right...

262
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:25,933
God, please stop the pounding in my heart!

263
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,830
You know...

264
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,733
Yes?

265
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,733
Usually, wouldn't a person ask why I came?

266
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,380
What?

267
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,000
Why did you?

268
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,200
You seemed...

269
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:53,066
somehow uncomfortable there, Kiyoi-kun.

270
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,733
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

271
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,966
- It's so damn hot!
- I'm sorry!

272
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,833
Pedal!

273
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,833
I'll go by myself.

274
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,200
No, you won't.

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,666
It's too tiring to walk back.

276
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,633
You pedal.

277
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,200
O-Okay.

278
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:23,000
- Then... I'll go.
- Yes.

279
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:31,233
This isn't a dream, is it?

280
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:34,090
A breeze makes all the difference.

281
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,560
Yes.

282
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,433
- You said...
- Yes?

283
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:43,600
- you don't like photography.
- I did.

284
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,233
Then why do you bring your camera with you?

285
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:51,500
Because I want to be invisible.

286
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,066
What?

287
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,766
When I look through the viewfinder,

288
00:15:55,766 --> 00:16:00,500
I feel like I'm cropped out from the rest of the world.

289
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,466
No one can bother me.

290
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,133
I'm in a place where I can be alone.

291
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,133
Alone?

292
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,666
Yes.

293
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,166
You say you're grateful for being left alone,

294
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,700
and you want to be invisible.

295
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,566
You're a strange guy.

296
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,233
I cannot see Kiyoi's face,

297
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:33,633
but he must be making his usual annoyed expression.

298
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,900
Stop. Stop!

299
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,866
No tandem riding!

300
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,533
Pedal with all you got! Go!

301
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,266
- Hey!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

302
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,133
Hey, stop!

303
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,900
Stop!

304
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,766
I'm reporting you to your school!

305
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:57,166
You couldn't have picked a worse time!

306
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,700
Do this, and I won't let it reflect on your recommendation letters.

307
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,200
Here.

308
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,300
Here's yours, Kiyoi.

309
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,900
Do a good job.

310
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm beat!

312
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,866
Why are you apologizing?

314
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,600
Because...

315
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,100
You can go.

316
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,766
I'll do the rest.

317
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:35,200
You have dance practice, right?

318
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,433
I don't want to keep Kiyoi any longer.

319
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:41,933
I won't punish the king any further.

320
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,566
It's super hot.

321
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,900
You don't want to get sunburned.

322
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,166
I feel so hot!

323
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,600
He's glowing...

324
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,233
I've never known anything so beautiful.

325
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,566
It's so hot!

326
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,166
- Heads up!
- That's cold! Stop it!

327
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,866
- Stop!
- Stop running away!

328
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,233
I see you always looking at me!

329
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,800
That's because...

330
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,866
You're beautiful, Kiyoi-kun.

331
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,266
There you go again.

332
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,500
You really are creepy.

333
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,566
I know.

334
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:48,700
And one more thing...

335
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,966
Stop calling me "Kiyoi-kun."

336
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,566
What?

337
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,133
Hearing a guy call me "kun" makes my skin crawl.

338
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,466
Just call me Kiyoi.

339
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,433
I can't.

340
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,933
Then stop looking at me!

341
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,833
O-Okay! Okay!

342
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,400
I'll try! I'll try hard!

343
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,533
I will.

344
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,033
I'm thirsty.

345
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,666
Okay, I'll get you something.

346
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,466
Don't bother.

347
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,066
Resisting me?

348
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,366
Look...

349
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,920
You!

350
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,530
I'm sorry!

351
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,666
It's cold!

352
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,600
It's cold!

353
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,333
It's cold!

354
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,900
I'll put you in your place!

355
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,766
Is that too big?

356
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:40,300
Guess it is. Better than too small.

357
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,400
Here.

358
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,666
Barley tea?

359
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Sorry. I'm out of ginger ale.

360
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
Buy some next time.

361
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,300
Why does he say those things?

362
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,533
There's some left.

363
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,566
I am yanked again

364
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,000
by hope and despair I have no right to feel...

365
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,866
"Beautiful."

366
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:44,300
My feelings for Kiyoi cannot be expressed by such a simple word,

367
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:57,766
but no words can convey what I feel.

368
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,566
In the end, I could not say anything.

369
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,233
All I can do is stare at him.

370
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,066
You don't like fireworks?

371
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,300
♫ It's not even close to my feet ♫

372
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,933
It's not that.

373
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,870
♫ I go back to place I used to be ♫

374
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,230
♫ Isn't it my job to follow you? ♫

375
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,933
There's something I like more than that.

376
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:40,950
♫ It was for the best and forever ♫

377
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,350
♫ Hey, more and more ♫

378
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,630
♫ I'm so absorbed that no one can stop me ♫

379
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,466
Kiyoi.

380
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,040
♫ Even if I refuse, only I can see it ♫

381
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,060
♫ Crawl... ♫

382
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:56,866
You said my name.

383
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,820
♫ And this hand ♫

384
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,040
♫ Can you let me kiss it? ♫

385
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,266
[Next Episode]
I want Kiyoi to realize his dream.

386
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,900
You! Do you pity me?!

387
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,966
King was not the chosen one.

388
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:17,766
It made the commoners restless.

389
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,333
I like you! You are the best, Kiyoi!

390
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,300
No one can compare! You're special!

391
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Do you like boys?

392
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,666
The last day of high school.

393
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,900
Two dots never overlapping.

394
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,200
See you again.

395
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,533
It was time to wake up from my momentary dream.

396
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,514
