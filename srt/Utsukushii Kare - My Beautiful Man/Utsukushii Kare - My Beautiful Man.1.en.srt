00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,320
Thanks for holding the table, Stutz!

Do us this favor!

175

You idiots. I didn't do this for you guys.

176
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,434
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,101
So how did that go, Kiyoi?

178
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:05,634
- What?
- Don't try to hide it.

179

You're in this contest, right?

181
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:09,934
- Awesome!
- Wow!

182
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:10,933
Contest?

183
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,634

- Who?
- My cousin.

Stutz. The usual. And three ice creams, too.

- How about you, Kiyoi?
- Ginger ale.

206
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,701
- And a ginger ale. Thanks.
- Thanks.

207
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,801
- Do you mean it?
- No!

208
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,334
Do it!

Say, mind cleaning this up for us?

213

Help us out, Stutz. I'm sopping wet.

214
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,700
It's what you do, right, Stutz?

215
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Do it.

216
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,833
Hey! What're you doing?

Why're you calling him Stutz?

221
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,401
Well, but...

222
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,701
That's what you guys call him.

224
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,830
So?

You got a problem?

226
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,701
I'll clean it up.

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,401
Okay.

229
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,668
This is too much.

230
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,267
You're annoying.

231
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,100
Buy yourself an ice cream.

232

Quickly, go!

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,734
I'll go right now!

We'll be waiting!

235
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,767
Kiyoi couldn't stand the idea of waiting.

236
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,867
He crushed Yoshida for only that reason.

237
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:57,100
I have never seen anyone so selfish and strong.

238
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,267
I'm not wasting this on ice cream.

239
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,400
Okay. All clean.

240
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,767
I want to keep these near me forever.

241
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:48,534
I've never felt this way before.

242
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,400
A cruel and glorious imprint.

243
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,134
Beautiful like a spring storm.

Overwhelming in its power.

I could feel my view of the world changing.

246
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,801
Kiyoi?

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,401
I know what I'm doing is creepy.

248
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,100
But...

249
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,767
I was too curious.

250
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,133
Hi!

251
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,567
Are you here to watch a class?

252
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,400
Well, no...

253
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Our dance school offers hip-hop, jazz...

254
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,867
A dance studio?

255
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,134
We just started K-pop too.

256
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,234
Would you like to try a class?

257
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,933
He was completely different from the Kiyoi I see at school.

258
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,833
I can't take my eyes off of him.

259
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
One, two, three... and hop!

260
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,767
Okay, take a break.

261
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,367
What?!

262
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,267
What the hell were you doing there?

263
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,234

264
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:53,133

265
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,334
What a nuisance.

266
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,401
Just take your time.

267
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,334
I'll wait.

268
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,000
I was taking photos when...

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,500
I happened to see you.

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Talking with you gets on my nerves.

271
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,100
I get it. I feel the same.

272
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
Ginger ale.

273
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,667
Oh... yes.

Here.

275
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,167
I thought you might be thirsty.

276
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,034
Don't tell anyone, okay?

277
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

278
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,300
That I'm taking dance classes.

279
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,067
I see. So that's what he wanted to tell me.

280
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,233
He acted disinterested in the contest,

281
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,867
but actually, he was trying hard.

282
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:28,900
He doesn't want everyone to know.

283
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,501
I won't tell.

284
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:35,067
I'm alone at home and at school anyway.

Even at home?

286
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,230
My parents moved for work, so it's just me.

287

Oh, I see.

288
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,900
So you really are alone?

289
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,800
I won't tell, no matter what.

290

What if you were threatened with death?

I would die.
