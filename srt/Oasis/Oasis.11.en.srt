Are you crazy?

We couldn't find him.

Well...

50
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,270
It appears he's drifted far into the ocean.

51
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,370
Damn it!

52
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,780

54
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,160
Did...

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,470
Did Doo Hak hyung really die?

56
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,630
I asked you if he died!

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,680
Please find him...

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,590
The ocean would be too cold for him.

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,230
Why did it have to be when it's cold like this?

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,370
Gosh, damn it.

61
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,140
I didn't think I would go back.

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,410
I thought that even if I did return,

63
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,010
I would return confidently as a boss.

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,710
But we're back to being nobodies.

65
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,530
Hey, you bastard! Who says we're just nobodies?

66
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,080
Even though it was for just a moment,

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,160
we were the core members of the Council that united all the gangs in the country.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,120
Did we do that by fighting?

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,940
They just joined us because it was profitable.

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,950
You're so stupid.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,930
Fighting takes skills, and money requires skills as well.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,870
How do you think Silla united the three kingdoms?

73
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,640
Kim Chun Chu did it through business,

74
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,950
while Kim Yu Sin used his sword.

75
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,320
Doo Hak and Hyung Joo did the business,

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,620
while you and I are the muscle.

77
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,730
So, it was half business and half muscle.

78
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,520
We united the gangs using both.

79
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,910
Listening to you like this, you're right.

80
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,880
But even the muscle,

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,220
didn't Doo Hak hyung do everything?

82
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,290
No matter how much dirty work the subordinates do,

83
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,420
history only records those who were the bosses.

84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,980
Isn't that right, Hyung Joo?

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,180
Let's go quietly,

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,920
instead of reminding me of the one who isn't here.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
This bastard.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,350
Hey! Do you think I want to talk like this?

89
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,810
I keep being reminded of that dead bastard

90
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,470
if I stay still while heading to jail.

91
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,870
If I don't talk like this, saying nonsense,

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,430
I feel like I'll go crazy from being reminded of him!

93
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,470
Why the hell are you crying!

94
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,880
No matter what I do

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,010
or say,

96
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,580
I keep thinking of Doo Hak Hyung.

97
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,320
Gosh, you stupid bastard.

98
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,270
Damn it, damn it!

and congratulations on coming up to Seoul.

105
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,500
Thank you, Father.

106
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,860
You should have come back sooner!

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,040
You lack nothing.

108
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,180
All right. Was it fun working near your hometown?

109
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,230
Whenever I had time during holidays,

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,020
I dropped by the school that I used to go to with Doo Hak Hyung,

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,980
and also the house that we used to live in.

112
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,540
What about Jung Shin?

113
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,870
Why is she so late?

114
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,210
Did you tell her to join us for dinner?

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,340
Yeah, that's strange. She said she was coming.

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,150
She shows her face once a year for your birthday,

117
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,080
but I guess she forgot it this year.

118
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,590
Hello?

119
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,450
Director Go?

120
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,430
Boss didn't say anything to you?

121
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,370
You know this is wrong, don't you?

122
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,730
Why is she suddenly like this?

123
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,840
Please tell Boss to wait just a little bit.

124
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,210
I feel like I will have to put an end to this once and for all.

125
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,170
She probably won't have the leisure to come this year.

126
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,880
Excuse me?

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,690
Did something happen to Jung Shin?

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,640
- Hey, Jung Shin!
 - I'm sorry I'm late.

129
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,800
It's been a while. I'm sorry I'm late.

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,230
All right, you should take a seat.

131
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,420
But are you all right?

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,670
Did something happen?

133
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,100
You supposedly have a problem?

134
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,520
Problem?

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,670
I don't.

136
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,050
The problem would be that business is going all too well.

137
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,890
Oh, and this is your gift.

138
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,300
Gosh, you didn't have to.

139
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,760
You're the only gift I need.

140
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,100
Ugh, why are you so cheesy.

141
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,470
Thanks.

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,750
All right. We should all make a toast.

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,670
For Cheol Woong's birthday and for his success.

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,020
Congrats!

145
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,080
Thank you, Mother.

146
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,550
- Congrats.
 - Thanks.

147
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,620
Ahjumma, what brings you all the way here?

148
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,220
Hey.

149
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,810
I had dinner plans nearby here.

150
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,010
I just dropped by after I finished.

151
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,750
How are you?

152
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,090
Well, yes.

153
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,010
Jung Shin, you too?

154
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,700
Mother.

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,150
I should have visited you more often. I'm sorry.

156
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,210
You should come inside. It's been a while.

157
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,860
Have some tea with us before you leave.

158
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,580
No, it's all right.

159
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,000
These are side dishes you like, so you should eat them.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,870
Also,

161
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,230
whenever you have time, drop by.

162
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,650
Yes. I'll make sure to visit.

163
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,180
At least if I get to see your face,

164
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,260
I feel a bit better.

165
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,490
Happy birthday.

166
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,830
I was a bit sad that I couldn't see you every year I dropped by,

167
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,080
but somehow, this time, I was lucky.

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,650
You had dropped by before?

169
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,740
I usually just returned right after seeing my parents.

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,010
But since I returned to Seoul,

171
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,320
I will visit you from time to time.

172
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,770
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,630
Thanks a lot.

174
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,450
I'll be going.

175
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes, get home safely.

176
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,330
Please drive safely.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's go inside.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,280
Actually, I have to go.

179
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,380
What?

180
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,920
Already?

181
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,620
You should eat before you go.

182
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,640
Yeah, have a cup of tea with us before you go.

183
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,490
No, it's already too late.

184
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,600
All right, then.

185
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,180
- You're really leaving?
 - Yeah.

186
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,190
See you. I'll call you later!

187
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
Let's go inside.

188
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,410
Then have a good night.

189
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,820
Hey.

190
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,070
Congratulations on returning to Seoul.

191
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,880
Come inside.

192
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,480
How did you know it was me?

193
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,280
Since I mentioned something about Jung Shin,

194
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,580
it's obvious you would come to ask me about it.

195
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,050
Intelligence work is about gathering facts,

196
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,190
but reading people is the first step to intelligence work.

197
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,450
You must be preparing for a business trip to Japan.

198
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,140
That's right.

199
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,230
It'll appear to be an ordinary business trip to Japan to ordinary people.

200
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,780
It appears it's something really important.

201
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,270
You can always ask Team Leader Oh, if you want info on Jung Shin.

202
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,220
I don't want to do that.

203
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,110
Jung Shin is...

204
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,660
cornered due to problems with shares in her film company.

205
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,980
She will probably

206
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,220
get kicked out soon with only a few dollars to her name.

207
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,810
Have you still not changed your mind

208
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,810
about pulling out your shares?

209
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,030
If your mind hasn't changed, Mom,

210
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,950
my mind won't change, either.

211
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,980
Then was it right to spend company money without permission for Film Academy or whatever?

212
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,070
How many times do I have to tell you?

213
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,370
I made that investment under the promise of them

214
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,520
recommending the best directors and writers to our film company!

215
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,190
I see.

216
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,970
Is that so?

217
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,880
You will argue that you're right to the very end?

218
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,440
Okay. Director Go.

219
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,630
Yes.

220
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,520
Here. Take this.

221
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,270
It's your shares.

222
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,560
<i>[100 million won]</i>

223
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,930
You're saying this is my share?

224
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,350
Yup. That's your share.

225
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,520
It's half of my shares, equating to 400 million won.

226
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,630
No.

227
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,780
From what I know,

228
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,820
half of your shares in the Gyeong-Gang region, excluding Gwangju and Jeonnam.

229
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,910
That is my share.

230
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,160
That should amount to at least 2 billion, so what's this!

231
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,980
Two billion?

232
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Give me a break.

233
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,850
Director Go, break it down so she gets it.

234
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,440
Y-Yes.

235
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,580
So, the thing is,

236
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,210
it's true you own 50% of the Boss's shares in Gyeong-Gang region, Branch Manager.

237
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,640
But since I spent all my life

238
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,490
going through all the hard times at the start, so Boss said I should have my shares, too.

239
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,980
So Boss gave me

240
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,960
90% of the shares in the Gyeong-Gang region.

241
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,350
And so when we do the math,

242
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,580
well, half of Boss's shares of 10%

243
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,690
is 5%. That is your share.

244
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,260
It came to exactly 200 million won.

245
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,050
- Do you really expect me to believe this?
 - Goodness.

246
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,500
You're saying it's not true?

247
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,980
Look at this. We even have a contract we signed together!

248
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,550
If this is really Director Go's shares,

249
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,190
I will change my last name.

250
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,410
This is clearly prejudice!

251
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,160
Isn't this too much!

252
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,090
You're the one who's being too much!

253
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,940
- Mom!
 - Mom?

254
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,990
Although you became my adopted daughter,

255
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,000
you originally agreed on your knees to live as my maid!

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,180
Are you a goldfish that you'd already forgotten?

257
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,880
How dare you argue with me!

258
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,890
I gave you this because of the time we've spent together,

259
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,340
so you won't go around begging for food.

260
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,910
You choose whether you decide to pay the rent for this office or to leave.

261
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,110
I'm done with you, so get lost!

262
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,570
Let me ask you just one thing.

263
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,870
Was I a maid or a daughter?

264
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,380
Let me ask you one thing, too.

265
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,850
Was I your master or your mom?

266
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,390
I won't leave the film industry.

267
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,580
Gosh...

268
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,940
That's what you want.

269
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,920
Branch Manager, Branch Manager!

270
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,330
Aigoo!

271
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,290
Don't do this.

272
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,540
Just get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!

273
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,650
Even though she speaks coldly like that,

274
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,410
do you know how much she loved you?

275
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,020
You're telling me to go back to living as a maid?

276
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,340
You can be her servant for a long time, Director Go.

277
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,810
And just wait and see...

278
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,850
who will survive in this film industry.

279
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,960
B-B-Branch Manager!

280
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,320
Gosh, that girl, seriously!

281
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,330
Well...

282
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,790
Father.

283
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,910
Could you help Jung Shin a little bit...

284
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,560
You want to help her?

285
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,810
Yes.

286
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,450
Then help her.

287
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,060
However, you are an adult now.

288
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,420
If you want to help the person you love, do it with your own hands.

289
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,730
If you're a man, isn't that what you should do?

290
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,600
What is your heart?

291
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,570
If you can't forget her, then give it your all to get her.

292
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,030
If you can't do that, then forget her.

293
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,570
I never forgot your mother,

294
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,260
and so,

295
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,240
I tried everything

296
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,610
in my power to

297
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,000
find her again and protect her.

298
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,920
But what about you?

299
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,680
Do you think you've put in that kind of effort?

300
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,990
♫ <i>I will go</i> ♫

301
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,980
♫ <i>I will leave</i> ♫

302
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,270
♫ <i>Holding my young son's hand</i> ♫

303
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,580
♫ <i>To where we plant potatoes</i> ♫

304
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,390
♫ <i>And great millet</i> ♫

305
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,250
I don't have a husband who'd come home to me

306
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,250
or children to visit me,

307
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,730
so who the hell is ringing the bell at this hour?

308
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,050
Who is it?

309
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,840
Is it you, Jung Ok?

310
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,990
It's me, Jung Shin.

311
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,390
I came because we didn't get a chance to catch up.

312
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,320
Oh, my.

313
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,740
What brings you here?

314
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,910
After my husband

315
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,180
and Doo Hak departed...

316
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,550
and now that even Jung Ok left home,

317
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,430
how could I live sober?

318
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,250
If I don't have some alcohol like this, I can't even fall asleep.

319
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,400
You're going through a hard time, too, right?

320
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,790
It just wasn't meant to be, so what can you do?

321
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,050
So you should just forget that rotten bastard.

322
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,610
Drink up.

323
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,420
It feels like my heart is punched full of holes

324
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,570
and wind just blows through them.

325
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,740
And I don't know why I keep thinking about Cheol Woong.

326
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,310
Since it's his birthday,

327
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,160
I dropped by wondering

328
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,960
if he maybe would have come up.

329
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,480
But did you see it?

330
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
How that witch glared at me?

331
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,900
She was basically saying how dare I come to see Cheol Woong without her permission.

332
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,930
That probably wasn't what she thought.

333
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,690
That's not what she thought? Bullshit.

334
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,250
Do you know what that stuck-up woman said to me a long time ago?

335
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,770
It should be enough for you

336
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,000
to start whatever business you want.

337
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,740
Oh, my!

338
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,640
Then, is this all money?

339
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,530
In return, I have a favor to ask you.

340
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
It may be difficult,

341
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,890
but I would like for you to never meet my family again.

342
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,160
Especially,

343
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,780
do not ever contact Cheol Woong again.

344
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,300
But...

345
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,980
can't I see him once in a while when I am reminded of Doo Hak?

346
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,440
Well then, take care.

347
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,200
<i>Was it a month after that?</i>

348
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,680
Oh, my!

349
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,120
What brings you all the way here?

350
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,250
Why?

351
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,980
Did I come somewhere I shouldn't have?

352
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,940
Here.

353
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,220
It's beef,

354
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,620
so please eat it and enjoy.

355
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,850
Gosh. Why would you bring something so expensive and so much of it!

356
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,060
Because I might not be able to come very often.

357
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,610
I was

358
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,010
stationed in the countryside.

359
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,640
Where are you going?

360
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,880
Well,

361
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,620
to Gwangju.

362
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,060
That's pretty far.

363
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,170
Until I come back again, please stay healthy.

364
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,780
Since you are living in a far and foreign place,

365
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,940
you should watch your health.

366
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,030
I'll quickly make some food for you, so eat before you leave.

367
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,410
Oh, wait.

368
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,500
I have to go because I have a lot to do.

369
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,650
I'll be going then.

370
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,190
All right.

371
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,790
Whatever it is,

372
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,910
if you need anything, let me know.

373
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,680
Whether it's side dishes, undershirts,

374
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,600
or underwear,

375
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,750
I'll send you whatever you need.

376
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,970
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,080
No.

378
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,680
I'm just grateful.

379
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,420
Now all I have is you.

380
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,420
You have to.

381
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,470
You have to stay healthy, all right?

382
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,850
<i>At that moment, it felt like</i>

383
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,910
<i>an icicle that was frozen in my heart fell off.</i>

384
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,630
That guy...

385
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,620
I guess he knows to do what is right as a human being.

386
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,540
Of course, of course. Whose son is he that he wouldn't?

387
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,950
That stuck-up woman

388
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,540
should have seen us like that.

389
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,520
They say that even a fox faces its homeland before it dies.

390
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,460
Everything's bound to return to its original intended place.

391
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,970
Don't you think so?

392
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,520
You're right.

393
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,240
Jung Shin.

394
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes?

395
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,860
Our Cheol Woong is quite nice, isn't he?

396
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,440
Of course.

397
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,650
It's just that he's a bit too greedy,

398
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,540
but he's quite a good guy.

399
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,340
You should marry Cheol Woong.

400
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,930
Goodness, Mother.

401
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,870
It looks like Cheol Woong can't seem to forget you

402
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,590
and keeps thinking about you.

403
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,880
A dead guy is gone.

404
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,560
Those who are alive should move on with life.

405
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,290
After he sent off Doo Hak like that, whom he had followed around like a brother,

406
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,700
life must have been torturous for him.

407
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,880
Both you and Cheol Woong,

408
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,750
when Doo Hak looks on you guys from Heaven,

409
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,250
wouldn't he want that as much as I do?

410
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,440
Gosh, Mother, please...

411
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,780
Listen to what I have to say a bit.

412
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,610
Cheol Woong...

413
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,420
- is actually–
 - I am...

414
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,650
reminded of him even while I'm eating.

415
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,390
I am reminded of Doo Hak even while I am walking.

416
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,270
He just refuses to disappear

417
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,480
from my heart.

418
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,690
So how could I accept someone else into my heart, Mother?

419
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,080
Aigoo, poor girl...

420
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,880
Aigoo, poor girl...

421
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,540
Aigoo...

422
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,360
Aigoo, poor girl...

423
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,290
Still,

424
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,570
it's just that you don't know it,

425
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,760
but Cheol Woong also...

426
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,960
came from my womb.

427
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,640
From my womb...

428
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,320
But as soon as I gave birth to him, Doo Hak's father...

429
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,270
He took him

430
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,710
and gave him away.

431
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
If it has to do with that family,

432
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,320
he would not only offer up his child but his life.

433
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,290
So what would he not be able to do for them?

434
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,180
At that time, Doo Hak...

435
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,190
always lived giving things up for Cheol Woong.

436
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,780
I feel so bad for my son...

437
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,670
I should have stopped him with everything I had...

438
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,780
My poor child...

439
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,070
My poor child...

440
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,610
As I've heard, the steak is fantastic.

441
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,750
It's not much different from a first-class hotel in New York.

442
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,340
Thank you.

443
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,910
Honestly, I was a bit surprised when I heard you would dine with us, Chairman.

444
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,890
It doesn't seem like you would come here just to have some steak.

445
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,550
Would it be all right for me to ask what brought you here?

446
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,680
[Geum Man Cheol (Chairman of Changsung Group)]
As I had heard about you, you are quite direct.

447
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,570
Actually, the president of an affiliate company is heading into prosecution today.

448
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,690
She should have arrived at the prosecution about now.

449
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>That president is my youngest daughter.</i>

450
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,620
Oh, I see.

451
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,670
That child's company set up a slush fund with dollars

452
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,280
using its branch location in a foreign country.

453
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,980
<i>I don't know how they managed to get the information,</i>

454
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,060
<i>but the prosecution is investigating her for breaking the Foreign Exchange Control Act.</i>

455
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,980
I am Geum Yeon Hee of Changsung Fashion.

456
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,410
That slush fund was set up to increase company assets

457
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,280
by buying real estate in Japan.

458
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,120
Our family doesn't live that poor

459
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,010
to take that kind of money for our personal use.

460
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,260
- I see.
- As you know...

461
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,730
<i>But that prosecutor...</i>

462
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,820
Everything you say can and will be used against you in court.

463
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,090
You've amassed quite a bit in the fund you set up through your foreign branch.

464
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,380
According to this report,

465
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,060
it was for buying real estate in Japan, which is the trend among chaebols right now?

466
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,770
I'm not sure.

467
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,690
What if you end up being a latecomer?

468
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,740
- A latecomer?
- Yes.

469
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,360
What real estate in this world only increases in value?

470
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,460
What do you mean?

471
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,460
Real estate in Japan is number one in the world.

472
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,760
Haven't you heard that

473
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,660
even if you just sell land in Tokyo, you could buy the entire land of the U.S.?

474
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,670
I have heard of it.

475
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,550
That is why I am saying you should be more careful.

476
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,850
Enjoying abnormally good times

477
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,250
also means that if something goes awry,

478
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,420
it will be even easier for everything to collapse.

479
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,270
Instead of an investigation,

480
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,840
you are putting on a lecture.

481
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,580
<i>Please put in a good word to your son.</i>

482
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,210
He's not someone who listens to a request like that,

483
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,540
but since you are speaking to me like this,

484
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,290
I will try putting in a word to him.

485
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,840
You must study economics a lot.

486
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,260
They say that we are in an unprecedented economic boom,

487
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,170
but financial crimes are also unprecedentedly booming.

488
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,460
So I am studying hard.

489
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,810
I see.

490
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,780
<i>Honestly, the Japanese real estate investment</i>

491
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,150
<i>was what I had pushed for.</i>

492
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,700
<i>My daughter was actually against it.</i>

493
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,430
Then,

494
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,430
indict me...

495

Gosh, maybe if the last bus's tire goes flat. How else are we going to get on it?

659
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:38,098
That's why real estate is an intelligence battle.

660
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,208
Still, since you know a lot of information,

661
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,138
you must've gotten some land near the new town.

662
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:43,388
Aigoo.

663
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,168
The entire world knows once the government makes the announcement.

664
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:49,068
That's not really knowing information.

665
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:53,128
I couldn't even buy an inch, either.

666
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:56,028
So there's really nowhere else?

667
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,858
Oh, my goodness.

668
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,918
In my opinion, the lands near...

669
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:05,558
this  region has future potential.

670
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:08,678
The west coast?

671
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:13,308
Although reclamation and the west coast highway were announced,

672
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:15,168
there is just so much land,

673
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:18,638
so there must be some decent properties somewhere.

674
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:22,418
I want to recommend Pyeongtaek, first and foremost.

675
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,058
Once we start doing business with China,

676
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:27,358
I have a very realistic expectation that

677
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,228
the Pyeongtaek docks will get so much better.

678
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:32,948
That does sound true.

679
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,178
Well, then.

680
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,408
Let's combine our funds and

681
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,888
go look at some properties soon.

682
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:47,978
Are you worried I might scam you and run off?

683
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:49,958
No, that's not it...

684
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,638
In  that case...

685
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:56,268
will you trust me if I put my money in your bank account?

686
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,758
Why would you go that far?

687
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,618
I mean, if you do...

688
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:03,338
it does make things certain.

689
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:06,058
Let's do it, then.

690
00:40:08,808 --> 00:40:13,518
But just what do you owe Doo Hak to be going this far?

691
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:16,438
It's a long story to tell.

692
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:19,098
Let's take our time to talk about that.

693
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:22,158
Let's go and have a meal.

694
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,468
Nope.

695
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,808
They said to strike the iron while it's hot.

696
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,638
Let's go visit the sites.

697
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,988
We can just have a quick meal at the sites.

698
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,978
My goodness. Don't be like that.

699
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:34,398
Let's go to a nice restaurant and—

700
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,018
Gosh, Madam Heo!

701
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,718
My goodness.

702
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:42,628
My goodness, this is really crazy, huh?

703
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:44,478
The sea is now the land.

704
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,538
It's like the creation of the world.

705
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:47,848
Gosh, I told you.

706
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:51,898
It's the largest national land development project since the creation of our country.

707
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,398
If the west coast highway comes in after this,

708
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,028
earning a few times

709
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:58,548
of the capital is just child's play.

710
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:01,748
Gosh, what a nice view.

711
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:04,968
Oh, my. Oh, my!

712
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,368
Oh, my.

713
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,208
What's the matter?

714
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,498
Is she someone you know?

715
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:20,348
She's Cheol Woong's mother.

716
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:21,788
What?

717
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:23,898
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong's?

718
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,848
The wretched prosecutor?

719
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:31,688
Is this where I'll get the goose that lays golden eggs?

720
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,388
Yes, there is no mistake.

721
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,238
I investigated and confirmed it myself.

722
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:38,478
In that case, what do I need to do for you?

723
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:42,668
You just need to do as you have been doing.

724
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:47,698
Ten percent of the profit?

725
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:51,748
Team Captain Oh,

726
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:54,708
you are still just as greedy, huh?

727
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:58,038
Well...

728
00:41:58,038 --> 00:42:00,278
since I also have a few mouths to feed...

729
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:02,608
Okay, then.

730
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:05,308
That's a deal.

731
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,638
He's not wretched.

732
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,718
Anyhow, seeing how that woman showed up,

733
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:14,428
this land must be the jackpot.

734
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,138
- Take your time and eat.
- Yes.

735
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,508
Here.

736
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,978
Thank you every time.

737
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:08,188
And I'm sorry.

738
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:11,038
I've been waiting for you to contact me.

739
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:13,518
Please...

740
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:16,068
let's meet at least once a month...

741
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:19,588
or once every two months, even.

742
00:43:20,568 --> 00:43:24,098
You know I can't contact you regularly.

743
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,628
Also...

744
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:28,728
we're gathering our comrades again.

745
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:31,268
Everything will be a waste if I get caught.

746
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:32,768
I know it must be hard on you...

747
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,938
- but please hang in there a little longer.
- In that case,

748
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:36,278
I'll also join you.

749
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:38,288
I can't allow that.

750
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:41,218
If you get caught again, everyone will be in danger.

751
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,998
Please...

752
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:45,768
please stay with me, Oppa.

753
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:47,518
Jung Ok...

754
00:43:48,708 --> 00:44:01,678
♫ <i>If, in those pure eyes, the raindrops well up</i> ♫

755
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:14,008
♫ <i>That beautiful being is a person</i> ♫

756
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:18,878
Wh-What's the matter?

757
00:44:18,878 --> 00:44:21,368
I don't want to do it. Let's not.

758
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:24,548
Aren't we...

759
00:44:24,548 --> 00:44:26,608
in love with each other?

760
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,268
I do love you.

761
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:30,748
Then...

762
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:31,998
why?

763
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:35,958
I'm scared.

764
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:38,578
Later...

765
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:39,878
Later.

766
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:42,718
Jung Ok.

767
00:44:47,908 --> 00:44:58,208
♫ <i>If one embraces the wind in his passionate heart</i> ♫

768
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,778
I'm sorry, Oppa.

769
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:04,778
It's okay.

770
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:06,498
I'm really sorry.

771
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:09,908
Stay healthy.

772
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:31,938
Mother.

773
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,678
Oh, my, Jung Shin!

774
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:37,708
Did you get home safe that day?

775
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:41,738
I really said such a thing?

776
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,758
Yes.

777
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:44,498
That's what you clearly said.

778
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:47,078
That you gave birth to Cheol Woong.

779
00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:50,218
That makes no sense.

780
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:53,418
I've been losing it whenever I drink lately.

781
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,048
If I said such a thing...

782
00:45:55,048 --> 00:45:57,428
I must've really gone mad.

783
00:45:57,428 --> 00:46:00,228
It's all nonsense, so don't even worry about it.

784
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:02,358
You really didn't? You're sure, right?

785
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,308
I didn't. I really didn't!

786
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:09,108
It must be that I said such nonsense since Doo Hak and Cheol Woong

787
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,948
hung out together all the time.

788
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,488
I did.

789
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,178
Cheol Woong's my son.

790
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:28,508
Whom I gave birth to with my heart.

791
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:31,828
Gosh, Mother.

792
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:34,238
I was really shocked.

793
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,948
You're such a chicken.

794
00:46:35,948 --> 00:46:38,158
Aigoo, you're so funny.

795
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:39,848
And you went ahead and believed what I said?

796
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,778
I need to drink some water. My goodness.

797
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,488
You were shocked?

798
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:45,698
Welcome.

799
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:52,238
I even made a request to you, Madam.

800
00:46:52,238 --> 00:46:54,648
This is a bolt from the blue sky.

801
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,728
To lock her up like this...

802
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:58,288
Gosh.

803
00:46:58,288 --> 00:46:59,978
I heard the story on the way here.

804
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:04,418
I didn't even have time to talk to my son about it.

805
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,608
I'll go home and ask my husband

806
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:12,628
to put in a word to the prosecutor general.

807
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:17,318
Such levels of violations are always happening in chaebol corporations.

808
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:19,078
In fact...

809
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:21,258
I intended to let my daughter and

810
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,458
Prosecutor Choi see each other.

811
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,338
I heard your son, Prosecutor Choi, is competent and

812
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:30,008
full of potential.

813
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:35,448
As a father, I was trying to introduce her to a good man.

814
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:39,588
My daughter also was interested in Prosecutor Choi

815
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:40,878
after hearing about him,

816
00:47:40,878 --> 00:47:43,488
saying she'll try approaching him naturally.

817
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,688
That's why she voluntarily appeared for the summon.

818
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:49,778
I really didn't know you had such intentions.

819
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:52,368
I'll apologize in his place.

820
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:54,038
By the way...

821
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,768
according to the attorney who came back from meeting my daughter...

822
00:47:57,768 --> 00:48:00,028
Please tell Father.

823
00:48:02,988 --> 00:48:06,368
I chose him as my man.

824

He said my daughter took a liking to Prosecutor Choi.

825
00:48:11,128 --> 00:48:12,538
My goodness.

826
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:15,628
What does she like about a man who sent her to the detention center?

827
00:48:18,658 --> 00:48:22,288
Please tell Deputy Director to have her released on bail.

828
00:48:22,288 --> 00:48:23,748
After that...

829
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:27,318
let's have our families meet on the field.

830
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:29,598
The children's feelings are what matter.

831
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:33,178
What would it matter what the parents wish for?

832

Anyhow, please don't worry too much.

Regarding Changsung Group...

835
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:49,018
your information was very useful, Team Captain Oh.

836
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:52,948
Most groups would want to become in-laws with Deputy Director.

837
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:54,308
Especially...

838
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:55,768
groups like Changsung Group

839
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:57,558
that are having financial difficulties,

840
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,498
they can't help but be more eager.

841
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,428
On top of that, he only has daughters,

842
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:06,678
so he's dying to find decent sons-in-law.

843
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:09,618
Although CEO Keum Yeon Hui is a mistress's daughter...

844
00:49:09,618 --> 00:49:11,508
I'm aware of that.

845
00:49:14,878 --> 00:49:19,188
I know Chairman Keum cherishes and acknowledges her abilities the most.

846
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:20,878
Yes.

847
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,178
Although the group is having difficulties at the moment,

848
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:25,858
they rank 20th in the financial sector as a corporation.

849
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:30,648
Only if Changsung Group can become Cheol Woong's safety net,

850
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:34,238
he'll be able to harbor a grand dream in the future.

851
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:39,648
Anyhow, Cheol Woong must think they met in a natural coincidence.

852
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:43,628
Otherwise, he's sure to be negative about it, so be careful.

Prosecutor Choi's marriage talks?

862

who's madly in love, not my daughter.
