00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,809
(Episode 12)
Well, then.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,729
Shall we talk about business?

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,929
Tell me whatever it is that you want.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,189
Our government and I will
help in whatever way we can.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,179
I am already over 70 years old.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,339
I want to start a business
in my home country.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,519
That would not be difficult.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,439
Many foreign nationals are running
large businesses in South Korea.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,770
What kind of business do you want to do?

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,680
The business of buying
and selling companies.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,129
Also, we will bring
some seed money with us,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,310
but help me to get loans in South Korea.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,129
- I don't know if I can go that far–
- Oh, there are conditions to that, of course.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,709
First,

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,649
I will help connect you to the Kremlin.

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,139
And secondly,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,809
we will make sure to give you

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,880
30% of all profits we
earn, Deputy Director.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,230
I will report this to my superior
and make sure it happens.

21
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,500
Sounds good.

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,040
(Arrivals)

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,899
Great work.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,439
Well...

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,159
what did I do?

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,469
You did everything, Deputy Director.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,729
It was your idea to take the rice wine.

28
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,380
Thanks to you, everything worked out well.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,049
It's not necessarily that
you did anything spectacular.

30
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,869
It feels good just to have you

31
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,800
reliably by my side.

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,040
I will...

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,680
work to become a more reliable person.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,429
If we can establish diplomatic
relations with the U.S.S.R,

35
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,749
it will be recorded as a historical event.

36
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,110
Also, we will be compensated
handsomely for making it happen.

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,769
While you are here,

38
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,869
work hard to learn and grow your strength.

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,300
Okay.

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,089
I heard they are sending Ha Yeon first.

41
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,229
Why isn't he saying anything to us?

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,139
Maybe he's trying to keep using you here.

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,089
Hey, Sengyo. That look
in your eyes right now

44
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,289
isn't one you should have toward
the person who saved your life.

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,850
If he doesn't send me to
South Korea this time as well,

46
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,119
I will smash everything and set it on fire.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,319
Why would you drink my
alcohol without permission?

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,119
Aigoo, please start sharing a bit.

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,529
Are you going to take all your
money with you in your coffin?

50
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,189
You bastard!

51
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,220
I'm leaving, Sengyo!

52
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,330
Pour me a drink.

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,969
I heard you say that you
will smash everything

54
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,229
and set fire to this place if I
don't send you to South Korea.

55
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,849
I said it for you to hear.

56
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,399
Do you know how much money it cost
me to save you when you were dying

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,890

My entire body is battered and cut
up from fighting with the Yakuza.

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,959
I think with all that I went through,

63
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,319
shouldn't I instead receive compensation?

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,030
Gosh, you're so scary that
I can't keep you around.

How do you feel being born again?

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,229
Go to Seoul tomorrow

68
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,789
and go find Raccoon in Myeongdong.

69
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,240
He will give you operating funds.

70
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,690
You can take 10% of that
as your compensation.

71
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,730
Shouldn't I now start a
business in South Korea?

72
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,360
And you will be my manager there.

Here is the current information on
the companies the old man mentioned.

74

These are the opinions of reliable
economics research professors

75
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,579
and famous business analysts.

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,369
What about an analysis
of the state of politics?

77
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,459
- It's in the back of that.
- How much did it cost?

78
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,539
In total, it was

79
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,679
around 100 million won.

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,090
You bought me a newspaper
worth 100 million won.

81
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,039
Mr. Lee, we don't need to see the
superficial, prettied-up face of businesses.

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,899
We need a business analysis of
the internal state of companies.

83
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,609
Then,

84
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,599
who do we need to contact?

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,179
We need the files from
the NSA on businesses.

86
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,349
I can directly ask them for that.

87
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,679
We need the list of weak businesses analyzed
by the Financial Supervisory Service.

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,110
Make sure to obtain it
no matter what it takes.

89
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,059
- Really?
- Yes.

Chae Dong Pal says he contacted the
Kremlin's chief foreign affairs adviser.

91

You did really well.

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,099
But there are personal
requirements he's stated

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,199
and he will demand huge loans.

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,869
That's something we can work out in detail.

96
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,689
We just overcame a major obstacle.

97
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,689
Great job!

98
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,279

Hong Kong noir films are selling
really well in our country.

These are films that
haven't been imported yet.

were successful in Hong Kong.

- So are you going to accept my gift or not?

162
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,019
I mean,

163
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,639
well, if I accept it...

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,499
what do I need to do for you?

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,730
Don't push me away. That's all I need.

166
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,039
So you're going to accept it, right?

167
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,989
All right! For the success
of the Young Generation!

168
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,620
Cheers!

169
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,929
What are you doing? Hurry
up and raise your glass!

170
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,260
Cheers!

171
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,869
In any case, thanks a lot, Cheol Woong.

172
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,570
I've always been mean to you.

173
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,930
So you do know you've been mean to me!

174
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,619
So...

175
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,469
be nicer to me.

176
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,569
All right. I really want to be nice to you,

177
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,689
but you always keep
crossing the line like this!

178
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,879
Geez!

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,059
- Come here and get ready to get hit!
- That hurts! That really hurts!

180
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,129
- Does he know?
- Hey!

181
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,789
Who cares? What does
that have to do with you?

182
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,009
- Whoa, whoa... A mouse, a mouse...
- What is it!

183
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,250
Just kidding.

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
What are you doing!

185
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,510
Whoa, hey!

186
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,869
How could I not hit you!

187
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,270
Gosh, seriously!

188
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,079
I'm going.

189
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,409
Hey, Jung Shin.

190
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,999
I will be promoted soon.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,040
You need to buy me food
when I get my promotion!

192
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,449
(Hotel Rice Soup)

193
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,619
Yes, two intestines!

194
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,000
(Hotel Rice Soup)

195
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,809
Hey!

196
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,479
When are you going to take our order?

197
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,350
I will be right there!

198
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,699
All right, what can I get for you?

199
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,699
Our intestines and ribs are good.

200
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,210
- R-Ribs, please.
- Ribs for two?

201
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,229
Hey, Seon Woo, ribs for two!

202
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,400
Yes.

203
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,190
Hey, I bought this.

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,719
Yes, this is Hotel Rice Soup!

205
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,599
Who gave you permission
to do business here?

206
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
Just a moment.

207
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,660
Gosh, which bastard said that with no fear?

208
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,419
From now on, this restaurant

209
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,530
will come under my management, and
I'll need to collect payment for it.

(Hotel Rice Soup - Closed for the day)

221
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,529
Gosh, Heaven really helped you out.

222
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,890
Heaven did...

223
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,309
So what are you going to do now?

224
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,720
Hyungnim.

225
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,259
- Are you going to get revenge?
- Don't say such nonsense.

226
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,899
He barely managed to survive.

227
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,209
Doo Hak.

228
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,629
I'm happy with you just being alive.

229
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,319
Do not even think about getting revenge.

230
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,389
You know very well that we
can't handle those people.

231
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,539
It's like trying to break
open a boulder with an egg.

232
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,470
Just forget it all, and let's live at ease.

233
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,529
I want to live at ease,

234
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,499
but in my current situation, how could I?

235
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,950
I'm already thought to be dead.

236
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,459
If they find out I'm alive,
they will try to kill me again.

237
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,299
If I want to live at ease,

238
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,969
I need to put everything
back in its original place.

239
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,089
Original place?

240
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,429
Where my father, my mother,
and Jung Ok were with me,

241
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,879
and where Jung Shin was next to me.

242
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,879
Hey, you bastard. Is that even possible?

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,729
- Your father has already passed away...
- I will need to try my best to get there.

244
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,570
That is revenge!

245
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,790
We can't handle those guys.

246
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,040
All right.

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,140
Right now, I am the egg.

248
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,760
If I try to smash a boulder with an
egg, that would be stupid. But...

249
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,979
wouldn't things be different
if I became the boulder?

250
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,439
Not only that,

251
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,989
I can see them,

252
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,409
but they can't see me.

253
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,809
You are nothing but a thug.

254
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,480
How can you become a boulder?

255
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,800
By using the thug way.

256
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,470
Please help me.

Yes, that is right.

Korea to do some business.

any businesses I could take over.

Excuse me?

264

sent me here wants to know.

They're not bouncers
but Managing Directors.

all the guys who are split up.

300
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,349
It's not okay.

301
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,169
Yeah, I'm afraid something might happen.

302
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,679
Let's turn the car around.

303

I'm turning the car around.
I will really turn it around!

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,329
It's not okay.

305
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,359
It's actually easy.

306
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,460
It's easy?

307
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,399
Just think about why we fought.

308
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,060
Then it becomes easy.

309
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,540

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,800

Let go of me! Let go!

325
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh, perfect.

326
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,500
You traitorous bastard.

327
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,689
It's nice to see you here today.

328
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,149
Let's both die here today!

329
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,829
- Hyungnim...
- Hyungnim?

330
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,520
Damn you, you bastard!

331
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,909
You just wait a bit.

332
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,710
I'll see you after I introduce
him to the king of the underworld.

333
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,229
You f♪♪♪ing bastard!

334
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,480
You!

335
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,239
Whenever I think about you,

336
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,959
I even wake up at night while I'm sleeping!

337
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,029
I'm sorry...

338
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,560
You!

339
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,139
Die!

340
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,630
You guys should stop.

341
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,580
Hey!

342
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Don't stop me!

343
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,400
Damn it, I'm bleeding...

344
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,959
I won't explain in detail

345
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,239
how I came to be here. It's a long story.

346
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,739
Do you know how upset I was
when I heard that you were dead?

347
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,899
Thanks for being alive.

348
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,749
Now I can chew you up and kill you myself.

349
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,639
Shut your mouth before I rip it apart.

350
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,959
I'll be the one to cleanly skin
your flesh from your bones.

351
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,139
So just wait.

352
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,939
Hyungnim, that was all
this bastard's doing!

353
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,579
Shut it!

354
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,850
Hey.

355
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,210
200 million won in cash,

356
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,230
and 300 million won in checks.

357
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
Each briefcase with 500 million won.

358
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,649
Let's not argue about our good or bad past.

359
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,899
In the end, it's not
because we hate anyone,

360
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,699
but it's because of our greed, isn't it?

361
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,700
There is a bit of hatred for
someone that does come into play.

362
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,369
Young Pil, you have a reputation
for being a drug dealer

363
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,869
and the state of your leg
would make it difficult for you

364
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,830
to go back to being the
boss of a gang, Hyungnim.

365
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,379
So,

366
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,220
how about doing business with me?

367
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,519
If you open up gambling houses
with this 500 million won,

368
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,909
you can probably open ten houses.

369
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,849
The profits will be split at 5:5.

370
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,040
Any houses that you make
after that will be split 6:4.

371
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,220
So...

372
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,369
call?

373
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,770
Or fold?

374
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,609
Geez...

375
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,040
Call.

376
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,979
Then we are now

377
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,309
business partners?

378
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,429
Yes.

379
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,509
That's right.

380
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,490
Like all of us

381
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,370
together like this?

382
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,100
Yes. Here.

383
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,780
Then, before we become business partners,

384
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,589
let me just beat up this f♪♪♪ing bastard

385
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,269
with just a hundred blows!

386
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,990
Actually, just ten punches.

387
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,039
Doo Hak...

388
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,569
Please hold Hyungnim back.

389
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,619
In the past, he used to do boxing!

390
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,339
I'll die even if it's just ten punches!

391
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,469
- After what you've done to me...
- I'm sorry!

392
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,469
- Doo Hak, seriously!
- You still have nine more punches!

393
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,889
You deserve to die!

394
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,209
You bastard!

395
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,539
At this rate, one of our
business partners will die.

396
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,759
You bastard!

397
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,769
It's all right. Young Pil is strong.

398
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,179
It's past 13.

399
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,519
That was 15 punches!

400
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,309
One more!

401
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,139
Die, die, die!

402
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,889
Hey, Doo Hak...

403
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,339
Please stop him!

404
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,499
I'll really die!

405
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,399
Young Pil was just like that.

406
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,759
- That's what I'm saying!
- Doo Hak.

407
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,749
This is the state of politics
analysis report you asked for.

408
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,469
After the three parties merged,
the terrain became complicated.

409
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,099
It was such an unexpected event

410
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,329
that even the people are dumbfounded.

411
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,159
Great work.

412
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,659
From now on, keep using all your
connections through your school

413
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,929
and maintain relationships with them.

414
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,419
And don't worry about the money.

415
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,359
Don't worry. If I buy them drinks and give
them an envelope, they take it so naturally.

416
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,979
Among my alums, they know me as a Chairman
Kim, who became very successful in the U.S.

417
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,879
Thanks a lot! Thanks to you,
I even got the title of chairman.

418
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,419
Wow!

419
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,639
You actually graduated from
Seoul National University?

420
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,049
Seoul National University!

421
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,639
Wow!

422
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,909
I dropped out.

423
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,739
Regardless, I am friends with someone
who went to Seoul National University!

424
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,080
Wow, it's such an honor!

425
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,779
Hey, we are all ex-convicts who graduated
from elementary school♪. (Slang for prison)

426
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,190
That's true.

427
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,059
You're right.

428
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,089
Hyung, make sure to manage the house well.

429
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,189
That is our source of strength.

430
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,819
Gosh, you know I am like a Seoul National
University graduate in that field.

431
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,830
Don't you worry.

432
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,319
Oh, right. What about Seon Woo?

433
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,939
I got a phone call from him earlier.

434
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,499
He's been staking out undercover
for the past few days,

435
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,120
but he hasn't shown up.

436
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,749
But...

437
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,309
when are you going to meet Jung Shin?

438
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,479
Hey, yeah.

439
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,300
She should have been the
first person you met.

440
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,260
I should meet her.

441
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,420
When I'm ready.

442
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's have a shot together.

443
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,930
(Paris Salon)

444
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,770
They're waiting for you.

445
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,180
You made it.

446
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,849
Mother, didn't you say you had
something to talk to me about?

447
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,960
That's right. Let's first say hello.

448
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,999
You would know President
Geum Yeon Hee already.

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,289
This is her father, Chairman Geum Man Cheol

450
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,269
of Changsung Group, the 20th
wealthiest man in the country.

451
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,429
Aigoo, it's nice to meet you, Prosecutor.

452
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,509
I really wanted to meet you.

453
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,399
It's nice to meet you, Chairman.

454
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
We meet again.

455
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,210
Thanks to you, I donated bail
money to the country and got out.

456
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,899
How could you be so inflexible?

457
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,169
She even voluntarily went
in for the questioning.

458
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,879
- Apologize to her right now.
- What do you mean, apologize?

459
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,959
He just followed the protocol.

460
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,369
That's right.

461
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,809
You had such a strong spirit.

462
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,570
Are you being sarcastic?

463
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,339
Do you think I came out to see
someone I want to be sarcastic with?

464
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,879
Even if it's not for an apology,

465
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,209
I came to be treated to a meal

466
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,839
since I was in quite a bind because of you.

467
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,639
You can buy it for me, right?

468
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,390
Please take a seat.

469
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,779
I sometimes go golfing with Chairman Geum.

470
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,399
After I heard what happened with
President Geum Yeon Hee, I was so shocked

471
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,369
that I invited them to a meal.

472
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,399
It's an honor to meet you.

473
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,880
Please eat.

474
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,239
Although the elders are here,

475
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,670
I felt like I should say this to you.

476
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,989
Please forgive me.

477
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,099
Go ahead.

478
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,389
Last time, since Prosecutor
Choi had me confined,

479
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,400
this time, I want to confine him.

480
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,199
Prosecutor Choi.

481
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,300
How about you go out with me?

482
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,629
Cheol Woong needs to feel like
they met naturally, by chance.

483
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,639
Otherwise, he will respond
negatively, so be careful.

484
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,060
Of course.

485
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,030
Hey, kid. Your elders are present.

486
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,409
You're joking...

487
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,929
President Geum, you have a
knack for toying with people.

488
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,029
I'm not joking.

489
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,049
It's not a joke?

490
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,809
I see...

491
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,670
I'll give you my answer.

492
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm seeing someone already.

493
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,039
- Cheol Woong.
- You would've known with a bit of research on me.

494
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,649
My father told me

495
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,439
that reading people is the
first step to gaining intel.

496
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,439
That means if you can't read people,

497
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,840
you don't deserve to work in intel.

498
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,730
I will be on my way.

499
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,210
Cheol Woong.

500
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,030
Please have some tea.

501
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,210
What are you doing?
Greet the bank president.

502
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,639
Hello, my name is Oh Jung Shin.

503
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,789
Oh, yes. It's nice to meet you.

504
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,969
- But what brings you here?
- Bank President.

505
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,809
Do you like movies?

506
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,609
Oh, movies? Of course.

507
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,189
Yes, I like them a lot.

508
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,659
Oh, really?

509
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,169
She is a CEO of a film
studio that I can vouch for.

510
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,800
Can I ask you to provide her with a loan?

511
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,379
Oh, of course.

512
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,140
I'll provide you a loan
in excellent condition.

513
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,919
Yes. Thank you.

514
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,850
I look forward to working with you.

515
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,129
Thank you so much, Cheol Woong.

516
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,029
Gosh, finally, you're brightening up.

517
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,009
How nice is it now that you're smiling!

518
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,889
You should relax a bit and live, Jung Shin.

519
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,440
But until the profits and the score
for the movie comes out, I can't relax.

520
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,310
Still, today is a good
day for various reasons,

521
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,099
so shouldn't you buy me a drink?

522
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,470
I should. Let's go somewhere nice.

523
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,860
Really?

524
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,399
Gosh, gosh. This really makes me so angry!

525
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,230
Here. Drink some water.

526
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,949
I mean, even if they love money that much,

527
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,889
people shouldn't be like this!

528
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,179
Does it make any sense that they ask for
twice the amount that we agreed upon?

529
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,839
Even though I've worked in
real estate my entire life,

530
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,329
and yet this is the first time
I'm seeing someone so evil!

531
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,029
They asked for double the money?

532
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,199
Yes, that's right!

533
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,420
It appears that people are clamoring
to buy it like a pack of dogs.

534
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,049
Wouldn't it be good to
still buy it at that price?

535
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,619
Seeing how everyone's
clamoring about buying it,

536
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,339
is it only a matter of time before it
increases to three or four times its value?

537
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,899
The thing about that is

538
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,049
if we buy it at the original price, we could
profit from just waiting three or four years,

539
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,979
but if we buy it at the double that price,

540
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,119
we wouldn't profit much even
after three or four years.

541
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,699
Not only that, if the government
changes to a different administration,

542
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,079
we don't know what might happen, then.

543
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,029
Real estate is fickle like that.

544
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,959
Gosh, seriously.

545
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,709
Goodness.

546
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,960
Damn it!

547
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,119
Then, what should we do?

548
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,349
What do you mean what should we do?

549
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,429
We don't even have the money
to pay them the doubled price.

550
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,019
We should just think

551
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,439
that land wasn't meant to be ours.

552
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,869
Gosh, we should have just given
them the down payment right away.

553
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,239
All because we pushed back the date
so we could get more interest...

554
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,779
Since this is so aggravating,
we should close up early today

555
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,639
and go somewhere for some cold draft beer.

556
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,869
- Mother.
- Oh, my! Oh, Jung Shin!

557
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,999
Cheol Woong! Aigoo!

558
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,899
Oh, have you been well?

559
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,539
What brings you guys here?

560
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,309
Something good happened to me, so I
came to treat you to something tasty.

561
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,599
Aigoo, it just so happens that
I wasn't in a good mood today,

562
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,489
so I was going to close up
early today and go home.

563
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,399
I'm glad you came! So glad you're here!

564
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,699
Just wait a little bit.

565
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,499
I will hurry up and come
back out with my bag.

566
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,519
Hold on just a bit!

567
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,360
Just wait here a bit.

568
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,419
This was the nice place you talked about?

569
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,799
Why? You don't like it?

570
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,629
You haven't seen her in
a while, either, right?

571
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,759
That's true.

572
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,320
I like it.

573
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,510
I thought it was going to be just us.

574
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,959
Here. Have a bite of this.

575
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,410
- Aigoo, it's okay, Mother. You should eat.
- Say ah.

576
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,150
Come on, my arm's about to fall off!

577
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,820
Delicious, right?

578
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,709
Mother, me, too.

579
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,830
Sure, sure. All right.

580
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,760
Say ah.

581
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,299
Aigoo, aigoo.

582
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,069
Gosh.

583
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,670
It's so delicious.

584
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,959
Geez, are they the only ones with mouths?
Mine counts as a piehole?

585
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,269
Oh, my.

586
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,049
Do you not have hands or eyes?

587
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,899
You can help yourself all you want.

588
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,469
Right...

589
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,100
with this...

590
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,700
Oh, my. It's so nice to see a good-looking
man and a woman sitting next to each other.

591
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,869
You two are old enough and
look so great together.

592
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,590
It'd be great if you
could just live together.

593
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,139
- Should we?
- Aigoo.

594
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,109
My goodness, seriously.
They'll choke on their food.

595
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,559
Why are you saying that stuff?

596
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,509
My, are you okay?

597
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,980
- Aigoo.
- Mother, please!

598
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,270
Cheers!

599
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,090
Oh, we're here, huh?

600
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,130
Go inside and rest up. You look tired.

601
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,469
Why?

602
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,839
What's wrong?

603
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,799
Is there something on my face?

604
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,260
Nothing.

605
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,549
Even when I know your feelings...

606
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,709
I get help from you like this.

607
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,290
I think I'm a terrible
girl for doing this to you.

608
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,830
If you're that sorry, you can date me.

609
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,299
Strangely, no matter how
pretty or rich they're,

610
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,030
I couldn't be satisfied unless it's you.

611
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,469
Just now...

612
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,910
I went back to our Yeosu days in my dream.

613
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,459
Say, do you remember when we jumped

614
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,470
into the ocean way at the end
of summer and had a water fight?

615
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,570
Of course, I remember.

616
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,119
The water was so cold

617
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,729
so we came out as soon as we went in.

618
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,620
Screaming that it's cold.

619
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,099
But then...

620
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,030
you dragged me back into that cold water.

621
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:55,710
♫ Somebody please tell me now,
what am I supposed to do? ♫

622
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,829
Honestly, I was also chilled to the bone.

623
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,049
But since I was with Doo Hak and you...

624
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,719
I got the courage from somewhere

625
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,939
and felt like I could endure
that cold ocean water.

626
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,919
♫ Must have been fallen,
must have been done ♫

627
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,079
♫ Darling, it's all in your mind ♫

628
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,089
You're that kind of a person to me.

629
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,979
♫ I'll really come back ♫

630
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,899
Like a precious memory.

631
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,829
♫ Have me back and hear me ♫

632
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,089
A friend who helps me
endure each and every single

633
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,240
tiresome day, no matter how tough.

634
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,379
Like today.

635
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,089
♫ For the rhythm ♫

636
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,219
I don't want to...

637
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,179
lose that precious memory, Cheol Woong.

638
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,140
♫ And start to listen, and
suddenly it's the dark and ♫

639
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,470
Jung Shin...

640
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,539
Thank you for dropping me off.

641
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,909
I'll be going now.

642
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,519
♫ They charge for the darkness
and dart for the rhythm ♫

643
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,739
♫ Will you save me now? I
don't know what to do with me ♫

644
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,719
♫ I don't like the darkness,
but we don't have to trust it ♫

645
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,029
♫ Nobody knows ♫

646
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:11,880
♫ Nobody knows, the pain ♫

647
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,819
♫ That I have ♫

648
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,060
♫ How can you? ♫

649
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,040
Mother...

650
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,449
You're coming home now?

651
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,160
Please stop it now.

652
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,299
You should be the one to stop it now.

653
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,430
Jung Shin won't be of any help to you.

654
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,049
Mother, please.

655
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,749
What about how my life has been?

656
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,419
I did anything if it was for you.

657
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,189
I did in the past, and I'll be the
same in the future, too. But you...

658
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,359
can't even give up this much for your mom?

659
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,289
She was even engaged to Doo Hak.

660
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,729
Doesn't that even bother you?

661
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,700
Why should I be bothered?

662
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,620
Did I kill Doo Hak hyung or something?

663
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,480
Doo Hak's mother told me to marry Jung
Shin, saying we look great together.

664
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,839
You met Doo Hak's mother?

665
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,599
Yes!

666
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,779
I visited her with Jung Shin

667
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,019
and we had dinner together.

668
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,440
Even when you knew...

669
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,859
how much I hate you meeting that woman?

670
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,999
Mom...

671
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,899
you know what Ahjussi and
Ahjumma did for our family.

672
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,829
Why do you hate her so much?

673
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,159
Doo Hak hyung even served a
prison sentence in my place-

674
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,459
Talk to me.

675
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,869
Stay here and talk to me, Mom!

676
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,499
Let go! Let go!

677
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,079
You're not even my son anymore.

678
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,900
- Cut it out!
- Let go!

679
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,609
Your mother gave birth
to you and raised you.

680
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,799
So, she must have a deeper
level of affection for you

681
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,690
than me, who got to meet you a lot later.

682
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,029
I told you I respect your opinion,

683
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,779
but you must understand your mother.

684
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,409
That woman...

685
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,599
really did anything

686
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,199
if it was for you and...

687
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,410
she'll be the same in the future, too.

688
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,689
If you and I were drowning and
only one of us could be saved,

689
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,549
your mother...

690
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,629
won't hesitate for even a moment and

691
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,509
throw the rescue tube at you.

692
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,450
Father, but that's not
the point of this matter.

693
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,000
Unless you can convince her first,

694
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,799
you'll have to put aside
your feelings for Jung Shin.

695
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
Father...

696
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,769
There are a lot of things
you need to do in the future.

697
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,670
Great things, on top of that.

698
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,030
Don't take too long with this.

699
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,840
Chairman Geum of Changsung
had called me earlier.

700
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,559
I heard there was an awkward situation.

701
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,380
So he'll come to visit me next time.

702
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:39,679
A chaebol chairman's daughter
asked Cheol Woong out.

703
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,769
It's Changsung we're talking about.

704
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,679
It's not a small or medium-sized
corporation. It's Changsung.

705
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,330
But then he said–

706
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,129
He said he likes someone else because
he's head over heels for Jung Shin.

707
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,870
How insulted and furious
must those two have felt?

708
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,980
He asked me to tell you
he'll visit you tomorrow.

709
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,699
For what business?

710
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,709
I don't know about that.

711
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,440
But he didn't seem all too angry.

712
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,239
Madam, I heard you're
interested in real estate.

713
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,589
Do you want to do business with me?

714
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,539
How could I dare to do
business with someone like you?

715
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,699
I'm only running a mom-and-pop
store-level business for retirement.

716
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,099
Exactly.

717
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,700
I'm telling you to expand it to
like a big supermarket level.

718
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,639
Do you have a good business item in hand?

719
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,349
You're aware of Housing Site Development

720
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,939
at Sooseo District, one of
the First New Towns, right?

721
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,309
Yes.

722
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,389
But I thought the government was supplying
that region to the non-homeowners.

723
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,689
Yes, that's true.

724
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,969
However...

725
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,579
people within the Ministry of
Economy, Seoul Regional Tax Office,

726
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,669
a news agency and even the military,

727
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,809
who have the power created a union

728
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,879
to lobby so that their
families can also receive

729
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,740
the special presale rights.

730
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,629
Even so, will the Ministry
of Works or Seoul city

731
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,059
accept their requests?

732
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,399
I'm Geum Man Cheol, am I not?

733
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,959
Am I not the one who came up thus far by erasing
the word "impossible" in my dictionary?

734
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,169
I have already met with
those special unions.

735
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,239
It was agreed that I'll secure about
11.5 hectares of the Sooseo District's

736
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,109
housing sites and give it
to them as a special supply.

737
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,659
Will that be possible?

738
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,470
It's possible.

739
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,889
But the problem is purchasing the land.

740
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,620
My company can't buy them in our name.

741
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,240
We need to buy them under a borrowed name.

742
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,379
Will you be able to do that for me?

743
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,089
If...

744
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,149
special presales happen...

745
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,769
how much will the gross profit be?

746
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,829
It'll be at least...

747
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,740
100 billion won.

748
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,900
Here's the map.

749
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,789
All right. Take a look here.

750
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,759
It's this side.

751
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,909
11.5 hectares.

752
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,580
Golden egg.

753
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,500
Sorry?

754
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,669
You want to postpone the purchase of
the west coast reclamation property?

755
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,839
Yes.

756
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,409
I thought about it a little bit.

757
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,030
But I think that will
take a little too long.

758
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,530
Filling in the ocean will take
more than a couple of years, right?

759
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,589
It's a little far from Seoul and

760
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,320
I think it'll take forever
to recover the principal.

761
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,279
But I have already...

762
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,869
given my word to many people.

763
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,490
It's not like you wrote a contract.

764
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,830
Could it be you...

765
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,569
received a different proposal?

766
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,679
Not at all. I'm just
saying let's take our time.

767
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,630
I'm sorry, Team Captain Oh.

768
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,020
Why?

769
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,680
Is something wrong?

770
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,890
It's nothing.

771
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,250
I understand.

772
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,350
(Paris Salon)

773
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,449
After all the work I put
in for preparation...

774
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,150
Is she kidding me?

775
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,440
(The best joy for our customers!
Jade Club Pachinko.)

776
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,319
Is this Chairman Joo of Kyeongsung Hotel?

777
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm Team Captain Oh, who
oversees corporations at Namsan.

778
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,840
(NSA Deputy Director's Special
Aide, Choi Cheol Woong)

779
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,729
He went around and collected
bribes from every pachinko place.

780
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,749
I confirmed it personally
with the business owners.

781
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,100
He probably got more than a
billion won in bribes already.

782
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,969
Fire him right away and

783
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,820
arrest him for investigation.

784
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,039
Must you go that far?

785
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,989
He went through a lot of trouble
working for me for a long time.

786
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,729
That's why he can't be forgiven.

787
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,399
Because he...

788
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,299
disgraced your reputation.

789
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,429
Because you seemed to
dislike Team Captain Oh...

790
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,709
I even left him out of
my trip intentionally.

791
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,459
And also...

792
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,849
he seems to be serving your mom well.

793
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,789
I think you're being too harsh.

794
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,789
That's only...

795
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,419
a part of Team Captain Oh's
social politics, isn't it?

796
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,660
Why don't you realize
that, Deputy Director?

797
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,569
- Is it because of your grudge from the past?
- Deputy Director!

798
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,900
He apologized and sought your forgiveness.

799
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,839
I'll make sure to give
him a strict warning.

800
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,609
Please look the other way
for your father this time.

801
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,290
I request of you.

802
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,549
Although you asked for his forgiveness,

803
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,719
Cheol Woong probably can't forget

804
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,729
that easily because he
still has the trauma.

805
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,909
I'm sorry, but I'll need you to understand.

806
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,809
It probably can't be
helped but be uncomfortable

807
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,571
for both of you to run into each
other while Prosecutor Choi is here.

808
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,579
Why don't you take this
chance to get a break

809
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,390
and stay at a branch abroad temporarily?

810
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,369
Deputy Director...

811
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,319
I have no other intentions.

812
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,530
I can just call you over again.

813
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,770
Can't you just...

814
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,680
Please send me to a regional office, then.

815
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,109
My father is ill...

816
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,720
so I don't know when he may pass.

817
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,089
Okay, then.

818
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,680
Think about it and tell
me where you want to go.

819
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,900
Nice!

820
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,989
Gosh.

821
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,189
- 50!
- 50?

822
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,290
- No way!
- Gosh.

823
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,870
Be careful around here.

824
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,459
- Wolf!
- Whoa!

825
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,249
You're here, Hyungnim?

826
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,929
Oh, you're here?

827
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,030
Yes, I'm here, Hyungnim.

828
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,329
Wow, it's not even the weekend today.

829
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,859
Looks like you'll get some money in today.

830
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,239
Since when did gamblers
care about day and night

831
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,549
or weekend and weekday?

832
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,289
Nowadays, more people come on weekdays,
saying it's too crowded on weekends.

833
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,509
That's 100.

834
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,680
Oh, okay.

835
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,249
Aigoo.

836
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,119
Thanks for the work, Hyungnim.

837
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,339
Gil Su, how's Young Pil's house going?

838
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,359
It's more or less the same as this place.

839
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,739
But you're still the one who makes more.

840
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,159
That wretched bastard.

841
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,489
He might be stealing money here and there.

842
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,699
Make sure to keep him in check.

843
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,759
He's the lowest of the lows, all right?

844
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,479
I'm double and triple checking him.

845
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,700
All right, then.

846
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,399
- I'll be going, Hyungnim.
- Okay, take care.

847
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,649
Right, Gil Su!

848
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,269
Tell Doo Hak to come visit sometime.

849
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,579
To have some soju and intestine soup.

850
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,250
- I'll tell him that, Hyungnim.
- Yes, take care.

851
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,130
- This is for the tip.
- Gosh, that punk. Take it!

852
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,410
Hello.

853
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,450
Hyungnims!

854
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,470
He came in an hour ago.

855
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,029
Hyungnim.

856
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,250
It's this room.

857
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,419
Hey, Lee Yong Deuk.

858
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,669
Yong Deuk!

859
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,140
Get yourself together.

860
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,709
This punk is drugged to the brains.

861
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,040
Hey!

862
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,300
Are you awake?

863
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,729
- Who are you?
- Can't you tell at first glance?

864
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,349
It's the Grim Reaper.

865
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,910
I see...

866
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,399
I didn't do anything wrong, though.

867
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,409
Why did you go in and out of prison that
much if you never did anything wrong?

868
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,499
You killed a person...

869
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,830
four years ago, by a
hit-and-run, didn't you?

870
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,400
Who ordered the hit-and-run?

871
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,089
I didn't kill anyone.

872
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,819
I don't know.

873
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,369
- Come clean, you bastard.
- I really don't know.

874
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,829
I really don't know anything.

875
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,740
You bastard, do you want to
get buried in the mountains?

876
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,620
Listen carefully, Lee Yong Deuk.

877
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,939
I can kill you at any given moment.

878
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,490
Kill me.

879
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,279
No.

880
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,869
You'll die soon even if
I don't kill you. But...

881
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:50,099
if you come clean about everything,

882
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,350
I'll give you money to buy drugs you love.

883
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,129
Please give it to me.

884
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,969
You have to talk first.

885
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,589
I know you won't give me
anything even after I talk!

886
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,229
You bastard!

887
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,610
Shit.

888
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,519
Thank you.

889
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,849
Th-Thank you.

890
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,229
Drug prices have gone up lately,

891
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,030
so you'll only last a few days with that.

892
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,960
I have one more bundle here.

893
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,910
Come clean.

894
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,830
Who ordered the hit-and-run?

895
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,230
Y-You see...

896
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,459
Well,

897
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,630
you see...

898
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,779
That's enough.

899
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,330
You've had enough.

900
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,980
Just let me drink in peace today!

901
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:00,210
It's because I'm sorry.

902
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,840
I feel sorry for my father.

903
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,439
Hello, this is Rich Real Estate.

904
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Are you President Go Poong Ho?

905
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,600
Yes, it is.

906
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,649
There's a decent property.

907
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,580
Do you want to pluck some eyeballs with me?

908
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,219
What bullshit are you spewing?

909
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,220
I don't know anything like that.

910
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,629
Oh, come on.

911
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,179
I called, knowing everything.

912
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,729
Who are you, punk?

913
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,090
I'm going to pluck your eyeballs out.

914
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,779
Why don't you come and try?

915
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,839
Where the hell are you? Huh?

916
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,380
Public phone?

917
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,500
This little...

918
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,460
You're dead now.

919
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,270
My goodness.

920
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,140
Are you the one who wants
his eyeballs plucked?

921
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,609
Let's talk after I finish this ramen.

922
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:48,579
How can you eat ramen
right now, you asshole?

923
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,540
I'll pluck your eyeballs out.

924
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,689
Oh, shoot!

925
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,619
Who's this?

926
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,489
A-Am I looking at a ghost?

927
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,739
Are there ghosts who eat ramen?

928
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,339
- Doo Hak!
- Hyungnim!

929
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,929
Oh, shoot! Doo Hak!

930
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,329
My goodness!

931
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,199
Oh, gosh! Doo Hak, you were alive!

932
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,409
Oh, gosh!

933
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,479
- You're in good health, right?
- Of course, I am.

934
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,369
Hold on. Let me get a look at you.

935
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,959
Gosh, you became handsome.

936
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,199
- My goodness, seriously.
- You look good!

937
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,219
Aigoo.

938
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,100
What?

939
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:24,799
So you're telling me to identify all
of Choi Cheol Woong's real estate?

940
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,119
- Yes.
- What are you planning?

941
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,519
You're really going to
pluck his eyeballs out?

942
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,719
Don't you even dare.

943
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,219
You've got to look before you leap.

944
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,129
I know, too.

945
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,680
Just identify them for now.

946
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,990
Then I'll need to gather the team again.

947
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,359
All right.

948
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,399
Let's go.

949
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,879
You should go and greet your mother.

950
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,489
Your mother's going to die of shock!

951
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,819
My goodness.

952
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,039
I still have things to take care of.

953
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,299
Please keep it a secret for now.

954
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,389
But she's still your mom.

955
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,959
I'm sure you can keep it a secret.

956
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,500
But my mother won't be able to
hide the fact that I'm alive.

957
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,550
I have to remain...

958
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,419
a dead person to those people.

959
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,840
My goodness, this is really f♪♪♪ed up.

960
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,830
My, what a nice car.

961
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,800
What's that?

962
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,479
Oh, shoot.

963
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,849
Okay. Sure, yes-

964
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,900
Oh, my, Madam! What brings
you all the way here?

965
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,180
I told you not to meet
my Cheol Woong, didn't I?

966
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,620
I think I also paid you the price.

967
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,319
Wait, Madam, that's not it.

968
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,489
Th-They came to me and asked to eat...

969
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,180
Even if they come, you should avoid them.

970
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,930
This is the last warning.

971
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,580
If you meet Cheol Woong again,

972
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,230
you better be prepared to lose everything.

973
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,289
You know...

974
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,859
I'm capable of doing that...

975
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,320
right?

976
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,850
My goodness. Are you okay?

977
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,099
You're coming now?

978
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,230
That woman is Choi Cheol
Woong's mother, right?

979
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,909
Her son gets his wicked personality from

980
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,199
his mother, doesn't he?

981
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,849
He doesn't!

982
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,580
Cheol Woong isn't wicked.

983
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,599
What do you mean he isn't wicked?

984
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,929
Choi Cheol Woong, who harasses Doo Hak, and

985
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,079
his mother, who harasses
you, have the same feathers.

986
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,350
Since he knows all of
this, Doo Hak is going to-

987
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,020
S-Sorry?

988
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,469
I mean...

989
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,350
I'm sure the pain relieving
patch is here somewhere.

990
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,579
Hello, this is Young
Generation Film Studio.

991
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,229
Oh, yes. That's right.
We have a long waitlist.

992
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,789
- "City on Fire"?
- Just a moment.

993
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,459
Yes, Donald Chow is the main actor.

994
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,859
Yes, hello?

995
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,639
Yes, yes. This is Young Generation.

996
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,429
Yes, Donald Chow is the main actor.

997
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,719
That's set for next week.

998
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,209
All right. Thank you.

999
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,889
Sorry to make you wait.

1000
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,569
I'm glad you're here! Come over here.
Hurry, hurry.

1001
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:54,390
Yes, yes, yes.

1002
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,330
Where do I put them?

1003
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,899
Oh, yes. That's correct.

1004
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,829
Yes, I'm checking right now-

1005
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,679
- Hey, can you answer this?
- Wh-What do I say?

1006
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,439
Say it's Young Generation! Hurry.

1007
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,659
Yes, this is Young Generation Film Studio.

1008
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,319
Thank you. Yes.

1009

1020
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,720
Jung Shin.

1021
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,180
Jung Shin!

1022
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,290
I don't think I drank that much today.

1023
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,650
Who are you?

1024
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,550
I said, who are you?

1025

It's me.

I must really...

1027
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,180
miss him a lot.

1028
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,050

1049

(Oasis)

1050
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,349
I found him.

1051
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,499
The person who did hit-and-run?

1052
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,509
No, the one who ordered the murder.

1053
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:33,489
It looks like a report from
a business owner in Busan.

1054
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,389
Should we notify him?

1055
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,629
The murder case that
changed my life in Yeosu...

1056
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,399
You all agreed to partake in the revenge?

1057
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,349
But you should quit. Things will never
go back to the way they were anyway.

1058
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,549
Are you worried for Cheol Woong right now?

1059
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:49,170
Everyone has a Pandora's Box in
his heart that no one should open.

1060
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,700
Or someone closest to you had
killed a decisive witness.

1061
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,219
Stop speaking nonsense!

1062
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,419
I guess this is it, huh?

1063
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,759
- I'm-
- Don't be like that.

1064
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,419
- Auntie!
- Why are you so surprised?

1065
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,959
I thought you had cut ties with me.

1066
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,009
Oh Man Ok? That bastard
carries a gun around.

1067
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,929
Look who I am talking to here.

1068
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:08,600
How would it feel to get
killed with your own gun?
