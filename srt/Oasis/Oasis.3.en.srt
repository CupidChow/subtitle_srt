00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,430
Aunt, Uncle!

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,400
You'd better not forget your promise.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,360
Of course! Don't worry.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,920
That's right.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,390
We moved our office, Jung Shin. Okay?

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,350
Stop by when you come to Seoul.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,170
I will treat you to Chinese food, your favorite.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,070
Honey.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,180
Isn't everything working out too well for us these days?

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,720
I'm getting a bit scared

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,120
that we might become chaebol.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,640
Don't get scared!

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,020
Don't you remember what that fortune teller at Miari said?

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,300
Around this time, there will be a big change in our lives.

Hey, Ms. Oh!

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,280
Give me some alcohol, Yang Ja.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,730
Did you fight again with your aunt?

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,070
Should I introduce you to some rich old man?

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,910
So you could keep your theater?

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,470
You don't have a rich young man?

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,070
Would young men look for you?

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,820
They would look for me.

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,450
Yeah, right!

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,320
You said that you had an aunt who runs a theater in Gwangju, right?

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,860
Yeah, my mom's cousin.

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,030
What's her name?

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,280
Aunt Geum Ok. Cha Geum Ok.

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,220
I heard my aunt is the only woman in the movie promotion industry in our country.

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,070
Even my mom and dad can't do anything in front of her.

36
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,500
<i>What's the deal with this little girl?</i>

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,910
<i>Who are you, Ahjumma?</i>

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,970
<i>If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of this.</i>

39
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,480
<i>Oh, you're the daughter of Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?</i>

40
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,350
But how do you know my aunt?

41
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,930
The Commander,

42
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,760
I mean, the Deputy Director

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,490
was worried a lot about

44
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,080
whether you had any difficulties while moving.

45
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,690
I see.

46
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,430
But what do you mean "Deputy Director"?

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,250
I heard he was leaving the military.

48
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,460
Did he already move somewhere else?

49
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh, yes. He went to Namsan.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,500
If it's Namsan,

51
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,740
then isn't that a major promotion?

52
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,480
We've already prepared a place for you to stay in Seoul.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,400
If you have anything else you need, let me know.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,030
No, thank you so much.

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,860
Do you...

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,060
have something you're worried about?

57
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,700
No.

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,670
I left a message for my son in Seoul,

59
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,990
and I was wondering if he would come.

60
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,830
Wouldn't he come since his mother is moving to Seoul?

61
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,510
He would, right?

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,270
How is it? Do you like it?

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,310
Yes.

64
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,760
Thanks to you, I was able to get such a nice house for less than the market price.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,730
Thank you so much.

66
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,220
I guess Cheol Woong hasn't come yet?

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,560
He said he would stay at his own place for the time being.

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,930
His school is a bit far from here.

69
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,120
I was going to properly introduce him to you, Oppa.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm sure I'll get to meet him soon.

71
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,970
But more importantly, shouldn't you also get a job, Yeo Jin?

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,680
It would be a shame to let your degree at a prestigious university go to waste.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,170
That was such a long time ago.

74
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,450
I happen to have a job I want to recommend you.

75
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,360
Do you want to hear about it?

76
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,490
Hey, you, wake up!

77
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,480
I said wake up!

78
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,320
What are you doing in a morning like this?

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,560
In front of the sacred theater!

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,000
You must have taken an early morning train.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,130
To pay the balance already?

82
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,430
O-Oh... well, not really...

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,190
Ma'am, how about a day-time drink...

84
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,680
I mean...

85
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,490
how about having a hangover drink with me?

86
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,400
This is...

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,300
a cognac that I worked hard to obtain.

88
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,850
Do you think there will be a pub that opens in the morning?

89
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,390
There's no need to go far.

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,290
You're telling me to buy Namhae Theater?

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,570
Yes.

92
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,800
I owe the bank about 70 million won,

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,700
and there are some other debts.

94
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,850
Please buy the theater with those debts included.

95
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,510
If I pay off your debt,

96
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,250
are you saying you will sell the theater for cheap?

97
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,870
Yes.

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,100
Why?

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,580
Although I couldn't keep my promise,

100
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,210
you trusted me.

101
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,540
Also,

102
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,020
I feel like if I said I would buy the theater back later,

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,090
you would be someone who'd return it to me.

104
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,680
This young girl

105
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,240
is talking like all she ate was conniving snakes for food.

106
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,320
I don't do business that comes at a loss for me.

107
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,390
In "The Godfather,"

108
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,070
Vito Corleone says this line.

109
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,470
"I'm gonna make him

110
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,960
an offer he can't refuse."

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,900
Honestly, the theater is just a sweetener.

112
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm the real deal.

113
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,040
I will sell myself to you, Ma'am.

114
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,120
Whoa, you're a tough cookie, aren't you?

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,390
What are you worth?

116
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,500
I know you are not satisfied with being an entertainment promoter just in Jeolla-do.

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,330
You should become a promoter who dominates the entire country.

118
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,640
I will help you with that.

119
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,030
Hey,

120
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,930
it does seem like

121
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,480
you watched a lot of movies.

122
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,430
Since you made your offer like in the movies,

123
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,550
I will respond to you very realistically.

124
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,870
Get lost.

125
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,070
Thanks for the drink.

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,140
W-Wait...

127
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,800
Ma'am!

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,430
Ma'am!

129
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,400
I refused an offer that I can't refuse.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,670
So you have more to say to me?

131
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,850
About what?

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,820
I was arrogant.

134
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,420
You can make the offer. I will do whatever it is.

135
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,860
Oh, really?

136
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,470
Then, for me,

137
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,270
I will make you an offer that you can refuse. Okay?

138
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,500
But...

139
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,700
you should hear my offer on your knees.

140
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,260
Here?

141
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,160
You can refuse.

142
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,050
Please tell me.

143
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,530
First,

144
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,420
I will pay off your debt and take over your theater.

145
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,590
When the right time comes.

146
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,070
Second,

147
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,450
you will work under me

148
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,190
as a maid.

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,140
I said you can refuse.

150
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,910
I'll do it!

151
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:12,150
♫ <i>Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!</i> ♫

152

153
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,760
M-Mom...

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,380
Come out.

155
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,260
I heard you haven't been to the boarding home for the past few days.

156
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,190
And you didn't visit me when I moved to Seoul, either.

157
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,790
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,910
If you've done that much, you've done enough.

159
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,460
You even got dragged into military service.

160
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,480
Stop with the protests

161
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,010
and study for the bar exam.

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,370
You say the same thing that Doo Hak hyung said to me.

163
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,160
You met Doo Hak?

164
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
Yes.

165
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,430
How is he doing?

166
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,500
I don't know.

167
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,110

We decided to go our own way. Isn't that right?

Give me what you got, too.

Enough.

No, Hyungnim. These guys need to be disciplined the military way.

Okay.

I mean, they were in and out of jail from their youth

so none of them went to military service.

So, why are you disciplining them in military style?

I couldn't tell you in advance because you were away.

You first take on a job and then report to me after?

Right. The action leader should have quick judgment like that, right?

Mom, you should eat up too.

496
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,680
Gosh, it hasn't been that long since you came out of prison,

497
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,260
but seeing how your visuals are great,

498
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,030
it's like you're a Seoul person.

499
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,370
Really?

500
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,050
- Oh, right. 
 - I ended up working at a factory so I can come to Seoul.

it's Jeongil Industrial Company in Guro-dong,

503
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,190
where they make zippers and razors.

504
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,430
Then what about school?

505
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,860
Oppa, you know too, right?

506
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,140
I wasn't on your level,

507
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,630
but I was at least in the top five students in school.

508
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,600
But, these girls who are worse at studying than me are all going to high school,

509
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,900
but Dad kept telling me to stop going to school and to work at a factory...

Shut your mouth.

Do you know why I said I would go to the factory without making a fuss?

513

It's so I can go back to school after earning my own money!

You resented your father a lot, right?

521
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,140
I resented him a lot too.

522
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,410
I thought how heartless your father was to not go visit his son in prison.

If you're going to talk about Father, then just stop.

524
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,480
When you became 20 and transferred to Gwangju,

525
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,810
that was the day before Chuseok.

526
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:58,910
But out of the blue, your father said he was going to a cousin's house in Gwangyang to offer ancestral rites.

527
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,650
I didn't want to bother with preparing food for the ancestral rites, so I told him to go ahead.

528
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,280
Mom.

529

531
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,850
Yes.

532
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,760
Still, listen.

533
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,160
But after telling me he will return around Chuseok evening,

534
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,600
he didn't return even when it became the day after Chuseok.

535
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I wondered if something had happened so I called his cousin in Gwangyang,

536
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,330
and he said, "What are you talking about?"

537
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,900
He said your father never came.

538
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,640
I was so scared.

539
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,810
I couldn't sleep at all

540
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,620
and couldn't eat anything.

541
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,540
It was only after two days after Chuseok had passed,

542
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,150
that your father

543
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,880
returned at night.

Where did you go that you're only returning now?

548
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,830
I thought I would die from being worried about you!

Your father doesn't have any relatives in Gwangju.

552
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,050
So why would he have gone all the way there?

553

He went to where you were.

554

At that time,

556

your father left money for your detention fund.

557
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,440
So your father

558
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,950
put in all the money he had for his returning bus and food,

559

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,440
It's catching spies and commies.

660
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,710
If you find and report commies,

661
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,120
we arrest those assholes and boost national security.

662
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,390
Are you...

663
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,490
asking me to be a mole?

664
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,070
What do you mean, mole?

665
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,600
That's what...

666
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,440
we call a patriot.

667
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,640
Loving your country.

668
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,380
This is the frontline.

669
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,540
It's a very dangerous place.

670
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,110
No one will know

671
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,080
even if you disappear.

672
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,290
Choi Cheol Woong.

673
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,650
I'm giving you an  opportunity right now.

674
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,200
Don't you need to continue your patriotic family lineage?

675
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,380
I don't want to.

676
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,650
Write it.

677
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,580
Hey, put him through one more run.

678
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,490
I'll write it! I will!

679
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,920
I'll write it...

681
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,650
- Hey, Hyung!
- What happened!

682
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,950
- What's this?
- How?

683
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,110
What the heck?

684
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,380
- What happened?
- You didn't get hurt? Are you okay?

685
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,190
Come on!

686

♫ <i>The life running...</i> ♫

687

Right now is the time to make our stand.

688
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,980
Yes, right now is the time.

689
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,870
I said we can't. Everyone got arrested.

690
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,720
When will it be if not now?

691
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,320
Hyung!

692
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,290
Why did you come back here? It's dangerous!

693
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,410
You're here?

694
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,740
I'm sorry for making you all suffer.

695
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,470
We worried so much because of the cops.

696
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,050
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

697
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,100
Let's sit.

698
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,300
By the way, what brings you here?

699
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,410
I need to at least see your faces before I go.

700
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,930
Are you okay?

701
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,420
Have some of this, too.

702
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,940
Where are you headed?

703
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,070
You know him, right?

704
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,360
I know you do!

705
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,830
You!

706
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,540
You sons of bitches!

707
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,680
"After confirming each other's feelings,

708
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,260
Ju Seok gets Black Glove in the taxi.

709
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,170
Ju Seok and Jun Il transports the luggage from the handcart to the taxi.

710
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,310
The three start to get hopeful.

711
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,980
And the screen fades out."

712
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,280
The scenario ends here.

713
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,890
It's a little dark, huh?

714
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,350
Who's the director again?

715
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,990
It's Bae Chang Ho's debuting work.

716
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,500
Kim Bo Yeon, Ahn Sung Ki, and Kim Hee Ra are the main cast.

717
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,730
I see. It's not bad.

718
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,970
By the way, I'm curious about this one thing, Boss.

719
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,140
It'd be faster for you you to read the scenario yourself,

720
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,050
so why do you always tell me to read it to you?

721
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,320
Didn't you know?

722
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,470
I don't know how to read.

723
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,800
What?

724
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,710
You really don't know how to read?

725
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,860
How did you read the ledgers all this time, then?

726
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,560
When did I ever read them?

727
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,560
I just memorize them when my bookkeeper reads them to me.

728
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,030
Whoa, how do you memorize this?

729
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,530
The landlord's apparently head over heels for his wife in Japan,

730
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,280
so he doesn't really stay in Korea.

731
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,570
It's perfect for us to use!

732
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,990
A total of 200 million won...

733
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,890
- for the production cost?
- That's correct, President Cha.

734
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,050
The work has some level of completion,

735
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,090
but it's about the poverty in cities.

736
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,330
So there will be some censorship and correction.

737
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,080
It'll also be Rated-R. No underage viewers.

738
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,720
So will it make money or not?

739
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,850
If I were you...

740
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,590
I wouldn't invest in it.

741
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,890
In that case...

742
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,600
I'll need to invest in it.

743
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,560
Sorry?

744
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,860
- Why?
- Because...

745
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,690
the arrogant smarties are the ones who are always wrong.

746
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,550
Hand him a postdated check for 30 million won.

747
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,810
Dated in a month, okay?

748
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,020
Thank you.

749
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,320
Thank you, President Cha.

750
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,410
Everyone else was reluctant to invest.

751
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,950
You're...

752
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,570
like an army of support by my side.

753
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,920
I'm not trying to help you.

754
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,570
It's because I smell money here.

755
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,820
Sorry?

756
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,200
You smell money?

757
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,800
Whoa...

758
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,730
This building is pretty good.

759
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,140
Since there's info on developments nearby,

760
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,190
we just need to put it up for about 300 million won.

761
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,300
And people will flock like a herd dogs.

762
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,190
Whoa, she must be an actress.

763
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,650
She's really pretty.

764
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,860
But who is she?

765
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,640
Boss, do you know her?

766
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,560
Let's leave if you're done looking around.

767
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,140
Just come for a second.

768
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,470
It's because she's really pretty. Come and take a look.

769
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,670
Hurry up. How are you so young and not interested in women?

770
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,160
Go take a look.

771
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,120
For the movie...

772
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,570
I was right, huh? Isn't she pretty?

773
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,540
She's not pretty at all.

774
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,290
Let's hurry up and go, I said!

775
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,920
He took his sweet time looking.

776
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,180
Our boss has high standards, huh?

777
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,270
You can start living here from now.

778
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:09,710
Wait—

779
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,450
What's this place for?

780
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,860
Oh, my.

781
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,450
You're really as dense as a rock.

782
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,530
Can't you tell from just looking?

783
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,680
It's Namdo Film Studio's Seoul branch.

784
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,790
Gosh.

785
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,140
There was a fool, who I fired about two weeks ago.

786
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,990
So, starting today,

787
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,990
you're the employee and the branch manager at the same time.

788
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,080
Why? You're so out of it since you

789
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,560
got promoted too fast, aren't you?

790
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,220
Sweetie,

791
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,520
buy what you need with this.

792

President Cha!

794
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,460
Wait...

795
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,470
you need to tell me what I need to do.

796
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,370
Oh, my. Look at this girl.

797
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,070
How can you be asking me when you

798
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,240
also have ran a theater before?

799
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,180
Also, I don't even  know how to read.

800
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,320
And you're a college drop out.

801

Who'd teach who?

802

Aigoo, whatever.

00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,780
Oh Jung Shin, you're the  crazy wench.

804
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,300
How can you make a living when you have no eyes for people?

805
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,860
Gosh.

825
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,120
Hey, you!

826
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,790
You better stop prank calling!

827
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,340
You're an elementary school student, right?

828
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,930
I guess you don't know how ill-tempered I am.

829
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,220
If you call me needlessly one more time,

830
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,500
I'll chase you down to the end of the universe and break your fingers so you can't dial ever again.

831
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,750
Do you understand?

832
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,020
You little!

833
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,130
Aigoo!

834
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,170
We're almost done now.

835
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,870
Hyung! Hyung, run away!

836
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,130
- The detectives are coming in. Hurry!
- Gosh...

837
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,350
Hey! Get them all!

838
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,270
Hey!

839
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,310
Stay still!

840
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,890
Hyung, you go first.

841
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,800
Hyung, are you okay? Can you move?

842
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,550
I'm okay. You guys go ahead.

843
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,830
Hurry and go.

844
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,410
I'm okay, so leave me and go!

845
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,710
Stay still!

846
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,150
Get that asshole!

847
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,480
Get him!

848
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,110
It's okay.

849
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,250
Sorry?

850
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,930
He's one of us.

851
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,340
Now, then.

852
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,790
Take care.

853
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,350
What's this?

854
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,070
Did you follow me?

855
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,630
Follow you, my ass.

856
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,210
I said you're one of us.

857
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,770
And families protect each other.

858
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,670
Gosh, those fellas aren't part of the student union.

859
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,230
It's just a regular club!

860
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,340
- Okay?
- Okay, I see.

861
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,030
However...

862
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,030
one of them might know the information I want.

863
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,260
So I'm just raking them all in once.

864
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,860
Choi Cheol Woong...

865
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,250
I don't need hundreds of small fish.

866
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,170
I just need one big fish.

867
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,590
Wouldn't that also save you some face as well?

868
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,260
I'm sick of showing you this picture, too.

869
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,440
Let's love your country for once!

870
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,270
Love my country?

871
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,410
Okay.

872
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,610
Please let me love my country.

873
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,340
Just send me back to the army instead

874
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,410
and stand guard by the barbed wires!

875
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,890
Have you gone mad?

876
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,750
You want to die, huh?

877
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,080
You talk too much.

878
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,580
If you go back to the army...

879
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,540
you can die without anyone knowing.

880
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,380
No one will know how you died or why you died, either.

881
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,350
That's what's called death under suspicious circumstances.

882
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,200
You seem to have gotten a little brave now that you socialized a bit.

883
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,910
How is it?

884
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:15,120
Shall I send you back to the army?

885
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:20,480
I'm telling you this because you're a family.

886
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,230
Always live in gratefulness, you punk.

887
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:30,070
The place does have a guard,

888
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,080
but he only knows the building manager

889
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,040
and not what the landlord looks like!

890
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,330
What?

891
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,120
Whoa, the heavens are helping!

892
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,790
Hey, isn't this such a good deal?

893
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,860
How much do you think we can get for this?

894
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,500
Still, we need to always be careful.

895
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,610
Even if you think the fire is out,

896
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,160
shower it with your pee just to be safe.

897
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,950
You just watch out for gigolos.

898
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,610
Gosh, seriously.

899
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,900
- Jand Deuk, get the certificate of registration.
- Yes?

900
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,660
Okay!

901
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,410
- What's that?
- What—

902
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,830
Why do you live so high up? Huh?

903
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,190
Gosh...

904
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,610
come out.

905
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,850
Let's have a drink.

906
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,840
Who's that punk?

907
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,040
He's my dongsaeng.

908
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,640
Gosh, I almost peed myself, thinking he's a cop!

909
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,560
- Seriously.
- Aigoo.

910
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh, my...

911
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,720
Come on, seriously.

912
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,400
Let's really just have one more shot.

913
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,370
Hurry up and go to sleep inside, you punk. Also...

914
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:42,550
if you come one more time asking to drink, I'll kill you.

915
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,250
If so...

916
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,520
just kill me now, please.

917
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,550
Who got your ankle beaten up like that?

918
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,410
Oh, this?

919
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,550
It's from loving my country.

920
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,350
Are you doing independence movements?

921
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,980
We're there.

922
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,610
Choi Cheol Woong.

923
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,570
Whoa, you survived somehow, huh?

924
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,430
Shall we have a word separately?

925
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,060
Who the heck are you lot?

926
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,490
If you have something to say, get it done here.

927
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,980
I'm Cheol Woong's sunbae.

928
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,360
Don't worry and wait inside.

929
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,040
It'll only take a moment.

930
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,650
I told you to get it done here.

931
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,220
O-Okay, okay.

932
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,500
Th-These are...

933
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,640
my closest sunbaes.

934
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,170
Hyung...

935
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,570
you go ahead and rest inside.

936
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,820
I'll be right back.

937
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,190
I'm going to leave, you punk.

938
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,600
O-Okay.

939
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,890
Okay, then. Take care.

940
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,400
Hey, Cheol Woong!

941
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,490
Choi Cheol Woong!

942
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,260
Oh, excuse me. Where's the movie club?

943

947

Cheol Woong...

948
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,180
let's be honest here.

949
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,850
How many times do I need to tell you?

950
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,710
I'm really not it.

951
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,180
I'm not something like a spy.

952
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,780
Then who's the detective who let you go?

953
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,920
And who's the one who talked to you?

954
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,510
That's why I'm saying...

955
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,920
let me talk to the female student who saw it at the dorm.

956
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,030
How is sure it was me when it was that dark at night?

957
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,770
You were limping, they said!

958
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,870
Who else could it be?

959
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,380
Other colleagues who were unhurt, all ran for their lives.

960
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,560
But you were the only one who didn't get caught, even with your injury.

961
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,110
- Does this make sense?
- Answer her!

962
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,580
Hyung...

963
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:55,450
I ran towards the east gate, not the outback,

964
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,600
and I didn't even limp my leg.

965
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,690
I was too nervous and running, so didn't even know it hurt.

966
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,760
I only realized it hurt after I escaped to safety!

967
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,840
Yes. That's why I drank alcohol!

968
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,390
Don't you all have  an experience like that? No?

969
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,260
- Gosh, seriously...
- Cheol Woong...

970
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,930
We all know you didn't want to...

971
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,770
become a spy.

972
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,280
You were drafted by force when you're exempt from service.

973
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,020
And the sudden early discharge.

974
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,420
I can guess what those bastards did to you.

975
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,290
Since countless colleagues were done like that and even died.

976
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,910
So let everything down and confess now.

977
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,610
We're not trying to harm you right now.

978
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,770
We need to let the world know how evil those bastards

979
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,700
can get in order to trample on democratization!

980
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,990
Cheol Woong, I beg of you.

981
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,180
Let's blow the whistle.

982
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,210

But it must've taken all night.

988
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,000
What about Cheol Woong?

989
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,480
We had a short talk yesterday and I sent him back home.

990
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,750
Gosh, come on now.

991
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,570
I slept alone in Cheol Woong's room until this morning.

992
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,470
Then he must've gone to another drinking buddy.

993
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,630
Hey, wait a minute.

994
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,440
Even educated college students lie, huh?

995
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,800
Cheol Woong's here, isn't he?

996
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,170
He said he isn't!

997
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,940
Whoa, you're quite the tough guy.

998
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,730
Please go back. They're from UDT and the marines.

999
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,310
Oh, my. How scary.

1000
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,800
I'll count to ten. If Cheol Woong doesn't come out by then,

1001
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,910
I'll be the seeker. Okay?

1002
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,870
Seven...

1003
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,570
Eight...

1004
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,370
Are you all done hiding?

1005
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,550
Nine!

1006
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,080
Ten.

1007
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,550
I'm going to look for him now, okay?

1008
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,570
If you come up here...

1009
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,550
we can't help it, either.

1010
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,030
Shit!

1011
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,220
Hyung, it's the cops.

1012
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,630
Cheol Woong!

1013
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,960
Choi Cheol Woong, are  you here?

1014
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,750
It's hard for me to find you if you hide too well!

1015
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,340
I wasn't...

1016
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,290
going to go this far on students...

1017
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:13,580
but the seeker needs to find everyone for it too end. Right?

1018
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,670
Okay.

1019
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,620
This little—

1020
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,040
- Get him!
- Stop it!

1021
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,230
Come out.

1022
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,060
I found you.

1023
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,400
Leave.

1024
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,440
Hey, you brat! I almost died.

1025
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,970
Let's go.

1026
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,850
Choi Cheol Woong!

1027
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,120
- Gosh...
- You've got a great friend.

1028
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,000
However...

1029
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,540
let's not live shameful lives.

1030
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,510
That's right.

1031
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,720
We can't live shamefully.

1032
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,290
We can't live embarrassing lives.

1033
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,790
But, you know...

1034
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:37,670
even in the worst situation, I did my best not to be shameful.

1035
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,830
If I was really a spy!

1036
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:46,600
Hyung and all of you, too!

1037
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,170
Wouldn't be here right now.

1038
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:50,630
Get it?

1039
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,540
Hey, let's go. All right?

1040
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,150
Let's go.

1041
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:12,570
Why didn't you tell them honestly?

1042
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,600
That whistle-blowing thing, you know?

1043
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,080
Oh...

1044
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,850
you need to have a whistle to blow it,

1045
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:25,430
but you don't have the conscience, huh.

1046
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,420
Right?

1047
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,180
By the way,

1048
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,820
why did you come in, even getting beat up like that?

1049
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,920
Were you worried something bad might happen to me?

1050
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,460
Of course.

1051
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,550
I don't care about you getting injured or dying,

1052
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:46,300
but where would I get the payment for the debt you owe me?

1053
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,760
Right?

1054
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,730
You...

1055
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,630
can't die even if you die until you pay me back, you punk.

1056
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,580
I'm in for some deep trouble, huh?

1057
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,800
But at least one thing's resolved.

1058
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,310
You can't...

1059
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,720
do the spying work anymore.

1060
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,570
What would be your use after all this ruckus?

1061
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,950
Is that so?

1062
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh, my.

1063
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,320
Choi Cheol Woong is one luck guy. How fortunate.

1064
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,610
Crazy punk.

1065
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,030
Hyung.

1066
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,890
I...

1067
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,820
really didn't sell out any of my friends

1068
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,800
who I did demonstrations with.

1069
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,070
Even when those bastards...

1070
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,350
beat me and threatened me so badly!

1071
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,640
But how...

1072
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,140
How can they do this to me?

1073
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,300
Hey, get on.

1074
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,090
Get on my back, you asshole!

1075
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,690
Aigoo, shit.

1076
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,420
You're so freaking heavy.

1077
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,900
Hyung...

1078
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,800
Hyung, don't you want to go down to Yeosu once?

1079
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:54,590
Let's go down, watch a movie, see my dad...

1080
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,630
and see your dad, too.

1081
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,040
- And meet Jung Shin, too.
- Cut it out.

1082
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,610
Why?

1083
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:05,680
You actually want to go, don't you?

1084
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,170
You miss Jung Shin, too, right?

1085
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,310
Gosh, you go there if you want, you punk!

1086
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,880
Hey, this can't do. Get off now.

1087
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,920
- W-Wait.
- Get off!

1088
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,390
Just up to there.

1089
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:18,650
In that case, shut your trap and

1090
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,010
be quiet on the way, okay?
