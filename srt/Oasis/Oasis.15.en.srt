00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,440
- Jung Shin! 
 - You scared me!

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,020
Here. I prepared this for you.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,270
It's nothing.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,060
Why would you prepare something like this?

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,710
- Where are they? 
 - They're that way.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,630
I'm still curious about something.

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,420
Yeah, what is it?

9
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,400
[Episode 15] A long time ago in Yeosu,

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,380
why did you choose me?

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,020
I mean, Cheol Woong is smart and comes from a prestigious family,

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,590
so why did you choose a poor agricultural high school student like me?

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,620
Are you still so curious about that?

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,730
Yeah.

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,290
Then if you were me, you would have chosen Cheol Woong?

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,700
Of course!

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,070
Lee Doo Hak doesn't seem to have much of a future.

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,060
That's the difference between you and me.

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,730
The level at which our eyes can see.

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,900
What difference?

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,930
My eyesight is really good, too!

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,370
Well, Cheol Woong... Yeah.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,330
He's rich and comes from an independence movement leader's family.

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,580
A shining family that has both wealth and prestige.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,650
But you know, Cheol Woong was only an extension of that shining family background.

26
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,830
Then I guess I was a bit

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,400
on the extension of darkness.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,880
Gosh, that's not true.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,670
It's true your family was poor,

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,800
but your eyes always shone like the light of dawn.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,650
The darker it was, the brighter they shone.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,000
Typically, people would lose motivation in circumstances like yours.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
- Was I like that? 
 - Yeah.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,840
But the more important reason was

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,450
I wanted to become Princess Pyeonggang*.
(Korean princess who married a commoner and made a great general)

36
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,400
Princess Pyeonggang?

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,110
Then what? You're saying I'm Fool Ondal?

38
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,350
That's right. Hey, it appears that I'm a film producer by nature.

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,970
Such an unexpected twist to turn this fool

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,520
into the best general there is... Isn't it awesome?

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,740
So what you're saying is that I'm an actor you cast

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,250
in the film of your life?

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,020
- That's right. 
 - Gosh, I'm starting to get a bit sad.

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,100
Doo Hak, all of that is meaningless.

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,890
I was just grateful that you grew up so well in such difficult circumstances,

46
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,450
and I felt sorry for you when I saw you struggling because of Cheol Woong.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,080
And your clear eyes looking at me...

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,530
were always honest and touching.

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,690
I guess all of that came together to seem lovely to me, even to this very moment.

50
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,340
Gosh, Jung Shin...

51
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,890
Why?

52
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,290
Was it a bit touching?

Lee Doo Hak was reported dead after he disappeared.

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,370
And no one entered the country under the name Lee Doo Hak.

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,260
After looking into the immigration records,

85
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,240
he came from Tokyo through Gimpo as Lee Young Gook, a foreign national from Japan.

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,430
Check his every move, and report to me everything you find. Got it?

- Get out!

I hope we can safely cross the seas breaking through the waves.

Our captain is an amazing man.

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,440
Did he not cross the seas of death to get here?

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,810
All right. Hyungnim, and Hyungnim's wife!

 - Yeah, we should.

Well... it's Choi Cheol Woong.

<i>Since I gave you an important piece of info,</i>

111

Lee Doo Hak should also give me an important piece of info.

112
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,820
Bring me proof

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,260

No.

120

Choi Cheol Woong put him on us.

121
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,810
- What? 
 - Quietly leave through the kitchen back door.

122

We will have to close down here for a while.

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,830

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,100
Doo Hak.

127
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,340
Just meet with Cheol Woong, instead of avoiding him.

128
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,480
I will go with you.

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,310
He can't act rashly against yo, anyway.

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,950
I will meet with him

131
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,180
since I should at least give him a chance.

132
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,850
Well, he might have changed. But...

133
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,600
I will go alone.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,330
Let me go with you.

135
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,620
I'd feel uncomfortable.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,800
Also, you know

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,220
we need to resolve some things by ourselves.

138
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,120
Since Cheol Woong called check,

139
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,870
we would have to call a counter-check.

140
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,370
The one who was asked to kill you was that guy,

141
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,250
and the one who hired him was...

142
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,000
He's here.

143
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,720
Oh, Lee Doo Hak came back alive.

144
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,360
I know.

145
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
How did you...

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,550
Then,

147
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,060
do you know the source of his funds to do what he wants to do here?

148
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,900
Source of his funds?

149
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,100
If I tell you everything truthfully,

150
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
then put Lee Doo Hak in jail, and guarantee me and my business's safety.

151
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,650
Gosh, this bastard...

152
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,190
All right, tell me.

153
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,350
Lee Doo Hak is running an illegal private gambling house with me.

154
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,260
Running what?

155
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,430
A private gambling house?

156
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,910
Yes.

157
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,340
He split the shares with me,

158
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,710
and we are running about 15 throughout the country.

159
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,010
From now on, whatever that bastard Lee Doo Hak does wherever,

160
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,030
I will become your eyes, Prosecutor.

Even if it weren't for me, you would have died anyway.

164
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,350
If that bastard keeps delaying it,

165
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,040
he may hire someone else to do the job.

166
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,920
If you're scared, just go into hiding while you're still ahead.

167
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
If I do that,

168
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,340
I would lose everything, then.

169

Why?

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,870
I'm sure you could live off of the money you made up to this point.

171
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,180
That's chump change compared to the money I helped that family obtain.

172
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,480
And they're an organization that can take away even that.

173
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,550

That would be impossible.

176
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,960

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh, yes. You must be tired.

Wow, you're so pretty, Song Yeon Joo!

Aigoo!

187
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,390
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

188
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,180
I'm doing well always.

189
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,390
But if it's all right with you, could I get an autograph?

190
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,210
Let's finish talking about business first.

191
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,130
Yes, of course.

192
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,210
Please take a seat.

193

She is the owner of a building in Apgujeong.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,720
You know very well who this is without me introducing her, right?

195
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,860
Hello.

196
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,950
It's nice to meet you.

197
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,980
Well, the building custodian gave me a tour, so I got a good look at it.

198
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,280
There weren't any water leaks. It was pretty clean.

199
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,860
Of course.

200
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,390
It was built recently, so of course, it should be clean.

201
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,710
Also, this is only possible because the owner here is in a rush.

202
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,600
She put it up for sale at such a ridiculously low price.

203
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
So, did you make up your mind?

204
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,600
- Please lower the price.
- Excuse me?

205
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,160
Since the building is so large, it's difficult to gather the necessary funds.

206
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,040
Please lower the price by 500 million won.

207
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,630
That would not be possible.

208
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,370
I already low-balled it.

209
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,670
A down payment of 10 billion won and a balance of 2 billion won.

210
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,160
I can't take anything below that.

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,280
The owner here is in a rush,

212
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,240
so that's why she put it up for such a ridiculously low price.

213
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,070
Then, give me a 300 million won discount.

214
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,770
Gosh...

215
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,850
This is driving me nuts.

216
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,210
Ma'am, what will you do?

217
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,310
You know the situation with my son.

218
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,880
Then, how about both sides consider this for one more day?

219
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,370
If someone else shows up in that time frame,

220
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,690
then too bad.

221
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,750
All right.

222
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,150
Wait!

223
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,370
How about that autograph that I asked for?

224
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,290
Well, that... I will give it to you when I sign the contract.

225
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,730
Oh, okay...

226
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,360
Gosh, this is awkward...

227
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,660
Well, don't worry about this, Ma'am.

228

229
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,860
Will you have a cup of tea with me?

230
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,210
Yes, you did great.

231
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,380
Please wrap things up well.

232
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,160
Thanks.

233
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,010
This is all that you're asking of me after we've met for the first time in a long time?

234
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,350
Sorry...

235
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,290
If you're sorry, then you shouldn't ask me for favors.

236
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,380
You asked me to break up with you since you're going to jail,

237
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,000
and then you ask me to act in this fraudulent act.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,640
It won't cause you any harm.

239
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,160
Let me ask a favor of you as well.

240
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,370
A special marriage and a special divorce...

241
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,870
As a result, it was easy to return to acting,

242
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,920
but it's taking forever to forget you.

243
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,290
You should come back to me.

244
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,920
Are you going to retire again?

245
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,470
I might end up back in jail.

246
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,430
You still value

247
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,900
loyalty more than love, I see.

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,680
No, I just have bad fortune,

249
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,780
so you would become unhappy.

250
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,510
I'm sorry...

251
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,350
and I'm grateful.

252
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,690
I won't ever call you again.

There was a big difference from what you told the Ms. Kang, Chairman.

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,750
As you well know, this project

329
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,940
has a lot of expenses that can't be listed on financial statements.

330
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,040
Right.

331
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,980
There is also the insurance money

332
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,820
just in case the project goes wrong.

333
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,860
And that was your main goal in making me the offer to join you in this venture.

334
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,350
We will give you 5% more.

335
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,800
We can't give you any more.

336
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,080
Then let's just say this never happened.

337
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,960
Ms. Kang.

338
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,150
I was disappointed by how you weren't honest with me from the start.

339
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,470
Isn't trust the basics of business?

340
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,190
I understand.

341
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,160
If you want more than that,

342
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,730
give us some time to consider.

343
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,200
But Ms. Kang, don't ever give me something like this again.

344
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,590
What's this?

345
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,940
Aren't they the borrowed name checking accounts that you told us to the deposit the funds after we divide it up?

346
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,360
What are you doing?

347
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,010
You can't even figure out where Doo Hak's whereabouts?

348
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,450
It's just that he keeps evading us as if he knows we're tailing him.

350
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,900
Instead of making excuses,

351
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,950
hurry on outside and go find him.

352
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,400
Yes.

353
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,820
It appears something's not working out for you.

354
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,590
If there's something I can help you with, please tell me.

355
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,200
I will help you whenever you need me.

356
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,740
Something you can help me with?

357
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,090
Not something to threaten me with?

358
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,160
Why are you still hung up about that?

359
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,450
You're someone who will be doing great things in the future.

360
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,360
I don't know.

361
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,600
I want to do great things,

362
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,000
but such strong shackles are attached to my ankles.

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,190
Don't just think of it as shackles.

364
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,810
Wouldn't it make you feel more comfortable if you saw it as

365
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,560
a symbiotic relationship like a crocodile and a crocodile bird?

366
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,920
Symbiotic relationship?

367
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,780
Instead of a parasitic relationship?

368
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,110
Whether it's symbiotic or parasitic,

369
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,280
isn't it the same in that they live together?

370
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,910
Wouldn't you need to kill of a parasite to become healthy?

371
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,930
Do you know who will win

372
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,430
if a lion and tiger fights in an open field?

373
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,840
The answer is,

374
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,640
nobody wins.

375
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,530
The lion and the tiger know each other all too well.

376
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,020
Even if one kills the other and wins,

377
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,320
it would get critically injured in the process and ultimately die as well.

378
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,950
So, a lion and a tiger

379
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,080
avoid each other, and would never fight each other.

380
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,770
So...

381
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,380
are you trying to say that you are a lion or a tiger, Team Captain Oh?

382
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,040
Are you trying to say that even if you die, you won't die by yourself?

383
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,470
From what I can see, you are just

384
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,190
a leech.

385
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,800
You just seem like an only harmful presence

386
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,430
who harms and leeches off of others.

387
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,050
So...

388
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,040
you're really not going to take my hand?

389
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,760
If you have my help, you can achieve what you want to achieve,

390
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,590
get the person you want, beat the person you want to beat.

391
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,180
You would be able to resolve all of those problems.

392
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,570
Did you not hear what I said?

393
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,780
Get out of my sight right now!

394
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,790
I will...

395
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,030
get out of your sight then.

396
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,830
Oh, Doo Hak's mother. What brings you here?

397
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,520
Oh.

398
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,040
I had something to discuss with you.

399
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,270
What is it?

400
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,300
Well, since Doo Hak and Jung Ok returned,

401
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,810
there's just one more thing that I need to do.

402
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,680
But, the thing is...

403
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,390
people would be a bit shocked if they find out.

404
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,440
So I really don't know what I should do.

405
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,880
What is it, Doo Hak's mother?

406
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,300
But what is Doo Hak up to right now?

407
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,530
Actually, I have something to tell you as well.

408
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,350
This is Choi Cheol Woong.

409
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,980
It's me.

410
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,970
Hyung.

411
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,570
You were alive?

412
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,910
As if this is news...

413
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,810
You knew it already.

414
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,420
I suppose.

415
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,560
But you're late in calling me after you've returned.

416
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,610
Is that really true?

417
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,750
I'm so sorry, Doo Hak's mother.

418
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,590
I should have told you sooner.

419
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,060
I feel so bad for Doo Hak

420
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,210
who took the blame for a crime that he didn't commit.

421
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,010
Goodness...

422
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,060
Goodness, how did he endure that...

423
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,870
Goodness, how did he take on all that blame...

424
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,360
Gosh, goodness.

425
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,910
How did he bear the blame for that sin?

426
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,060
That's why... that's why he said at that time...

427
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,870
<i>Who knows what can happen in this world?</i>

428
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,970
<i>Also, it's not like we committed a sin or anything,</i>

429
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,780
<i>so shouldn't Cheol Woong know now, too?</i>

430
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,490
<i>It would make things complicated</i>

431
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,820
<i>for Doo Hak and Cheol Woong.</i>

432
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,360
My wretched husband didn't tell me anything!

433
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,970
This won't do.

434
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,560
It looks like I really need to step in!

435
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,790
Goodness! Goodness...

436
00:25:53,790 --> 00:26:00,920
♫ <i>Will I be able to come to you again?</i> ♫

437
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,840
♫ <i>Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful</i> ♫

438
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,190
♫ <i>Above the rough sky, my heart floats away</i> ♫

439
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:23,330
♫ <i>Only your name, I engrave like this</i> ♫

440
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,360
What's with that look?

441
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,250
Are you glad to see me,

442
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,750
or disappointed?

443
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,420
No,

444
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,710
I just can't believe it.

445
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,180
Sit down.

446
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,910
Still, I thought you would at least pretend to be glad to see me.

447
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm glad to see you.

448
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,270
Jung Shin said she would come with me,

449
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,630
but I dissuaded her.

450
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,840
I told her that it was something that we needed to resolve by ourselves.

451
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,280
If you were alive,

452
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,580
then you should have at least contacted me.

453
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,240
Do you know know how much I blamed myself and struggled?

454
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
If the one who killed feels tortured,

455
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,280
then how much more pain and suffering would the one who fell into the cold ocean

456
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,210
after being shot and died have gone through?

457
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,810
Did I shoot the gun?

458
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,490
I hoped you would flee to a foreign country.

459
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,400
A fugitive?

460
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,360
What difference is there between living as wanderer

461
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,820
and dying?

462
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,990
So what?

463
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,610
Did you come to get revenge?

464
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,260
Shall I apologize to you?

465
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,520
Cheol Woong.

466
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,920
An apology

467
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,830
is not something you do because the one who got hit tells you to do it,

468
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,270
but it's something that the one who hits someone must do.

469
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,350
Hyung, you know where I'm at right now, right?

470
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,150
Doing something to you

471
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,200
is a piece of cake for me.

472
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,330
Oh, of course I know that.

473
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,980
A mere gangster like me has a hard time handling a prosecutor,

474
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,140
so how could I handle someone who's part of Namsan?

475
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,770
I'm not that stupid.

476
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,970
Then what is it that you want?

477
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,720
I want to return to the place where I was

478
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,560
before I died and live quietly.

479
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,800
That's all I need.

480
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,780
Is that it?

481
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,340
When the right time comes,

482
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,350
I will go abroad with my family and live in another country.

483
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,120
What about Jung Shin?

484
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,970
She would need to come with me.

485
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,740
She's someone who's engaged to be married to me.

486
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,980
What if I say no?

487
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,860
Cheol Woong.

488
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,270
I know how much you liked Jung Shin.

489
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,160
But,

490
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,030
Jung Shin is not an object.

491
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,760
She's not someone that you can have just because you want her.

492
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,710
Jung Shin said

493
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,040
she would go with me wherever I go.

494
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,270
So,

495
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,440
just let go of us...

496
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,250
please.

497
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,560
I'll let you go.

498
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
- But only you, Hyung.
- Cheol Woong...

499
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,650
You can't have Jung Shin.

500
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,910
She'll never be getting with you anyway.

501
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,160
She even knows I went to prison in your place already.

502
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,650
I'm not saying I'll hold onto her.

503
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,880
I just can't leave Jung Shin to be

504
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,480
next to a man who may get locked up any day,

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
while being on the run for the rest of his life.

506
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,870
It doesn't have to be me,

507
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,600
but I just can't watch Jung Shin become miserable.

508
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,570
You really...

509
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,700
haven't changed at all.

510
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,410
You're the one who haven't changed at all,

511
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,030
still thinking about yourself, only.

512
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,480
If you had agreed to let us go...

513
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,360
I was really going to forgive you.

514
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,170
My life that I lost because of you and...

515
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,070
my father who died an unjust death...

516
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,310
I'm saying I'll forget everything...

517
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:14,580
and live a quiet life back in my place.

518
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,390
Is that such a...

519
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,120
hard request for you to grant?

520
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,470
Are you saying even that much is...

521
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,050
an unfathomable greed for people like me, you asshole?

522
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,030
No...

523
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,370
you should dream about your happiness all you want.

524
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,890
It's also true I'm indebted to you.

525
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,940
That's why I'm saying I'll save you here!

526
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,790
I'll give you one week.

527
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,640
Go back to Japan.

528
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,550
Go back and live on as Korean Japanese Lee Hyeong Gook.

529
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,690
If you do that, nothing will happen.

530
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,540
Cheol Woong!

531
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,150
Are you...

532
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,030
really going to decline?

533
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,680
Must you really go this far?

534
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,840
Doo Hak!

535
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,130
How did it go?

536
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,570
You couldn't get his apology?

537
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,310
Does he even have a sense of conscience?

538
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,520
How could he not even apologize after ruining your life completely?

539
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,180
I thought about it on the  way back.

540
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,890
I now think Cheol Woong never did anything wrong.

541
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,050
- What?
- A person doesn't change.

542
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,220
It's only the position of a person that changes.

543
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,940
The high schooler Choi Cheol Woong and the current Choi Cheol Woong...

544
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,880
They're still the same people, aren't they?

545
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,970
Choi Cheol Woong still looks at me as...

546
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,230
a servant's son...

547
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,680
the same way he's been thinking of me.

548
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,140
I guess this is why they say...

549
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,520
if a person changes...

550
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,810
it means  his death is near.

551
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,630
Since it's impossible.

552
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,560
That rotten bastard.

553
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,820
He told me to leave you and get out of Korea in one week.

554
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,010
Saying nothing will happen, if I do that.

555
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,390
Don't worry.

556
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,710
As long as I'm here, that bastard can't lay a finger on you.

557
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,840
I'm going to block all the arrows coming your way.

558
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
Choi Cheol Woong isn't our only opponent.

559
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,330
We need to take on Hwang Choong Sung and Kang Yeo Jin, too.

560
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,600
It'll be a difficult fight.

561
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,360
Doo Hak, what's gotten into you?

562
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,140
I'm a news magazine publisher.

563
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,720
A journalist who surveils those in power.

564
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,620
Jung Shin, although Cheol Woong is twisted,

565
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,010
even you know at least his feelings for you were sincere.

566
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,720
Cheol Woong might be comepletely ruined...

567
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,470
when the trigger is pulled.

568
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,850
Will you be okay with that?

569
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,460
Go ahead.

570
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,550
Go ahead, nonetheless.

571
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,430
Though Choi Cheol Woong is really a f***ed up bastard...

572
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,400
it's true I'm not feeling completely at ease. However...

573
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,170
the pain you had to suffer...

574
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,940
it's also hell for me to see you relive that pain.

575
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,880
So go ahead...

576
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,100
and strike first before you get hurt.

577
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,960
I haven't heard of these companies.

578
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,020
Are these accounts related to your company?

579
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,360
They're related...

580
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,610
but how did you know, Mother?

581
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,120
I used a different alias, but why did he use those?

582
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,580
This is a common method.

583
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,620
You need to split into many smaller accounts like this

584
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,360
when you're trying to launder a big sum without getting traced.

585
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,420
The more you split, the less suspicion you get.

586
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,510
Anyhow, did you make a big investment in something?

587
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,660
Or did Father tell you about this?

588
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,730
No, your father doesn't know.

589
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,280
I had a trouble with Chairman Keum.

590
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,390
Apparently, Team Captain Oh went to Chairman Keum

591
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,800
and told him to split my capital and return them into these accounts.

592
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,610
When we're...

593
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,300
laundering money, we need to report to our superiors.

594
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,430
But I didn't get any reports about this.

595
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:24,380
Also, those accounts aren't to be used for personal reasons.

596
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,600
What the f*** is Team Captain Oh doing?

597
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
It's fine.

598
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm sure he was trying to get the money back safely.

599
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,050
It's a matter you or your father didn't know about.

600
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,130
You should hurry inside and rest.

601
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,490
Yes.

602
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,560
Oh...

603
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,480
Mother...

604
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,890
Why?

605
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,370
It's nothing.

606
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,260
What is it?

607
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,410
I'll tell you at a later time.

608
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,370
Whoa, Seoul sure is different, huh?

609
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,430
How are you, Sir?

610
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,820
Hey.

611
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,980
The air's a lot dirtier here than at the oceanside, right?

612
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,580
You're here?

613
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,280
I called you over since a good sword was rotting away.

614
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,080
Why would you bother with a nutcase like me?

615
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,050
Nutcases are the ones who get the bigshots.

616
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,010
Let's grab some dinner later.

617
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,170
Yes! Please take care!

618
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,690
Please buy me a delicious meal!

619
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,150
Yes, Kim Sung Yeob speaking.

620
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,530
Congratulations on entering Seoul.

621
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,510
No Sook Ja? Are you the one behind this, too?

622
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,880
Come on, how could a homeless like me do this?

623
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,610
Anyway, have your sword nice and sharpened.

624
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,550
<i>When will you show me your face?</i>

625
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,690
<i>Should I come to Seoul station?</i>

626
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,870
I moved.

627
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,120
I'll be the one to come to you.

628
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,500
Yes!

629
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,300
Thank you.

630
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,940
A deposit of 10 billion won has been confirmed.

631
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,910
Aigoo, my son is safe now.

632
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,420
Aigoo, thank you for your work.

633
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,980
- Please give me your seal.
- Oh, yes.

634
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,980
Please let me know about good properties in the future, too.

635
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,820
Aigoo, no question about that.

636
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,260
Madam...

637
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,000
please give me your seal.

638
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,580
This building is already profitable, the moment you buy it.

639
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,520
You've got yourself a really great deal.

640
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,200
All right. Congratulations.

641
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,190
Now, then.

642
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,980
By the way...

643
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,920
I'll pay you the remaining balance, two billion won, a month later.

644
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,460
- Oh, yes. Sure.
- S-Sure.

That's our Prosecutor Choi, never keeping his promises.

657
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,550
He's trying to tie down my source of income first.

658
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,260
However, I won't let him.

659
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,420
You better keep your promise.

660
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,040
You're giving me all of your shares.

661
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,880
All right.

662
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,970
Gosh, Officer Choi, why are you doing this to me?

663
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,060
I handed over all the information to you!

664
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,760
Hey...

665
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,920
how can I trust the words of a gangster?

666
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Don't you agree?

- Hey, that's one sick song.

670
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,960
Really?

671
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
You didn't seclude yourself in the countryside for nothing.

672
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,790
That was great.

673
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,850
Does that mean I get to feature my song in a movie now?

674
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,310
Well... sure.

675
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,340
Let's find a scenario that fits the song.

676
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,210
- Gosh, Jung Shin!
- Yes!

677
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,280
- There was a decent scenario I saw.
- Really?

678
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,340
Cheol Woong...

679
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,440
What's up?

680
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm sure I said we won't ever be seeing each other's faces again.

681
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,470
I'm here strictly for official business.

682
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,230
I'll go ahead home first.

683
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,120
Is there any official business between us?

684
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,310
Lee Doo Hak will be publicly wanted soon.

685
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,190
But I gave him some time.

686
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,100
So could you tell him to stop being stubborn and leave please?

687
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,850
Why didn't you apologize to Doo Hak?

688
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,440
What difference does my apology make?

689
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,520
- You're really...
- I mean...

690
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,560
you also deceived me.

691
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,820
You knew Doo Hak hyung was alive.

692
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,130
And you were clearly meeting him.

693
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,690
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong!

694
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,780
Of all people, you can't do this to me.

695
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,000
You can't do this to me!

696
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,040
And why can't I?

697
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,390
You have been hiding the truth behind Doo Hak's sentence ever since.

698
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,560
Why did you apologize to me,

699
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,320
but not to Doo Hak?

700
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,990
Why aren't you letting him go?

701
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,430
He was your friend and hyung who sacrificed himself for you.

702
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,780
Aren't you the one who shouldn't be doing this?

703
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,280
It's because you'll be miserable.

704
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,840
I just can't bare to watch you become miserable, okay?

705
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,500
Are you going to live the life of a runaway next to Doo Hak hyung until you die?

706
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,690
I'm fine being on the run for the rest of my life.

707
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,190
I'm going to protect Doo Hak.

708
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,360
Journalist Shin, you got the information, right?

709
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,990
Let us prepare now.

[Young Generation Film Studio]

711
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,930
There's a problem.

712
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,360
Lee Doo Hak's currently working with Chairman Chae Dong Pal.

713
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,030
What?

714
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,550
Hey!

715
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,380
What's the matter?

716
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,650
Why didn't you tell me, Chairman Chae?

717
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,430
That Lee Doo Hak works for you.

718
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,100
Lee Doo Hak?

719
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,090
- Who is that person?
- I'm talking about Lee Hyeong Gook!

720
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,780
Oh, Lee Hyeong Gook. He does work for me.

721
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,550
Do I need to introduce even people who work for me to you?

722
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,470
Lee Doo Hak, no— Lee Hyeong Gook is...

723
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,800
a criminal who ran away from Korea after committing a crime.

724
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,550
You should send him back to Japan right away.

725
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,840
If you don't...

726
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,740
you'll have a lot of trouble doing business in Korea, Chairman Chae.

727
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,920
Well, I don't know what crime this person called Lee Doo Hak committed.

728
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,370
I just don't know him.

729
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:22,600
The only person I know is Lee Hyeong Gook.

730
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,210
He's never committed any kind of crime and

731
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,810
he's a young man who works diligently for me.

732
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:33,070
I can't just send back a person I need,

733
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,790
just because you said a word or two.

734
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,630
Chairman Chae, if you protect a criminal...

735
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,690
even you could end up getting punished.

736
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,300
Are you blackmailing him right now?

737
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,030
It's not blackmailing.

738
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,730
I'm just worried for him.

739
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,120
Hae Sung.

740
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,110
Please take your leave.

741
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,680
What's wrong? Did the talk not go well?

742
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,100
Seriously.

743
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,860
People still don't know what kind of person Lee Doo Hak is.

744
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,890
Hyung, I clearly gave you a chance.

745
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,030
I'm the one who gave you a chance.

746
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,240
By the way, Hyung...

747
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,120
are you sure you can beat me?

748
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,380
<i>Hyung. Will you be able to beat me?</i>

749
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,450
<i>Who said I would fight with you?</i>

750
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:35,070
<i>I really don't care, so you do what you want!</i>

751
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,860
Why don't you realize that even when you're so smart?

752
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,030
You got the first place taken by me in high school once, right?

753
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,440
You asked me this back then.

754
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,230
<i>Congrats.</i>

755
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,890
<i>Oh, no. I guessed a few, too.</i>

756
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,300
<i>I just got lucky.</i>

757
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,450
<i>For this exam, did you study with all your might because of Jung Shin?</i>

758
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,940
You were right.

759
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,060
It was because of Jung Shin, however...

760
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,110
Do you know what was more difficult?

761
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,410
It's maintaining second place by a few points.

762
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,160
I'm saying losing to you intentionally was harder.

763
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,550
Now...

764
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,490
I won't lose on purpose.

765
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,810
All right.

766
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,860
Let's bring it on.

767
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,870
Welcome in!

768
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,230
Aigoo, have you been well?

769
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,790
You've been doing well, right?

770
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,600
Well, yes. Of course.

771
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,430
By the way...

772
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,920
why did you want to see me out of nowhere?

773
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,080
The thing is...

774
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,110
I'm a little busy right now.

775
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,840
If it's nothing urgent, I'll come back later.

776
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,500
I heard you were the one, huh?

777
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,330
Sorry?

778
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,920
At Yeosu...

779
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,240
I heard you did it, huh?

780
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,750
Yes.

781
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,230
Just how painful must it have been, this entire time?

782
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,270
Wh-Why?

783
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,070
Is that what Doo Hak hyung said?

784
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,750
Tell him to announce it on the news instead.

785
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,360
He can just let the news broadcast say Choi Cheol Woong

786
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,650
was the one who murdered, not Lee Doo Hak!

787
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,750
Wh-What's the matter, Cheol Woong?

788
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,610
You're right.

789
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,090
I'm acting a little weird today.

790
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,680
I'll get going now.

791
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,880
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong!

792
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,270
Cheol Woong! Just listen—

793
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,280
Cheol Woong, just hear me out for a second.

794
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,860
Cheol Woong...

795
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,930
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong! Just hear me out for a second.

796
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,340
Mother, get back inside, all right?

797
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,450
Just hear me out for a second.

798
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,720
Cheol Woong! Cheol Woong!

799
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,010
Cheol Woong...

800
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,660
just listen to what I have to tell you for a second.

801
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,630
It's custom made from Japan.

802
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,940
You're not trying to eavesdrop us...

803
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,510
talking smack about you, are you?

804
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,620
Thank you.

805
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,020
Nothing's for free.

806
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,180
You owe me one for this.

807
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,260
Secure the recording and hand it over to me.

808
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,090
Then, everything ends when you take the money and escape to overseas.

809
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,760
Okay.

810
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,620
Does that mean I'm...

811
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,780
getting a happy ending now?

812
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,820
I don't want to let you have one...

813
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,630
but you should go.

814
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,810
Get out of this country.

815
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,240
That's how this country will be even slightly cleaner, right?

816
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,130
However, if you fail to secure the evidence...

817
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,220
you'll be trashed at Nanjido dump site.

818
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,590
Right.

819
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,780
Since we're on the same boat now...

820
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,650
want me to tell you a funny story?

821
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,700
I don't know what you're scheming...

822
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,900
nothing you say will surprise or interest me anymore.

823
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,050
I'm sure  you know Choi Cheol Woong's birth father...

824
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,560
to be Deputy Director Hwang Choong  Sung.

825
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,440
But did you know this?

826
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,080
I got a call from Chairman Chae Dong Pal.

827
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,210
He said you had went to him.

828
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,250
- Yes.
- You should've discussed such matters with me.

829
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,600
I'm sorry.

830
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,010
You're already busy because of the election.

831
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,140
And I didn't want to be a burden, either.

832
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,830
So I was going to take care of it myself.

833
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,840
Just keep a watch for now.

834
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,820
Chairman Chae Dong Pal said he can't continue business with us

835
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,430
if he's sent back to Japan because he does great work.

836
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,710
A phenomenal amount of money was invested in this election.

837
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,490
We need to save every single bullet right now.

838
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,330
We can't give up the entire ammunition depot just because of that one little thug.

839
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,600
Deputy Director, Lee Doo Hak...

840
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,860
isn't just a little thug.

841
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,060
Is it because of Jung Shin?

842
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,580
At this point, I don't think she's meant to be yours.

843
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,910
You should forget about her now.

844
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,010
I'll have someone else watch Lee Doo Hak.

845
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,180
No, I'll put an end to Lee Doo Hak.

846
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,440
I told you to stop!

847
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,750
You may leave.

848
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,580
Aigoo, the national security is sighing away.

849
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,920
What makes you sigh so heavily?

850
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,440
Do you have a concern or something?

851
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,680
Why do you ask?

852
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,020
Is the parasite trying to steal even my worries now?

853
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:42,760
A parasite steals everything that the host has, doesn't it?

854
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,990
By the way...

855
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,620
what are you trying to pull off, scheming...

856
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,520
between my mother and Chairman Keum?

857
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,750
Why did you give company accounts to Keum Man Cheol?

858
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,220
Do you want Madam's funds to be traced?

859
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,340
In that case...

860
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,210
you need to report to either me or Deputy Director, you asshole.

861
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,060
Report?

862
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,770
Is it something that needs reporting?

863
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,470
Deputy Director doesn't even know Madam invested in Keum Man Cheol.

864
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,860
I just did what I can to keep the peace in the family.

865
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,270
I'm starting to get offended here.

866
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,490
I'm sure I told you that we ought to respect each other.

867
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:32,180
Gosh, this f***ing insect.

868
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,980
Why?

869
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,180
Are you frustrated...

870
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,670
I didn't die?

871
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,270
Yeah, bastard.

872
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,080
I'm frustrated.

873
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,590
How long do you think Deputy Director will remain your umbrella?

874
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,410
You think he'll be your umbrella?

875
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,110
An asshole with a rootless family...

876
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,850
What?

877
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,910
A pathetic asshole who can't even...

878
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,530
take care of a f***ing thug.

879
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,940
<i>Choi Cheol Woong is aware I sent company accounts to Keum Man Cheol.</i>

880
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,650
I can no longer withdraw the money,

881
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,350
even if Keum Man Cheol deposits into that account.

882
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:39,430
- What?
- <i>This means there's nothing in this for me, anymore.</i>

883
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:43,130
I just don't have the will to work anymore.

884
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,760
I'll make the ends meet.

885
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,320
- How?
- <i>I'll first send a billion won to your account.</i>

886
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,920
The rest will be exchanged with the evidence, once it's secured.

887
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,710
Send the money right away.

888
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,860
I'll get to work, once it's confirmed.

889
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:07,230
[Sunggwang Bank]

890
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,460
[Deposit: one billion won]

891
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,050
Everyone's ready, right?

892
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,010
Yes. We secure the evidence of Hwang Choong Sung murdering Doo Hak's dad and

893
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,850
expose it through Jung Shin's news magazine.

894
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,300
Prosecutor Kim Sung Yeob will make his move after.

895
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,150
Preferential treatment for Kang Yeo Jin and

896
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,680
instigated murder for Hwang Choong Sung.

897
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,140
On top of that, the investigations on NSA's slush funds will

898
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,350
extend like the stems of sweet potato.

899
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,220
What about Choi Cheol Woong who framed someone else for his murder?

900
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,290
Once Choi Cheol Woong's parents are doomed,

901
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,600
he's bound to sink along with them.

902
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,290
Everyone listen up.

903
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,450
We don't have a second chance.

904
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,540
We can't afford to make mistakes.

905
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,420
Yes!

906
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,520
Let's go catch the villains!

907
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,890
- Let's go. 
- Let's go!

908
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,400
<i>Take a seat.</i>

909
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,460
<i>You have a lot of hard work lately, Sir.</i>

910
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,250
All right. What did you want to tell me?

911
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,630
Hurry up and tell me.

912
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,130
I'm sorry to tell you this...

913
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,330
but I think it's time for me to leave your side.

914
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,670
What do you mean?

915
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:54,470
You promised to go to the end with me, didn't you?

916
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,790
I think this is the end of my capabilities.

917
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,160
I'm sorry to keep causing trouble and burden you.

918
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,630
What's the matter?

919
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,020
That's all in the past now.

920
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,420
Everyone has a flaw or two.

921
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,750
There are mountains of ordeals, such as the congressional and the presidential elections.

922
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,300
Who will I have to trust, if I don't have you?

923
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,140
There's a lot of younger and more competent fellows by your side, Deputy Director.

924
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,040
Especially, you have Prosecutor Choi, don't you?

925
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,340
Are you upset I keep Cheol Woong by my side...

926
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,390
and keep at a distance with you?

927
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,170
Not at all.

928
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,500
You have taken care of me better and longer than anyone else.

929
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,810
You're my captain for life.

930
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,730
<i>I don't even have an inkling of hard feelings towards you.</i>

931
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,780
<i>It's just that I thought this is the end of my work.</i>

932
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,020
<i>I do keep clashing with Prosecutor Choi and...</i>

933
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,120
<i>I'm also quite exhausted.</i>

934
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,800
Please...

935
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,730
accept my request.

936
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,640
Come on, now.

937
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,010
I beg of you, Deputy Director.

938
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,860
I can't help but feel bitter.

939
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,080
All right. You do that.

940
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,650
Before I leave...

941
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,770
there's something I must tell you.

942
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,120
Do you remember Lee Yong Deuk?

943
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,440
Who?

944
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,190
His name is Lee Yong Deuk.

945
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,670
<i>The truck driver who killed Lee Joong Ho, Lee Doo Hak's father.</i>

946
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,200
I heard that Lee Doo Hak who came back to Korea...

947
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,120
is looking for Lee Yong Deuk.

948
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,970
<i>- What?
- I think he's suspecting...</i>

949
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,680
<i>an instigated murder.</i>

950
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,520
<i>If he starts suspecting you to have ordered Lee Yong Deuk...</i>

951
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,250
it'll be quite troublesome, won't it?

952
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,100
Team Captain Oh, mind what you say.

953
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,920
I'm sorry.

954
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,050
Take care of it on your own volition before you leave.

955
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,670
Yes, I'll take care of it myself.

956
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,420
Also...

957
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,570
there's one more thing I must tell you.

958
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:58,840
<i>I'm telling you this out of my sincere loyalty.</i>

959
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,160
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong...

960
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,260
isn't your...

961
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,670
biological son.

962
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,130
I'm sorry, Deputy Director.

963
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,840
However...

964
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,660
I couldn't bare to...

965
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,950
let you live on fooled...

966
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,760
without knowing anything.

967
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:59,860
Does anyone else besides you know this fact?

968
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,050
You're the first one I told, Deputy Director.

969
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:07,590
I also knew that Cheol Woong...

970
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,110
isn't my biological son.

971
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,020
Wait, but why...

972
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,630
<i>I just...</i>

973
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,760
didn't wish to part ways again with

974
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,930
the person I longed for my entire life.

975
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,020
Choi Cheol Woong is also not bad enough to take as a son.

976
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,040
I can finally understand.

977
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,180
Why my wife defended you so much.

978
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,130
Both Cheol Woong and

979
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:42,380
Yeo Jin must've had it tough because of you, Team Captain Oh.

980
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,270
That's not true.

981
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,550
That's a misunderstanding.

Deputy Director...

983
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,920
For my family,

984
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,930
please be loyal to the end...

<i>What,  a North Korean spy?</i>

989
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,000
<i>I don't think this place is safe, either.</i>

990

<i>You may kill him if he resists.</i>

991

<i>Cheol Woong is really our son, right?</i>

995

<i>This is Deputy Director and Cheol Woong's life, as well as yours, Mother.</i>

996
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,150
<i>Please save my dear Cheol Woong.</i>

997

<i>Turn myself in? On top of framing me for your murder...</i>

998

<i>You two can't be fighting like this.</i>

<i>You two are brothers.</i>

<i>They're not!</i>

<i>You're not my son if you don't shoot now!</i>

1003

<i>No! No, Cheol Woong.</i>
