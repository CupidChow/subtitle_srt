[Episode 13]
 You should've called me!

31
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:20,051
Then I would have gone to Japan!

32
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,821
I wanted to,

33
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:27,351
but if Cheol Woong had found out about me, I would have never been able to return.

34
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,861
You think Cheol Woong would try to kill you?

35
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,851
Cheol Woong gave you the keys to open your handcuffs to escape at your father's burial.

36
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,571
That was a deal he made with you.

37
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:41,641
He probably thought I would never be able to come back after I fled by boat.

38
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,391
I would be as good as dead.

39
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,821
Doo Hak, Cheol Woong isn't that terrible.

40
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,861
I'm not taking his side right now.

41
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,811
I've seen how you two lived.

42
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,911
You two were so close that people would mistake you as brothers.

43
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,751
I found him.

44
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,521
You found whom?

45
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,651
The one who killed my father.

46
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,381
What? The hit-and-run driver who killed your father?

47
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,891
No.

48
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,101
The one who hired him to kill my father.

49
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,591
Are you telling me it wasn't an accident?

50
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:17,101
Who was it? Who hired him?

51
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,161
The one who was so close to me, like a brother.

52
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,301
<i>That man hired me to do it.</i>

53
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,591
His name...

54
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:30,131
I don't know his name.

55
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,761
Take a look.

56
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,621
Was it this guy?

57
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,651
What about him?

58
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:48,091
He was wearing sunglasses, so I couldn't see him properly.

59
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,421
Take a closer look, you bastard.

60
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,261
That's him.

61
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,221
It's that guy!

62
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:11,181
<i>He said a drunk man will come onto the road.</i>

63
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:15,821
<i>He said he'd get me out quickly by making it an accidental homicide.</i>

64
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,971
Who was the one who hired him to do this?

65
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,191
No way.

66
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,951
That entire family plotted together to do this.

67
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:55,471
Don't think that way, Doo Hak. There's no way.

68
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,101
He's more than capable of it.

69
00:05:57,101 --> 00:06:00,401
Doo Hak, you must be mistaken.

70
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,101
I wish that was the case.

71
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:05,231
You said it yourself. And I know because I've seen it.

72
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,021
Your father cared about Cheol Woong more than he did for you.

73
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,061
But you think Cheol Woong wouldn't know to be grateful?

74
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,861
I know how you feel about Cheol Woong.

75
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:18,681
But this isn't it. This is really not true, Doo Hak.

76
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:24,301
All right. How about we try meeting up with Cheol Woong right now?

77
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,161
If he sees that you're alive, he will be so happy!

78
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,811
Also, we can ask him about this case.

79
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,151
Perhaps he can reinvestigate it and reveal what really happened.

80
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,231
- Doo Hak...
- That bastard would reveal the truth?

81
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:44,951
That bastard, who's so used to hiding the truth?

82
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,761
What do you mean by that?

83
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,921
What truth would Cheol Woong cover-up?

84
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,721
You don't know Cheol Woong at all.

85
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:07,261
The murder incident that changed my life in Yeosu.

86
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:12,131
You asked me every time you came to visit me in prison if I really killed someone.

87
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,381
That's right. I lied to you.

88
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:22,271
I didn't kill anyone, but I became a murderer,

89
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,941
and...

90
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,671
and as a result, I ended up in prison.

91
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:29,021
Then that murder...

92
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,961
Are you saying Cheol Woong was the murderer?

93
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:36,601
<i>Is Doo Hak really the murderer?</i>

94
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,391
<i>Are you saying you think someone else is the real culprit?</i>

95
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,531
<i>And you're saying that's me?</i>

96
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,291
<i>That's what it is, right?</i>

97
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,631
<i>I can really do anything if it's for you.</i>

98
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,351
<i>I can even kill a person.</i>

99
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,551
<i>Let's just say I killed Young Tak. Okay?</i>

100
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,981
<i>Even if I was the one who killed him...</i>

101
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,351
<i>that was all for you.</i>

102
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,791
Cheol Woong begged me crying.

103
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,261
<i>- Hyung!/i></i>
- To save him...

104
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,051
<i>Please save me.</i>

105
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,991
And he begged my father with his mother.

106
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,951
<i>Please save me just this once!</i>

107
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,991
<i>- Please save me this once!
- Ahjussi!</i>

108
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,351
The only people who know this

109
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,521
<i>is me, Cheol Woong, my dead father,</i>

110
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,231
<i>and Cheol Woong's mother.</i>

111
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,161
Now do you see?

112
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:50,791
He's more than capable of killing my father and me.

113
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,011
Yes. We also heard.

114
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,051
When?

115
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:30,831
He told us while drinking after we heard the confession from Lee Yong Deuk.

116
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:35,621
Gosh. We were quite shocked as well.

117
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:38,161
You know he'd never lie.

118
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,891
Choi Cheol Woong, that bastard is so evil!

119
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,651
How could he do that to Doo Hak hyungnim, who went to prison for his crime?

120
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,851
Then, for some unknown reason, Doo Hak's father blackmailed Cheol Woong or

121
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:54,681
Cheol Woong's family with the fact that Doo Hak took the blame for the murder?

122
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,471
And that's why he was murdered,

123
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,901
and all that happened to Doo Hak?

124
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,251
That's the only conclusion we can come to.

125
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,351
So,

126
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,061
you all joined him in getting his revenge?

127
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,521
Let's say that's true.

128
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,401
But only Cheol Woong and his family know the truth.

129
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,371
Would they ever admit it?

130
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,681
Also, who would listen to a druggie? Don't you think?

131
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,851
Not only that, they have powerful allies behind them.

132
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,991
Please try to stop him, and don't help him.

133
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:34,601
This is basically killing Doo Hak a second time when he barely managed to survive.

134
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,291
We tried. But...

135
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,141
he says he wants to return things to their original state.

136
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,461
If he doesn't, he will die.

137
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:47,311
Even if he lives, he can't live in peace.

138
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,991
Nobody can persuade him otherwise

139
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,131
except for you, Jung Shin.

140
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,541
You're here?

141
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,141
Oh, Boss! It's been a long time.

142
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:12,641
Aigoo, what are you doing reading? It's so not like you.

143
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:15,191
- Gosh.
 - What book is it?

144
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,721
"Musoyu"?*
(It means to own nothing)

145
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,991
Aigoo, what a sight.

146
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:22,661
Ma Cheong Ja is going to live a life of giving up on possessions?

147
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,921
Oh, that's not it.

148
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:27,241
Whether it's your mind or finances,

149
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,871
aren't you supposed to empty it before you fill it again?

150
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,041
Right now, I'm in a state of lacking possessions.

151
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,381
Why? Because I'm a nobody.

152
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,891
If I fill up on money, then I'll be somebody again.

153
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,811
Why don't you just enter a Buddhist temple, hold a cane,

154
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:46,581
and pray to Buddha?

155
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,061
Aigoo, our elders.

156
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,461
- Hello.
 - Oh, hey, guys.

157
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,701
Gosh, I get the sense that this one will be a big one.

158
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:56,121
You're sharp.

159
00:11:56,131 --> 00:12:00,131
Gosh, how rich is she that we are assessing her assets?

160
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,431
That's what I'm saying.

161
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,911
Is that ahjumma Lee Byung Chul* or Chung Ju Young* or something?
(Owner of Samsung and Hyundai, respectively)

162
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,681
Who is she?

163
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,491
She's not a normal businessperson.

164
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,651
She might have lots of money through backhanded means.

165
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,711
Gosh, who is it? Hurry up and tell me.

166
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:20,221
The wife of Namsan's* leader.
(Slang for NSA)

167
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:22,251
Hyungnim!

168
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:23,981
Are you crazy right now?

169
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:28,531
Hyungnim, have you lost your mind after taking a break from this for a few years?

170
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,731
- Hurry up and go to the hospital.
- Forget it!

171
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,121
I'd rather be a nobody and have nothing.

172
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:34,971
You've gone absolutely mad!

173
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,681
Hey, hey, hey! The more dangerous the job, the greater the profit margins.

174
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:43,321
Also, she has great ambitions in real estate.

175
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:47,601
Hey, hey. How much longer can we really keep this up?

176
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,461
Think of it as our final job before retirement,

177
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,751
and prepare for our future retirement.

178
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,291
Also, if we steal the money the powerful have acquired through corruption,

179
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,301
the people would love that, too.

180
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,001
Look at Cho Se Hyung*!
(Famous thief who stole from the rich)

181
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,431
If we are successful, we can donate some money to the poor.

182
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:07,631
Let's be a Hwalbindang*!
(A group that rebelled against corrupt government to serve the people)

183
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:10,121
Whether it's Cho Se Hyung or Hwalbindang,

184
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,671
they're all thieves if you think about it!

185
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:13,751
That's what I mean!

186
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:19,061
No matter how I look at it, this isn't something that would've come out of your head.

187
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,721
Hyungnim, there's someone behind this, right?

188
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,081
There's nothing like that!

189
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,761
If there is someone behind this,

190
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,841
I can say love is behind it.

191
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,831
Gosh.

192
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:35,181
The final love of my life.

193
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,791
What's wrong with you!

194
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,301
So, are you in or not!

195
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,241
How many people have you talked about as your final love?

196
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,081
Mi Sook, Young... not Young Ja...

197
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:50,051
Whoa, this is amazing.

198
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,951
This is a whole new level compared to a cabaret.

199
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:59,221
In my eyes, every single one of these looks like a pile of cash.

200
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:04,431
How much money would you have to spend to set up a place like this?

201
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,861
Y-Yeah, I know.

202
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,071
If we pluck her eyes out* properly,
(Slang for scamming her)

203
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:13,461
we could make at least 5 big bills*.
 (A big bill is 100 million won)

204
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,451
Five big bills?

205
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,781
It's not difficult.

206
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,571
You just have to lend us your name for doing business.

207
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,701
The business funds will actually be provided by the developer.

208
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,821
Just our names?

209
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,121
What kind of business is it?

210
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,751
Just know that it's real estate development.

211
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,961
After the job is done and everyone is paid,

212
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,751
we were promised to each receive one big bill.

213
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:47,221
One hundred million won? One hundred million won for lending our name?

214
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,561
This seems like it's a large-scale business.

215
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,761
Instead of being like that,

216
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:56,511
how about you include us in this?

217
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,411
That would be difficult.

218
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,641
I didn't even get to participate, either.

219
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:03,961
Gosh, you're too much.

220
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:18,171
[Title Deed]

221
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,811
Next time, you need to pay me more for high-risk.

222
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,901
Wow does she have so many buildings?

223
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,611
Hey!

224
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:27,981
Gosh...

225
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:30,021
What's this?

226
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,891
I mean, is this all real?

227
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,031
How many is this?

228
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,541
Aigoo...

229
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:42,781
I heard you have a good eye for ancient art, Deputy Chief.

230
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:46,291
Gosh, I don't know about having a good eye.

231
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,551
I just...
 [Kim Wan Ki (Chief Prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office)]

232
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:52,071
Back when I was active as a prosecutor, I had to catch tomb robbers,

233
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,831
so I had no choice but to study it.

234
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:57,961
It's just a few tidbits of common sense

235
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,681
I learned by being around it.

236
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,541
While doing business,

237
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:06,281
sometimes debtors would give me antiques instead of money for their debts.

238
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,421
Could you take a look at it for me?

239
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,071
This is...

240
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,241
I mean, I accepted it,

241
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:21,041
but it's not Goryeo porcelain pottery and looks like some chamber pot.

242
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,691
Wait, this is...

243
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,281
Isn't this moon pottery?

244
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:28,331
Moon pottery? Is it valuable?

245
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:31,211
Of course, it's valuable!

246
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:39,181
Although it hasn't been designated as a national treasure or treasure,

247
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,271
in the field of ancient art,

248
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:45,491
it's a pottery that is considered to be a treasure.

249
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,501
Oh, is that so?

250
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:52,551
I guess this pottery has finally found its owner.

251
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,251
- Excuse me?
 - Gosh, how sad is it

252
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:59,431
to be treated like a chamber pot by me, who knows nothing about art?

253
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:02,131
For both people and objects,

254
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:06,021
it's only valuable when one recognizes its value and possesses it.

255
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,431
Do you mean it?

256
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,821
I have quite a few ancient art items.

257
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,301
If you could take a look from time to time, I would be grateful.

258
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,801
Gosh, no, it would be an honor for me!

259
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,741
Oh, right.

260
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,111
- Let's have a drink.
- Sure.

261
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,331
It increased by 20% from last time.

262
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,651
You'll be a chaebol at this rate.

263
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:49,771
You would become the chaebol, Chairman Yoo Young Pil.

264
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,911
You keep expanding the number of businesses.

265
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,621
Hey, with the regulatory insurance money and the maintenance fees,

266
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,811
there are more than a few areas that require money.

267
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,011
If the manager doesn't change, I could just pay him the down payment and monthly wages

268
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:07,701
but they keep changing, so I have to pay them more in the down payment.

269
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:11,831
Most professional baseball team managers probably have it easier than me.

270
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:16,131
Aigoo, you should stop whining and exaggerating.

271
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,781
Well, yeah.

272
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,691
Honestly, it's better than selling drugs.

273
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:22,501
Most things can be taken care of with money,

274
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,031
and the penalties are much less severe, too.

275
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:28,131
- What about what I asked you for?
- Oh Man Ok?

276
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,391
Even after he got demoted to Busan,

277
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,291
he's still bringing in a lot of money.

278
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:39,931
There are no hotels with a casino that he doesn't visit, big or small.

279
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:45,541
This bastard is eviler than a corrupt loan shark.

280
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,201
At least, loan sharks give you initial money before they beat you down.

281
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:51,891
This guy just takes your money without even investing 10 won!

282
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:54,291
Did you look for any of his weaknesses?

283
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,821
Gosh, it was so scary to do a background check on him.

284
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:59,021
This bastard goes around carrying a gun!

285
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:02,481
Until we lower his defenses, we can't do anything with him.

286
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:06,181
Then,

287
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,721
we will need to lower his defenses.

288
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:14,511
He didn't reveal his real name,

289
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,441
but it looks like an anonymous letter from a businessman in Busan.

290
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,741
What about our office in Busan?

291
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,801
It appears they don't know about it yet.

292
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,611
Shall I inform them?

293
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,471
Forget it.

294
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:36,921
There's also an anonymous letter.

295
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:39,481
And I had given a report to the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

296
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:42,061
A dog that's been abandoned by its master

297
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,741
isn't fed by its master

298
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:48,431
so shouldn't it find its own way to survive?

299
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,931
I suppose so.

300
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:53,251
But if an abandoned dog bites a passerby,

301
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:56,581
the owner will get criticized for it.

302
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,871
Making threats and taking bribes using one's position...

303
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,691
That's not minor.

304
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,441
If you get fired, you can't collect your pension.

305
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:07,251
Are you telling me to quit voluntarily?

306
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:10,001
I heard your father is gravely ill.

307
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,811
You should use this opportunity to take care of your father and be a good, dutiful son.

308
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,111
If you make up your mind,

309
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:20,511
I will ask the Deputy Chief Prosecutor to grant you leniency.

310
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,061
I'll give you three days.

311
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,941
Choi Cheol Woong...

312
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,741
I apologized to you and

313
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,811
I have served you well as a young master all along.

314
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,821
Why isn't that good enough for you?

315
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,961
You think you're my superior just because I serve you as one, huh?

316
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,651
Hey.

317
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,391
Oh Man Ok.

318
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,751
You're still so immature.

319
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:59,481
I treated you well only because you're the son of my superior.

320
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:02,781
If not for that, even if you were something higher than a prosecutor,

321
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,781
I would've put a dog chain around your neck.

322
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:09,421
You'd better not mess with me.

323
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,261
Things wouldn't go your way anyway.

324
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,911
I guess you're counting on Deputy Director.

325
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,931
Do you think you could still say that after being indicted?

326
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,031
Hey!

327
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,161
You mole.

328
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:30,471
Your fate cannot escape from me from the moment

329
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:34,411
I got a hold of your neck in my hands. You...

330
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:36,221
can't beat me.

331
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:38,081
You know why?

332
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,301
Have you ever held someone's head underwater

333
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:43,691
until he stopped breathing?

334
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:47,261
Have you ever shot a hole in a man's heart?

335
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:49,851
I have been doing those things for my country.

336
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,551
I didn't come all the way here by memorizing law books!

337
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,551
So?

338
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:56,931
Huh?

339
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,311
So what?

340
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:03,111
Are you threatening me? Huh?

341
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:06,321
Threatening?

342
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,871
I see...

343
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:12,681
I guess there's something to threaten you with, huh?

344
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,801
For example, you killed a man

345
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:21,071
but your friend sent to prison in your place...

346
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:23,261
Say another word.

347
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,741
And you killed a crucial witness to that.

348
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:31,821
The closest person to you.

349
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,271
Actually...

350
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:46,181
there is a bit more to it than that.

351
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,121
But you'd get hurt if you find out.

352
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,341
Very much at that.

353
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:55,411
Everyone has...

354
00:22:55,411 --> 00:23:00,661
a Pandora's Box in his heart that no one should open.

355
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:03,151
Deep down in his heart.

356
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,331
Me, too. You, too, Choi Cheol Woong.

357
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:07,431
Deputy Director and Madam, too.

358
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:11,651
But if you still want to get rid of me,

359
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,541
I'll open up that Pandora's box for you.

360
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,601
It'll chew and swallow all of us up.

361
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:22,771
It's too lonesome for me to go alone.

362
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,511
So, Prosecutor Choi...

363
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,421
Let us just stay in our own territory...

364
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:37,081
acknowledge each other and get along.

365
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,331
You know...

366
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:42,221
stress is bad for you.

367
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:59,701
Team Captain.

368
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,621
When did you arrive?

369
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,951
How have you been?

370
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:09,211
I had something to discuss with Special Aide Choi.

371
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,101
Oh, really?

372
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,431
Why don't you have a drink before you go?

373
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,941
No, no thanks. I'm fine.

374
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:19,911
I was going to meet with you anyway.

375
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,461
By chance, are you available tomorrow?

376
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,061
Did something happen?

377
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:35,281
Mom...

378
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:39,381
by chance, are you mixed up with Oh Man Ok over something?

379
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,011
Okay.

380
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,721
Setting you up with Keum Yeon Hui...

381
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,561
That had something to do with Team Captain Oh.

382
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:53,981
I told him to do it, and he set it up.

383
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:55,821
Don't hate me too much.

384
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:58,521
I did it all for you.

385
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:01,741
No, not that. By chance...

386
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,311
Huh?

387
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,051
Why?

388
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,491
Nothing.

389
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:25,331
[Hotel Rice Soup]

390
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,171
What are you all doing?

391
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,701
I've thought a lot about it.

392
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,491
The fact you went to prison in place of Cheol Woong

393
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:02,191
and your father's death being connected to Cheol Woong's.

394
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,051
I didn't confirm all that.

395
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:07,191
But I believe you.

396
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,021
But stop it.

397
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,281
Why?

398
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:15,071
Because things won't go back the way things were anyway.

399
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:18,021
Your father can't come back to life

400
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:21,071
and you can't get your time in prison back.

401
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:23,401
More than anything,

402
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:25,721
I don't ever want to lose you again.

403
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,311
You also think this is like trying to break open a boulder with an egg?

404
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,221
Totally impossible?

405
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,971
Even if you think you can do it 100%, don't do it!

406
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,621
What's going to get back to its rightful place in the end?

407
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:39,851
If Cheol Woong and his family either die or go to jail, is that what going back to rightful place means?

408
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,981
Are you worried about Cheol Woong right now?

409
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,691
Is that it?

410
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,921
What?

411
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,531
I get it.

412
00:26:57,531 --> 00:27:01,251
I'm well aware that Cheol Woong liked you a lot and helped you out a lot.

413
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,461
Lee Doo Hak...

414
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,681
Seriously, you're...

415
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:17,691
Fine. Let's say you took revenge.

416
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:20,991
How about the blood on your hands because of doing all that?

417
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:24,071
And how would I bear to watch all that?

418
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,201
When you were covered in blood a long time ago,

419
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:29,221
do you remember what I said to you?

420
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:33,311
Don't you remember the promise you made to me?

421
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:37,901
<i>Let's really break up now.</i>

424
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:47,341
<i>This is where I stop...</i>

425
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:50,701
<i>watching you do that.</i>

426

<i>I don't think I can live without you.</i>

430
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,041
You say you want to get back to your rightful place?

431
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:13,001
That was...

432
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,081
your rightful place then.

433
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,141
When you said you loved me.

434
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:23,401
When you said you could give up on everything for me.

435
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,311
[Closed]

436
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,141
I don't think Jung Shin is wrong.

437
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,021
She's not wrong.

438
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:55,601
Neither Jung Shin or me.

439
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,211
Those bastards are the wrong ones.

440
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,891
So, what are you going to do?

441
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:19,481
I was loyal with all my heart.

442
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:23,881
Of course, I know that Prosecutor Choi holds old grudge against me.

443
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:28,711
But especially because of that, I served the three of you with sincerity.

444
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,741
You did.

445
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:35,741
I'm always grateful to you, Team Captain Oh. It's just that...

446
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,141
I don't think Cheol Woong...

447
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:43,081
can forget the past entanglement with you.

448
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,851
So...

449
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,221
he's trying to kick me out of my position.

450
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,411
I saw your picture, Team Captain Oh.

451
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,701
I think you did wrong.

452
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:04,621
You were demoted over that

453
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,751
and yet to repeat doing the same thing is...

454
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,171
How about you, Madam?

455
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,501
Pardon?

456
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,891
What do you mean?

457
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:16,011
Not only Prosecutor Choi, but

458
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:21,341
you also started excluding me at some point.

459
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,971
Are you talking about giving up the west coast property?

460
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,891
I thought I explained it to you back then.

461
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:30,841
No, you didn't explain it.

462
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:37,001
That it was because of the business Chairman Keum Man Cheol offered.

463
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:43,121
Well, I understand.

464
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,341
You probably didn't want to share it since it was quite big.

465
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:49,581
It's just a natural instinct of humans.

466
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,851
As such, I also wanted to see you because of that same instinct,

467
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,831
which strives to survive.

468
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:58,731
I also didn't want this day to ever come, but...

469
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,291

474
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:40,641

00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:12,661
<i>Doo Hak's mother, Heo Gui Rye.</i>

483
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:29,261
I apologize for startling you.

484
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:36,631
How dare you blackmail me with such a nonsense of a fabricated letter?

485
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:40,451
I found it in the dead Lee Joong Ho's pocket.

486
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:43,351
If anyone was to blackmail you, he'd have done it.

487
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:45,481
And that's why...

488
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:48,341
I had to dirty my own hands.

489
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,781
Stop speaking nonsense!

490
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:57,221
You think Deputy Director...

491
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,691
will let you be for doing something like this?

492
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:05,671
That's only a copy.

493
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:09,701
Besides, I think...

494
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:14,181
you're the one Deputy Director will punish, not me.

495
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,781
The world has become such a better place.

496
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:21,881
I don't know if you saw it on the news,

497
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:25,531
but there's such a thing called...

498
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:29,031
DNA testing, which is very accurate.

499
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:34,081
I had hairs of Deputy Director and Prosecutor Choi compared.

500
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:35,681
Take a look.

501
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,311
Those two...

502
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,571
weren't...

503
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,681
related by blood.

504
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:50,091
I was really shocked.

505
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:53,961
I had gone to Yeosu and your hometown to investigate before,

506
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:57,681
but you had already filled every possible hole, thoroughly.

507
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,951
What do you want?

508
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:08,191
Fortunately, I still have loyalty for Deputy Director.

509
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:11,711
Give me back my position besides Deputy Director.

510
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:14,241
- Is that all?
- Of course not.

511
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:17,391
That position was mine to begin with.

512
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:21,191
Give me 30% of your profit from the business with Chairman Keum.

513
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,331
What did you say?

514
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:25,151
Aren't you getting more than enough from the business?

515
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:31,281
If Deputy Director finds out about this, everything will go up in smoke.

516
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:34,521
Instead...

517
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:39,831
I'll serve the three of you with all my loyalty.

518
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:44,041
Additionally, these things...

519
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,851
will never see the light of day.

520
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:51,171
Now, then. Please let me know.

521
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,021
It's a deal.

522
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:59,051
If I keep the promise,

523
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:02,201
bring me both the letter and the test result,

524
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,671
in their entireties.

525
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,551
No question about that.

526
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:13,341
Madam...

527
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,531
I'm happy only when I'm next to you and Deputy Director.

528
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:21,981
As long as you have me near you,

529
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:26,061
I'll never betray you or Deputy Director.

530
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:30,301
Do you still not understand that?

531
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:42,221
However...

532
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:46,441
I was also quite surprised at first.

533
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:49,891
How could you have schemed all of this?

534
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:54,731
How were you able to lie about all this without a flinch?

535
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:59,951
But thinking about it after some time,

536
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,041
I had very high respect for you.

537
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,421
You dared to attempt this scam against

538
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:10,391
the most dangerous man in Korea.

539
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,531
Isn't it so amazing?

540
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:17,611
I'm on your side.

541
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,031
If you keep me by your side,

542
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:23,731
your life...

543
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,931
will definitely be a happy ending.

544
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:31,401
I'll promise you that.

545
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,971
I read your report about Team Captain Oh.

546
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:46,021
For him to cause the same trouble again...

547
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,011
My goodness.

548
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,141
I guess this is it, huh?

549
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:53,781
- I'm—
- Don't be like that.

550
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:58,121
Everyone makes such mistakes in life, no?

551
00:36:58,191 --> 00:37:03,491
A civil servant only gets paid so much and his father is severely ill.

552
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,821
He must've needed the money.

553
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:12,931
Considering what Team Captain Oh has done for you and our family so far,

554
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,221
it'd be too harsh of a consequence.

555
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:18,161
Don't you think so?

556
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:22,331
Perhaps, did you speak to Team Captain Oh separately?

557
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:24,211
No, I didn't.

558
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:28,301
I only saw Cheol Woong having a meeting with Team Captain Oh.

559
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,721
Father...

560
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:40,911
I also think it's too harsh to rid of Team Captain Oh like this.

561
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:43,261
I think you should reprimand him strictly,

562
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,111
so such a thing won't ever happen again.

563
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:47,501
Really?

564
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:50,121
I actually didn't feel good about it, either.

565
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:55,121
In that case, we'll wrap it up with a strict warning as you said.

566
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:58,601
All right, let's all have another toast, the three of us.

567
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:21,721
Long time no see, Special Aide Choi.

568
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,981
Thank you for having me back.

569
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,411
If you need money, just tell me!

570
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:39,291
Instead of doing the dirty work.

571
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,511
I'm sorry for what happened. It'll never happen again.

572
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,341
Take it.

573
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:47,561
It's fine.

574
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,841
Take it!

575
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,351
I know your father got a surgery.

576
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:54,381
I was going to give it to you for your retirement anyway.

577
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:11,491
What did you say?

578
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:14,541
H-Hey, is that true?

579
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,651
Wait, he got his job back in Seoul?

580
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,091
Why you little... Did you really report him?

581
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:24,561
I even included a picture and definitely sent it!

582
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:27,061
I really can't understand it, either.

583
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:31,751
Doesn't this mean we can't get this bastard?

584
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,931
I guess so.

585
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:39,201
We didn't think this through.

586
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:44,641
We believed in justice when we're just thugs.

587
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:51,351
My goodness, this place is plastered with Donald Chow and Leslie Cheung.

588
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:54,771
I told her to add my favorite Joey Wong, too.

589
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,991
And Joey Wong doesn't like you.

590
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:57,931
I know.

591
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,761
That's what he was saying, so...

592
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:01,451
Auntie!

593
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,811
Why are you so surprised?

594
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:07,441
Am I prohibited from coming here?

595
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:11,151
Hey, President Oh! Long time no see.

596
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:13,041
I thought you had cut ties with me.

597
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:16,161
My, my. Even if we cut ties...

598
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:18,631
can't I still be a guest at least?

599
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:22,051
Hey, you brat, did you cut ties with me, too?

600
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:26,151
You need to treat your auntie to a glass of juice at least.

601
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:29,501
What brings you here?

602
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,691
My goodness. Why are you so impatient?

603
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,791
Let me just have a sip before we talk.

604
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,981
I heard the Hong Kong movies are quite the money, huh?

605
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,841
It's not just "quite the money."

606
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,901
It's as sweet as honey.

607
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:50,181
Copyright income on videos is great, too.

608
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:56,351
You didn't come to try and get a hand on our business, did you?

609
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:59,441
My, keep that mouth of yours shut for a while.

610
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,091
Before I dice it up, all right?

611
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,951
Are you getting by a little now?

612
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:11,871
We only just got started.

613
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:15,801
On top of that, all of this was started on loan.

614
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:20,821
I stopped by that film academy place on the way here.

615
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:25,871
I heard you reserved a few scenarios written by directors from that place.

616
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:29,511
Was it "Marriage Story" or something?

617
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:32,341
That seemed quite bold and entertaining.

618
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:36,391
It seemed to be a new type of food, but it seemed delicious.

619
00:41:36,391 --> 00:41:38,071
I read it to her.

620
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:39,701
So are you going to invest in it?

621
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:43,481
No. I'm saying you had foresight and made the right decision.

622
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,661
On keeping an interest in the academy.

623
00:41:45,661 --> 00:41:48,311
You came to compliment me for that? At this point?

624
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:51,661
I was still called Oh Jung Shin's adopted mother.

625
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:53,451
You think I came to compliment you only?

626
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,191
I need to reward you as well.

627
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,871
- What are you doing?
- Yes.

628
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:03,951
All right! Here is the reward for our dear...

629
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,751
President Oh Jung Shin.

630
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,141
What is that?

631
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:11,941
They're shares of Namdo Film Studio.

632
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:13,231
Sorry?

633
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,631
I thought there are no shares left to my name.

634
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:18,081
I know.

635
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:19,811
So the thing is...

636
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:22,161
We're giving you...

637
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:25,041
all of our shares to you, the branch manager.

638
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,641
Including the theater, everything. 100%!

639
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,281
Hey, hey, look at this.

640
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,381
What the heck is going on here?

641
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:37,741
Auntie, are you really going to hand over everything to Jung Shin?

642
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,461
What are you scheming?

643
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,601
Scheming?

644
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:52,071
I guess I am scheming something.

645

I'm going to stop working now...

Gosh, like this, again...

When you were kicked out last time...

651
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:15,781
it wasn't President Cha's will, either.

Yes, yes! I'll be right there!

Although we only got a small burn in the corner...

- Oh, yes.

809
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:49,611
I guess I didn't live too badly.

810
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,721
I got to invest and get some shares in my guys'

811
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:55,061
pachinko and casino places.

812
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:59,731
So I'm getting by with a few bucks coming from there.

813
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:03,081
By the way, this is legal.

814
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:08,431
Looks like you got an upgrade, President Yeom.

815
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:11,501
- Congratulations.
- Aigoo, you flatter me.

816
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,511
By the way, from what I hear,

817
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:17,481
your company also takes care of this sort of business.

818
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,071
Please take good care of me.

819
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,891
As a matter of fact, I clearly told my guys.

820
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:26,801
I told them to let you take over a good gaming house after you retire,

821
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:34,141
not to mention pay for the current monthly health maintenance fee.

822
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:36,681
Even if they're empty words,

823
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,341
they make me feel important, so I'm pretty happy.

824
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:41,111
What are you saying–

825
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:43,221
I never speak empty words.

826
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:48,001
I received a solid promise, Team Captain.

827
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,631
By the way...

828
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:54,211
where's the business located?

829
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,071
I'd like to go see it in person.

830
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,501
Absolutely! Of course, you should pay a visit.

831
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:05,571
- Here, please have a glass.
- No, thank you.

832
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:08,741
All right. I'll personally escort you to the business myself.

833
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:12,751
We can talk about business once we get there.

834
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:14,701
Hey, tell the girls to get in here!

835
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:16,271

Team Captain, I love you!

841
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:37,861
How embarrassing, gosh.

842
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,131
Thank you, thank you.

843
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:42,281
Oppa, you should sing a song, too.

844
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,401
Oppa, just have one glass.

845
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,851
- Forget it.
- Just one!

846
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,971
- Forget it.
- Why not?

847
00:53:52,031 --> 00:53:53,441
Team Captain!

848
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:57,201
Here, please have a glass.

849
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:01,121
- I don't drink.
- Of course not.

850
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:04,021
This is water. Just water.

851
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:08,161
Here.

852
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,981
Here's to our loyalty. Cheers!

853
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:15,871
Thank you.

854
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:21,611
Yeah!

855
00:54:25,746 --> 00:54:27,846
Water...

856
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:35,066
You awake now?

857
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:37,416
Who the hell are you lot?

858
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:39,896
We're the ones who run the gaming places.

859
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:41,176
You said you wanted a look.

860
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:44,006
This is where we do business.

861
00:54:44,006 --> 00:54:46,466
You shitty thugs.

862
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:49,206
Where's Yeom Gwang Tak?

863
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:52,166
Gwang Tak hyungnim went to cure his hangover.

864
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:06,996
Did you wait long?

865
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:09,416
Gosh, it's cold.

866
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:15,626
Nothing better than oden and soju when it's cold like this, right?

867
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:23,206
Man, an oden date

868
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,496
is perfect for late night.

869
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:29,376
About Doo Hak's father...

870
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:35,576
Did you kill him because you were afraid he'd expose that...

871
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:37,756
Doo Hak went to jail in your place?

872
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:45,156
Don't you know who I am?

873
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:48,806
Of course, I do.

874
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,486
You're a government employee.

875
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,656
One who tortures!

876
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,486
One who pockets money!

877
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:59,556
One who murders!

878
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:03,046
Am I wrong?

879
00:56:03,046 --> 00:56:06,216
What do you want from me?

880
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:13,326
If you're honest, I'll let you go alive.

881
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,846
Or else, you're a dead man.

882
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:21,446
You know Lee Joong Ho from Sungnam, right?

883
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:25,706
The one you ordered Lee Yong Deuk to run over with a truck.

884
00:56:25,706 --> 00:56:28,496
- I don't know.
- You little...

885
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,366
Bring him.

886
00:56:32,366 --> 00:56:34,326
- Bring him.
- Yes, Hyungnim.

887
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,776
Take a look.

888
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:51,826
Is this the bastard?

889
00:56:57,056 --> 00:56:58,716
Yes, yes.

890
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,586
It's this bastard.

891
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:03,626
This bastard gave me the order. This one.

892
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:08,466
What's this bullshit?

893
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,656
Who are you?

894
00:57:09,656 --> 00:57:11,406
You made me do it...

895
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:14,336
for 30 million won.

896
00:57:14,336 --> 00:57:16,566
I never did anything like that.

897
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:21,886
Lee Yong Deuk recognizes you,

898
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:24,926
but our dear Man Ok doesn't recognize his friend.

899
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:27,656
Take him back.

900
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,846
Come here, punk.

901
00:57:35,606 --> 00:57:37,236
Hurry up and spill it.

902
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:38,666
This, again?

903
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,316
I'm right, though.

904
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:45,036
Doo Hak carried your murder charge and went to prison in your place.

905
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:47,026
I know.

906
00:57:48,526 --> 00:57:53,266
You and either of your parents probably pleaded with Doo Hak's father.

907
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:56,486
Since he was their servant.

908
00:57:58,086 --> 00:58:01,786
Aren't you being too harsh, seriously?

909
00:58:02,786 --> 00:58:05,686
I told you that's not true.

910
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,986
What can I do?

911
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:11,126
What can I do to make you believe me?

912
00:58:11,126 --> 00:58:14,236
Should I split open my stomach and show you my guts? Huh?

913
00:58:14,236 --> 00:58:16,156
Hurry up and spill it.

914
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:22,036
If you have a brain, use it to think.

915
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:25,366
You'll kill me if I don't blow?

916
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:29,766
You'll kill me even if I do, you son of a bitch.

917
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,846
Even if I—

918
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:40,486
Doo Hak and...

919
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:43,266
Doo Hak's father won't speak because they're dead,

920
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:47,546
but you... You really shouldn't do this.

921
00:58:47,546 --> 00:58:49,296
No.

922
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:53,616
No, it's really not like that.

923
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:56,426
Jung Shin, let's stop talking about this

924
00:58:56,426 --> 00:58:59,406
and talk about something else.

925
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:01,036
If...

926
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:04,726
Doo Hak was alive...

927
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:08,866
If his father was still alive, would you still talk like that in front of them?

928
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:20,146
This bastard...

929
00:59:20,146 --> 00:59:23,036
was alive, huh?

930
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:24,886
Hey–

931
00:59:31,126 --> 00:59:34,356
I wondered who you could be.

932
00:59:34,356 --> 00:59:36,876
Lee Doo Hak...

933
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:39,076
you were still alive.

934
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,876
You've lost your touch a lot.

935
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:51,456
I wonder what it feels like to die by your own gun.

936
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:55,096
Yes.

937
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:58,316
I can say the same.

938
00:59:58,316 --> 01:00:00,076
I can say it's not true.

939
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:02,906
Even if I die, and meet those two,

940
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:06,156
I can say it's not true!

941

942

committed too many sins,

943
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:21,216
