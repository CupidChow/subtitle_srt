00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,990
This bastard...

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,210
was alive, huh?

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,850
Oh Man Ok, you...

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,480
committed too many sins,

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,530
so you can't be convicted within the boundaries of the law.

[3 days ago]

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,590
The drug addict Lee Yong Deuk killed Doo Hak's father and covered it up as an accident.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,840
<i>The one who ordered him to do so on the outside is</i>

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh Man Ok.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,180
But Oh Man Ok has no particular motive

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,860
for killing Doo Hak's father. 
[Episode 14]

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,350
Then that means that Oh Man Ok's boss gave him the order.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,190
It could be the orders of just one person,

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,470
<i>or it could be the will of the entire family.</i>

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,470
Can't we just report this to the police?

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,810
Geez!

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,990
Hey, now that you've grown a bit older,

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,330
shouldn't your brain start working by now?

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,880
How could the police handle Namsan?

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,870
Also, who would listen to the words of a drug addict?

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,040
Who would believe him?

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,650
Oh, you're right.

24
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,430
They wouldn't be able to handle them.

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,670
But as Young Pil found in his background search,

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,090
<i>Oh Man Ok is so caught up with filling his own belly that he even resorts to taking money from casinos.</i>

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,160
<i>Also, although he's the right-hand man of this family,</i>

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,660
he's got a grudge against Choi Cheol Woong.

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,440
Then, it's very likely that Choi Cheol Woong demoted him to Busan.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,190
- Yeah.
- But...

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,100
he was brought back right away.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,760
The one who brought him back was probably Hwang Choong Sung.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,690
<i>Since he was his long-time right-hand man.</i>

34
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,690
<i>I mean, Choi Cheol Woong probably couldn't do anything about it, either.</i>

35
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,910
More importantly, he knows the corruption of that family best.

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,180
So it appears he decided that it was best to keep him around,

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,170
coddle him, and keep an eye on him.

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,160
Usually, the traitor is someone who's closest to the boss or knows him well.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,080
Really? The closest one...

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,660
Gosh, you bastard!

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,270
I'm just joking!

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,430
In any case, if they all stick together, we can't touch them.

43
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,340
They have power, money,

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,380
a prosecutor who has the right to investigate cases,

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,160
and a vicious hunting dog who wouldn't hesitate to kill.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,430
We'll have to break them up.

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,960
Bingo.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
How?

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,680
We'll have to cause them to doubt each other.

50

Who? Choi Cheol Woong?

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,520
No.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800

What do you mean?

62
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,870
Are you saying I protected Team Captain Oh?

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,330
Yes.

64
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,640
That's what it looked like.

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,290
Mother, does Team Captain Oh hold something as leverage against you?

66
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,380
What in the world are you talking about?

67
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,960
What do you mean by holding leverage?

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,400
Cheol Woong.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,490
I know that you hate Team Captain Oh,

70
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,500
but he sincerely apologized to you.

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,730
Also, our family needs him.

72
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,940
We need him?

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,380
You should forgive him now.

74
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,390
I mean, I suppose you would need him, Mom.

75
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,570
He played a major role in helping you acquire your wealth, Mother, is he not?

76
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,930
Cheol Woong, I did that for your future–

77
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,160
No, no, no.

78
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,230
It wasn't for my future,

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,750
but you nearly screwed up my future.

80
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,080
Your real estate...

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,050
was purchased with the knowledge of the development plans ahead of time.

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,710
It's not just me.

83
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,600
Everyone does it!

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,440
You know that much!

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,110
Everyone does it?

86
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,220
Ordinary people don't have access to such power or information.

87
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,320
And there's no way Oh Man Ok did that for you, purely out of loyalty.

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
And you are not the type who wouldn't compensate him for it, either, Mom.

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,610
That will all become evidence later.

90
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,080
That is necessary.

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,590
Does a horse run only by whipping it?

92
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,770
It also needs to be given carrots for it run!

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,470
That's...

94
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,550
because a horse is a beast that can be tamed.

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh Man Ok is not a beast you can tame, Mom.

Team Captain Oh can't do whatever he wants against us or betray us.

Everything that Oh Man Ok knows about us,

100
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,060
that will all be a deadly weapon that he can use against us, Mom!

Why are you being like this?

Your father, you, and I all agreed to move past this already.

Let's stop this now, please?

105
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,130
Oh Man Ok threatened me before.

106
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,700
In this spot.

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,950
What?

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,250
He threatened me,

109
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,600
knowing that I murdered someone and had Doo Hak hyung take the blame.

110
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,630
And...

111
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,590
And what else did he threaten you with?

112
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,380
<i>Also, the fact that the person closest to you</i>

113
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,880
<i>had the definitive witness killed.</i>

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,410
I'm asking just in case,

115
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,200
but Joong Ho ahjussi...

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,400
were you responsible?

117
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,090
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,620
Are you trying to say that I ordered him to kill Ahjussi?

119
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,530
That was an accident!

120
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,370
If you weren't responsible, then tell me so.

121
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,630
Don't look at me with those eyes!

122
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,950
It's not me.

123
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,540
I'm not responsible for that!

124
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,690
Then...

125
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,200
was it Father?

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,700
Cheol Woong.

127
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,550
Tell me the truth, Mom.

128
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,250
Do you know what that guy said to me?

129
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,400
He said the one closest to me did it.

130
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,160
So, please tell me the truth.

131
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,810
Lee Joong Ho threatened your mother.

Honey...

133
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,370
- Excuse me? 
 - While Team Captain Oh was acting as your mother's security,

134
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,240
he found out about Lee Joong Ho's threats.

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,360
I found out later after receiving his report

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,750
that he took care of it by himself.

137
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,590
Does that make any sense?

138
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,350
How could Team Captain Oh do that by himself?

139
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,460
There are times in our field when we take action first and then report later.

140
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,470
You know that as well.

141
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,750
But even so, that is a bit–

142
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,890
Don't make this a problem any more.

143
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,050
You can't make this a problem, and you shouldn't do so, either.

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,060
You want me to tell you the truth?

145
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,440
The truth is...

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,250
knowing the truth is not always right and worthwhile.

147
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,130
An uncomfortable truth can actually cause chaos to society,

148
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,150
and destroy a nation.

149
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,350
At times, it is more often than not

150
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,050
more right and worthwhile not to know it or to cover it up.

151
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,990
But if you still feel that you must know the truth, then go ahead and try it.

152
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,930
In return,

153
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,480
you will have to lay everything down.

154
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,130
Your ambitions,

155
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,970
and your love.

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,130
I was so shocked as well.

157
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,530
I didn't know Team Captain Oh would go to that extent.

158
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,910
Did Ahjussi...

159
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,470
really demand money from you?

160
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,190
Yeah.

161
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,700
And so did you give it to him?

162
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,640
That real estate agency Doo Hak's mother is running

163
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,050
got started using my money.

164
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,930
It's the truth.

165
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,700
Honestly,

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,180
I can't believe it.

167
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,990
He's not someone who would do that.

168
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,230
I was the same.

169
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,680
I guess it was hard for him to come up here without any money.

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,500
He was like...

171
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,930
a real father to me.

172
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,670
I know.

173
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,870
So, that's why

174
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,160
I couldn't really tell you these things.

175
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,160
<i>When I look at you, Cheol Woong,</i>

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,870
<i>you take after your grandfather.</i>

177
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,260
<i>You will become a great person</i>

178
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,130
<i>just like your grandfather.</i>

179
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,120
<i>Well, If I could be like him in the slightest, I would be happy.</i>

180
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,130
<i>Aigoo, how you're also humble...</i>

181
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,750
<i>You are truly an adult. Really.</i>

182
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,300
<i>Cheol Woong...</i>

183
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>let me give you a hug.</i>

184
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,520
[1 day ago]

185
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,960
Hello?

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,550
<i>It's me.</i>

187
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,080
If you still can't believe me,

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,620
you can ask Cheol Woong yourself.

189
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,330
Would Cheol Woong admit it even if I asked him?

190
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,460
There's no evidence. So would he admit to being a murderer?

191
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,030
Doo Hak, please–

192
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,790
You can think I am spewing nonsense out of wanting to get revenge.

193
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,860
You remember what I said to you

194
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,580
before I got shot and jumped into the ocean?

195
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.</i>

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,960
<i>There's a slush fund ledger I gave to the NSA.</i>

197
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,190
<i>If that's revealed to the world...</i>

198
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,280
That...

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,020
You still have it, right?

200
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,550
Yeah, I remember it.

201
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,690
Why do you ask about that?

202
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,540
You said not to open it or show it to anyone.

203
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,230
Because it's so dangerous and you would get hurt.

204
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,090
I wouldn't be around,

205
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,890
so you wouldn't have anyone to protect you.

206
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,810
Within the slush fund ledger,

207
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,120
there is a notebook.

208
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,380
[Present] 
 Yeah.

209
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,500
I can say it.

210
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,220
I can say it's not true.

211
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,120
Even if I die and meet those two,

212
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,170
I can say it's not true!

213
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,650
Even if such ridiculous things took place,

214
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,810
would Doo Hak hyung have lived not saying anything?

215
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,200
What kind of crazy bastard

216
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,160
would live such a long sentence in prison for someone else, Jung Shin?

217
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,490
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

218
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,290
Lee Doo Hak sure happens to be a crazy bastard.

219
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,960
Choi Cheol Woong.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,980
You were such a good friend to me.

221
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,150
And a friend I felt bad for.

222
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,280
I really hoped it wasn't you.

223
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,920
<i>That day,</i>

224
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,350
<i>it was raining heavily.</i>

225
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>My father returned from Cheol Woong's house completely soaked and...</i>

226
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,340
Doo Hak...

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,120
<i>looked down at me while I was crouching under the eaves.</i>

228
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,630
<i>With such a pitiful look in his eyes.</i>

229
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,030
<i>And...</i>

230
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,710
<i>with a gaze that said he had no choice,</i>

231
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,400
<i>that I should go to jail instead of Cheol Woong,</i>

232
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,010
<i>and that I shouldn't forgive him.</i>

233
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,850
<i>Jung Shin was looking down at me in disbelief.</i>

234
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,550
<i>And she kept asking me</i>

235
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,430
<i>holding onto me.</i>

236
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,260
<i>I couldn't say anything.</i>

237
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,540
<i>In the police car on the way to the station,</i>

238
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,580
<i>Cheol Woong told me he was sorry.</i>

239
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,760
<i>I answered him saying,</i>

240
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,960
<i>"What are you sorry about?"</i>

241
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,130
<i>"You are human, while I'm the son of a servant."</i>

242
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,030
<i>"I'm pretty much a dog or a pig, so what are you sorry about?"</i>

243
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,010
<i>And like that, I came here.</i>

244
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,550
<i>The son of a servant dreamed a useless dream.</i>

245
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,040
<i>I dreamed of becoming a Korean Literature teacher,</i>

246
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,950
<i>and of eating dinner with Jung Shin who looks pretty with her pigtails</i>

247
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,860
<i>when I come home from work.</i>

248
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,350
<i>That was a ridiculous ambition.</i>

249
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>How dare Lee Doo Hak, the son of a servant...</i>

250
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,990
<i>Lee Doo Hak, who is nothing more than a dog or a pig...</i>

251
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,720

♫ <i>Let me go and my life</i> ♫

257
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm sorry, Jung Shin.

258
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,810
Why are you sorry to me?

260
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,660
What are you sorry about?

261
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,620
All of it.

262
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm sorry about everything.

263
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,740
Why did you do that!

264
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,770
Why did you do that to that poor guy!

265
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,880
Why did you do that...

266
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,300
Why did you do that, Cheol Woong...

267
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,920
You read it, too.

268
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,150
His dream was to become a Korean Literature teacher.

269
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,300
He dreamed of living together with me.

270
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,950
But he says that was a ridiculous ambition and a useless dream!

271
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,970
It's something everyone else could achieve!

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,900
How is that anything big or something to dream about!

273
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,800
He says it was a dream he should never have dreamed as the son of a servant.

274
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,510
I was scared

275
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,660
that my life would end.

276
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,560
Most importantly,

277
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,090
I was most afraid of not being able to see you again.

278
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,100
I'm sorry, Jung Shin.

279
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,450
I really wanted to be a decent guy to you.

280
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,580
Then, what about Doo Hak?

281
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,650
It's okay for Doo Hak's life to end?

282
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,350
Is that why you killed Doo Hak's father as well?

283
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,300
No, that's really not true, Jung Shin.

284
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,700
Doo Hak's father was really like a father to me, too.

285
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,500
How could I do that to someone I considered a father?

286
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,660
That was really an accident.

287
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,930
I did my best to look into it.

288
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,840
Now, I can't believe anything you say anymore.

289
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,860
Jung Shin, I'm tormented, too!

290
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,650
I have done so up to this point,

291
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,860
but I will keep living...

292
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,680
to atone for what I did.

293
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,740
Leave.

294
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,330
Killing that bastard in Yeosu...

295
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,160
That was your fault.

296
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,450
I was able to endure him taking my money and beating me,

297
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,550
but when that bastard hit you, I really

298
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,070
wanted to kill him.

299
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,230
Jung Shin,

300
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,120
it's true that I was wrong,

301
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,630
but I can't turn back.

302
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,530
Just...

303
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,940
I-I'll just be good to you.

304
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,450
I'll be good to you and Ahjumma severalfold to make up for Doo Hak hyung.

305
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,200
Choi Cheol Woong...

306
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,510
I don't know if I can stand to see you anymore.

307
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,710
Don't call me again.

When did you come home?

314
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,170
You must be tired, wash up and go to bed early–

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,160
What happened?

If I did something wrong,

326
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,690
you should have scolded me and hit me with a stick.

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,130
You should have punished me until I was remorseful.

328
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,880
Cheol Woong...

329
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,390
why are you being like that?

330
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,660
I even killed someone!

331
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,280
So how did you manage to do that, Mom?

332
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,100
Even if I begged you to save me,

333
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,960
y-you should've had me pay the price

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
so that I grow up, live properly,

335
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,310
and come to my senses, Mom.

336
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,230
Doo Hak hyung's life was ruined, and he died because of me.

337
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,250
Ahjussi died, too.

338
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,730
After that, there was never a day I felt at peace.

339
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,290
Mom,

340
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,500
if you'd sent me to jail instead of protecting me,

341
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,260
will things be different now?

342
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,980
Cheol Woong, don't be like this.

343
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,110
You are my everything.

344
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,520
If I had sent you to prison then, I would

345
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,710
probably be dead.

346
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,670
For you,

347
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,110
I could do even worse things.

348
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,300
If I could just save you,

349
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,090
I could even give up my heart! You're...

350
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,860
You are my life.

351
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,380
You're right.

352
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,210
I...

353
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,370
I'm your life.

354
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,210
Yeah. That's right.

355
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,230
So...

356
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,800
Mom,

357
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,330
you lived for yourself,

358
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,380
not for me.

359
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,880
Cheol Woong.

360
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,160
Why are you being like this?

361
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,020
What took place that you're being like this?

362
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,140
Jung Shin...

363
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,810
found out...

364
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,800
that I'm a murderer.

365
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,640
How?

366
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,960
How could she know?

367
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,000
I told her, Mom.

368
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,120
Cheol Woong!

369
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,110
What have you done!

370
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,960
Mom.

371
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,910
I can't hold it in anymore.

372
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,670
I just can't deal with this anymore!

373
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm sick of acting like I'm okay,

374
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,470
and like I'm not the one.

375
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,910
Doo Hak hyung ruined his entire life because of me!

376
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,010
It's same as if I killed him!

377
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,780
Not only that,

378
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,800
Jung Shin even says she will leave me.

379
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,770
No, no!

380
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,960
What do I do, Mom?

381
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,880
Don't worry, Cheol Woong.

382
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
I will...

383
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,320
meet Jung Shin and shut her mouth.

384
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,600
She won't ever report you or anything like that. Actually,

385
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
even if she were to report you,

386
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,830
Doo Hak has already served the full sentence and died!

387
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,200
So what could possibly happen?

388
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,590
It's okay.

389
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,700
It's okay.

390
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,400
It's okay.

391
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,600
How did you endure that?

392
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,350
How? You idiot!

393
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,680
It's because you were there, Jung Shin.

394
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,160
Because of you.

395
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
He said he had nothing to do with your father's death.

396
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,530
Of course, he would.

397
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,550
It was his last chance to seem human to you.

398
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,560
No. That part seemed truthful.

399
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,520
You hope it was the truth.

400
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,290
Doo Hak,

401
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,630
can't you just end it here?

402
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,510
You can't go back to the way things were anyway.

403
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,360
You should visit your mother and find Jung Ok,

404
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,150
and let's go to the U.S. or Japan and live there.

405
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,480
You should spend the rest of your life like a human being.

406
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,370
I know.

407
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,940
We should leave.

408
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,880
- Do you really mean that? 
 - I'm not interested in revenge or getting justice.

409
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,460
The reason why I fought with my life to return

410
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,080
was to meet you again.

411
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,340
I thought I would be okay with everything being forgotten

412
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,540
if I could just be happy with you.

413
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,940
But every night,

414
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,370
my heart is engulfed in flames

415
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,840
and burns up my entire body.

416
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,990
I don't know how to describe it.

417
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,070
Jung Shin.

418
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,050
I need to quench those flames.

419
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,120
If not, I would burn to death from those flames even if I leave this country!

420
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,280
And those flames will spread to you, too.

421
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm scared.

422
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm so scared that I'll go mad.

423
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,500
All right.

424
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,590
Let's quench those flames together.

425
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,610
But in return, promise me...

426
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,300
that you will not burn up in those flames.

427
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,510
Jung Shin...

428
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,800
Let's do it together, Doo Hak.

429
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,790
We can do it together.

430
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:32,000
♫ <i>Somebody please tell me now, what am I supposed to do?</i> ♫

431
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:42,210
♫ <i>Maybe you'll come lie to me now, what am I supposed to do?</i> ♫

432
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,010
♫ <i>Must have been fallen, must have been done</i> ♫

433
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,040
♫ <i>Darling, it's all in your mind</i> ♫

434
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,180
♫ <i>I will come back, Darling, have me back</i> ♫

435
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,260
♫ <i>And hear me</i> ♫

436
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,520
♫ <i>They charge for the darkness and dart for the rhythm</i> ♫

437
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,820
♫ <i>And then you are lost in your mind</i> ♫

438
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Did you sleep well?

439
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,460
Yeah.

440
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,080
♫ <i>Kill me softly</i> ♫

441
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,870
Thanks for being alive, Doo Hak.

442
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,860
It took me too long.

443
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,300
My heart was tearing apart much more when we met again

444
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,100
than when we were separated.

445
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,250
Afraid that it might be a dream

446
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,190
and that I might wake up from the dream.

447
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,780
If this is a dream,

448
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,320
then let's not ever wake up.

449
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,230
♫ <i>Please do, somebody</i> ♫

450
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:13,530
♫ <i>Breathe in, nobody knows</i> ♫

451
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:18,350
♫ <i>Nobody knows, the pain</i> ♫

452
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,950
You're here, Mother?

453
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,380
- Ta-da!
- Whoa!

454
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,630
Oh, my goodness. What is all this?

455
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,660
Well, this is your first time coming to my house.

456
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,960
Even so, it's a housewarming, not a birthday party.

457
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,250
Huh? Is it a special occasion today?

458
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,310
Yes.

459
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,460
Housewarmings and birthdays aren't the only special occasions.

460
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,810
If the day was peaceful without any trouble, that's also a special occasion.

461
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,500
My, you sound like a grandma who's lived a century.

462
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,830
Anyhow, it feels great to see you.

463
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,520
Me, too.

464
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,250
All right, now. Let's close our eyes and say our wishes.

465
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,040
Shall we?

466
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,410
Jung Shin...

467
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm hallucinating here.

468
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,900
I see Doo Hak right now.

469
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,920
I must really be close to my death now.

470
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,050
Mom...

471
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,850
Oh, my.

472
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,550
He even called me just now.

473
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,480
It is Doo Hak.

474
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,190
He came back alive. He did.

475
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,610
What's the matter with you?

476
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,800
Mom, I'm Doo Hak.

477
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,760
Your son...

478
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Mom, I'm really sorry.

479
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,500
Aigoo...

480
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,980
I-Is it you, Doo Hak?

481
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,620
M-My baby...

482
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,380
Are you my baby, D-Doo Hak?

483
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,790
Yes.

484
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,550
Mom, I'm sorry.

485
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm really sorry, Mom.

486
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,630
My baby!

487
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,180
Lying together likes this...

488
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,610
reminds me of the days when we all slept in one room.

489
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,140
Mom...

490
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,330
aren't there any countries you want to visit?

491
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,500
Why wouldn't there be?

492
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,060
I never even got to ride an airplane.

493
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,310
Why? Are you going to buy me a trip around the world?

494
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,310
Gosh, you think that's all I can do for you?

495
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,390
Whether it's the U.S. or the U.K.,

496
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,340
you can just go and live there.

497
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,210
Is it because living in Korea is a bit difficult...

498
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,100
that you want to go live abroad?

499
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,310
Well, that's part of it.

500
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,800
Doo Hak...

501
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm fine with wherever.

502
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,380
If I can just live with my child in this old age...

503
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,000
wouldn't that be my hometown?

504
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay, Mom.

505
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,590
By the way...

506
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,050
I just have one request for you.

507
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,680
Don't ever be a bad son again.

508
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,490
You should never pass on before your parents.

509
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,190
And don't pretend to be dead, either.

510
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,350
Do you understand?

511
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,790
Yes, Mom.

512
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,960
Thank you, my baby.

513
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,820
Today is really your birthday.

514
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,190
It's better than the day I gave birth to you.

515
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,670
Gosh.

516
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,470
Aigoo!

517
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,660
Please make the preparations right away.

518
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,850
Yes, right on.

519
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,630
Hello, Madam.

520
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,550
What brings you here, so early in the morning?

521
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,280
I brought an important information for you.

522
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,500
If you aren't interested, I'll take my leave.

523
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,830
Do you...

524
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,030
want a separate reward again?

525
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,890
How could I?

526
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,750
So...

527
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,120
what is this information you speak of?

528
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,350
Changsung Group's situation is worse than expected.

529
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,510
Even our agency is worried they might go bankrupt.

530
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,210
I thought that was why they wanted Choi Cheol Woong.

531
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,250
But that wasn't the case.

532
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,490
We were fooled.

533
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,860
They already knew Choi Cheol Woong likes Oh Jung Shin.

534
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,010
Why'd they pull off such a show, then?

535
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,590
It's all for the Sooseo District Development business.

536
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,630
How much did he say the profit was?

537
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,810
I assume he probably said something like 100 billion won.

538
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,560
In fact...

539
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,900
it's at least 500 billion won.

540
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,180
He lowered the profit when telling his partners,

541
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,320
in an attempt to take the rest for himself.

542
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,460
Additionally, he desperately needs you and Deputy Director for that business at the moment.

543
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,590
How did you find out about this?

544
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,300
Well, our company's work involves keeping a watch on corporations.

545
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,060
If there's anything else you want to confirm,

546
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,180
- tell Deputy Director—
- No.

547
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,260
He doesn't know about my deal with Chairman Keum.

548
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,520
But this isn't necessarily a bad news.

549
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,730
It's wrong for Chairman Keum to have fooled you.

550
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,540
But your profit is...

551
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,880
also increasing as a result, isn't it?

552
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,230
And mine as well.

553
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,930
I must meet Chairman Keum.

554
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,170
No. Even if you meet him now...

555
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,310
he'll deny it, showing you the financial forecast.

556
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,260
Only after the business has been accomplished,

557
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,220
that's when you must strike him.

558
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,320
We must also prepare a surefire evidence he can't deny in the meantime.

559
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,000
That's how you'll be able to get your fair share.

560
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,940
Do you understand?

561
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,670
It's out of ammo.

562
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,530
Stop playing around and kill me right now.

563
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,910
I don't like playing with a person's life, either.

There was another person who wanted to kill you besides me.

566

569
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,710
I don't know about that.

570
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,860
He only left the documents in the mail.

571
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,480
But why would he come to me?

572
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,320
I mean, you told me to bring you

573
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,930
anything that will make money after you got out of jail.

574
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,830
Come on, now! Even so,

575
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,810
am I a human butcher or something?

576

Gosh, Hyungnim, your knife skills are neat, aren't they?

577

You know what's so funny?

591
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,550
The one who got the request is pretty close to us.

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,770
So he came to consult us about what  to do.

593

595
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,560
I'd be fooled by such tricks?

596
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,800
Hurry up and finish.

You're my sworn enemy.

599

So I want to kill you right away. However...

600

601

Don't be like that and use your brain a little more.

Don't play both sides against the middle.

All right. What's your business?

653
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,820
In fact, I'm trying to run a resort around here.

654
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,390
And when you run a business, complaints and arguments are sure to follow.

That's for sure!

656
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,110
So I came down in advance to get to know you while I'm at it.

657
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,490
Getting to know each other is great!

So, what do you have for me?

659
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,190
First off, I'll give you 10 million won per month.

660
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,390
And I'll take care of all expenses you incur.

Also, I heard the house you have in Seoul is about 676 sq ft, on an annual lease.

662
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,380
But it's a little small for your wife and kids to live in, right?

If you get back to your position Seoul,

I'll buy you a 1,000 sq ft apartment in Gangnam.

I told him about her.

864
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,940
Why don't you go to a branch in the U.S. or Europe to take a breather?

865

No.

I don't want to run away for a reason like that.

I'll stay here, Father.

868
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,710
All right. If you can face it and overcome it, that's better.

She wanted our family to try the food she learned to make in the U.S.

Yes.

Please try some and let me know how it is.

875
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,050
It's flavorful and delicious.

Yes, I do.

But she hurt me recently, so my heart is aching too much right now.

888
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,400
So, since I don't want to hurt your feelings,

889
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,530
I'll enjoy today's food, at the very least.

890

Thank you.

891
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,700
You know, when you look in history,

892
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,220
neighboring countries exchanged prisoners,

893
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,520
formed marriages of convenience and stuff, right?

894
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,610
They say they'll send their princess for the marriage,

895
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:29,250
but send a commoner woman to the neighboring country instead.

896
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:34,490
In fact, that was my purpose in approaching you, too.

897
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:39,530
So my father and his company can approach Deputy Director and his wife...

898
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,680
I had to make my move.

899
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,920
Saying stuff like how I said I liked you...

900
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,460
although it wasn't completely false...

901
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,060
it was all just a show.

902
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,860
But a few days ago, Father told me this.

903
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,880
He got to know Madam and got into a business together.

904
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,950
So I can stop putting on a show.

905
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,280
I apologize for acting in front of you, although it wasn't my intention.

906
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,200
It's okay since I wasn't that serious of an audience.

908
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,950
I already knew you had her in your heart before I started all this.

909
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,580
Nonetheless,

910
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:33,070
we also have a department that looks up all kinds of information for no reason.

911
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,650
So, let me apologize, but...

912
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,550
we also looked into CEO Oh Jung Shin's surroundings.

913
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:42,360
The guys who kept a watch around CEO Oh's house

914
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,190
told me an interesting story a few days ago.

915
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,830
It looks like she's in love with someone.

916
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,530
A certain man appeared...

917
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,460
around CEO Oh's house, one late night.

918
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,000
CEO Oh and that man...

919
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,930
hugged each other in joy and cried for hours...

920
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,000
as if they were loves who have been apart for years.

921
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,660
I didn't know if I wanted to tell you this or not.

922
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,040
But your face looked too lonely earlier.

923
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,700
