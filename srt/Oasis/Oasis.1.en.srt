Come, come!

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,069
Isn't she so cool?

5
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,770
Let's watch from there.

00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,630

Let me out!

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,929
Who the hell is that?

11
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,090
When I get out, you're dead!

12
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,359
Lee Doo Hak.

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,250
You have a visitation today.

00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,769
Tonight at 8 p.m., in prison building 8,

there will be disinfection to
get rid of fleas, silverfish...

What are you doing?

18
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,379
Just eat and go. Go and
wait for Cheol Woong.

19
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,760
(Episode 1) Gosh, he's going
to get indigestion like that.

20
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,369
- Add water and eat it.
- Yes, Father.

21
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,379
- Me, too!
- Hey, Girl!

22
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,920
Your school is nearby
so you can eat slowly.

23
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,409
Eat up a bit more!

24
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,060
Hey, here.

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,720

Your mom will take care of everything!

Your son doesn't lose in
studying or in fights!

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,590
Of course, my son!

31
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,129
Drink up!

32
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,539
Cheol Woong, what are
you doing not coming out?

33
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,469
Doo Hak is waiting for you.

34
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,539
Hurry up and go.

35
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,060
Your dad might get angry!

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,859
Since I have dinner plans
today, I'll be a bit late.

37
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,879
Yes, don't drink too much.

38
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,219
Goodbye!

39
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,889
Have a nice day!

40
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,659
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,779
We'll be back.

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,449
- Yeah.
- It's reassuring to see you two

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,999
stick together like that.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,500
It's nice to see! You
guys look like brothers.

45
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,519
Oh.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,459
What's the matter?

47
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,270
I am pretty much like brothers with Hyung.

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,680
- We'll be late. Let's hurry up and go.
- Yeah, let's go.

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Have a nice day!

50
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,439
What made you come out to see the kids off?

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,089
It's not that I came to see them off,

52
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,759
but Kyeong Ja asked me for a bit of help

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,249
making the side dishes for the kids' lunch.

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,079
Just a few dishes like anchovy stir-fry.

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,189
Yes, I asked Doo Hak's mother for a bit
of help since she's so good at cooking.

56
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,569
How are you so thoughtless still?

57
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,479
The farming work is so busy right now,

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,059
so how could you call her
for something so petty?

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,299
No, that's not true.

60
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,059
It's not busy at all.

61
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,279
Also, my family sent me some
really nice anchovies, so I said

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,159
- I would do it–
- Oh, no.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,219
I appreciate your intent,

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,420
but it's an educational
issue, so please just go back.

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,020
Hurry up and come inside.

66
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,750
Wait!

73

Supposedly, it's really fun.

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,009
What do you think?

75
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,669
Do you want to die?

76
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,449
Also, we're clearly minors,
so how could we get in?

77
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,650
Geez.

78
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,880
Why do you have so much fear?

79
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,330
We got seats!

80
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,750
Get up.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,409
Get up, you bastard.

82
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,600
How could second-year students sit down
while their hyungnims are still standing?

83
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,229
But...

84
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,179
I don't think you're that old where
I should give up my seat to you.

85
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,299
What did you just say, you bastard?

86
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,360
What, you bastard?

87
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,559
Did you really get left back a year?

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,699
If you can't believe it, go look up
Lee Doo Hak's transcript at our school.

89

That's a problem later,
you f♪♪♪ing bastard!

90
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,250
Damn it.

91
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,059
So embarrassing.

92
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,950
You bastard!

93
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,290
One more punch!

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,929
I let down my guard.

95
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,500
Hurry up and hit me.

96
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,409
Hyung! At this rate,
we'll be late for school.

97
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,199
Let's hurry up and go.

98
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah.

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,059
Happy?

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,440
Let's go.

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,989
Wait, we're late!

102
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,730

(Total security, education in action)
Close the gate!

Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

105
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,610
Wait!

106
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,630
Gosh!

107
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
Should we?

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,370
Let's hurry up.

109
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,090
Got it?

110
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,469
Does it show?

111
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,490
You're getting better at it each time.

112
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,399
This bastard!

113
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,419
Your butt has met the wrong owner

114
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,349
and is suffering like this every morning!

115
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,009
Oh, look at these bastards.

116
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,249
Did the principal tell you you guys can be
late because you are doing well in school?

117
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,799
You guys are worse, you bastards!

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,259
Worse, I say!

119
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,930
Hurry up and get up.

120
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,489
Get in the push-up position!

121
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,169
You bastard! Get in the proper position!

122
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,880
The results of the midterms came out.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,689
Hey, you boneheads. Congrats.

124
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,519
Our class got last place among
the second-year students.

125
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,729
Although it's a relief that Choi
Cheol Woong placed first in the school

126
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,479
and Lee Doo Hak placed second,

127
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,139
we cannot erase the shame of
being in the last place class.

128
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,519
What is a class?

129
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,989
A community.

130
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,189
Everyone together...

131
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,609
Takes responsibility.

132
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,819
- Everyone will run five laps around the field!
- Come on!

133
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,790
You bastards, do you know what kind of a
world we live in? Hurry up and go outside!

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Hurry up and go outside!

135
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,369
If she didn't like it, then
she should just say so...

136
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,209
Education, what?

137
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,199
How much more educated
could she possibly be?

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,909
That's why I told you not to go.

139
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,809
Why would you go and make trouble?

140
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,579
Also, it's true.

141
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,019
Since she graduated from college in Seoul,

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,399
what other woman in this
area is as educated as her?

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,709
What did you say?

144
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,159
Whose side is this guy taking?

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,569
What I'm talking about is housework!

146
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,439
What's so good about
graduating from college?

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,019
Does she know how to
make rice or do laundry?

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,569
When it comes to doing housework,

149
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,849
I'm pretty much a professor. A Professor!

150
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,170
Okay. Then you can be a professor.

151
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,269
I told you thousands of times

152
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,060
that you should stay away from that house.

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,380
Geez!

154
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,629
Hey.

155
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,320
O-Over there.

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,589
G-Gosh...

157
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,629
In front of the proud Taegeukgi,

158
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,349
I firmly pledge to devote
my body and heart...

159
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,719
Ahjussi!

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,360
- Ahjussi!
- You think he would hear you if you call out like that?

161
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,129
Ahjussi!

162
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,600
Ahjussi! What time is it?

163
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,949
It's almost time for it to start!

164
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm sure he'll come out.

165
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,180
What if we get caught like this?

166
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,360
What are you guys doing?

167
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,169
Us?

168
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,670
Is there anyone else here besides you two?

169
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,010
Then what about you?

170
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,979
It's clear what this is...

171
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,449
You guys are so naughty, loitering
around the backdoor of the theater.

172
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,359
What? Gosh, this little kid.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,029
Then what are you doing here?

174
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,399
This is my house. Why?

175
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,209
Yeah, right.

176
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,309
Did this girl eat popped rice♪
before coming? (Slang for lying)

177
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,019
Lies keep popping out of her mouth!

178
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,669
Piss off before I call someone.

179
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,829
So ridiculous.

180
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,359
We're here confidently,
having been invited here.

181
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,839
So, don't bother the oppas,

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,030
and just go over there and play.

183
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,300
Oh, you're here, Jung Shin?

184
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,149
The lumber?

185
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,709
Ahjussi!

186
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,969
Did you call these guys, Ahjussi?

187
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,949
Oh, well, it's a long story,

188
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,279
but if I were to explain concisely,

189
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,009
I have a friend in the lumber mill.

190
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,469
That friend asked me to help
these guys watch a movie–

191
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,789
Make them leave right now.

192
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,019
If you don't, then I'll tell my dad!

193
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,869
This girl is too much!

194
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,299
Then,

195
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,569
does your dad know you come
in through that backdoor

196
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,600
and watch movies?

197
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,629
- Does he know?
- Hey!

198
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,109
Look at this guy!

199
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,899
Who cares? What does
that have to do with you?

200
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,899
- Whoa, whoa.
- They were the ones who were in the wrong!

201
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,870
Don't be like that.

202
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,670
- I might not be able to come for a while.
- Why?

203
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,829
I feel like something
good's going to happen.

204
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,500
What good thing?

205
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,269
I enjoyed the movie, thanks to you.

206
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,669
What are you talking about? It's
not like she showed you the movie.

207
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,959
If you watched a movie
for free at my house,

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,770
then basically, I showed it to you.

209
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,700
From now, don't you dare
come anywhere near here.

210
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,390
- You got that?
- Don't you come anywhere near here.

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,200
That theater is your dad's, not yours.

212
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,639
Is it yours?

213
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,189
What did you say?

214
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,579
These guys look like
freshly dug-up potatoes!

215
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,479
- What you say?
- Potatoes don't like that.

216
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,399
Those guys need to die.

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
- Okay, all right!
- It's going to pop!

218
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,289
Gosh, that thing...

219
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,999
It's so loud.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,829
Wait a sec.

221
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,250
You guys!

222
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,539
Hyung, it's those bastards.

223
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,909
Look at these crazy bastards.

224
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,779
- You got a girl to come with you
- What do we do?

225
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,849
- To the movie theater?
- It's them, right?

226
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,809
Hyung, run.

227
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,079
Run, run! Quickly!

228
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,000
Hurry, hurry!

229
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,960
Hyung, are you all right?

230
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,629
Gosh, this bastard!

231
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,799
♫ Saying that you'll leave and not return ♫

232
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Run! Run!

233
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh, my!

234
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,999
- Ouch...
- Are you okay?

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,459
♫ My love who left Mansusan ♫

236
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,199
Oh, what do we do!

237
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,960
♫ If I could meet you now ♫

238
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,990
♫ With my lips filled with joy and sorrow ♫

239
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,640
♫ I could say everything to you ♫

240
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,700
♫ I lived with the world behind me ♫

241
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,949
Where did they go?

242
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,039
♫ I lived with the world behind me ♫

243
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,800
What are you guys doing?

244
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,369
- Whoa, whoa...
- What is it!

245
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,489
A mouse, a mouse...

246
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,160
Damn it...

247
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,020
Just kidding.

248
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,339
What are you doing!

249
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,810
I can't even joke?

250
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,590
All right. Let's go this way.

251
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,950
Damn it...

252
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,509
Well...

253
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,019
This is all my father's lumber mill.

254
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,409
Shouldn't we stop by a pharmacy somewhere?

255
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,970
Her leg...

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,819
If I ever see you guys again,

257
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,410
then I'll really kill you.

258
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,179
Accomplish. It means to achieve something.

259
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,329
Adventure. It means an incident,

260
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,389
or an excursion.

261
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,540
Adventure...

262
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,130
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

263
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,659
When did you get here?

264
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,199
I just got here.

265
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,449
But why are you so surprised?

266
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,699
Oh, it's nothing.

267
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,930
I was studying vocabulary.

268
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,499
What are you doing? I told
you I was studying vocabulary!

269
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,340
To the girl whose name I don't know.

270
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,850
Gosh, is this studying English vocabulary?

271
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,440
"My name is Lee Doo Hak.

272
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,719
I felt so sorry about and bothered
by what happened at the theater,

273
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,990
so after some thought–"

274
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,449
Is this a love letter
you're writing to that girl?

275
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,999
How is that a love letter?

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,119
Since she scraped her knee that day,

277
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,889
I felt bad and sorry, so I just wrote it.

278
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,500
I wasn't even thinking of sending it.

279
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,029
Then,

280
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,229
why is your face so red?

281
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,419
What?

282
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,749
Well...

283
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,469
it's because the sun is hot!

284
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,049
Come on, I know you, Hyung.

285
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,699
Let's become honest with each other.

286
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,670
You probably feel the same way as me.

287
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,659
That girl's face keeps
appearing before your eyes,

288
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,999
and you can hear your heart
like a drum in your ears, right?

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,809
Hyung.

290
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,889
Will you be able to beat me?

291
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,969
Who said I would fight with you?

292
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,509
I really don't care, so
you do what you want!

293
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,809
Gosh, don't play dirty with me.

294
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,559
If you like her, you should compete
with me for her, fair and square!

295
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,039
Also,

296
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,539
the most important thing is

297
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,530
her feelings rather than ours, no?

298
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,959
She is not a girl whose
name you don't know.

299
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,679
Oh Jung Shin.

300
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,089
A second-year student at
Yeosu High School for Girls.

301
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,239
She transferred there early this year.

302
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,219
Her father ran a theater in Seoul,

303
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,659
but he came down here to recuperate
because he wasn't feeling well,

304
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,600
and she came with him.

305
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,559
But...

306
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,030
do you know what the
craziest piece of info is?

307
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,079
- It's not our first time meeting her.
- What?

308
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,509
You know...

309
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,169
The brass band leader last time

310
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,609
from Jinnam Festival, right?

311
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,699
The girl who was twirling the baton!

312
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,670
That's her.

313
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,839
Are you serious?

314
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,739
I should have at least this much
information if I want to start.

315
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,630
Don't you think so?

316
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,959
♫ We are the mighty men of South Korea ♫

317
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,049
♫ We are imposing and brave ♫

318
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,229
♫ With the strength we've grown
and the skills we've polished ♫

319
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,679
♫ Let's fight to the end ♫

320
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,260
- Here, eat up!
- Thank you for the food.

321
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
Aigoo, you're here.

322
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,369
Aigoo, everyone's gathered
here together, I see.

323
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,629
Aigoo, don't get up. Sit down. Sit down.

324
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,469
Oh, you've come.

325
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,839
Oh, you are all here.

326
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,319
Well, everyone, enjoy
yourselves while you're here.

327
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,469
Oh, my! Oh, my!

328
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,899
Be careful...

329
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,459
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

330
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,269
Aigoo...

331
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,959
Mr. Choi is a bit drunk...

332
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,919
Hey, Cheol Woong.

333
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,170
Yes, Father.

334
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,289
You need to

335
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,849
live like your grandfather.

336
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,540
You got that?

337
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,949
- Yes.
- No matter what anyone says,

338
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,779
white is white,

339
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,389
and black is black.

340
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,009
Why are you saying that to our child?

341
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,469
Please wash up quickly and go to bed.

342
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,149
- Okay, okay.
- Aigoo, Hyungnim.

343
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,499
Aigoo, I'm sorry I'm always
just causing you trouble.

344
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,789
Then have a safe trip home.

345
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,509
Gosh, Mr. Choi is doing it again.

346
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,129
Hurry inside and get some rest.

347
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,380
Okay, be on your way. I'll...

348
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,800
Oh, okay...

349
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,180
Good night.

350
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,459
Ahjussi, thank you for all your hard work.

351
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,009
Aigoo.

352
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,829
It appears your father is
upset about a lot of things.

353
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,179
You should understand him, okay?

354
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,690
Okay.

355
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,179
When I look at you, Cheol Woong,

356
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,810
you take after your grandfather.

357
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,209
You will become a great person

358
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,949
just like your grandfather.

359
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,379
Well...

360
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,069
If I could be like him in the
slightest, I would be happy.

361
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,159
Aigoo, how you're also humble...

362
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,660
You are truly an adult. Really.

363
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:45,670
♫ I will go, I will leave ♫

364
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,330
♫ Holding my young son's hand ♫

365
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,719
♫ To where we plant potatoes... ♫

366
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,510
Doo Hak.

367
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,099
Your father is in such a great mood today.

368
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,279
Why, Father?

369
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,189
While I was in town with
Mr. Choi, I met your teacher,

370
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,589
and he said you entered high school

371
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,419
in the first place.

372
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,499
I heard that you also swore the oath as the
representative of the entering students.

373
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,149
How come you didn't say anything?

374
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,169
Oh, that...

375
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,389
I thought they would tell you
to come in and pay for a party.

376
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,559
Even though I am poor
and can't afford a cow,

377
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,919
I would have slaughtered a pig
for you if you had told me.

378
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,629
In any case,

379
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,659
he complimented me for raising you well

380
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,449
because you're smart and polite.

381
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,309
So I had a nice drink

382
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,450
of unrefined rice wine with your teacher.

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,770
But...

384
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,510
don't do that in the future.

385
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,869
Excuse me?

386
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,909
What good will come from
you beating Cheol Woong?

387
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,609
Cheol Woong supposedly cried a
lot because he wasn't in first.

388
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,509
It was only then that
Mr. Choi told me laughing.

389
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,569
Doo Hak.

390
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,139
Haven't I told you many times before?

391
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,109
A person should know what's right.

392
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,199
No matter how smart and talented you are,

393
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,109
if you don't know what's right, you're
no different from a cow or a pig.

394
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,889
Whose field is this?

395
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,069
Who have I to thank for learning to read

396
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,369
and being able to feed
and clothe our family?

397
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,029
That is all thanks to
Cheol Woong's grandfather.

398
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,089
If you know that, you would be ashamed to
even step on the shadow of their house.

399
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,260
So...

400
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,049
don't get first place.

401
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,549
I'm telling you not to beat him...

402
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,890
in whatever it is that Cheol Woong does.

403
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,089
You understand

404
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,210
what I'm saying?

405
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,379
I understand what you're saying, Father,

406
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,820
but...

407
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,800
until when?

408
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,630
Forever.

409
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,760
You can promise me, right?

410
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,820
Yes, Father.

411
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,429
I saw this morning that your toe
was sticking out of your shoe.

412
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,820
I don't know why that woman brought
back such tattered shoes for you.

413
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,849
Can you see anything?

414
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,309
Not yet.

415
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,259
Damn it. Maybe she's not practicing today.

416
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,839
Gosh, I'm sure I heard they were practicing

417
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,589
for the Alumni Field Day.

418
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,809
She will come out.

419
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,819
- Hey, why don't you come down for now?
- Wait, wait!

420
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,739
She's coming out!

421
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,300
Whoa, whoa!

422
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,449
- Did you find her?
- No.

423
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,580
I don't see her yet.

424
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,499
Did she come out?

425
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,979
I asked you if she came out!

426
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,580
Gosh, seriously!

427
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,680
Gosh!

428
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,380
Hi.

429
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,120
Hey, come on.

430
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,579
How are you?

431
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,619
Give me a break.

432
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,049
- I told you if I ever see you guys again–
- You will kill us.

433
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,140
Right.

434
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,309
Bruce Lee?

435
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,000
You know that, too!

436
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,199
I've rewatched The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way
of the Dragon, and Enter the Dragon so many times

437
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,030
that I'm pretty good at twirling this.

438
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,800
All right. Who wants to die first?

439
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,389
Well,

440
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,139
before we die, we have a wish.

441
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,899
H-Hey...

442
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,600
How about you die before your wish?

443
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,829
Wow, did you want to die so
badly that your brains got fried?

444
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,299
After all that you put
me through, you want...

445
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
you want to date me?

446
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,060
These guys! I should just–

447
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,599
Please make your choice right here.

448
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,969
Otherwise, you will have
to kill us to leave.

449
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,910
Yeah.

450
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,739
You guys are quite determined.

451
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,179
You.

452
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,629
Aren't you afraid of me?

453
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,889
I am. But...

454
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,770
you're pretty.

455
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,629
Don't laugh!

456
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,759
I've put my life on the line for this!

457
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,180
All right.

458
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,389
Hyung. Isn't it a bit too much to
say you put your life on the line?

459
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,659
Is it?

460
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,429
What about you?

461
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,409
What did you put on the line?

462
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,970
Me?

463
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,499
Oh, you think I wouldn't
put my life on the line?

464
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,130
Well...

465
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,969
obviously, my life is on the line,

466
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,749
and if you don't go out with me,
I will run around the neighborhood

467
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,959
yelling your name, Oh Jung Shin!

468
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,259
Put on your clothes! Put it on, put it on!

469
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,000
Okay, okay.

470
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Gosh. These guys are nutjobs!

471
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,119
You guys are the first I've seen
putting your lives on the line.

472
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,549
Okay. But let's say that

473
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,719
I go out with one of you.

474
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,269
Who should I choose, yo–

475
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,710
gurt.

476
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,639
I'm telling you not to beat him...

477
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,440
in whatever it is that Cheol Woong does.

478
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,140
You two.

479
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,860
What is your relationship with each other?

480
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,690
- Well... w-we're friends.
- He's my hyung.

481
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,370
What?

482
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,960
Oh, yeah.

483
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,089
He's a hyung who's like a real hyung to me,

484
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,569
but he was left back a year.

485
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,509
His family and my family are really close.

486
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,609
- Hyung's family is–
- Gosh, maybe it's because I ate so fast,

487
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,719
but my stomach hurts.

488
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,169
Cheol Woong, I'll go ahead. Come
after you finish your conversation.

489
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,940
Sit down.

490
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,710
- I told you my stomach hurts...
- Don't run away,

491
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,350
and sit down.

492
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,770
Sit down.

493
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,729
Okay.

494
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,609
They say you even grant
the wishes of dead people.

495
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,290
Then, are you going to date us?

496
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,739
Oh, my. Wait!

497
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,129
First,

498
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,130
I'll meet you.

499
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,669
But with whom?

500
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,599
I don't know. Let's wait
and see for that one.

501
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,369
How can I pick when I've
only seen you a couple times?

502
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,490
How long are you going to wait and see?

503
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,299
For about a year?

504
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,249
Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?

505
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,979
Can't you choose a bit more quickly?

506
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,480
One year is a bit...

507
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,519
What do you think about it, Hyung?

508
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,340
I'm fine even if it's late.

509
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,049
I'm fine with it, even
if it takes even longer.

510
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,589
Or I'm fine even if it
gets delayed forever.

511
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,979
Gosh...

512
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,030
You'll grow old and die waiting like that.

513
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,370
All right.

514
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,929
Then I assume it's been
decided as I had suggested.

515
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,430
Get up.

516
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,659
And you.

517
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,679
You'll speak casually to me from now on.
Got that?

518
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,429
Yes, miss! I mean...

519
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,929
Well...

520
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,240
Okay.

521
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,130
All right! Let's go, my friends.

522
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,329

Oh, let's see.

If there were only sunny days,
all the trees will dry up.

545
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,679
Trees need snow and rain.

546
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,609
That's how the trees grow
up to be big and sturdy.

547
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,629
Don't consider this as a demotion.

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,920
Let's bear this through it.

549
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,279
Thank you for your kind words.

550
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,779
Thank you in advance, Division Commander.

551
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,150
First of all,

552
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,899
go ahead and boost the
morale of your troop.

553
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,299
I will ask for your kind
consideration going forward.

554
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,700
Thank you, sir.

555
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,489
Look at this guy. Does
he think we're beggars?

556
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,949
Team Captain Oh, add this to your
family's winter kimchi-making this year.

557
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,099
- No, thanks, Commander.
- Take it.

558
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,660
You're the only one who came with me.

559
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,129
Thank you, sir.

560
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,889
What? Trees need snow and rain?

561
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,519
What the hell? Am I a tree?

562
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,879
He's nothing but a baseless shitty commander.
How dare he looks down on us Security Command?

563
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,059
How could he even? In this day and age?

564
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,239
Team Captain Oh, look into
that guy's background.

565
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,599
Not to worry, sir.

566
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,910
I'll go through every speck of dust on him.

567
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,249
And did you start figuring out the
tendencies and trends of local influencers?

568
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,689
Yes, sir. I'm organizing them
according to election districts.

569
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,449
We have to do well in the
upcoming assemblymen election.

570
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,499
That's how we could go back.

571
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,120
Got it, sir.

572
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,589

I have your exam results.

574
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,319
Is everyone ready to run around the field?

575
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,860
Yes.

576
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,009
But there's been a
significant change this time.

577
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,169
Lee Doo Hak and Choi Cheol Woong.

578
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,239
- Yes.
- Your ranks have been switched.

579
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,590
Lee Doo Hak took number one in the
entire grade for this round of exams.

580
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,899
You got a perfect score on everything.

581
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,870
Everyone, applaud!

582
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,800
Cheol Woong.

583
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,879
Congrats.

584
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,179
Oh, no.

585
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,130
I guessed a few, too. I just got lucky.

586
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,619
For this exam,

587
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,639
did you study with all your
might because of Jung Shin?

588
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,579
You know I wouldn't do that!

589
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,689
I said I just got lucky!

590
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,169
Well, it does get boring if
I don't have competition.

591
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,960
But still, it feels a
bit uneasy about this.

592
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,089
Then, let's hash this out.

593
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,330
Jung Shin must be waiting for us.

594
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,129
I don't feel too good today.

595
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,529
You go ahead alone.

596
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,689
- Hey, Cheol Woong–
- Doo Hak! Cheol Woong!

597
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,260
Hey!

598
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,089
Why did you come all the way here?

599
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,150
Hey, do you know how I did
on my exams this time around?

600
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,679
How did you do?

601
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,999
I jumped...

602
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,449
eight rankings in my class!

603
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,209
Wow! So, what number are you?

604
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,459
I'm 17th in my class.
190th in the entire grade.

605
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,640
It's my first time ranking within 200.

606
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,019
What the?

607
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,809
Do I have to rank number one or
two in the entire grade, too?

608
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,009
No!

609
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,499
You did great!

610
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,229
This is all...

611
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,920
thanks to you, Lee Doo Hak.

612
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,829
So...

613
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,149
you guys have to go
somewhere with me today.

614
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,520
Let's go.

615
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,490
Let's go!

616
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,030
What are you doing?

617
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,650
Let's hurry up and go.

618
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,579
Whoa, you ordered so much food, Mom!

619
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,169
Oh, Mom!

620
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,979
This is Choi Cheol Woong.

621
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,749
And this is Lee Doo Hak.

622
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,949
They're always ranking number
one or two in the entire grade.

623
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,829
And this time, Doo Hak got number
one, and Cheol Woong got number two.

624
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,170
Isn't that great?

625
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,679
Oh, really?

626
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,749
Gosh, thank you.

627
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,469
I heard you helped Jung
Shin with her studies.

628
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,939
Gosh, no.

629
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,709
Jung Shin studied really hard.

630
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,169
That's right. I studied hard.

631
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,379
Aigoo. Don't you think I know my Jung Shin?

632
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,249
If it weren't for you guys, she'd

633
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,509
never rank within 200, even if
heaven and earth came together.

634
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,490
I can do that without their help, you know.

635
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,310
Your father must be coming
home from the hospital.

636
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,079
Long time no see, Oppa.

637
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,499
I was so surprised to hear from you.

638
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,339
I did think I might get to see you

639
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,239
once at some point.

640
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,009
When I heard that

641
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,729
you came to Yeosu,

642
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,839
I was a bit surprised.

643
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,710
Let's sit down.

644
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,349
Oppa, you look the same.

645
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,540
Speak for yourself.

646
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,699
Any children?

647
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,430
I have one son.

648
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,330
He must be around high school age?

649
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,009
Yes.

650
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,219
Good thing you didn't marry me.

651
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,709
If you had married me,

652
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,189
you would've had to follow me to
all the different military bases

653
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,350
and you'd already be a
country folk ahjumma.

654
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,939
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,149
Only if it weren't for
my father's opposition...

656
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,609
Oh, no.

657
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,170
He was able to see into the future.

658
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,980
I hope he's healthy?

659
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,939
He passed away.

660
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,339
He had a stroke after he
dropped out of the campaign.

661
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,189
I see.

662
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,669
I'm sorry to hear that.

663
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,569
It's okay.

664
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,649
But what is this about?

665
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,890
I'm sure you didn't want to
meet me to just greet me.

666
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,199
Actually,

667
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,479
I have a favor to ask of you, Oppa.

668
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,050
You like Chinese food, I see.

669
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,739
Come over sometime.

670
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,829
I'll buy you some again.

671
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,309
Yes. I'll come over often.

672
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,349
I heard your father runs a lumber mill.

673
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,029
Your family is quite famous in Yeosu.

674
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,269
Yes.

675
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,989
It must be because my grandfather Choi Byung Cheol had
been involved in the Korean Independence Movement.

676
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,699
I heard.

677
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,830
He was a great man.

678
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,500
So, what does your father do for a living?

679
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,990
Yes, well...

680
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,740
He's just a farmer.

681
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,909
It must be tough for him.

682
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,769
But since he has a scholastic son like you,

683
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,589
he must be so proud.

684
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,349
Yes.

685
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,270
As they say, "A dragon rises from a small stream.♪"
(A phrase about rising from a humble beginning)

686
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,339
Of course.

687
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,039
Doo Hak's father

688
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,609
used to be my family servant.

689
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,919
But my grandfather sent him to
elementary school and got him to study.

690
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,229
And as he left for Manchuria
for the Independence Movement,

691
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,320
I heard he burned his slave contract.

692
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,859
Choi Cheol Woong, you're really...

693
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,140
Huh?

694
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,409
What I'm saying is...

695
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,659
Since you said, a dragon
rises from a small stream...

696
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,860
I'm just saying Doo Hak hyung
comes from a difficult family...

697
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,949
Well...

698
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,569
I don't know about a dragon
rising from a stream.

699
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,719
The fact that my family received a lot
of help from Cheol Woong's grandfather...

700
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,180
My father and I also know...

701
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:59,050
that it's a great favor he had shown us,
which we won't forget until the day we die.

702
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,369
That's right.

703
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,110
You're very thoughtful.

704
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,979
Do you mean that?

705
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,600
Yes. I mean it.

706
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,969
His views are completely
opposite from our party.

707
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,339
As well as his late father.

708
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,239
Isn't that how the image of
the Gukhan Party would improve?

709
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,909
Someone from a family who led
the Korean Independence Movement

710
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,179
and with opposing political views
has also joined Gukhan Party.

711
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,500
It's also effective in cutting off the funding support
to the opposition party from the southwestern region.

712
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,489
I just assumed.

713
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,650
But if you make such a
face, I get so embarrassed.

714
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,800
I ask of you, Oppa.

715
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,300
Is this what we've become now?

716
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,249
But...

717
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,919
did you get your husband to agree?

718
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,140
Of course.

719
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,319
If I help your husband,

720
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,530
what do I get in return?

721
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,620
Are you okay?

722
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,140
Doo Hak.

723
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,839
Wipe with this.

724
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,510
And let's go to a pharmacy.

725
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,959
I'm okay.

726
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,819
Go home.

727
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,699
You're not okay.

728
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,880
I said to go home.

729
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,369
Doo Hak...

730
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,150
I don't want to see you! So go home!

731
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,300
Hyung...

732
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,969
I'm...

733
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,790
sorry.

734
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,459
And you call yourself a friend?

735
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,379
Are you the only one with self-respect?
And Doo Hak has none?

736
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,480
What a petty bastard.

737
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,880
Geez, that girl. She's
got quite a stinging slap.

738
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,559
Are you all right?

739
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,699
I'm really sorry.

740
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,940
I didn't mean to say it like that.

741
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,440
Hyung!

742
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,539
I said I was sorry.

743
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,370
Please let it go just once.

744
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,559
I deserve to die.

745
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,070
I wanted to rip my mouth open, too.

746
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,079
Let's not do this...

747
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,920
and just beat me up until you feel better.

748
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,269
Cheol Woong, you asshole!

749
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,269
You bastard! Disloyal traitor!

750
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,680
Worse than a dog!

751
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,909
Hit me!

752
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,359
I deserve to get beaten!

753
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,809
Stop it.

754
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,079
It's fine.

755
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,959
What's fine?

756
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,790
I want to get beaten more.

757
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,899
I get how you feel.

758
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,570
So, stop it.

759
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:02,869
Do you really...

760
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,259
know how I feel?

761
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,820
Yeah.

762
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,830
Damn it!

763
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,230
Aigoo, my back...

764
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,360
Whoa! It tastes like honey, not water!

765
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,449
Even though you came out of my womb,

766
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,689
it's so amazing whenever I see you.

767
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,049
What do you mean?

768
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,579
Your father barely learned to read

769
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,819
and I might as well be blind
with my eyes wide open.

770
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,979
Makes me wonder how I managed to
give birth to someone like you.

771
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,009
And you even help out with farming.

772
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,009
I'm saying, how do you
study on top of that?

773
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,979
Where you plant beans, you harvest beans.
Not red beans.

774
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,329
If your father gave you schooling,

775
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,589
I'm sure you would've become
a judge or a prosecutor, Mom.

776
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,229
Right on.

777
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,179
If that had happened, I would've never
met such a stuffy man like your father

778
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,029
and met a stylish man in Seoul.

779
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,520
Isn't that right?

780
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,720
Right!

781
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,649
Doo Hak.

782
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,740
Do you when I feel the most satisfied?

783
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,729
When I awake from a light sleep

784
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:42,609
and see your back while studying at
your desk. I feel most satisfied then!

785
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,750
Makes me think, "That guy's
bound to become something great!"

786
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,120
Aren't you envious of Cheol Woong?

787
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,719
No.

788
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,059
Don't you worry.

789
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,989
I've saved up tons already.

790
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:01,789
You'll be able to live rich
and proud down the road.

791
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,169
Save up for what?

792
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,539
I know you have no money.

793
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,949
Money isn't the only thing you save up.

794
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,759
At times, you also save and cherish people.

795
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,660
What do you mean by that?

796
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,129
There's something like that.

797
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,879
So, go back in and either go to
the library or study at home.

798
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,349
Just go and study, got it?

799
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,209
I'll do the rest by myself.

800
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,469
- But I'm okay!
- Hurry up and go in!

801
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,480
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

802
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,240
Come and sit down for a minute.

803
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,040
You know, I think...

804
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,289
you've learned enough at this rate.

805
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,189
Why don't you just farm with me?

806
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,459
Pardon?

807
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,369
As for Jung Ok, she'd belong to
another family once she's married off.

808
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,569
You're the only son I've got.

809
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,709
What's going to happen
to all this farm work?

810
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,049
And...

811
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,129
I just don't have the confidence
to support you through college

812
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,689
by farming this small plot of land.

813
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,549
- So...
- Father.

814
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,949
You're saying this because
of Cheol Woong, aren't you/

815
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,679
It's because I beat Cheol Woong, right?

816
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,649
Why? Did Cheol Woong cry again?

817
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,259
Father, why can't I study?

818
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,039
Why can't I be number one in class?

819
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,209
Other parents praise their
kids when they rank number one!

820
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:08,360
Why do you try to stop me from
studying and ranking on top?

821
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,669
Father,

822
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,949
if we received favor from
Cheol Woong's grandfather,

823
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,759
we can repay them when I
become successful later on.

824
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,709
We don't live in the feudal
age or in the Joseon dynasty!

825
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,579
Why do I have to live like a servant, too!

826
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,119
You punk!

827
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,269
Are you trying to lecture your father?

828
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,109
If you become more learned,
you'll try to swallow me up!

829
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,060
That's why I'm telling
you to stop studying!

830
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:40,129
Father...

831
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,630
Father!

832
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,799
I'll never say that again.

833
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,510
I must've lost my mind for a minute there.

834
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,009
Father...

835
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,589
I'll make sure I'll never
become a nuisance to

836
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,379
Mr. Choi's family and Cheol Woong.

837
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,710
I swear it! Please!

838
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,710
Father...

839
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,409
I really...

840
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,719
I really want to study.

841
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,359
I don't even hope for college.

842
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,739
Please let me finish high school. Then...

843
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,579
I'll do as you say, Father.

844
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,469
And...

845
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,429
I will...

846
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,980
never...

847
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,069
I'll never upset Cheol Woong.

848
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,849
Father, please...

849
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,600
Please...

850
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,160
Then,

851
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,070
transfer out of your school.

852
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,399
Aigoo!

853
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,269
What brings you here at this hour, Honey?

854
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,689
Honey.

855
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,000
I did it.

856
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,029
It's all done now.

857
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,149
What are you talking about?

858
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,579
You'll become an assemblyman now.

859
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,749
What?

860
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,590
You'll be nominated!

861
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,190
Wait, come see me, Honey.

862
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,419
What are you talking about?
What nomination?

863
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,929
By chance, have you been in
contact with Minyoung Party?

864
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,139
If you're bound to do it, you might as well
hold on to a strong and thick rope of support.

865
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,409
What? Then...

866
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,410
By chance, Gukhan Party?

867
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,449
Are you out of your mind!

868
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,029
You've been nominated.

869
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,909
Why are you getting so angry when you've
pretty much won the assemblyman seat?

870
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:59,089
Come on. Listen to you. I had my
doubts about what you were saying.

871
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,709
What? Gukhan Party?

872
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,969
Are you telling me to become
a dog to a dictator right now?

873
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:06,839
I'm not saying you should become their dog.

874
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,409
Don't you know that you need to walk into
a lion's den if you want to catch a lion?

875
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,329
If a critical figure joins the party
and says what needs to be said,

876
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,559
how nice would that be?

877
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,709
No matter how much you try to get through
to them from the outside, it's no use.

878
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,619
Also, they're saying they'll
be generous and accept you.

879
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,969
Why would you refuse that?

880
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,119
I just can't get through to you.

881
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,469
Yeah, right.

882
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,259
Why don't you do all
those great things, then?

883
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,939
Honey. This was so difficult to accomplish.

884
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,820
It's a chance we can
elevate our family again.

885
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,319
You mean elevate your side of the family.

886
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,199
Our family has never faltered.

887
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,309
Honey...

888
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:50,700
I mean, how could you not know me at
all after living with me for 20 years?

889
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,599
That's right!

890
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,869
All the money you worked so hard to make,
you gave away to all kinds of people

891
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,859
and made some nobody an assemblyman!

892
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,379
You worry about the country so much!

893
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,649
Can't you get into politics yourself?

894
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,349
Instead of rotting away in this countryside

895
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,340
drinking rice wine with farmers!

896
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,949
This is my hometown.

897
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,679
This countryside you speak of!

898
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,109
I have lived as your wife

899
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,059
and this family's
daughter-in-law for 20 years.

900
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,789
I had no idea what a fool you were.

901
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,749
Do you know how much running
around I did for you?

902
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,610
Do you even know what I went through!

903
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,170
Yet not even a word of thank you...

904
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,669
Pardon?

905
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,919
My goodness...

906
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,219
So, something like that
had happened, huh...

907
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,179
He insists on throwing away a nice
table that's all set up for him.

908
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,119
I feel like I'm going
to die from a breakdown.

909
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,919
So that's why I'm saying this to you.

910
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,759
I think he might...

911
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,800
listen to you, Ahjussi.

912
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,070
Pardon?

913
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,319
Aigoo, I'm just a mere farming hand.

914
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,239
I know nothing more than farming.

915
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,719
Besides...

916
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,189
once Mr. Choi makes up his mind,

917
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,189
he is so stubborn as hell.

918
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,639
The lumbermill...

919
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,759
It looks good only on the outside. That...

920
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,309
pretty much belongs to the bank.

921
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,880
On top of that,

922
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:23,419
I think he'll find out that I've
been funding the opposition party.

923
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,089
And now, they're saying
they'll give us the factory.

924
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,139
In this situation, if he
turns down the nomination,

925
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,189
they probably will not
leave this family alone.

926
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,900
Aigoo...

927
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,339
Your family and our family...

928
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,840
have a special connection, you know.

929
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,249
With the cultivation of
unified rice beginning in 1973,

930
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,369
the production of our
crops has increased a lot.

931
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,780
However, to be independent
in grain production...

932
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,960
Geez, what a bastard...

933
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,720
Hey, asshole!

934
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,300
Someday, you're going to croak.

935
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,899
Was it Lee Doo Hak?

936
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,230
Without him, you're no shit.

937
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,010
- How dare he!
- Whoa!

938
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,270
That bastard...

939
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,540
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

940
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,459
How come Young Shik isn't coming?

941
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,470
He'll be here soon.

942
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,249
You're sure he changed his mind, right?

943
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,249
Yes.

944
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,939
Mr. Choi will say he'll enter the election

945
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,870
and they're the people
who will work with him.

946
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:08,510
We need to use people who have
worked on elections before.

947
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,119
By chance, he's not going to
campaign for Minyoung Party, is he?

948
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,779
That party already has
decided on a candidate.

949
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,539
I see.

950
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,969
- Come, welcome!
- Aigoo, hello, sir!

951
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,649
Hello!

952
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:24,809
Thank you.

953
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,789
Aigoo, you came!

954
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,859
Aigoo...

955
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,749
- Aigoo...
- He'll be the new assemblyman.

956
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,999
Our new assemblyman.

957
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,569
I wanted to live a quiet life.

958
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:39,889
But this world just won't leave me alone.

959
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,929
So, I will...

960
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,999
Although I'm lacking...

961
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,330
I made up my mind to enter the
assemblyman election, everyone!

962
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,019
Choi Young Shik!

963
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,799
- Choi Young Shik!
- Thank you!

964
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,029
- Choi Young Shik!
- Yes!

965
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,599
Choi Young Shik!

966
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,899
Choi Young Shik!

967
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,109
Everyone! Just as dripping
water drops break the boulder,

968
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,319
although we are small in power,
we'll gather our strengths

969
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:17,010
and end this dictatorial government!

970
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,519
Choi Young Shik!

971
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,089
Choi Young Shik!

972
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,819
Choi Young Shik!

973
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,339
Choi Young Shik!

974
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,549
Choi Young Shik!

975
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,480
Choi Young Shik!

976
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,659
You were correct in your
assumption, Commander.

977
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,069
You were right in not
recommending him from the get-go.

978
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,979
What did I tell you?

979
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,609
I told you he'd never campaign
as a Gukhan Party candidate.

980
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,409
All right.

981
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,460
We'll have to chew him
up one nibble at a time.

982
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,170
Lee Doo Hak, stop right there!

983
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,220
Why are you avoiding me?

984
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,269
I never did that.

985
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,879
But you never came to the
library, and you never called me.

986
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,660
I was helping out with farming.

987
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:25,049
That's not it.

988
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,610
You're avoiding me because you're
embarrassed that your father was a servant.

989
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,600
Go.

990
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,359
Lee Doo Hak, you're really
a loser, aren't you?

991
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,729
Is being a servant like being a traitor?

992
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:44,899
Did he sell out his country?

993
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,639
What's so embarrassing about that?

994
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,289
The future is more important, isn't it?

995
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,139
You can study hard like you are now

996
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,960
and once you become successful,
who'd look down on you?

997
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,569
I transferred.

998
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,240
To an agricultural high school.

999
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,149
Study hard...

1000
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,520
and stay healthy, okay?

1001
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,329
Are you saying you'll never see me again?

1002
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,650
We can't be friends if you go
to an agricultural high now?

Hey.

1019
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,779
Are you the newbie who got
transferred here last week?

1020
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,199
And you beat up everyone in room 7, huh?

1021
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,850
Are you the lunatic who got
sent to solitary confinement?

1022
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,560
What's your crime?

1023
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,019
He's not answering me again.

1024
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,729
Murder.

1025
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,449
Who...

1026
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,080
did you kill?

1027
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,249
Hey, Young Tak...

1028
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,429
Wake up!

1029
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,470
Young Tak!

1030
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,590
Why did you throw it there?

Young Tak...

1032
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:56,439
The dead guy's name was Ki Young Tak...

1033
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,079
He was...

1034
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,119
my one and only younger brother.

1035
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,819
And...

1036
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,719
he was the only one...

1037
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,049
who used to visit me

1038
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,570
and put money in my detention fund.

1039
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,749
Do you know how much I waited
for you to get here, you asshole?

1040
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,369
It wasn't me.

Choi Cheol Woong. You know him, right?

1055
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:58,279
- Yes.
- Who messed you up like this?

1056

Just go away!

You bastard!

You're going through quite an ordeal after
meeting a very refined man, Madam Kang.

1060
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,699
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

1061
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,009
Hyung, Hyung! Please save me!

Why should I do that?

Doo Hak, say you didn't do it!

1064
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,709
Turns out all this happened because of you.

1065
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,359
Don't ever act like you know me.

1066
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,229
You said you'd take care
of my life, didn't you?

You said you'll be successful in your
