[Episode 8]

4
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,217
Hyungnim!

5
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:23,977
Go, go!

6
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:28,387
What's the passcode for the safe?

7
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:32,117
You bastard! Young Pil.

8
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:34,707
You should free me from these ropes first before we talk.

9
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:38,567
Why are you doing this to me!

10
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,297
Hyungnim, why are you doing this to me?

11
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:41,367
What did I do?

12
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,867
You didn't tell me about the redevelopment projects.

13
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,937
I sold drugs to provide you with capital,

14
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:48,327
and got thrown away under a cliff.

15
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,937
Is this how brothers who show their insides to each other act?

16
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:53,477
What bastard told you that?

17
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:57,667
I was going to tell you about the redevelopment projects later in due time!

18
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:01,747
What is the reason why you need to tell your successor later?

19
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,897
That is... Gosh.

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,647
The answer is...

21
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,687
so that you can gobble it all up by yourself.

22
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,327
What is the passcode?

23
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,407
I give you exactly three chances.

24
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:22,007
Passcode.

25
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,837
All right.

26
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:27,337
It's the day you die, you motherf***ing bastard.

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,977
Happy?

28
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,517
You punk.

29
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,537
Grab him.

30
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:37,947
You bastard! Let go of me!

31
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,057
I will ask you just one more time.

32
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,927
What is the passcode!

33
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,977
Okay, okay!

34
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:52,087
7777, you bastard!

35
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,257
You're so full of luck.

36
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:02,497
All right. Since we have our history,

37
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,157
I'll at least let you live.

38
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,297
Hyungnim, hyungnim!

39
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:19,907
Money! Where's my money!

40
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,807
Where is the money!

41
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,467
You stupid bastard!

42
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:30,117
Who puts their money in a safe these days? You put it in the bank!

43
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:37,647
I know that you don't like the bank, Hyungnim.

44
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,357
Where is the cash?

45
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:44,167
I mean it, you bastard. I put it in the bank.

46
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:48,087
Next is your wrist.

47
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,767
Young Pil!

48
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:17,857
Even though we ambushed him, he fought back so much.

49
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,117
We had a bit of trouble.

50
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,507
Great job.

51
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,147
Hyungnim.

52
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:25,597
Doo Hak, your favorite one, is here.

53
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:35,117
I will ask you just one more time.

54
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:37,227
Where is the cash.

55
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,597
Hyungnim doesn't have any cash, you bastard.

56
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,127
I told him to play it safe

57
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:46,877
and use the bank.

58
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,717
This bastard.

59
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,547
Where is the cash!

60
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,047
You bastard!

61
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,577
Hyungnim!

62
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,547
Am I a dog? Am I a dog!

63
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:21,817
I am the boss, no?

64
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,717
We can't do it yet.

65
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:29,197
We need to let it sit for a bit.

66
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,527
- What?
 - What are you doing?

67
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,107
Sit down.

68
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,497
All right.

69
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:39,697
Do I need to sit if you tell me to?

70
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,117
Wow, if this went a bit longer, you would have hit me.

71
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,427
Hey, what do you think? It looks so real, right?

72
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:52,627
W-What the... What's going on?

73
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:56,457
What Doo Hak is saying is that we can't just do it now.

74
00:05:56,457 --> 00:06:00,217
Doo Hak... also shares your thoughts.

75
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:03,727
We are planning on taking over the redevelopment projects.

76
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:07,627
Gosh, damn it! Why did you ignore me when I said it before!

77
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:09,277
If Doo Hak steps in himself,

78
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:12,137
he would lose respect in this field.

79
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,847
Doo Hak would no longer have anything to say even if his juniors later overthrow him.

80
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,127
And taking over the redevelopment projects would be difficult too.

81
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:21,147
So, what I'm saying is

82
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,597
let's borrow the knife of someone else.

83
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:27,507
Yeah, the strategy of having another's knife kill someone.

84
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:30,777
The strategy of having another's knife kill someone, wow.

85
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:31,897
What does that mean?

86
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:35,437
It means that we need a substitute to act in our place, like a stuntman.

87
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,037
- Yeah.
 - Also, one more thing.

88
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,517
You're going to have to suffer a bit.

89
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:42,967
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,157
What is that?

91
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:49,087
You don't need to know.

92
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,987
- What is it that I have to suffer?
 - I'll tell you later.

93
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:05,277
Hey!

94
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,857
Damn it!

95
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,947
This bastard!

96
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,417
Young Pil!

97
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,297
That hurts, you bastard!

98
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:21,787
Come here! Come here!

99
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,477
Wait, wait!

100
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,467
Young Pil.

101
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,737
You're really done for.

102
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:04,217
What are you going to do? You're not going to be able to eat the rice soup that you love so much.

103
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,347
You son of a bitch!

104
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,907
All right. Everyone, stop moving.

105
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:13,297
Gosh, you should have come sooner! Why are you here only now!

106
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:16,117
What, the timing seemed perfect.

107
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,117
Why are you being like this?

108
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,577
Hyung!

109
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:32,637
Hyung.

110
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,137
- Hyungnim!
 - Hyungnim!

111
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,287
- Doo Hak!
 - Hyungnim.

112
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,297
Damn it.

113
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,497
Are you okay, Hyung?

114
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:58,197
Hyung, you sure you haven't lost your mind?

115
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:00,287
Are you in your right mind?

116
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:01,727
Yeah.

117
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,867
I mean, thugs aren't stupid.

118
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:08,907
I am a prosecutor. Would a thug listen to a prosecutor?

119
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,957
You have to make him listen to you.

120
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:16,197
So, you want me to incite Yoo Young Pil to overthrow Yeom Kwang Tak,

121
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,137
and you are going to take over that spot,

122
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,167
and become the real boss.

123
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,767
And you get to arrest a major thug and become a star prosecutor.

124
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:29,807
Gosh. Did you make me become a prosecutor so you could have me do things like this?

125
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:33,967
What, did you think that I did that because I wanted to see you be happy and successful?

126
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,847
Okay.

127
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:45,157
Lee Doo Hak isn't someone to act as someone else's underling.

128
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,647
Hyung,

129
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,787
you can be the boss of a national gang,

130
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,287
whose name everyone would

131
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:56,027
recognize and respect

132
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:57,767
as the baddest of the bad guys.

133
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:01,947
But, with this,

134
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,917
I will pay off all my debts to you.

135
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:17,787
Isn't that a bit too cheap of a payment

136
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:21,977
when I had to go jail and be charged as a murderer?

137
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:28,157
Come on. I feel like if you become the boss of a national gang, that's sufficient payment.

138
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,087
Okay.

139
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,677
If the results are good, then we'll call it even.

140
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:43,987
It's not greed.

141
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:48,667
My feelings for Jung Shin isn't greed.

142
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,587
If that really was greed,

143
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:57,747
then I would have already put you in jail.

144
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,927
Is that so?

145
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:03,107
Gosh, I guess I should watch out.

146
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:08,447
If things go well, the day you arrest me just might come, Prosecutor Choi.

147
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,257
But,

148
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,667
let's first take care of this business well.

149
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,617
Gosh, this bastard.

150
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:17,727
You scared me!

151
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:21,057
Also, there's a favor to ask of you.

152
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:23,297
Oh, hyungnims.

153
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,947
This wasn't the end.

154
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,657
<i>During the demolition process,</i>

155
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,567
<i>too many people were injured</i>

156
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,997
and the media got involved as well, so we need a scapegoat.

157
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,667
That's what the higher-ups want as well.

158
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,567
Lee Doo Hak.

159
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,807
We should frame him as the main figure behind the violence during the demolition,

160
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,507
and send him to prison.

161
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:50,877
Doo Hak?

162
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,857
Why?

163
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,587
You can't because he's your right hand man?

164
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:57,687
O-Oh, no. I will do as you've said.

165
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:01,387
I was thinking of getting rid of him sooner or later.

166
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,527
<i>It seems we are</i>

00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:09,257
really disappointed in you.

328
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:17,307
You didn't like sour things, so I tried to pick only the sweet ones.

329
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,667
Here it is, Hyungnim.

330
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:31,497
Young Pil isn't courageous enough to try something like this by himself.

331
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,917
There is definitely someone else behind this.

332
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:38,387
You have to find that bastard, Doo Hak, you got that?

333
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:40,967
Well, Hyungnim, is the taste of the apple all right?

334
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,927
Is the apple what's important right now?

335
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:46,547
I'm telling you to go find out who's behind all this!

336
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:52,127
The police are investigating it right now, so it will be revealed soon enough.

337
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:55,147
The police! Hey, you bastard, when did we start trusting the police?

338
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:59,127
I'm telling you to go find out who it is first!

339
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,067
What are you doing right now?

340
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,667
This is a waste of food.

341
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:20,037
Gosh. Eat up then. Eat it all.

342
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,397
Hyungnim.

343
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:27,217
To be honest, I already found out

344
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:28,817
who was behind it.

345
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:31,787
What?

346
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:34,487
Who is it? What bastard is it?

347
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,467
It's me.

348
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,167
I planned all this.

349
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,707
You...

350
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,597
You son of a bitch.

351
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,577
You should retire,

352
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:01,957
instead of thinking to make your brother who worked hard under you a scapegoat and send him to prison.

353
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,127
<i>Lee Doo Hak.</i>

354
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:08,387
<i>We should frame him as the main figure behind the violence during the demolition,</i>

355
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,477
<i>and send him to prison.</i>

356
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,167
<i>I will do as you've said.</i>

357
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:15,497
<i>I was thinking of getting rid of him sooner or later.</i>

358
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:20,227
I get it.

359
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,957
So leave.

360
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,957
Leave me alone for a bit.

361
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,347
Did you come to visit Hyungnim because he's injured?

362
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:50,927
How is he?

363
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,657
I don't think you need to go inside.

364
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,477
What do you mean?

365
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:59,977
His surgery went well, but he retired.

366
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:03,857
He won't be able to act the part of your hunting dog any more.

367
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,187
Really?

368
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,997
Well, what a shame.

369
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,907
No.

370
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:18,097
You gained an even smarter hunting dog.

371
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:24,117
This was all what I drew up.

372
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:26,627
Provide me with an opportunity to meet with the boss.

373
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:30,127
I want to get the permission to be loyal to my master.

374
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:51,037
Nice to meet you for the first time. My name is Lee Doo Hak.

375
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,687
You want to die, right?

376
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,167
I want to live.

377
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,297
And yet, you would mess with my business?

378
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:06,917
I don't know about your business, sir.

379
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:10,117
All I did was to make the first move so I can survive.

380
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,227
You don't know my business, you say?

381
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:18,657
I know that it involves clearing out the evictees. Besides that, I don't know anything else.

382
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,717
You are not a hunting dog.

383
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:26,597
A hunting dog needs to die if told by its master to die.

384
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:30,097
You are just a rabid dog who bit its master.

385
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:33,297
Kwang Tak hyungnim

386
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,307
was not my master, but like a brother to me.

387
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,057
I never bite my master.

388
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,467
If you would

389
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:43,967
become my master,

390
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:48,767
then I will die if you tell me to die.

391
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,097
Really?

392
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:54,487
All right. I'll allow it.

393
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,907
Die.

394
00:29:57,907 --> 00:30:00,847
It's your punishment for killing my hunting dog.

395
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:04,697
You just said it yourself.

396
00:30:04,697 --> 00:30:06,787
Words are easy.

397
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,407
Why?

398
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,257
You can't do it?

399
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:37,587
Instead of killing yourself, just live as rabid dog.

400
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:47,017
This f***er is truly a mad dog, huh?

401
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,967
Drink.

402
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:01,087
How did you know the gun was empty?

403
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:05,647
If you intended to have me killed, you could've easily ordered someone to do it.

404
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:09,087
I thought you wouldn't come in person.

405
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:12,177
You're a bright one for a gangster.

406
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:16,017
How are you related to Choi Cheol Woong?

407
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,287
We grew up as brothers since we were—

408
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,497
Does Choi Cheol Woong owe his life to you or something?

409
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:28,477
Even if you grew up like brothers,

410
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:32,857
a prosecutor wouldn't help a gangster's coup de tat.

411
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,727
What's the relationship between you and him, exactly?

412
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:40,817
Did you serve jail time in his place?

413
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:43,857
Tell me the truth.

414
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:48,047
I saved that fella's life.

415
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:51,487
When Choi Cheol Woong was having a hard time, working as a spy,

416
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:54,127
I helped him a lot.

417
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:56,927
Is that really all?

418
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,427
Yes.

419
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:03,257
I told him to pay me back for what he owed me from back then. I apologize.

420
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:12,847
Lee Doo Hak.

421
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,127
Yes.

422
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,637
You're my hunting dog starting today.

423
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:19,317
One that doesn't know his master's face,

424
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:21,757
whom he didn't meet today.

425
00:32:21,757 --> 00:32:24,217
One that bites and dies when told to do so.

426
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:27,057
I'll keep that in mind.

427
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:30,167
Mr. Oh will explain what you need to do from now on.

428
00:32:45,077 --> 00:32:46,867
Hyungnim!

429
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,017
Aigoo, Hyungnim!

430
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:52,297
Aigoo, your wound must've burst opened again.

431
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,937
I really almost died.

432
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,827
Aigoo, shit.

433
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:00,407
He's a clever and daring one.

434
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:03,327
That punk seems to have realized the core of our business

435
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:06,057
before he got rid of his boss.

436
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:09,097
Otherwise, he wouldn't ask to see me as well.

437
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:14,177
If it doesn't sit well with you, I'll get rid of him.

438
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:16,527
We don't have time to find a replacement.

439
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,727
Just keep a good watch on him.

440
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:21,447
I understand.

441
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,297
Gosh, Hyungnim!

442
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:37,547
Shouldn't you go to the hospital first?

443
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:38,927
Aigoo.

444
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:43,587
Don't you need to get it stitched again at the hospital?

445
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,857
You got in another fight?

446
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:11,047
You called me over to show me this?

447
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:15,377
I saw it, so you're done, right?

448
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,277
I'm leaving.

449
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,627
Jung Shin...

450
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:27,787
If I quit being a gangster...

451
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:32,087
will you live with me?

452
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:39,317
I went out so I could quit being a gangster.

453
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,127
I thought about it.

454
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:49,227
When I was really at my lowest,

455
00:34:49,227 --> 00:34:52,137
you had held on to my hand.

456
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:55,837
When I went to the agricultural high school,

457
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:58,137
when I got locked up in jail, and also...

458
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:02,137
when you came to my house last time, too.

459
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,837
Every time,

460
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:12,027
I considered it my fate, which can't be helped.

461
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,527
So I stepped away from you on purpose. However...

462
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:18,727
I'm not going to do that anymore.

463
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:27,587
Please don't give up on me, Jung Shin.

464
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,997
I'll quit being a gangster and

465
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,797
try to live with a proper job.

466
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:42,217
I don't think I can live without you.

467
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,227
I love you, Jung Shin.

468
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,007
How do you think I felt?

469
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,737
How do you think I felt when I decide to leave you?

470
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:57,037
You idiot!

No, I'm telling you all to go. Take your leave!

486
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:17,987
Oh, you weren't telling us to come, but go?

487
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,127
- <i>Oh...</i>
- He was telling us to leave.

488
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:25,097
♫ <i>I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice</i> ♫

489
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:26,857
Aren't you cold?

490
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:28,687
I feel warm.

491
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:35,827
♫ <i>Come over here, back in your love, in my life</i> ♫

495

♫ <i>Let me go and my life</i> ♫

502
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,474
That's Moon-dong and Shinhwa-dong over there.

503
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:55,094
It's slums that get flooded whenever it rains.

504
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:58,124
About 463 hectare is planned to be redeveloped.

505
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:01,814
Myeongdang-dong can't even be compared.

506
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:05,214
Original purposes were to create housing for regular folks.

507
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:07,524
But that's not really profitable.

508
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:10,144
Since we need to make capital for the Olympics as well,

509
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:12,644
we changed the plans to create a luxurious apartment complex.

510
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,064
The natives will be fighting back hard, right?

511
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,254
They can only fight back so hard.

512
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:22,624
The higher-ups intend to pull through, regardless of whatever may happen in the process.

513
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,404
Our elder is known for his initiative, you know?

514
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:30,164
Is there still a lot of land left?

515
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:32,354
Of course there is.

516
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:36,834
How much profit do you expect to gain from developement?

517
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,934
The government will be taking at least one trillion won.

518
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,514
You can say the land is making money.

519
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:50,124
However, that's not the only place.

520
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:09,474
Aigoo.

521
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,134
Are you okay?

522
00:40:13,554 --> 00:40:17,524
Oh, my. My, she's dying with happiness.

523
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,164
The map is missing a few details.

524
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:25,594
That's Moon-dong and Shinhwa-dong is right next to it.

525
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:28,454
Aigoo, there are too many slums.

526
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:32,744
What about over here?

527
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:40,024
Why are you eating ramen again?

528
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:42,134
I'm sure there's rice in the rice cooker.

529
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:44,464
Why are you coming home later and later?

530
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:48,714
Oh, my. Am I working at a company? It's not nine to five for me.

531
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:51,354
You're the one who told me to go help.

532
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:59,554
What about Cheol Woong? Does he at least stop by home?

533
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:04,924
She said he rents a place near his work because there's too much work.

534
00:41:08,964 --> 00:41:14,424
By the way, I really think Cheol Woong's mother is going to start a new family.

535
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:16,714
Don't say things so thoughtlessly.

536
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:18,134
What if he's really her relative?

537
00:41:18,134 --> 00:41:21,454
Aigoo, you think I was born yesterday?

538
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:23,494
She said he's her relative orabeoni,

539
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:26,714
but what kind of relatives hold hands so affectionately?

540
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:29,944
She's the daughter-in-law of a noble family and she also has Cheol Woong.

541
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:33,164
She isn't someone who'd thoughtlessly remarry.

542
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:37,244
My goodness. You're really stubborn.

543
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:42,284
Even the scarecrow at the fields would have more common sense than you.

544
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:45,464
He helped her with that house, that store called Something-Salon,

545
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,514
and even looked into real estate for her.

546
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:52,284
What would he be doing all of that for when she's not even his real dongsaeng?

547
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:55,094
He was ridiculously handsome, too!

548
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:58,094
Quit it and just take this away!

549
00:42:01,594 --> 00:42:04,414
I'm also a woman who works and makes money.

550
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:06,404
You take it away.

551
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:09,604
What did you—

552
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:14,984
What has gotten into her?

553
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:17,194
Careful, careful.

554
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:21,774
Where did you get so drunk at?

555
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,104
Sorry?

556
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,794
You're really leaving the gang?

557
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,094
Yes.

558
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:49,574
Let's quit being third rate gangsters.

559
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:52,844
What if Gwang Tak and Young Pil come at us for revenge?

560
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:55,024
What are you going to do, then?

561
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:58,114
They won't even be able to dream of doing that. Don't worry.

562
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:01,324
How could you, without even discussing it with us? Aren't you being too harsh?

563
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:04,344
If we started together, we need to see the end together.

564
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:07,264
If the boss just up and leaves, then is it all just fine?

565
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:11,154
He's right! I'm really disappointed, Hyungnim.

566
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:13,074
If I discussed it, would you have let me go?

567
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:15,604
Hey, you! What about us, then?

568
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:18,514
- Are you telling us to just go on about our way? Huh?
- I-I...

569
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:22,104
I knew he would be like this! He has no loyalty!

570
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:25,284
Aigoo, he finally got some big money.

571
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:28,594
So he doesn't want to share, isn't it? So you—

572
00:43:28,594 --> 00:43:30,224
You, Sirs, go on about your ways.

573
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:33,754
Hyungnim! Let us all go, too! Aigoo.

574
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:35,994
Let's go. Hyungnim, let's go!

575
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:38,224
- Gosh, come out.
- One second please!

576
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:40,784
It sounds to me that we need to now leave the illegal business

577
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,924
since we need to do the legal construction business.

578
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:45,824
Am I right?

579
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,844
Poong Ho, your crew will probably have a lot of work to do

580
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:51,084
in this construction business.

581
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:53,964
Let's start doing legal real estate developement,

582
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,834
instead of illegal real estate fraud.

583
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:01,184
I knew it, man!

584
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,994
- <i>Family!</i>
- Yes, family.

585
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:09,314
Gosh, you're really the boss! You look handsome, even.

586
00:44:10,224 --> 00:44:13,404
You'll also need to be by my side, too.

587
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:14,974
Sure.

588
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:20,394
Gil Su hyungnim and Seon Woo, you have two options.

589
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:23,114
You can go with construction or stay in the gang.

590
00:44:23,114 --> 00:44:27,634
Whichever choice you make, I'm going to give you your shares.

591
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,534
Gosh. I know it'll look cool if I quit the fighting life and

592
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:37,924
go to work everyday in a suit and tie.

593
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:41,284
But I have no education. Isn't that true, Hyungnim?

594
00:44:41,284 --> 00:44:46,814
Seon Woo, for a big company, there are security and guard jobs, so don't worry about that.

595
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:52,504
What's more important is getting rid of your gangster habits.

596
00:44:52,504 --> 00:44:55,224
- Gangster habits?
- How do I lose them?

597
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:59,104
Was I a gangster since from I was an infant? Huh?

598
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:04,784
Only if my environment was okay, I-I could've also...

599
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:07,154
- Okay. Then, we're all going together.
- Yes.

600
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,974
- I can't go.
- What?

601
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:13,574
If we all go, who's going to do the demolition service, which is mandatory.

602
00:45:13,574 --> 00:45:16,764
Also, is construction work something you can do without dirtying your hands?

603
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:19,374
Hey, demolition service is a type of service as its name says.

604
00:45:19,374 --> 00:45:21,144
Other people can do it.

605
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:25,084
Seon Woo and I can't lose our gangster habits.

606
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:28,254
It's right for us to stay behind.

607
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:31,914
- Wait—
- Hurry up and come out, you punk!

608
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:35,604
Wait, I-I think I can lose it, though.

609
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:38,994
Well, then. See you later.

610
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:40,584
Wait, Seon Woo—

611
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:42,574
That asshole, acting all cool.

612
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,194
Damn.

613
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:50,054
Hyungnim, can we really never lose our gangster habits?

614
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,724
Seon Woo...

615
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:59,274
when you clean your home, you need to wipe the kitchen and the floor, right?

616
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:01,704
- Yes.
- What do you wipe with?

617
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:05,224
I wipe the kitchen with kitchen towel and the floor with rags.

618
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:11,254
Exactly. Doo Hak and Hyung Joo will be the kitchen towels.

619
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:14,424
You and I will be rags.

620
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:16,664
Rags? I'm a rag, you said?

621
00:46:16,664 --> 00:46:19,084
It's not anything bad, you idiot.

622
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,644
Gosh, I don't want to be  a rag.

623
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:25,084
It's just that our roles are a little different.

624
00:46:26,234 --> 00:46:30,724
Both of them gets your house nice and clean anyway.

625
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:35,034
Still, you never ask me first and always go—

626
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:39,784
I just didn't want to part ways with you, man.

627
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:44,584
Let's just do what we're good at.

628
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:48,624
Still, we're presidents, you punk.

629
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:52,044
Do you want the hotel or the night club?

630
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:54,014
You choose first, Hyungnim.

631
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,054
You punk.

632
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:58,204
You choose first, Dongsaeng.

633
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:01,054
- Really? For real?
- Yes.

634
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:02,744
I want the hotel, then.

635
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:04,274
I-I wanted the hotel—

636
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,044
Why did you ask me, then?

637
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:10,014
Hey, hey! Could you let me do the hotel instead?

638
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:11,764
Come on, wait a second!

639
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:16,034
Cheol Woong likes Doo Hak's woman?

640
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,194
Why didn't you tell me about this?

641
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:21,484
I meant to tell you.

642
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:23,034
But...

643
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:29,674
Lee Doo Hak has more than just a woman problem with Prosecutor Choi.

644
00:47:30,674 --> 00:47:33,194
He's also involved with Deputy Director Hwang.

645
00:47:36,794 --> 00:47:40,574
You seem to be rushing too much. Is it because of Jung Shin?

646
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:44,564
I can't marry her as a gangster.

647
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:47,804
You made the right decision. When will it be?

648
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:51,254
Well, after our construction business settles.

649
00:47:51,254 --> 00:47:53,444
I see you've got a reason to rush.

650
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:55,354
However,

651
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:58,224
you know you need to be more careful at those times, right?

652
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:04,384
Lee Doo Hak is running the construction company?

653
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:08,194
He's a mere gangster. Should he be entrusted with such an important task?

654
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:11,634
There was a lot of happenings and it also happened suddenly.

655
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:14,334
So Deputy Director Hwang didn't have any other options, either.

656
00:48:22,014 --> 00:48:23,814
I'm going to introduce Cheol Woong

657
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:27,174
to Deputy Director Hwang soon.

658
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:31,504
That means we'll become one family.

659
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:40,424
Between family members,

660
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:43,084
there must exist no secrets.

661
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,984
Do you understand?

662
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,894
Before we become one family,

663
00:48:56,124 --> 00:48:59,674
there's one more fact you must know, Madam.

664
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:12,504
Welcome.

665
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:14,864
I'm a bit late, am I not?

666
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:18,244
Cheol Woong, he's the one I told you about.

667
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:22,754
Nice to meet you, Prosecutor Choi.

668
00:49:27,224 --> 00:49:32,474
<i>A young man who is willing to devote himself to serving his country shouldn't lose his spirit.</i>

669
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:34,654
<i>I'll see you next time.</i>

670
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:48,114
After we parted ways when you were a cadet,

671
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:51,854
we finally got to meet after ages.

672
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:57,074
Aigoo. Am I doing a good job with the interview?

673
00:49:57,074 --> 00:50:01,234
Have you been looking after me for my mom?

674
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:05,894
When I was taken to the army,

675
00:50:05,894 --> 00:50:08,194
I met a man who I thought,

676
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:11,324
if a demon exists it must be him.

677
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:14,064
According to that man,

678
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:18,324
someone helped me become a prosecutor.

679
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:21,204
And you were the one, Deputy Director, huh?

680
00:50:26,814 --> 00:50:28,914
You worked with...

681
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:33,144
Coordinator Oh Man Ok for a long time, right?

682
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:37,244
I've been with him since I was a company commander, so it's been a long time.

683
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:38,994
In that case...

684
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:43,264
you must've been with him when

685
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:45,934
he worked for the National Security Agency as well.

686
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:50,054
He should be here by now.

687
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,810
Prosecutor Choi...

688
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:15,010
my heart was heavy whenever I met you.

689
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,960
I feel that it's too late for this now,

690
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,810
but for the things I've done to you in the past,

691
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,510
I'd like to sincerely apologize.

692
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:31,250
Your forced draft and working as a spy is unrelated to Deputy Director.

693
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,340
He actually found out you're Madam's son,

694
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,830
only after you passed the bar exam.

695
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,580
Although I didn't want to do any of the things I did to you,

696
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
please forgive me.

697
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,420
Deputy Director doesn't know anything. I was the one who ordered everything.

698
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,150
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

699
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,610
I'll make it up to the two of you, atone for my actions,

700
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,120
and promise my loyalty for the rest of my life.

701
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,660
Stand up.

702
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,080
I'll see to it.

703
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,670
How you'll make it up and show your loyalty.

704
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:35,850
I wanted to die.

705
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,810
I even had my will written.

706
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:45,280
Nonetheless, I endured, believing...

707
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,670
I'll get my revenge one day.

708
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,060
Thank you, Cheol Woong.

709
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,790
Thank you so much for enduring it all.

710
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:59,340
If it wasn't for you, Mom wouldn't have been able to live, either.

711
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,420
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Choi.

712
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,530
It also pains me, but when you're doing government's work,

713
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,370
sometimes the wrong somebody gets sacrificed for no reason.

714
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,330
I apologize in this country's place.

715
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,160
I'm really sorry.

716
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,770
I was sacrificed for no reason?

717
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,760
Mom, I can't...

718
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,830
accept this marriage.

719
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,300
Cheol Woong...

720
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,010
Those people...

721
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,310
aren't humans.

722
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,980
They're not humans, but monsters!

723
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,610
Is it those monsters or me?

724
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,480
You make your choice, Mother.

725
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,130
Gosh, how freezing.

726
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,540
Sorry? Change the movie's title?

727
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,640
Yes. Change it.

728
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,220
What on Earth is wrong with the title being "The Fearsome Baseball Team?"

729
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,610
Most people already read the comic version!

730
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:42,360
The world" fearsome" might  stir up fear in our society.

731
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,330
That's the Performance Ethics Committee's stance.

732
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,960
Take out fearsome.

733
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,430
Wait, Manager.

734
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:52,830
Does that mean "My Daughter Saved from the Pit" pushes this society into a pit and

735
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,640
"Killing Field" stirs up the society as a slaughter field?

736
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,000
Our committee didn't exist back then.

737
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,100
If you're going to do this, then just blatantly censor like you did before.

738
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,480
What do you mean censor?

739
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,990
It's called review!

740
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:08,600
We're only judging according to the social ehtics.

741
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,460
If you don't change the title, you may not show it!

742
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,170
Wait...

743
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,710
Oh my goodness! It's such a comedy.

744
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,510
If we just say "Baseball Team" without fearsome, it sounds weird.

745
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,120
[Branch Manager Oh Jung Shin]
Exactly.

746
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,820
Well, anyhow, we'll need to replace it with something else.

747
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,740
The Scary Baseball Team?

748
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,200
The Invincible Baseball Team?

749
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,120
The Ghost-busting Baseball Team!

750
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,540
Are they made up of marines?

751
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,710
Oh!

752
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,490
Since Director Lee Jang Ho was the one who made it, why don't we put his name in it?

753
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,500
Oh, yeah!

754
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,000
Lee Jang Ho's Baseball Team?

755
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,450
Yes.

756
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,800
Make sure to ask Director Lee as well.

757
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,670
- I got it.
- Aigoo.

758
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:07,890
By the way, the film business is becoming boring for me.

759
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,170
The new film law allows anyone to make and import movies.

760
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,880
On top of that, the TVs and the videos are there, too.

761
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,480
It feels like the good days are over.

762
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,630
Seriously, even the production costs keep rising.

763
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,160
But if we make a good movie,

764
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,540
the disorderly film studios will be gone on their own.

765
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,820
We need a selling movie, not a good movie.

766
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,530
Don't forget that your mom's a businesswoman, okay?

767
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,140
You're here?

768
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,230
Y-Yes.

769
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,730
And he is?

770
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,200
He's my boyfriend.

771
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,800
You had a boyfriend?

772
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,140
Whoa...

773
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:02,150
Oh, my goodness. My, he looks neat and handsome.

774
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,580
Your name is?

775
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,950
- My name is Lee Doo Hak.
- Oh...

776
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,630
Nice to meet you.

777
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,960
How can you not even tell your mom

778
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,470
that you have a boyfriend?

779
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,610
Well, I'm telling you now.

780
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,510
I'm Jung Shin's mother. Her mom.

781
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,950
And the name is Cha Geum Ok.

782
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,660
My, I'm so glad to meet you.

783
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,100
Y-Yes, well, nice to meet you.

784
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,830
Yes. Oh, how great.

785
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,860
Let's go eat together.

786
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,450
I know a good beef restaurant.

787
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,250
My goodness, Mother!

788
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,330
Us two already have plans.

789
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,330
Oh, my. Plans for what?

790
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,890
Are you two eating with someone else?

791
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,450
You've got someone more important than your mom?

792
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:48,820
Aigoo, seriously, how upsetting. Who is it?

793
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,460
Tell me. Who is it?

794
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,910
My mother in the nursing home.

795
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,930
Oh...

796
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,630
Yes, then, you need to go.

797
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,940
- All right. Director Go.
- Yes.

798
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,550
- Let's have some cold noodles before we go back.
- Yes.

799
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,510
All right, then. I'll see you again.

800
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,340
Yes, please take care.

801
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,270
Nice to meet you.

802
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,850
Mom?

803
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,800
Darling...
♫ <i>You're a fool</i> ♫

804
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,810
♫ <i>if you can't speak after holding onto him</i> ♫
