Hey, Doo Hak. About the development fund...

95
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,783
Even if you combine the money you gathered with Poong Ho hyung,

96
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:21,623
and your shares in the hotel and the nightclub,

97
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,503
that won't even be 20% of the necessary funds.

98
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:27,243
Didn't they say they will connect us to a bank?

99
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,443
That is what would be best for us right now,

100
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:33,603
but it could someday become poison for us.

101
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:35,863
If they cut off the bank from us,

102
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:38,273
we will have no way to survive.

103
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:43,353
Doo Hak, what did they tell you to become at Namsan?

Hunting dog? Our Doo Hak hyungnim?

107
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:54,953
Instead of a hunting dog, how about you become a wolf?

108
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:59,533
Rather than a hunting dog that an owner can

109
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:03,503
tie up with a leash, beat, and kill whenever he wants.

110

A wolf instead of a hunting dog?

111
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:09,383
If I could, of course, I should. But...

112

It is an honor to meet you in person like this, Chairman Goo.

<i>or a union with him in the center.</i>

122

<i>So get all the gangs in the country to buy the development company shares</i>

We added some money to your account for you to use it for expenses.

125
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:43,833

00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:47,683
And so, we are planning on moving forth with a legal development.

to a crisis of our country and our people!

153
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,423
In addition to operating our development company,

154
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,003
we also need to purchase the land near the redevelopment sites.

155
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:38,503
With the funds of the council, it would be more than possible.

156

If 10 represents the profits of the development company,

157
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:45,173
the profits from the rising price of neighboring land will be...

158

over 100.

159
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,763

About 12,000 households will enter.

163
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,683
About 3-400 residents are participating in the sit-in.

164
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,303
Hyung and Seon Woo, only get involved in the compensation,

165
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,803
and not in the demolition work.

166
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,313
I wonder if other gangs won't cause trouble during the demolition.

167
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:24,083
We just need to make sure we don't get reported on the news.

168
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,173
For something minor, there are guys who are willing to take the fall for it.

169
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,473
The higher ups will get them released on probation or bail.

170
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:35,533
Also, don't forget to buy the neighboring land around the redevelopment site, Hyung.

171
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,303
That is the Council's source of profits and lifeline.

172
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,603
Got it.

173
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:43,293
If you look here, from here–

174
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,803
Doo Hak, I'm sorry. Give me a sec.

175
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,113
Hey! What's with you?

176
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:04,863
Why don't you call me?

177
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,613
W-Why should I?

178
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:08,873
That night!

179
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,133
That night?

180
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,573
Night?

181
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:16,103
I told you I'd pay for the drinks at the street food cart!

182
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:19,093
Gosh, that's okay! It wasn't even that much anyway.

183
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:25,723
Hey, you bastard! Are you a bonehead?

184
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,893
Oh, okay.

185
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,543
Hey, bonehead. Follow me.

186
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:35,533
I will buy you ten times worth those drinks!

187
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,113
Aren't you coming?

188
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:40,473
What are you doing not following her?

189
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,203
Hey, we're not even done with our meeting...

190
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,773
Gosh, the meeting is over.

191
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,763
- The meeting is over!
 - You should go!

192
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:48,813
It's over! You should go.

193
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,413
Go, go!

194
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:52,563
Hurry up and go, you bonehead!

195
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,863
Come back late!

196
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:59,643
We gave you a better deal than the market price!

197
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:02,133
We'll give you this. It's a good deal!

198
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,273
Wait! Stop!

199
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:07,143
According to the district office, this land isn't very profitable.

200
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,013
- This house?
 - Yeah, this house isn't profitable.

201
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,673
So, let's go across the street.

202
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,513
Gosh, we almost ended up making a big mistake!

203
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,303
- Gosh.
 - Wait, wait a sec!

204
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,163
- Yeah, let's do it.
 - Do what?

205
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,663
- You said you won't do it.
- Give it!

206
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:20,343
Aigoo, goodness.

207
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,823
Then, take 100,000 won off the amount.

208
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,773
I'm just joking! Just sign already.

209
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:27,463
- We got it.
- Good work.

210
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:32,363
- Oh, my. This is a triangle zone.
- Where are we going?

211
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:34,373
For times like this...

212
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,163
Oh, sorry, sorry.

213
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,183
- Gosh, your spit...
 - It's over here.

214
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,733
Aigoo, ma'am.

215
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,443
You're doing well.

216
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,873
Gosh, then have a drink.

217
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:54,163
Drink some of this and feel good.

218
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,893
Thank you.

219
00:11:56,973 --> 00:12:00,613
Aigoo, here. Sign with a good mood!

You are earning a profit like this.

221
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,413
Gosh, you are earning a lot.

222
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,903
Oh, boss, you have a lot of work. We'll help you out a bit.

223
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,553
I happen to be quite good at this.

224
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,423
Watch me carefully!

225
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,363
Let's go!

[Consent Form]

227
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,283
Oh, thank you.

228
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,903
Welcome.

229
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,783
- Oh, look who it is!
- Hello.

230
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,373
This land looks good. Yeah, this is good.

231
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,923
Oh, really?

232
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:40,173
- Welcome.
 - Hello.

233
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,673
I would like land here.

234
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:42,973
There aren't any.

235
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:44,183
There aren't any at all.

236
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,503
You should have come sooner.

237
00:12:57,163 --> 00:13:00,663
Where should we go now?

238
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,233
[Real Estate Agency]

239
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,103
The land around the major apartment complex is the most valuable.

240
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,823
But Doo Hak bought it all

241
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,773
at a steeply discounted price, leaving only the useless land.

242
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,883
When the development ends, do you know how much all that would be?

243
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:20,733
I didn't know that he had access to such funds.

244
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,733
It's a business run by the government,

245
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,763
so how could bears do the tricks while the thug bastards–

246
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,353
While the thugs take all the money?

247
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,023
- That definitely won't do.
 - Then,

248
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,023
what will you do about it?

249
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:38,813
I am already concerned because Cheol Woong isn't picking up my calls...

250
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:45,233
Lee Doo Hak is definitely taking care of business well.

251
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,623
He moves quickly,

252
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,203
and produces less noise than other work managers.

253
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,143
However,

254
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,853
he is also buying up land near the site to be redeveloped.

255
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:57,653
Really?

256
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:00,633
That's outside of the site we've designated, so it doesn't matter.

257
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:04,483
But it's an incredible amount of over 90%.

258
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:07,153
That land was bought with the funds from the union of gangs,

259
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:10,203
so our company does not have even one percent of the shares.

260
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:11,683
Let him be.

261
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,273
It's better for us that their land prices increase.

262
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,073
Excuse me?

263
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:20,103
None of our money went into it, and

264
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:24,023
if you think about it, it is purely a crime organization's profits.

265
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:28,693
That is why there is always a trap to freedom.

266
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:33,493
Oh, and this is what I heard from a real estate agency near Gongjang-dong.

267
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:38,633
Supposedly, Lee Doo Hak has been leaking that our agency is behind him.

268
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,003
What?

269
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,703
Is that true?

270
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:44,343
With this much money, you can buy an apartment building.

271
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,933
Right, Hyungnim?

272
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,953
Hey, bastard, if try to steal this money, you know what will happen, right?

273
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:52,113
- Gosh, I know not to steal this.
 - Hyungnim.

274
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:53,913
Yeah, what is it?

275
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,283
That never happened.

276
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:08,593
Why would I do something that hastens my own death? And...

277
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:11,703
as you well know, this business uses the Council's funds.

278
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,613
If this business goes wrong, it'd negatively impact gangs all over the country.

279
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,563
So why would I do such a foolish thing?

280
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:21,943
Who told you that?

281
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:25,993
I will confirm who it is and shut him up.

282
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:29,303
Forget it. I understand what you're saying,

283
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,103
so make sure I never hear anything like that again.

284
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,923
If something like this happens again,

285
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:38,643
the development company and whatnot, they will go down the drain.

286
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:45,823
Lee Doo Hak.

287
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:50,603
What are you trying to do with the gangs' money

288
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:52,873
after refusing to take the loans

289
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,463
we offered?

290
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,993
I will handle that myself.

291
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:30,443
Is business going well?

292
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,473
- Is it you?
 - What are you talking about?

293
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:35,183
The one digging up stuff about me and telling everyone.

294
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:39,193
Oh, about you setting up the Council?

295
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:42,723
I know you had a fancy launching ceremony.

296
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:47,343
Hyung, if a South Korean prosecutor doesn't know that, he'd be a North Korean spy.

297
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:51,093
A sunbae I know tried to look into it,

298
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,893
but his higher-ups stopped him.

299
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:57,733
He said it's a good thing if the gangs decide to be friendly with one another

300
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,333
instead of battling each other.

301
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,783
But, I don't believe it.

302
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:04,733
Be friendly?

303
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,363
You're saying thugs would know such a beautiful word?

304
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:10,863
A dog walking would laugh.

305
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,113
In any case, you're amazing,

306
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,053
that you'd make such a union organization.

307
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,543
Is that because someone is watching your back?

308
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:30,243
I'll be going.

309
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,763
Come on. Why are you being so silly here?

310
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,263
Be careful.

311
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:43,543
I could arrest and put in jail

312
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,103
South Korea's biggest gang boss.

313
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,393
Well, I don't have any debts to repay you anymore, Hyung.

314
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:51,773
I know.

315
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:56,243
But I already retired.

316
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,913
So, I'm saying you shouldn't come visit me like this out of the blue.

317
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,333
We might meet later as prosecutor and defendant,

318
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,263
so it's a bit uncomfortable.

319
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:10,733
Oh, my mom might remarry soon.

320
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,403
Don't come then, either.

321
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:15,563
Well, you probably won't get invited anyway.

322
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:22,633
But you should still come.

323
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:25,143
I will send you an invitation.

324
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,763
I'm marrying Jung Shin.

325
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:04,262
We have to go somewhere. Please change your clothes.

326
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,032
I said we have to go somewhere!

327
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,722
Gosh, gosh.

328
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,702
Wow. Goodness!

329
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,672
Gosh, this is so good.

330
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,282
Kyeong Ja.

331
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:39,662
What are you going to do when Cheol Woong's mom gets remarried?

332
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:41,832
What power do I have?

333
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,822
If she tells me to work, I'll work.

334
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:46,242
If she tells me to leave,

335
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,752
I'll have to leave.

336
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:51,642
Then again, I guess for both you and me,

337
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:55,882
have we ever been the master of our lives?

338
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:59,872
Do we have money, or were we educated?

339
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:01,672
But...

340
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:07,102
educated people shouldn't act like that, no?

341
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:08,492
What do you mean?

342
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:12,962
They were hugging and kissing in front of the gate.

343
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,872
Aigoo, aigoo, it was so embarrassing to watch.

344
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,252
How did you manage to see that?

345
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,702
Last time, when I came back from celebrating my father's 60th birthday in Yeosu,

346
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:29,742
they were like that in front of this gate.

347
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:31,282
How were they doing it?

348
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,572
Were they like doing it like this?

349
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,122
Gosh, what are you doing?

350
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:37,402
How were they doing it? Do it to me.

351
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,032
Gosh, it's so gross!

352
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,482
How did they do it? Was it like this?

353
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,842
But you know,

354
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:48,042
I heard something a bit weird.

355
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,252
- Hey, Mom.
- Aigoo

356
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,462
- Doo Hak!
- Yes.

357
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,212
Oh, goodness, Doo Hak's father is here, too.

358
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:09,472
But what's the matter?

359
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:13,632
You acted like you weren't ever going to come back home.

360
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:17,012
Hey, Mom. What about Jung Ok?

361
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,972
We only talk on the phone from time to time.

362
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,572
She just tells me she's doing fine.

363
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,372
Even if I ask her where she works or where she lives,

364
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:25,682
she doesn't tell me.

365
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:28,812
Just like last time, she thinks someone is trying to arrest her.

366
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:30,762
Forget it.

367
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,912
She's not coming home because she's doing fine.

368
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,982
She's not a baby.

369
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:36,612
What are you so worried about?

370
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,552
Your father is acting like that again.

371
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:41,362
His heart is burnt black from worrying about Jung Ok.

372
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,452
Who says I am!

373
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,942
When Jung Ok comes back, please tell her

374
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:51,342
to come to my wedding.

375
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:57,402
You're getting married? For real?

376
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:59,572
Who is the bride?

377
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:02,322
Jung Shin.

378
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,612
Jung Shin?

379
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:06,642
The daughter of the owner of Namhae Theater in Yeosu!

380
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,032
When are you having the wedding?

381
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:09,512
We'll set the date soon.

382
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:13,942
When we set the date, I will introduce her properly to you all.

383
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:17,932
Aigoo, you're just like a goblin!

384
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:21,582
Why do you keep shocking people!

385
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:24,842
Also, now I...

386
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,292
I've really...

387
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:29,722
left that type of work.

388
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:37,362
Are you serious? Do you really mean it?

389
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:40,202
Yes, I am now working in construction.

390
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:42,992
Oh, goodness. I'm proud of you, my son.

391
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,282
I am proud of you!

392
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:50,512
Whenever I thought of you, I felt terrible inside like I had indigestion...

393
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:53,062
You did well. You did well.

394
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:55,972
Hey, Mom. You should eat. Eat up.

395
00:22:56,952 --> 00:23:01,012
Now you can sleep peacefully at night now, Honey.

396
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,242
You should say something to him!

397
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,562
Thanks...

398
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:15,372
and I'm sorry.

399
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:19,182
I didn't stop doing it for you, Father.

400
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,102
I know.

401
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:31,342
Now I should get up now.

402
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,432
You guys eat up before you leave.

403
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,132
I mean,

404
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,302
aigoo, if you're going to leave, we should leave together!

405
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:38,882
Mom, Mom, Mom...

406
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:40,372
I still have things to tell you.

407
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:43,702
Oh wait, he left his cigarettes behind.

408
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,292
I'll quickly run out and give it to him.

409
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,582
Aigoo.

410
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,532
Ahjussi!

411
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:56,982
Why did you come out?

412
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,742
You should eat more.

413
00:23:58,742 --> 00:24:02,232
You are looking for this, right?

414
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,872
You left it behind at your seat.

415
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,502
Thank you.

416
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:09,762
You should hurry inside and eat up!

417
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:12,842
Also, come visit our house sometimes.

418
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,412
Yes.

419
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,692
But, Ahjussi.

420
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,712
What is it?

421
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,102
By chance,

422
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:27,602
is Cheol Woong not the real son of the boss who passed away?

423
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:30,972
W-What are you talking about?

424
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:33,682
Of course, he is Mr. Choi's son!

425
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,602
Right?

426
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:38,692
Then, please get home safely.

427
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:43,792
Tell me. Who said anything like that to you?

428
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,002
Did Doo Hak's mother say stuff like that?

429
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:47,532
No, she didn't.

430
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:49,532
What do you mean, she didn't!

431
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:51,862
That wretched wife of mine!

432
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:55,112
Gosh, I told you she didn't!

433
00:24:56,612 --> 00:25:01,112
Madam Kang said so. It was Madam Kang.

434
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,872
Madam Kang?

435
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,572
Yes.

436
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:13,082
I never knew that my son went through so much like that.

437
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:17,362
It's not your fault, Oppa.

438
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,472
No.

439
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:23,322
If I found you a bit sooner,

440
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:27,022
and if I knew that Cheol Woong was my son,

441
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:30,332
he wouldn't have gotten so hurt like that.

442
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:32,632
This is all my fault.

443
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,872
At this rate, the gap between father and son will only increase.

444
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:39,622
How about you tell Cheol Woong instead?

445
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,802
That I am his birth father. He'll find out sooner or later anyway.

446
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,512
Please.

447
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:46,652
Give me some time.

448
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:48,292
Yeo Jin.

449
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:55,392
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:57,492
I think I shouldn't have told you that.

451
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,932
Kyeong Ja.

452
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:01,232
Yes?

453
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:03,842
What you heard is definitely not true,

454
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,272
so you can't ever say this to anyone.

455
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:11,672
Gosh, I really can't figure out what is true and what is false.

456
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:14,792
Whether it's true or false, don't mention this to anyone!

457
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:17,412
You got that?

458
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,802
I got it...

459
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:23,482
I swear.

460
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,172
Take a look at this.

461
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:30,262
I put your name as the owner of the apartment, Mom.

462
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:34,262
It should be comfortable enough for three people to live.

463
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,282
[Title Deed]

464
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,362
Hey, Doo Hak!

465
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:45,992
What took you so long? You should sit down and eat up.

466
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,192
Y-Yeah.

467
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:52,032
Kyeong Ja, we can live like actual people now.

468
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:58,012
Doo Hak, you shouldn't let your father leave like that on such a good day!

469
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:01,002
You should go and bring him back.

470
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,402
Please?

471
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,052
Cheol Woong.

472
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:07,562
Ahjussi.

473
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:11,992
- Is it you, Ahjussi?
 - That's right.

474
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:15,062
I came to see Doo Hak, and I thought

475
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:17,722
I'd see your face before I go.

476
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:31,632
It's 70% of the down payment for the redevelopment apartment in Gongjang-dong.

477
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,282
Great work.

478
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:34,972
Thank you.

479
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,542
Also,

480
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,202
- I have a favor to ask you.
 - Yes?

481
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,372
I would like for you to give up

482
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:44,312
half of the neighboring land that your company bought

483
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:47,892
near the Gongjang-dong redevelopment site.

484
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:52,362
- Excuse me?
 - We'll pay you 5% on top of the value.

485
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:55,962
That land has nothing to do with the redevelopment site.

486
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:01,212
Just do it this time around.

487
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:04,032
I'm not the one making the request.

488
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:10,272
I have too many family members in the Council I need to feed.

489
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,412
I'm sorry, but please understand.

490
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:15,102
I will definitely repay you next time.

491
00:29:16,612 --> 00:29:18,502
Really?

492
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:20,532
I'm really sorry.

493
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,342
Please drink slowly.

494
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,662
Cheol Woong.

495
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,892
Yes?

496
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,282
Your Choi family is a great family line.

497
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,402
Your grandfather was a leader in the independence movement,

498
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:50,382
and your father refused to take

499
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:54,262
even a silk path if it was not a righteous path.

500
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:57,042
No matter what the world says,

501
00:29:57,042 --> 00:30:01,742
you should be proud that you have the last name of Choi,

502
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:07,332
and never forget your grandfather and father.

503
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,032
Of course.

504
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:15,372
I always think proudly about that.

505
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:16,952
You don't need to worry about that.

506
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:19,502
Even if your mother remarries,

507
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:23,242
you are a man of the Choi family.

508
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,762
So you've heard.

509
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:28,842
You are a man of the Choi family, you got that?

510
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:30,712
Yes...

511
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,612
Say it even louder!

512
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,062
Yes, I got it.

513
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,742
That's right!

514
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:54,472
You heard about Doo Hak hyung getting married, right?

515
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,502
I did hear.

516
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,972
Do you think you can...

517
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:07,792
postpone that marriage just for a little bit, Ahjussi?

518
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,532
What's the reason?

519
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:17,482
The Prosecution is watching closely on Doo Hak hyung

520
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:19,972
if he really quit being a gangster.

521
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:23,062
If it's only...

522
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:26,392
If it's only that he disguised as a businessman...

523
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,182
the bride...

524
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:34,042
The bride will be hurt too much, wouldn't she?

525
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,682
Cheol Woong...

526
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:42,672
I'm indeed his father,

527
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:48,132
but with what right can I possibly tell him to marry or not?

528
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:51,162
When I'm the one who sent that young kid off to jail...

529
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:55,062
even after he clung to me in tears.

530
00:31:56,802 --> 00:32:01,062
I did make the decision...

531
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:06,042
but you should stop it now, too.

532
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:10,642
That poor boy is trying to start a life with the woman he loves.

533
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,502
He's still...

534
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:20,362
your hyung, isn't he?

535
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,442
Hyung, you say?

536
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,742
He was my hyung.

537
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:38,032
And your blood is indeed thicker than water.

538
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:45,152
Since Doo Hak hyung is your son.

539
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,282
You're leaving?

540
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:01,592
Yeah, I should get going.

541
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:04,322
Cheol Woong...

542
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:07,912
let me give you a hug.

543
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:18,722
I'm...

544
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:22,472
really proud of you.

545
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:27,252
I'm totally fine, okay?

546
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:33,162
I really...

547
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:37,362
don't regret it at all.

548
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:44,692
A-Ahjussi...

549
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,822
Hello?

550
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:05,412
What a great coincidence for you to pick up.

551
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,222
This is Doo Hak's father.

552
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,002
Oh, yes.

553
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,762
What's the matter at this late hour?

554
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:15,682
Is Doo Hak's mom still not home?

555
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:18,682
Well, I'm still in Seoul.

556
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,432
<i>You came to Seoul?</i>

557
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,872
Yes. I just...

558
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,452
parted ways with Cheol Woong.

559
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,452
You met Cheol Woong?

560
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:32,582
What was the occasion?

561
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:35,712
I met Cheol Woong and told him.

562
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:38,262
That even if you remarry,

563
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:43,702
he better not forget he's a son of the Choi family.

564
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:47,372

Cheol Woong to be my own child.

568
00:34:56,692 --> 00:35:02,022
<i>Since Cheol Woong has always been Choi Young Shik's son.</i>

569
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:04,012
That's how I've lived my life.

570
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:07,752
But how dare someone else call Cheol Woong his son?

571
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:10,662
Ahjussi... Doo Hak's father...

572

Go on and tell me.

00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,432
I'll listen to anything you have to say.

610

have been...

614
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:09,632

00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:11,152

What are they blackmailing you with?

619
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:24,752
He wants half of everything I own.

What if you don't?

621
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,452
He said he'll destory Cheol Woong.

622
00:38:31,822 --> 00:38:34,202
What's Cheol Woong's weakness?

623
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,612
You can tell me. I can cover for you.

624
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:41,732
He had committed murder before!

625
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:44,342
During high school in Yeosu...

626
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,332
And then?

627
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:50,612
That man's son, who was Cheol Woong's friend,

628
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:54,182
went to jail in his place for murder.

629
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:57,192
I had desperately asked that man,

630
00:38:57,192 --> 00:39:00,372
who was a servant of my family,

631
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,612
saying I'll give him a lumpsum.

632
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:06,572
And that man's son is Lee Doo Hak?

633
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:22,482
I was curious why Cheol Woong let Lee Doo Hak use him and have his way.

634
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,682
But now I know.

635
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:26,332
His son used Cheol Woong and

636

Cheol Woong will be okay, I can give up everything, but that man

00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,382
One more, one more.

654
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:01,462
They're gang leaders, each representing the region they come from.

655
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:04,062
Each one of them is as notorious as the other.

656
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:08,172
Is Lee Doo Hak's company the one managing the funds?

657
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:11,622
Yes, Goo Pan Shik is the chairman on paper,

658
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:14,622
but the actual leader of Loyal Brotherhood is Lee Doo Hak.

659
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:16,582
They all know it, too.

660
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:21,402
However, I'm glad they stopped knifing each other lately.

661
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:23,952
Wouldn't a criminal organization...

662
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:27,172
- be a possibility?
- Sorry?

663
00:41:27,172 --> 00:41:30,532
Aren't you two kind of close?

664
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,882
Yes.

665
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,102
It's because I know him.

666
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:40,842
If he gets worse, his sentence will be heavier.

667
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:14,932
It's just as I told you back then.

668
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,642
Cheol Woong isn't my son nor anyone else's.

669
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:20,872
He's the son of

670
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,972
Young Shik of the Choi family.

671
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:26,002
Of course.

672
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,782
Who told you such nonsense?

673
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:31,162
Is that what matters?

674
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:34,592
The problem is that you're thinking such things.

675
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:36,192
Isn't that right?

676
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:39,272
How could you do that?

677
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:42,512
How could you tell that man he's the father?

678
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:48,322
It was for Cheol Woong.

679
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:53,582
Since Cheol Woong needs to be his son to succeed.

680
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:58,482
Is he that much of a powerful person?

681
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:01,472
Cheol Woong was able to become a prosecutor

682
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:03,572
only because that man helped.

683
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,032
From now on, too...

684
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:08,542
at least until Cheol Woong grasps some power in that world—

685
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:12,212
I don't know how high Cheol Woong will rise in there...

686
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:15,552
No, even if he becomes the president...

687
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,332
his blood doesn't change.

688
00:43:17,332 --> 00:43:19,292
Not that it even should.

689
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,612
What's the point of success if he forgets his roots on the way?

690
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,592
That makes him less than a beast!

691
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:26,642
Ahjussi...

692
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:29,062
I beg of you.

693
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:31,762
Please look the other way just this time.

694
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:34,642
If anything happens to Cheol Woong...

695
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:36,982
I can't keep living, either.

696
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:43,832
I'll compensate you enough— No...

697
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,032
More than enough.

698
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:50,602
I didn't have much time, so this is it for today, but—

699
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,692
Madam!

700
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:57,732
You really can't be doing this.

701
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:03,762
Don't you even feel sorry for your late husband?

702
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:31,642
You came home early.

703
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:36,152
Was it you?

704
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:39,932
- It's you, right?
- Madam...

705
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:43,062
what did I do...

706
00:44:43,062 --> 00:44:46,322
You're the only rat in this house.

707
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:48,892
Pack your things and leave right away.

708
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,822
Madam! It's all my fault.

709
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:55,402
I really didn't know anything—

710
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:59,052
M-Madam! I-I really didn't know...

711
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:01,032
Madam...

712
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:06,902
Aigoo! Why are you being so pitiful all by yourself?

713
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:09,582
What brings you home so early today?

714
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,302
That's not up to me.

715
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:13,792
I just come and go as she tells me to.

716
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:15,722
It's up to Madam.

717
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:20,372
What now? Did she say you can stop coming?

718
00:45:20,372 --> 00:45:25,802
Oh, my. Why would she fire me, who serves her the way she likes to be served?

719
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:29,462
I guess she's not feeling well. She said she'd take a break.

720
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,152
Don't put it away and leave it.

721
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:33,902
I bought some beef.

722
00:45:33,902 --> 00:45:36,272
I'll make bulgogi, so let's eat dinner together.

723
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:38,082
You can eat them all.

724
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:40,262
I've no appetite.

725
00:45:41,662 --> 00:45:43,392
Oh, my.

726
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,762
It's beef, I said.

727
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:48,672
It's beef!

728
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:02,502
Kyeong Ja...

729
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:04,342
Ahjussi...

730
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:06,912
What brings you here—

731
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:09,322
Were you kicked out?

732
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:14,742
You told everything I told you to Madam, right?

733
00:46:14,742 --> 00:46:19,232
- W-Well...
- This is all because of you!

734
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:40,602
I saw the memo and came. What's the matter?

735
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:43,192
I'm busy, so I need to return quickly.

736
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,292
Why are you looking so ill?

737
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:59,832
Are you sick, Mom? Mom?

738
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,942
It looks like you're ill.

739
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:04,512
Have you been to the hospital? Huh?

740
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:07,142
Come on and get up. Let's go see a doctor.

741
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:09,192
Cheol Woong...

742
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:12,902
I don't need to remarry.

743
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:16,182
I just need you, Cheol Woong.

744
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:18,722
G-Gosh, I got it.

745
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:23,212
We'll talk about that later and let's go to the hospital first.

746
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:25,062
One second.

747
00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:28,932
Cheol Woong...

748
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:32,482
your biological father...

749
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:37,162
is Deputy Director Hwang.

750
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:05,755
Lee Jung Ok, you're really something else, too.

751
00:48:05,755 --> 00:48:09,465
You're the first one to be on the run for this long after a wanted order.

752
00:48:09,465 --> 00:48:11,555
Let's give up and go now.

753
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,055
Why you little!

754
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,755
Let go of me!

755
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:17,595
Stay still!

756
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,095
Stay still.

757
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:23,015
I did hear that...

758
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:27,845
you broke up because Grandpa was against it.

759
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:30,395
But still, this is...

760
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:32,655
I didn't know, either.

761
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:35,115
Only if my father didn't marry me off

762
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:39,875
so hastily out of fear that I might go back to him...

763
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,815
But why are you...

764
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:45,225
telling me this story that I didn't have to know

765
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:49,055
for the rest of my life?

766
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:53,895
Because I met him again.

767
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:57,135
I just felt so sorry for you, who couldn't even

768
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:02,665
recognize your own father after our fates reconnected.

769
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,715
I'm sorry.

770
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:10,585
I already...

771
00:49:12,155 --> 00:49:14,195
have told him.

772
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:17,995
I'm sorry, Cheol Woong.

773
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,815
I'm sorry.

774
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:50,825
Don't cry.

775
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:53,115
I'm sorry, Cheol Woong.

776
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:56,005
Thank you.

777
00:50:30,975 --> 00:50:34,555
You're working so hard. Do you remember me?

778
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:39,615
I had come from the prosecution regarding Prosecutor Choi's matter.

779
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:43,265
Oh, yes, yes.

780
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:46,455
But what brings you here?

781
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,195
You're working so hard.

782
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:50,525
Why don't you have a drink first?

783
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,895
He told me you like rice wine, insisting that I must

784
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:55,885
buy one on the way.

785
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:58,325
Who insisted?

786
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,525
I'm talking about Prosecutor Choi.

787
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:04,535
Thank you.

788
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:16,025
By the way, what did he want to see me for?

789
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:21,185
Oh, was it regarding the ancestral burial mountain in Yeosu?

790
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:24,945
Anyhow, please hear the details in person.

791
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:28,255
Prosecutor Choi is waiting at the restaurant.

792
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:31,575
- I'll get changed quickly and come—
- No.

793
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:35,235
You can just go as you are.

794
00:51:35,235 --> 00:51:37,945
Also, after you're done eating,

795
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:40,715
I'll give you a ride back home.

796
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,595
What's the occasion?

797
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:51,995
For the successful Prosecutor Choi to come visit a prosecutor no one knows?

798
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:54,165
Since you lack presence too much,

799
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:56,905
I decided to help you grow some.

800
00:51:57,905 --> 00:52:02,685
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong I know doesn't know what "love your colleague" means.

801
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:08,395
Well, what you see aren't usually the true feelings.

802
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,685
What's this?

803
00:52:09,685 --> 00:52:13,895
A case that will make you a star, Prosecutor Park Jae Hwan.

804
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:18,585
It smells quite funky, though?

805
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:20,595
What's the real reason?

806
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:26,805
He's a childhood friend.

807
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:28,615
It's uncomfortable, you know?

808
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:31,595
Is that really it?

809
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:36,305
Who is it?

810
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:40,655
Lee Doo Hak.

811
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:43,515
You'll miss him in a blink of an eye.

812
00:52:43,515 --> 00:52:45,415
Do you think you can do this?

813
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:04,385
♫ <i>Even if the path I take will be rough and long,</i> ♫

814
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:08,905
♫ <i>I'll be happy if you'll come with me.</i> ♫

815
00:53:08,905 --> 00:53:11,575
<i>Kiss her now! Kiss her now!</i>
