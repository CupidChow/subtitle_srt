00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,894
Oh, Cheol Woong!

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,334
Ahjussi!

5
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:22,584
Cheol Woong is here.

6
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,084
Are you here?

7
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,354
Cheol Woong...

8
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:44,264
What do we do? I feel so bad for your father...

9
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,644
I feel so bad for your father...

10
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:51,484
I feel so bad for your father!

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,164
Your father...

12
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:56,504
I feel so bad for your father!

13
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:00,764
What to do! What do we do...

14
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:03,354
What do we do...

15
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:33,014
You must be in so much pain from mourning the death of your loved one...

16
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,804
He was such a crucial elder in our region,

17
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,314
so we sincerely mourn–

18
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:42,004
Instead of mourning, you should be asking for forgiveness.

19
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,274
Why?

20
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:45,174
Did I say something wrong?

21
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:49,354
Wasn't it you who accused him of engaging in illegal elections even after

22
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:53,104
he resigned as a candidate and bothered him without letting him

23
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:54,914
sleep for several days, Chief?

24
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,294
Look here, Chief Mourner.

25
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,474
You must be misunderstanding something.

26
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,664
A misunderstanding?

27
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:03,224
He valued his honor as much as his life.

28
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,884
How tormented he must have been that

29
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:09,234
he would collapse after drinking day and night for several months?

30
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:13,234
Let's go!

31
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,684
Thank you for coming!

32
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:21,544
I will make sure to go

33
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:24,984
to visit your mortuary.

34
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:31,184
Not too long ago, I received a call from Seoul city police.

35
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,404
A student from this village who even had a feast in his honor

36
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,304
for being the first to get into Hankuk University

37
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,714
wasn't studying like he was supposed to

38
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:39,304
but became a pro-communist

39
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,324
and was participating in anti-government protests!

40
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:43,804
Also!

41
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:46,464
I was told to arrest him whenever he comes down to this village

42
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,764
and send him up to Seoul!

43
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:56,244
Mother...

44
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,284
Mother!

45
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:00,764
You must be so tired from serving the country, Chief.

46
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,624
I am only grateful that you would take the time

47
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,634
out of your busy schedule to come here.

48
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,534
Right now, we are in the middle of mourning,

49
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,824
and how could we mourn our loved one without our chief mourner?

50
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,874
I will speak to him,

51
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:16,844
so please show us some mercy.

52
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,444
I beg you desperately like this.

53
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:22,164
Watch yourselves.

54
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:37,374
Your father told me

55
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:40,814
to give you this after his funeral.

56
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,954
<i>Cheol Woong.</i>

57
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:54,694
<i>All of this is due to my lack of virtue.</i>

58
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,004
<i>However, your father</i>

59
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,044
<i>never did anything that was shameful.</i>

60
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:03,004
<i>Do not think about trying to get revenge,</i>

61
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:05,364
<i>and take good care of your mother.</i>

62
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,654
Father...

63
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:17,484
left a will telling me not to get revenge.

64
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:20,264
But, you know...

65
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,584
I wonder why for me,

66
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:27,264
that sounded like a request to get revenge for him at all costs?

67
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,664
I...

68
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,794
I reached this point after going through a lot.

69
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:42,194
And I will get stronger.

70
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,014
After becoming stronger,

71
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,394
those bastards who made Father end up like that,

72
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:51,164
those bastards who made me so miserable...

73
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,164
I will pay them back

74
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,724
for the pain they caused us.

75
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,194
You're all grown up, my son.

76
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,404
Also,

77
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:09,374
I will protect my people so they won't ever be

78
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,724
humiliated again like that, Mom.

79
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:17,734
So, what are you saying?

80
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:20,614
Are you asking me

81
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:23,784
to find someone?

82
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:26,994
Please help me

83
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,784
this once, Coordinator.

84
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:33,684
Our company is a place where we deal with national security.

85

It is not a detective agency

86
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,074
that finds people.

87
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,944
Why does our company

88
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:46,254
ignore the difficulties faced by its family members?

89
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,634
I will become

90
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:02,194
part of the family.

91
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:06,074
Just help me this once.

92
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:09,934
Are you serious?

93
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,444
Yeah?

94
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,024
What should I do?

95
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,624
He's quite a romanticist, I see.

96
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:20,964
Help him out.

97
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,514

We don't have time!

101

Yes, Boss.

103
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:42,604
We should at least save a person first!

104
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:45,054
Even if you report it, they can't find her.

105

Just trust me.

106

I will let you go right away. Understand?

112

If you kneel and beg in front of me,

113
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:23,964
I'll think about forgiving you, you shitty boss.

114
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:26,964
I told you I am not shitty!

115

I told you I'm not shitty!

- You know some pimps, right?
 - Of course!

- You know some, right?
- Of course, Hyungnim!

Hello?

123
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,264
It's me.

124
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,794

how did you find them so quickly?

130
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,244
President Byun recently obtained a new toy,

131
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,684
and it was possible to track the location of that thing.

<i>It is not something that is common in South Korea</i>

<i>so I guess he didn't know it was trackable.</i>

President Cha,

135
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,984
I can't hold back

my guys anymore.

137
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,974
Listen carefully.

138
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,884
You have exactly five minutes.

139
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:41,294
If not, you will have killed Ms. Oh, you got that?

140
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,064
You got that!

141
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:56,534
Gosh, his phone bill is going to be so high.

142
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:57,774
You're right.

143
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,144
Gosh!

144
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,414
What did he say?

145
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:08,534
This guy...

146
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:11,524
is coming out quite tenaciously than I expected.

147
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,924
If he acts like this, I can't see any way to solve this...

148
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:17,574
Aunt, don't you know that you'll lose all your theaters

149
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,064
if we don't have Jung Shin anyway?

150
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,374
That's right!

151
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:26,034
As long as you have the Branch Manager, won't you always have a chance to come back and fight?

152
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,414
- Is that so?
 - Yes!

153
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,834
- Aunt!
 - Boss!

154
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,364
- Aunt!
 - Boss!

155
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,024
Hyungnim, you received a call from Busan.

156
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:58,484
He says if you bring the girl,

157
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,894
he could keep her there for at least ten years.

158
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,624
Shall we get going?

159
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:11,604
Gosh, that heartless bitch!

160
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,834
Let's go.

161
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,314
Yes, Hyungnim.

162
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,894
W-W-Wait.

163
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,664
Hello?

164
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:26,164
Oh Jung Shin.

165
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,344
- Send her.
- Aigoo!

166
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:31,024
President Cha!

167
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:36,144
If you called any later, you would have been in big trouble!

168
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,974
My guys were just about to bury her in the ground.

169
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:41,504
No! Don't!

170
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,464
- No!
- Do you hear her?

171
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:44,914
- Do you hear her? You hear her, right?
- No!

172
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,824
Is Jung Shin okay?

173
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:52,844
Then,

174
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,874
I will send someone to pick up the contracts.

175
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,494
We did it!

176
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,304
- It's over!
-  Yes!

177
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:06,504
It's all over!

178
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:10,144
- Hong Joo!
 - Yes, Hyungnim!

179
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,804
You go up to Seoul first

180
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,294

181
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,804
Yes, Hyungnim.

I'm Byun Hak Soo! Shit!

Catch them!

187
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,674

188

Thanks.

216
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,334

how did they manage to find her so quickly

225
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,634
when we couldn't find her after searching all that time?

226
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:24,384

You've been through a lot.

I heard that you told the Shitty Boss to just kill me.

Don't be so upset.

Even though the Boss spoke like that,

she said she would hand over all her theaters

You have it wrong, Boss.

273
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,720
About what?

274
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,200
I put my life on the line to do this business,

275
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,340
and so this is more important than my life.

276
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,040
You shouldn't have put your seal on this even if I were to die.

277
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,560
What did you say?

278
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,950
To say it one more time,

279
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,630
since I have my share in this,

280
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,850
you can't decide whether I live or die as you want.

281
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,960
Your life is yours,

282
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,700
but my life is mine.

283
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,720
I, Oh Jung Shin, get to decide my own life.

284
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,320
Whoa, look at this tenacious bitch.

285
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,100
In any case, because you played around with my life,

286
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,320
Star Entertainment ended up in our hands,

287
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,830
so we'll have to adjust the amount of shares I receive.

288
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,410
From now,

289
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,760
for the shares of the Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do film distribution company,

290
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,530
I'll take 60%

291
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,450
and you can take 40%, Boss.

292
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,390
- What did you just say?
 - Branch Manager!

293
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,470
That is not how you should treat the Boss!

294
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,910
Otherwise,

295
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,980
I will set up my own independent company.

296
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,120
What?

297
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,230
Jung Shin!

298
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,530
So,

299
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,330
shall I set up an independent company?

300
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,440
Will you be able to beat me in the Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do market?

301
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,640
I knew you would be like this.

302
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,380
- Hey, Director Go.
 - Y-Yes.

303
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,900
What I told President Byun wasn't wrong.

304
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,030
I knew that one day, she would try to eat me up.

305
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,180
All right, go ahead.

306
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,420
Actually, why don't you also take over Jeolla-do as well?

307
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,300
- Boss!
 - But on one condition.

308
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,800
You...

309
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,680
be my daughter!

310
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,350
What I'm saying is to play under my domain, if you are going to play around.

311
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,520
Then, I'll have you inherit everything I have.

312
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,080
Let's go down.

313
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,410
Yes.

314
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,270
Don't think too long about it.

315
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,310
Hey, Boss.

316
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,610
Boss!

317
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,570
I'm not deaf!

318
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,020
Why? What do you want?

319
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,150
Do you want to ask me if I'm really going to give Jung Shin everything?

320
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,590
Yes...

321
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,880
I don't know about everything,

322
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,980
but I know two famous people who got on their knees.

323
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,840
One of those was Prince Heungseon,

324
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,060
the father of Emperor Gojong.

325
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,620
The other was Han Shin, a great general during the Han Dynasty of China.

326
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,310
Of course, I also know about

327
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,020
Prince Heungseon.

328
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,780
But I don't know that Chinese general.

329
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,610
I don't even expect you to know him.

330
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,790
In any case, what is in common between those two guys

331
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,870
is that when both lacked strength,

332
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,870
they put on a show to put at ease

333
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,980
the person who was trying to kill them.

334
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,250
They were first trying to avoid the storm

335
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,130
and then build up their strength to beat up their opponent.

336
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,830
They got on their knees under false pretense.

337
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,320
Gosh. They are dishonest guys.

338
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,040
How can we talk about dishonesty in a war where your life is on the line?

339
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,020
Everyone deceives and is deceived by others.

340
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,010
So, did those guys

341
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,050
beat up their opponents in the end?

342
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,020
They beat them up quite handily.

343
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,400
They all croaked.

344
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,090
Oh, my...

345
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,780
They're quite scary people.

346
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,130
That's right.

347
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,500
That is where the saying comes,

348
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,950
"Don't ever trust people who kneel easily."

349
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,370
So,

350
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,300
to kneel...

351
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,460
means that they're thinking of beating me up.

352
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,210
That's what it is, I see.

353
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,510
Wait a sec.

354
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,720
Then,

355
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,050
Branch Manager Oh Jung Shin is also trying to beat you up–

356
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,000
You little...

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,040
S-Sorry.

358
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,620
To a child like that, I told her to become my adopted daughter.

359
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,460
Do you think she will take my offer or not?

360
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,450
Gosh, seriously.

361
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,700
Seeing how she was threatening you like that earlier,

362
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,270
she will never accept it.

363
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,610
Then, that means she will be at war with me.

364
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,160
We shall see.

365
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,670
You know Choi Young Shik, right?

366
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,640
- Yes.
 - Then I suppose

367
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,470
you know Choi Cheol Woong as well?

368
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,920
Hello.

369
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,570
Did you also babysit Kang Yeo Jin's child as well?

370
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,890
Yes.

371
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,850
You know about Patient Choi Young Shik, right?

372
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,930
Oh, yes.

373
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,880
Let me take a look at his medical records.

374
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,250
Excuse me.

375
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,320
Who are you?

376
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,360
I came from the Prosecutors' Office.

377
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,180
You know about Choi Cheol Woong, right?

378
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,500
D-Did Cheol Woong do something wrong?

379
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,050
It's not that.

380
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,550
He will become an official judge or prosecutor soon,

381
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,980
but since that is such an important position,

382
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,910
we need to assess his background history and identity.

383
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,560
Also,

384
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,730
don't tell Choi Cheol Woong about this.

385
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,870
It can have a negative impact on receiving promotions.

386
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,750
Oh, yes, yes.

387
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,220
Well, I heard that in this neighborhood,

388
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,850
you were pretty close with Choi Young Shik's family.

389
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, yes.

390
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,740
When Choi Cheol Woong was in high school,

391
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,160
apart from receiving a fine for violence,

392
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,630
did he ever commit any other crimes?

393
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,010
Oh, no. Not at all.

394
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,080
I see.

395
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,470
Then, did you ever hear any stories about

396
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,260
him going to a hospital for mental issues?

397
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,620
Oh, my gosh!

398
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,730
There's nobody who's as smart and upright like him.

399
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,550
I've never heard anything like that before.

400
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,740
I see.

401
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,950
Is it true that

402
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,350
Choi Cheol Woong is really Choi Young Shik's son?

403
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,740
What do you mean by that...

404
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,790
Well, it doesn't matter if he was adopted.

405
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,130
That wouldn't change anything about their legal parent-child relationship.

406
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,700
Just tell me...

407
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,110
comfortably,

408
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,040
and honestly.

409
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,790
W-Well...

410
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,290
that is...

411
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,820
He is his real son!

412
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,000
Honey.

413
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,900
I've pretty much lived my entire life at that house.

414
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,640
What kind of ridiculous question is that?

415
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,530
Choi Cheol Woong

416
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,680
is the descendant of the Choi bloodline.

417
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,820
Oh, I see.

418
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,160
It's not that I was doubting it.

419
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,180
I just asked because I needed to confirm his personal background information.

420
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,270
Choi Cheol Woong is Choi Young Shik's real son.

421
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,440
Thank you.

422
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,040
Have a nice day.

423
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,630
Excuse me,

424
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,370
Excuse me...

425
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,380
There are no issues with Cheol Woong, right?

426
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,210
Come on!

427
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,860
Of course not.

428
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,790
This won't do.

429
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,870
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,190
What if our Cheol Woong ends up in trouble later

431
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,320
because they find out that this was false information?

432
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,140
You and I are keeping our mouths shut,

433
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,470
so how could they know?

434
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,190
Who knows what can happen in this world?

435
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,320
Also, it's not like we committed a sin or anything,

436
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,600
so shouldn't Cheol Woong know now, too?

437
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,740
You must be out of your mind!

438
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,660
We promised the elder and Mr. Choi who passed away,

439
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,900
and Ms. Kang not to tell anyone!

440
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,190
Also...

441
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,570
Geez.

442
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,750
it would make things complicated

443
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,160
for Doo Hak and Cheol Woong.

444
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
What do you mean?

445
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,990
If they find out that they're brothers, they would be happy!

446
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,410
Also, I want to hear from my son

447
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,700
call me Mother.

448
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,400
If I tell you that we can't, we can't!

449
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Why cause trouble by bringing up something we kept buried for decades!

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,140
The promise you made to the elder may be important to you,

451
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,730
but my heart has been burnt black as a result!

452
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,840
I went through the pain of childbirth to give birth to him,

453
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,790
and yet I could not even hear him call me Mother!

454
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,870
Every time I see him hug that fox of a woman and call her Mother,

455
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,420
I feel like my heart is set on fire.

456
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,470
Don't be like that.

457
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,270
I'm not looking for money or land.

458
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,340
All I want is for Cheol Woong to know

459
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,610
that we are his parents

460
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,580
only while he's with us.

461
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,880
Stop it!

462
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,170
Then, how could I ever see the elder and Mr. Choi in the afterlife?

463
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,980
I'm the idiot for living with someone who is so uptight and frustrating.

464
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,590
If we say we have a son who is a prosecutor,

465
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,680
the world would think so highly of us.

466
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,760
Aigoo, seriously...

467
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,980
From my gut feeling,

468
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,000
Choi Cheol Woong doesn't appear to be Choi Young Shik's son.

469
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,900
Contrast to how Lee Joong Ho, a servant of the family since the time of

470
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,360
Choi Young Shik's father, vehemently denied it,

471
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,090
his wife seemed so flustered as if her secret's been found out.

472
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,620
Then, do we now

473
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,700
just have to find the medical records that show Choi Young Shik

474
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,900
has been receiving treatment from before marriage?

475
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,390
That is such an old record

476
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,960
that it will take some time to find it.

477
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,460
You've gone through much.

478
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,800
Not at all.

479
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,640
Well,

480
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,590
with all due respect, I have a question.

481
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,630
It is what you are thinking of, Team Captain Oh.

482
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,730
I've got a lot on my mind right now as well.

483
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,280
I'm sorry.

484
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,710
Why didn't your dad come with you?

485
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,050
You know that Dad is busy with theater work.

486
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,340
He promised to come with me next time.

487
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,250
You're lying.

488
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,340
Your dad didn't even keep his promise to go to Jeju-do with me.

489
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,660
He also promised to take me to Mokpo and buy me brown croaker.

490
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,100
Lies! He always lies!

491
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,020
Mom.

492
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,470
Dad...

493
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,750
Dad is already...

494
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,570
Dad is not a liar.

495
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,120
When he comes next time, he said he'll do all of that at once for you.

496
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,990
N-No...

497
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,470
Your dad...

498
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,930
is always lying to you, too.

499
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,870
He even stole a look at all your letters.

500
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,030
What letters?

501
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,780
Your friend's letters.

502
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,350
The friend who hurt someone.

503
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,580
He said you shouldn't meet that guy

504
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,770
and he would go visit him.

505
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,910
<i>Whatever you say doesn't matter to me,</i>

506
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,990
<i>but what's certain is...</i>

507
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,190
<i>that you're a worse prison than this place.</i>

508
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,760
<i>Please let me go now.</i>

509
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,230
<i>I mean it.</i>

510
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,360
This stupid bastard...

511
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,980
- Hi, Hyungnim.
 - Yeah, Seon Woo.

512
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,600
Hyungnim, who is he that our boss is being so subservient?

513
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,910
He doesn't look like someone in our field of work.

514
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,360
He's probably either a rich man, a scary man,

515
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,610
or someone he needs to repay a debt.

516
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,740
Then, I hope he's not a scary man.

517
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,750
Yeah. But...

518
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,350
you always end up meeting people you want to avoid in this line of work.

519
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,930
Come on, Hyungnim. Why are you so pessimistic?

520
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,020
- Why are you always talking so negatively–
 - What?

521
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,290
Never mind, Hyungnim.

522
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,590
Let's go.

523
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,460
- Hey.
 - It appears that it's something good.

524
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,070
It is a good thing.

525
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,190
Look at this.

526
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,780
They're really pulling all the stops.

527
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,700
In Seoul of South Korea, where we need to host international festivals

528
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,240
such as the Asian Games and the Olympics,

529
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,860
won't our nation be disgraced in this state?

530
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,030
Gosh, these people are so immature!

531
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,340
I mean, the government has provided sufficient compensation and solutions,

532
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,290
but these tenants are being greedy and demanding more money.

533
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,550
And most of the landlords already left without any complaints.

534
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,360
You think this will work?

535
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,320
Oh, and also, they're going to let us know in a few days.

536
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,230
Leave the minimum number of men in the stores and gather the rest. All right?

537
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,510
Gosh, that startled me.

538
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,430
Oh, my, young man. Have some kimchi before you go.

539
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,980
Delicious, isn't it?

540
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,250
- Yes.
- Of course, it is.

541
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,900
Aigoo.

542
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,560
Do you want one more?

543
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,630
Over there is Two Myeongdang-dong.

544
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,850
And this right here is Three Myeongdang-dong.

545
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,430
The region we got assigned is the the Three Myeongdang-dong.

546
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,570
Then this place is going to be filled with apartments?

547
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,150
Whoa... that's crazy.

548
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,420
Do those people even have places to go?

549
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,040
I heard those people gathered here

550
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,350
after living in illegal constructs here and there

551
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,740
after the war.

552
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,410
Still, they're getting compensated,

553
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,900
so they'll find a place somewhere.

554
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,080
- Hyungnim.
- What?

555
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,260
To be frank,

556
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,880
I don't care at all about us fighting among ourselves

557
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,810
and beating each other up in our world.

558
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,420
But...

559
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,400
- But those people are...
- Why?

560
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,840
Are you saying you feel guilty?

561
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,050
You can't do it?

562
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,270
No, I can't.

563
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,910
I think it'd be better for you to reconsider.

564
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,360
Is that so?

565
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,230
Sure, you can feel that way.

566
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,350
I feel you.

567
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,450
Doo Hak...

568
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,750
you've got a long way to go to become a gangster.

569
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,160
Of course, they'll find a place...

570
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,000
somewhere very far away.

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
Gosh!

572
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,290
Cut it out already.

573
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,740
Do we have the luxury to be considerate of other people right now?

574
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,230
I heard the profit from fighting other gangs for years

575
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,770
doesn't even come close to one job like this one.

576
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,710
Our lives might change here.

577
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,440
Let's please focus on the future, okay?

578
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,580
But I still feel for them.

579
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,880
What, then?

580
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,740
Shall we go back to being scalpers at baseball games?

581
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,550
I did feel more at ease back then.

582
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,890
Gosh, you idiot!

583
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,540
Geez!

584
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,270
Are you going to keep hitting my head?

585
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,810
I'm stimulating it so you can think.

586
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,880
Those people's circumstances won't change.

587
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,870
If we don't do it, other gangs will take the job.

588
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,770
Isn't that right, Doo Hak?

589
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,180
Aigoo, shit!

590
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,620
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go now.

591
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,310
What is it you want to tell me?

592
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,850
Hyung, why are you always in such a rush?

593
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,310
To report on Jung Shin's kidnapping incident and

594
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,730
also to celebrate our joint operation...

595
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,850
while we're at it.

596
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,830
What's the need for a celebration?

597
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,740
As I reserved, please give us the A course.

598
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,880
Oh, okay.

599
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,300
It's for three people, right?

600
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,940
Yes.

601
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,720
What?

602
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,410
Who else is coming?

603
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,350
Yeah.

604
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,840
Our sponsor who's going to

605
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,270
feed us today.

606
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,390
This bastard...

607
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,100
You're still in probation and

608
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,510
you already learned the bad trades. Hey!

609
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,230
I'm going to take care of the bill today.

610
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,000
So just order some jjajangmyeon*.
(Korean black noodle)

611
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,870
How can we do that, Hyung?

612
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,720
She's a good person. It's okay for her to treat us.

613
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,750
So let's treat our stomachs today, okay?

614
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,050
Gosh, this little bastard.

615
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,850
Hey!

616
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,920
You can eat all you wish.

617
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,960
Lee Doo Hak...

618
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,690
- Hey.
- What?

619
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,910
We have the right to get treated.

620
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,600
- You can eat all you want.
- Sit down.

621
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,510
You said you never avoided me.

622
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,840
Won't you feel uncomfortable

623
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,020
eating with a thug?

624
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,100
I don't feel uncomfortable.

625
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,620
I just feel sorry for you.

626
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
What are you doing at a restaurant?

627
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Both of you, cut it out and sit down.

628
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,010
The three of us haven't met like this in  a long time.

629
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,360
Let's eat. Okay?

630
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,850
Gosh, Hyung.

631
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,380
Seeing the entrees makes me nostalgic.

632
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,470
You know, when Jung Shin's grades ranked within top 200 thanks to us,

633
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,870
so Jung Shin's father bought us Chinese food.

634
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,110
You remember, don't you?

635
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,930
Does it make you a gangster to chug down alcohol like that?

636
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,390
Stop trying to act cool and eat the food, too.

637
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,550
She's right, Hyung. Have some. They're delicious.

638
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,270
Aigoo.

639
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,110
Sit down.

640
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,120
I have something to tell you.

641
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,130
Yes, Hyung. Take a seat. Let's have a conversation.

642
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,770
Hey.

643
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,940
This pitiful gangster...

644
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,390
accepted your charity.

645
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,230
So I'm off now. Okay?

646
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,430
What do you mean charity, Hyung?

647
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,570
Hyung, you have more than enough right to have a feast.

648
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,430
Jung Shin...

649
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,740
when you got kidnapped by President Byun,

650
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,890
Doo Hak hyung's the one who informed me.

651
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,120
On top of that, in a very desperate

652
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,280
and urgent manner.

653
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,610
- Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.
- What?

654
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,020
I'm telling the truth.

655
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,840
That's why I was able to find you.

656
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,060
So you can say you owe half of your life to Doo Hak hyung.

657
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,530
- Is that true?
- It's not.

658
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,970
He made it up.

659
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,920
Stop lying.

660
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Are you Daddy-Long-Legs or something?

661
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,170
Jung Shin, although Hyung talks like that,

662
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,670
it means he has been...

663
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,770
lingering around you all this time, in fact.

664
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,060
That's enough. Okay?

665
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,660
I arranged this meeting because...

666
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,020
I didn't want to be a coward or be ashamed.

667
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,670
Jung Shin.

668
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,190
I'm going to take my chance at you one more time.

669
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,090
Not with young boy's feelings like back then.

670
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,310
But sincerely with all of my life on the line.

671
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,680
So...

672
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,860
don't put up a front and distance yourself.

673
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,540
Let's fight head on, fair and square.

674
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,320
Hey, you asshole. Do you really—

675
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,770
This is really...

676
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,370
such a bullshit.

677
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,630
Am I your pastime toy or something?

678
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,610
Why do you mess with me whenever you want?

679
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,310
Savior of my life?

680
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,530
Hey!

681
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,530
I'm not fated to die yet, even if it wasn't for you two.

682
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,550
Also, you think we're still the teens from Yeosu?

683
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,350
Please grow up, you idiots.

684
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,080
I'll donate today's dinner to you,

685
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,250
so help yourselves, please.

686
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,750
That's what makes Jung Shin so cool.

687
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,020
Isn't that right?

688
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,250
Hey...

689
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,460
don't ever pull this kind of joke ever again.

690
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,140
- It's a warning.
- No.

691
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,890
I'm going to keep doing it.

692
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,390
I'm going to keep it up.

693
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm going to keep competing with you

694
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,550
and make Jung Shin my woman.

695
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,640
You're a crazy bastard.

696
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,910
Aren't you too poor for a gang leader?

697
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,830
What the hell's with you?

698
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,100
What do you mean? I couldn't even eat dinner because of you.

699
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,440
You need to take responsibility.

700
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,630
Aigoo! I'm starving to death. Bring me some food.

701
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,450
- Wait, how did you—
- Doo Hak...

702
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,120
is she your girlfriend?

703
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,480
Yes!

704
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,570
- Eat up.
- Should you really treat me like this?

705
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,980
This is how I usually eat.

706
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,220
Go and fry an egg, at least.

707
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,800
There's no such thing here.

708
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,690
You're a hobo, not a gangster.

709
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,050
Gosh, seriously, you...

710
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,740
Gosh, you're about to shoot lasers.

711
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,780
Aigoo, you can't be treating

712
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,470
such a beautiful lady like this.

713
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,340
Thank you for the food.

714
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,900
It looks delicious.

715
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,820
Gosh, it's delicious!

716
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,310
My, eat as much as you want.

717
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,840
Thank you.

718
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,390
Gosh, that hits the spot.

719
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,830
Don't you have soju?

720
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,040
Hey, just eat quietly and go. All right?

721
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,700
Can't I even have a shot with the food?

722
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,810
What are you doing? That's so petty!

723
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,760
Just bring the whole bottle. We'll each have a shot.

724
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,780
♫ <i>You're a fool if you can't speak after holding onto him.</i> ♫

725
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:45,110
♫ <i>You're a fool.</i> ♫

726
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,770
♫ <i>If you can't say you love him after holding onto him</i> ♫

727
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:58,010
♫ <i>He'll just walk away.</i> ♫

728
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,600
♫ <i>Hurry up and talk.</i> ♫

729
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,140
Jung Shin?

730
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,180
Yes.

731
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,990
I called the film studio,

732
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,270
but she didn't answer.

733
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,200
Oh... She said she has someone to meet,

734
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,580
so she'll be a little late.

735
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,070
Who would that be?

736
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,380
Who did she say it was?

737
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,800
Oh! An abnormal guy who's also unfortunate.

738
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,410
But who is that?

739
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,580
Not sure.

740
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,790
Seriously, Jung Shin that girl.

741
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,180
She seems crazy from time to time.

742
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,730
What the heck would she meet an abnormal guy for?

743
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,350
Is she seeking trouble?

744
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,930
Anyhow, she'll stop by here on the way home and go with me.

745
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,850
That's what we always did.

746
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,790
I see.

747
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,990
♫ <i>Hurry up and talk.</i> ♫

748
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,380
♫ <i>Hurry up and talk.</i> ♫

749
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,970
♫ <i>Hurry up and talk.</i> ♫

750
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,080
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

751
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,630
I, Oh Jung Shin, is going to conquer the film industry of Korea.

752
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,860
With the movies I make, I'll make people laugh and cry.

753
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm also going to make a ton of money.

754
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,210
Sure.

755
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:20,250
However, you don't even seem to be making much money being a gangster.

756
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,660
Every gangster is different.

757
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,290
Just quit everything

758
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,410
and come to me instead.

759
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,870
Come to me, help me with filmmaking,

760
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,210
and go study in college, too.

761
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,110
I just need to help you with all of it.

762
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,110
I... I can afford that much.

763
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,090
Do you...

764
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,270
pity me that much?

765
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,710
Yes.

766
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,070
I pity you to death.

767
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,950
I'm also sorry.

768
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,870
I should've held onto you to the end.

769
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,580
Gosh, you're speaking nonsense.

770
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,050
You were dumped by me.

771
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,400
Does fooling your heart like that and pushing me away make you happy?

772
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,890
I heard my father went to visit you when you were in prison.

773
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,100
"As long as you're happy, I don't care about my life."

774
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,270
Is it that kind of a romantic melodrama?

775
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,750
You're a pure-hearted gangster, a rare find these days.

776
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,490
How awesome!

777
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,680
Sunday Seoul needs to come and interview you.

778
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,220
Cut it out now, seriously.

779
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,740
- It's all in the past!
- If it's all in the past,

780
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,010
why do you keep showing up around me?

781
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,110
That was never my intention.

782
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,900
You know how all film studios are related to my field.

783
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,610
I just heard the news and

784
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,620
told Cheol Woong about it.

785
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,060
What a bunch of bullshit.

786
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,300
You're still not over me.

787
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,890
You still have those feelings for me, you idiot.

788
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,770
Jung Shin.

789
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,540
You're the one who said this earlier.

790
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,810
Whether I think we're still the teens from Yeosu or not.

791
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,790
What you said is right. Okay?

792
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,390
I'm already...

793
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,920
a gangster and

794
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,530
I'm fated to be one until I die.

795
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,110
I'm very different from a civilian like you!

796
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,290
Hey, you're too drunk. Let's go.

797
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,140
A gangster until death?

798
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,390
Fate?

799
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:27,540
Hey, we all die anyway, so why bother to put food in our mouths?

800
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,430
We should just starve.

801
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,010
You still want to be by my side.

802
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,190
So get out of this field.

803
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,120
I'll feed you and

804
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,880
I'll even help you study!

805
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,170
I'll be by your side.

806
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,250
You're still young.

807
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,550
What my dad did to hurt you...

808
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,410
and how I failed to hold on to you to the end...

809
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,090
I'll make up for all of them.

810
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,500
Please get out of this, Doo Hak.

811
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,630
Please?

812
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,420
In this world,

813
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,280
how many people do you think they like their jobs?

814
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,000
We're all just enduring it.

815
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,540
Filmmaking? College?

816
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,930
You think this society will accept a ex-convict like me,

817
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,360
who's a murderer?

818
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,560
Almost everyone in the filmmaking industry knows

819
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,520
a gangster named Lee Doo Hak already...

820
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,940
and if you get yourself involved with me,

821
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,630
they'll point fingers at you, too.

822
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,470
That's...

823
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,830
my reality.

824
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,430
Do you understand?

825
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,700
So, as I said...

826
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,430
take your leave now.

827
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,010
I told you to go—

828
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,600
♫ <i>I want to hold on your hand</i> ♫

829
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,340
♫ <i>I want it to be like a birthday</i> ♫

830
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:42,180
♫ <i>No matter, you will be here, forevermore, the only one</i> ♫

831
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:50,420
♫ <i>I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice, hand me in, beautiful your life</i> ♫

832
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:58,160
♫ <i>Come over here, back in your love, in my life</i> ♫

833
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,130
♫ <i>Let me go</i> ♫

834
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,920
♫ <i>And my life</i> ♫

835
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,840
♫ <i>Let me go</i> ♫

836
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,760
♫ <i>And your life</i> ♫

837
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,680
♫ <i>Love you, no more, I want to myself</i> ♫

838
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:29,050
♫ <i>Let me go and my life</i> ♫

839
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:37,210
♫ <i>Love you, no more, I want to be myself</i> ♫

840
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:44,460
♫ <i>Let me go and my life</i> ♫

841
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:30,501
What a sight to see.

842
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,241
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

843
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,351
You're really a handful.

844
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:49,631
Aigoo.

845
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,491
Gosh, how sweet.

846
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:04,901
Did you put honey in this?

847
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:07,351
How would a hobo have honey?

848
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:09,281
That's true.

849
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:14,321
By the way, did we sleep together?

850
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:16,651
What did you say?

851
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:18,831
Hey, y-you! What kind of nonsense is that?

852
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:22,181
I slept on the bench, shaking in cold, because of you!

853
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:24,601
Why? You should've just come in.

854
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,271
Were you afraid I would have at you?

855
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:30,631
Damn. How could you say that so easily as a woman?

856
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:34,411
It's always the bad apples like you who argue about purity.

857
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:35,971
- What's the matter with sleeping together?
- What, now?

858
00:50:35,971 --> 00:50:38,481
Does sleeping together make you a scum, but sleeping separately  makes you pure?

859
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,371
If you really like someone,

860
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,791
hugging her tightly is what it really means to be pure.

861
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,371
You stupid gangster.

862
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:49,981
From what I see right now,

863
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,751
you're not completely sober, yet.

864
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,251
- Hurry up and go.
- Hey.

865
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,761
- Did you hit me? You hit me?
- Hurry up and leave.

866
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,031
How dare you!

867
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,151
A well-mannered man escorts a lady to the main road at least.

868
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,391
You remember what I said yesterday, right?

869
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:08,131
Of course. That I'm  a gangster who lives like a hobo.

870
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,571
Being sarcastic is second nature to you, huh?

871
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,071
Aigoo, seriously!

872
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:14,591
Follow me.

873
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,121
I'm giving you an opportunity right now.

874
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,031
I never asked for one.

875
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:25,531
You couldn't bring yourself to ask, but that's what your eyes said.

876
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:31,201
You were happy inside because I stayed with you yesterday, right?

877
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:34,721
Wh-What the heck are you saying?

878
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:37,251
Aigoo, look at you blush.

879
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,541
What use is a person like you as a gangster?

880
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:43,421
You're inherently unable to be a gangster.

881
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:45,711
- How cute.
- My goodness!

882
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:48,751
Lee Doo Hak!

883
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,231
Why are so surprised? It's not like this is the first time.

884
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:02,241
We did it a few times in Yeosu.

885
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:05,411
Also, we even slept under the same roof.

886
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:06,691
Hey, you—

887
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,561
Me, what? What about me?

888
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:09,651
You...

889
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:12,431
You shouldn't be playing with a person's feelings.

890
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:13,791
What a great thing for you to say.

891
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:17,561
Until you get out of this field, I'll need to play you a bit.

892
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:19,141
- Come here, let me give you a kiss.
- H-Hey, hey, hey!

893
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:21,161
Hey, you... Don't come close to me.

894
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:23,581
Why, why? Does the smell of alcohol bother you?

895
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,731
Hey, where are you going?

896
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:28,041
- H-Hey, go home now!
- Hey!

897
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,871
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

898
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:51,961
I'm so good at worrying about others,

899
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:54,011
but what will I do about myself?

900
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:52,321
Hello.

901
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:58,731
You need to speak if you called.

902
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:02,841
I accept... being your step-daughter.

903
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:12,321
Are you Jung Shin?

904
00:54:12,321 --> 00:54:13,831
I knew you would accept.

905
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:15,521
Instead,

906
00:54:15,521 --> 00:54:17,521
you keep your promise, too, President Cha.

907
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:18,911
Oh, my.

908
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,091
President Cha?

909
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:22,851
Mother.

910
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,701
Am I your mother-in-law?

911
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:27,951
Try calling me in a more friendly way.

912
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:34,491
Mom.

913
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,211
Yes, yes.

914
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:42,251
How nice to hear is it?

915
00:54:42,251 --> 00:54:44,031
<i>My daughter.</i>

916
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,691
Make sure not to skip any meals.

917
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:49,381
Also diligently secure Gyeonggang distributions.

918
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:50,691
<i>What's mine is yours,</i>

919
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:51,981
and what's yours is mine.

920
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:53,531
You got it?

921
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,431
- Yes.
- <i>Your phone bill's going to explode.</i>

922
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:57,541
Let's keep it short now.

923
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,911
Yes, please take care.

924
00:55:01,811 --> 00:55:03,551
You did well!

925
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,961
You made the right decision, Jung Shin.

926
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:09,121
You really need to help me, okay?

927
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:10,751
You and I are now...

928
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:12,721
step-cousins!

929
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:14,781
Whoa... Hey!

930
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:17,011
I'm tired.

931
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:20,211
Let us just stay as friends, okay?

932
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:23,321
By the way...

933
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,131
where did you...

934
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,161
sleep last night?

935
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:32,181
Right?

936
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:41,281
I had a few drinks and

937
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:43,381
just blacked out somewhere.

938
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:45,881
Could it have been...

939
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:48,261
with that abnormal guy?

940
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,921
Oh, my! Have you gone mad?

941
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:54,471
Who the f*** is this guy to get you drunk—

942
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:57,951
I'm the one who made that punk drink.

943
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,131
None of what you're thinking happened.

944
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:02,351
So don't worry, Ham Yang Ja.

945
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:03,801
I'm leaving now.

946
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:05,171
Hey, hey, hey.

947
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:07,991
Cheol Woong waited for you all night.

948
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,521
Cheol Woong did?

949
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:14,091
Did you tell him what I told you over the phone?

950
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:17,301
Of course. The abnormal but unfortunate guy.

951
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:19,901
Why?

952
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,951
Should I have not told him?

953
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,661
It's okay. You did well.

954
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:28,141
He would've found out anyway.

955
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:31,391
Wait, is he someone Cheol Woong knows, too?

956
00:56:33,061 --> 00:56:34,831
Hey, could that abnormal guy...

957
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:36,621
you talked about be...

958
00:56:36,621 --> 00:56:39,511
Lee Doo Hak, who used to be Cheol Woong's pair?

959
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:42,921
The one who dated you and went to prison.

960
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,681
Right?

961
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:46,941
You don't need to know about that.

962
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:48,871
Hey, Oh Jung Shin!

963
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,061
You're absolutely not dating him!

964
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,751
He's a murderer. A killer!

965
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:54,001
Hey!

966
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:56,981
I'm not dating a murderer.

967
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,321
Then, what is he?

968
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,381
He's just...

969
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,991
a person.

970
00:57:09,411 --> 00:57:11,701
She's becoming a nutcase herself.

971
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,601
Hey, what's up? Coming all the way to my company.

972
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:22,091
- Aigoo.
- You want a cup of coffee, too?

973
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:27,301
That will make the sixth cup for me today. I'm fine.

974
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:30,001
I heard you waited for me all night yesterday.

975
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:32,951
Yes.

976
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:35,131
After our dinner ended like that,

977
00:57:35,131 --> 00:57:38,371
I went to catch some drinks with you for second round.

978
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:42,401
To be honest, I was with Doo Hak the whole time yesterday.

979
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:45,351
Well, I know.

980
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:48,181
Yang Ja told me about it.

981
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,271
We drank a bit together.

982
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:53,321
To convince him to get out of that field.

983
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:57,021
So?

984
00:57:57,021 --> 00:57:59,011
Was there any progress?

985
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,681
Well, I did see the potential.

986
00:58:01,681 --> 00:58:03,661
You know how he's inherently good.

987
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:06,081
A gangster is?

988
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,201
Doo Hak may hit other gangsters,

989
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:11,561
but he'd never be a scum.

990
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:14,321
Did you come to defend Doo Hak hyung...

991
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:18,731
or apologize since I waited all night?

992
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:21,391
Did I tell you to wait?

993
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:24,021
It's not so much as to apologize.

994
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:26,951
Don't grow any feelings for me.

995
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,111
So you chose Hyung, huh?

996
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,161
Did you two sleep together?

997
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:41,231
This is why it'll never be you.

998
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:43,461
It was a joke! Just a joke.

999
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:46,131
I know Doo Hak hyung would run off even if you have at him.

1000
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:49,541
I just feel like it's a little unfair.

1001
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,491
For what reason,

1002
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:56,091
won't you even give me a chance?

1003
00:58:56,091 --> 00:58:58,431
Since we were young, you had nine out of 10 things.

1004
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,941
But Doo Hak had nothing.

1005
00:58:59,941 --> 00:59:01,161
Then and now.

1006
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:04,221
Aren't pity and love...

1007
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,261
two different things?

1008
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:12,041
I can't sit and watch you ending up in misery.

1009
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:13,901
Misery?

1010
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:17,361
Are you someone who makes me happy, then?

1011
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:19,431
Let me make this clear one more time.

1012
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,741
My happiness and misery are my creations and

1013
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,551
my responsibilities.

1014
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,801
Let's go!

1015
01:00:54,831 --> 01:01:01,471
♫ <i>Will I be able to come to you again?</i> ♫

1016

♫ <i>Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful</i> ♫

1017

1020
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:22,611
<i>I'd like to have someone watched.</i>

1021
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:23,891
<i>Who is it?</i>

1022
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:25,691
<i>Doo Hak, let's get rid of Gwang Tak.</i>

1023
01:01:25,691 --> 01:01:27,131
<i>Don't ever miss a meal.</i>

1024
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:29,431
<i>You can make that come true for me, at least from now on.</i>

1025
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,891
<i>She must be seeing a man.</i>

1026
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:33,861
<i>Hey, you thug asshole. You even moved to avoid me to be doing this?</i>

1027
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,611
<i>I just can't help my feelings for him.</i>

1028
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:36,901
<i>Yes, I'm going to date.</i>

1029
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:40,261
<i>Would you like to try doing it yourself instead of asking?</i>

1030
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:43,281
<i>Doo Hak's mother, would you like to help me with my work?</i>

1031
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:44,451
<i>Stop!</i>

1032
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,791
<i>You just need to hand over evidence of Yeom Gwang Tak and Lee Doo Hak's crimes to us.</i>

1033
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,271
<i>I'll take care of Hyungnim.</i>

1034
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:51,541
<i>Take both Achilles' heels from Doo Hak.</i>

1035
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,521
