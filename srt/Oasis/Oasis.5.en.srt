[Episode 5]
Aigoo, it seems that our Doo Hak is hungry.

4
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:20,937
Okay, okay. Shall I give you some milk?

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:24,637
I'm going out to the elder's fields to pull out some weeds.

6
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,687
Plant all the seeds and head home first, okay?

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:30,377
Gosh, are you telling me to do the entire barley field by myself?

8
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,627
While I'm also taking care of the baby?

9
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,207
That's too much!

10
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,517
We're not slaves from the Joseon era!

11
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:40,607
What, is he going to set up a commemorative monument for you?

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,997
Gosh! What do you know?

13
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,477
What don't I know?

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,467
How could someone who knows talk like that?

15
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,797
I know we should be grateful, and I am.

16
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:50,917
I'm saying this because you're too excessive!

17
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,147
You do all of their farming for them.

18
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:56,637
Not only that, but you offer up all of our crops to them as well!

19
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:59,377
Even other former slaves don't do that!

20
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:03,477
What I'm saying is, why are you the only one who acts like that, as if you're a fool?

21
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:05,937
I should do this since nobody else does!

22
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:08,467
Those guys don't even know to be grateful!

23
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,537
Even if the world has changed,

24
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,987
people should still do what is right.

25
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:16,207
Aigoo, because you are so good at doing what is right,

26
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,957
we won't need Confucius or Mencius.

27
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:21,827
- Gosh, that wife of mine...
 - Hurry up and leave.

28
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:24,187
Whether I croak or not, just go

29
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:26,847
and do what is right.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,527
It appears

31
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:34,197
I'm pregnant with another child.

32
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:37,187
I haven't had my period for the past three months.

33
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:45,327
I'll finish planting the seeds here after I come back,

34
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,207
so go home and rest.

35
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:56,127
Aigoo, Doo Hak...

36
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,027
Even though I told him I'm pregnant with your younger sibling,

37
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:01,377
your father is so indifferent like that.

38
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:04,527
You must never become like your father, okay?

39
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:13,347
Hey, come on! Go a bit slower!

40
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:15,157
At this rate,

41
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,437
I might die first like this!

42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,987
Oh, gosh!

43
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:29,157
Stop...

44
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,347
Aigoo, stop...

45
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:33,747
We should rush him to a big hospital in Gwangju.

46
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,717
Could you call an ambulance?

47
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,897
- Yes, I will call them.
- No, it's all right.

48
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,087
- Father.
 - Father...

49
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,057
See the doctor back home

50
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:48,817
and tell Doo Hak's father to come in.

51
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:03,207
Elder...

52
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:06,937
I'm not just telling you to hand the baby over as an adopted heir.

53
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,247
Only if your second child is a son...

54
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,947
My daughter-in-law can't bear children.

55
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:18,377
Since I have committed many sins, I don't care much

56
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:21,847
about receiving food for my ancestral memorial service.

57
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:30,807
But I would be ashamed to meet my ancestors.

58
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:33,267
It's my request to you...

59
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:37,247
Elder, still...

60
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,877
how could you take in someone of such a lowly bloodline?

61
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,887
Young Shik.

62
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,137
Hyungnim.

63
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:49,097
I beg you.

64
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,087
But on one condition.

65
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,217
If we do this,

66
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,747
that child will be my own,

67
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:00,067
the child that I gave birth to.

68
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,427
I understand.

69
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:15,867
We will take this...

70
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,677
to the grave.

71
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,547
Elder...

72
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,177
Thank you.

73
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,197
Why are you crying?

74
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:47,127
It's because I'm so sad!

75
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,487
How does it make sense that they will steal

76
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:53,187
our child that isn't even born yet as an adopted heir?

77
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:56,077
That's only if it's a son.

78
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,597
Also, what do you mean steal?

79
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,587
This is us receiving grace!

80
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,867
Gosh! They say they will take away our child,

81
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:06,337
so how the hell is this grace?

82
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,537
Think about it.

83
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:11,287
In this famine where it's hard to feed just one mouth,

84
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:15,127
shouldn't we be grateful that they are reducing one less mouth for us to feed?

85
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,857
Also,

86
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:20,417
if our child grows up well in such a prestigious family,

87
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,147
wouldn't that be good to see?

88
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:26,567
Will our child even know who we are?

89
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,797
Gosh, what does it matter whether he knows or not?

90
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,957
We would know, and heaven and earth would know.

91
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,657
A child is only your child when you give birth and have him in your arms.

92
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:39,557
He will think of the ones who raised him as his parents.

93
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:43,237
It's of no use to us, even if he becomes a judge or a prosecutor.

94
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:45,317
If our child...

95
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,697
is a son,

96
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,557
then just think that he's a blessed child.

97
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:09,097
Why do you think I got married so quickly

98
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,917
after we broke up, Oppa?

99
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:21,147
We have another headache of a case in the Guro Industrial Complex.

100
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,467
I'll take care of it like last time.

101
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,847
Instead of getting in the way, just follow your hyungnim.

102

Then the police can just arrest him, can't they?

This is a place where the company shut down first as soon as the labor union was formed.

We don't have any justification for arresting the workers.

Gosh, your aunt had sold it,

331
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,684
so it was really hard to get it back.

332
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,524
Thank you so much!

333

Gosh, seriously! I'm so jealous.

00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:14,514
Gosh, seriously. That's gross.

Thank you so much, Boss!

00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:23,144
I'll call you!

339
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:25,164
All right, shall we go?

340
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,284
Oh, yes. Here you go.

341
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:37,954
I'm sorry we keep being indebted to you.

342
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:39,934
What do you mean by debt? This is an investment.

343
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,454
I'm happy to see your business expand.

344
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,324
- You should check it.
 - Thank you, Mr. Kim.

345
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,684
Thank you also for the Namhae Theater.

346

My girl was falling over with joy!

347
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,664
I'm glad that she was happy.

The core of the National Student Union is

349
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,094
the Three Min Protest Committee.

350
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:03,984
Three Min Protest Committee?

351
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,144
The Three Min Protest Committee

352
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,914
is the real key driving force and an organization at the forefront of the National Student Union.

353
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:12,624
They are headed in a much more radical direction,

354
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,344
and in the future...

355
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:21,454
there is a possibility that they will engage in sudden violent protests.

356
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:25,294
As such, rather than targeting the National Student Union's leadership,

357
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:28,064
it is more important that the Three Min Protest Committee's leaders

358

Kwon Dong Hwi,

Where is he going in the middle of the presentation?

368
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,314
What's he doing?

369
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,774
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,664
Don't be nervous.

371
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:30,204
A young man who is willing to devote himself to serving his country

372
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:32,864
shouldn't lose his spirit.

373
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,924
I'll see you next time.

374
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:04,064
They say that one thing that's hard to wash clean is the red color of commies.

375
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,334
I don't know how your younger sister got involved.

376
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,714
Well,

377
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:14,074
I heard this from my friend, whose younger sister was working at a textile factory,

378
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,474
but there aren't really any commies.

379
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,794
Supposedly, most of the workers rebel

380
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,264
because the factory bosses mistreat them so badly.

381
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:23,784
So...

382
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:27,804
your younger sister is most likely a similar case rather than being a commie.

383
00:26:28,614 --> 00:26:30,814
Don't worry about it too much, Hyungnim!

384
00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:32,924
What do you know to be rambling on?

385
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,714
You didn't even graduate middle school!

386
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,314
Why are you suddenly bringing up my education?

387
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:41,524
Did I not graduate from middle school because I didn't want to?

388
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:45,654
I told you we couldn't afford the monthly payments, so I let my younger siblings go instead of me.

389
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,394
Then why didn't you take the GED in prison?

390
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,274
You didn't have to pay monthly payments for that there.

391
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,664
It wasn't a good studying environment!

392
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:56,874
To study, I need other people who are also studying around me.

393
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,574
But everyone around me was frauds, thieves,

394
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:01,904
and gigolos, so how could I study, you bastard?

395
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,514
Geez, punk!

396
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:07,714
Then did Doo Hak pass the GED on top by studying with other students?

397
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,194
Aigoo, you should say things that make sense!

398
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,394
Gosh, stop hitting me!

399
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:13,904
Geez.

400
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:15,344
Oh, he's here.

401
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,934
You're here?

402
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:22,314
Come on. How did it go?

403
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:30,924
I feel like Young Pil is finally starting to make his move.

404
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:33,034
- Young Pil?
 - He's quite late.

405
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,324
When do you think that will be?

406
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,434
After Young Pil completed that Guro Industrial Complex job with you,

407
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,494
he met up with the Director Park of Yeonhap Liquors.

408
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:43,404
It looks like Director Park is almost done making fake transaction documents to falsely accuse you.

409
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,264
I think it will take place in less than a week.

410
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,304
That's good.

411
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,134
Starting today, make sure to stay extra on guard, protecting Doo Hak.

412
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,024
You don't know when Young Pil might attack.

413
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:52,474
- Yes, Hyungnim.
 - Got it.

414
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:05,254
I said I would buy you a nice dinner, and yet you just had to call me in here for lunch.

415
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:07,684
What is this?

416
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,214
Geez.

417
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:15,044
I'm sorry. I was a bit hungry.

418
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:19,624
So, how's love*?
(The way he said it sounded like "love")

419
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:23,014
What?

420
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,844
I asked how's your business.

421
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,504
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

422
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:34,334
What is it that you really want to say to me?

423
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,074
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

424
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,744
Yeah.

425
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,214
How did you know?

426
00:28:44,704 --> 00:28:47,174
Do you read people's minds?

427
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:54,914
Do you know when I feel the happiest in the morning?

428
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:58,614
The morning I wake up from dreaming about you.

429
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:02,894
When I wake up, I do feel a bit empty,

430
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:05,254
but I do feel

431
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,144
pretty happy.

432
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:12,994
I'm sorry. This is a bit too sudden, right?

433
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:18,084
You're also going through a hard time, aren't you?

434
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:21,104
I also had a time when I was really struggling, too.

435
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:25,024
Looking at you now, I think I was just like you back then.

436
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:30,844
Now that I think about it, I think Doo Hak was also in a similar situation as you when I last saw him.

437
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:34,404
But I only said mean things to him...

438
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:40,814
You can't handle me.

439
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,434
I will make you suffer even more.

440
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:45,794
Let's just see each other comfortably as friends.

441
00:29:47,574 --> 00:29:49,084
I'll be going.

442
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,974
Is that the only reason?

443
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:56,914
Apart from the reason for not being able to handle you,

444
00:29:57,864 --> 00:30:00,614
don't you have any other legitimate reason?

445
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:03,644
You let Doo Hak hyung

446
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,664
but not me?

447
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:15,864
I'll set up another date, so make sure to treat me to drinks next time.

448
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,594
She didn't eat at all...

449
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:32,374
This is the principal and the interest.

450
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,734
I put in a bit more than required.

451
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,804
Oh, you didn't need to do that.

452
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,924
Thanks to you, we were very successful,

453
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,754
so I wouldn't be human if I pretended like nothing happened.

454
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,144
I'm Cha Geum Ok.

455
00:30:43,144 --> 00:30:45,954
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

456
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:48,774
But,

457
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:53,314
when are you going to introduce me to the CEO, who is residing in Japan?

458
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:57,864
I really need to greet him sometime.

459
00:30:57,864 --> 00:30:59,914
It so happens that he will be coming to South Korea soon.

460
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,814
I will make sure to deliver the message to him.

461
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:07,894
What happened? Weren't you meeting Cheol Woong today?

462
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:14,994
Oh, my. Hey, what's up? Is something wrong?

463
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:18,754
It's just because I'm ugly and damn mean.

464
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:21,184
Hey, who the f*** said that? Who is it?

465
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:23,144
I'll dice his mouth up.

466
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,794
Yang Ja...

467
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:27,124
If you had to choose between a guy who...

468
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:29,704
has an abnormal job and

469
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:32,374
one who has a normal job...

470
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:33,884
who would you choose?

471
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:36,564
It's the normal one, of course.

472
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,124
Right?

473
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:43,914
But what if you keep worrying about the abnormal one.?

474
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,794
You're also abnormal.

475
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:47,914
A nutcase.

476
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:49,454
Right?

477
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:52,564
Did you meet Cheol Woong?

478
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:58,464
But who's the abnormal one?

479
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:01,734
Who is it?

480
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:04,944
There is one. A very misfortunate guy.

481
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:09,254
Hey, listen carefully.

482
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,684
The normal one is your destiny and

483
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:15,804
the abnormal one is your ill fate. However,

484
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:19,204
people tend to always confuse the ill fate

485
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,764
as  their destiny and regret later.

486
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,254
Though I don't know who it is...

487
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:27,424
please refrain yourself. Okay?

488
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,224
Just don't do it.

489
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,934
Hey.

490
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,824

00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:12,264
Mom!

654
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,614
Aigoo.

655
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:18,574
Why?

656
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:20,154
The chamber pot is full.

657
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,114
Wait a minute.

658
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:28,124
Aigoo, what's all this for?

659
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:30,534
It's not like this is a prison.

660
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,234
What about Dad?

661
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:37,774
I don't know. He must've gone to smoke after dinner.

662
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:39,674
Give me the pot.

663
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:48,574
Oh, my! O-Oh, my!

664
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:52,314
You little wench! Stop right there!

665
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:56,284
Hello.

666
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,914
Yes, Mother.

667
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:00,524
What?

668
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:07,474
Your sister ran away from your mom's house.

669
00:43:07,474 --> 00:43:09,274
What in the world?

670
00:43:09,274 --> 00:43:10,624
Are you sure?

671
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:12,564
There are really only four men?

672
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:17,794
Yes, there are four.

673
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:21,434
W-Wait, th-there are three.

674
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,224
Got it.

675
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:25,874
Get these guys armed right away and get ready to leave.

676
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:28,574
- And give a call to Director Park.
- Yes, Hyungnim.

677
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:33,714
It's over for you, you asshole.

678
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:38,704
<i>[Mokpo Night Club]</i>

679
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:47,644
Whoa! My goodness.

680
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:49,584
Has Jung Ok come here, by any chance?

681
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:52,844
I-I haven't seen her after that day, either.

682
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,354
If Jung Ok comes here,

683
00:43:55,354 --> 00:43:57,024
tell her to use this for transportation fees.

684
00:43:57,024 --> 00:44:00,494
I'll tell her, but I'm not in night school or a union.

685
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:02,804
So would she come to me?

686
00:44:02,804 --> 00:44:06,044
If she gets caught by the police again, no one can help her.

687
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,884
So tell her to hurry up and go to the Seongnam home.

688
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:11,244
I'm counting on you, Gil Ja.

689
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:31,864
What's that?

690
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:39,054
Go, go, go! Get him!

691
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:54,564
Who do we have here?

692
00:44:56,954 --> 00:44:58,624
It's Doo Hak, one of our family.

693
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:01,644
Gosh, I was wondering who the f*** almost got us into an accident.

694
00:45:01,644 --> 00:45:04,724
Did you eat? Do you want to join us at our company dinner?

695
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:06,644
Move your car aside.

696
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:10,564
- If the police see, you'll get a ticket.
- A ticket?

697
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:12,564
I'll just get one, then.

698
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:14,334
And get you while I'm at it.

699
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:15,854
Away from my family, that is.

700
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:20,044
If Hyungnim finds out, it won't be fun for you, either.

701
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:25,654
No, he'll be very entertained.

702
00:45:25,654 --> 00:45:28,944
Is it because I banned you from eating soup and rice at the hotel?

703
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,224
I apologize, but

704
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:35,694
eat soup and rice at the soup and rice place, you scum.

705
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,914
Gosh, this son of a bitch...

706
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:44,654
Get out!

707
00:45:58,684 --> 00:46:00,954
You—

708
00:46:03,674 --> 00:46:05,714
Shit...

709
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:20,474
Now!

710
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:33,134
You're dead—

711
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:06,404
Doo Hak hyungnim!

712
00:47:31,594 --> 00:47:42,254
♫ <i>Where did it go all wrong? I can't figure it out</i> ♫

Stand him up.

720
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:55,594
You called me a scum, right?

721
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:56,904
Is that what you think?

722
00:48:56,904 --> 00:49:00,764
A great gangster will be killed by a scum today, then.

723
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:05,824
Don't ever meet another scum when you're in hell.

724
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:19,644
What's this?

725
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:45,994
This little bastard, have you gone f***ing mad?

726
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:50,824
- Hey, hurry up and take him to the hospital.
- Yes.

727
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:54,054
Come.

728
00:49:58,324 --> 00:49:59,884
Aigoo.

729
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:02,444
Come here, you stupid bastard.

730
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,864
You f***ing...

731
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:09,064
What? Are you saying I came late?

732
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:11,864
You said your life needs to be on the line for it to be dramatic!

733
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:16,614
Doo Hak, if we get ambushed, we'll all die.

734
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,794
We need to tell at least Seon Woo's party to come back.

735
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:21,784
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

736
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:23,604
Hyung.

737
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,414
Let's change our plan.

738
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,994
I'll take care of Young Pil.

739
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:33,244
What? By yourself?

740
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:35,314
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

741
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:39,134
I'll take two or three men with me and go to Jung Ok right now.

742
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:42,294
Young Pil's gang is focused on me.

743
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:45,424
When will we ever get a better chance?

744
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:47,594
Let's lure them in to ambush us,

745
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:49,734
instead of waiting in ignorance?

746
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:52,204
And I'll go to Gwang Tak hyungnim.

747
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:53,814
That's right.

748
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:55,894
That's better instead of an all-out battle.

749
00:50:55,894 --> 00:51:00,574
Our guys won't be harmed, and we'll also appeal to Gwang Tak hyungnim's sympathy.

750
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:02,514
What if it goes wrong?

751
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:04,464
If you come late, that's on you.

752
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:05,954
You crazy bastard.

753
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:08,134
Must you go this far?

754
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:10,734
Your life needs to be on the line for it to be dramatic.

755
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:14,444
What about the men who went to look for Jung Shin? Nothing yet?

756
00:51:14,444 --> 00:51:16,254
She's nowhere to be found.

757
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:18,264
What is that woman to you, exactly?

758
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:20,324
Why do you need to go this far?

759
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:23,194
Investing in the film studio's shares and the ownership of Namhae Theater, too.

760
00:51:23,194 --> 00:51:26,514
On top of that, you're doing this to go all in on looking for that woman,

761
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:28,184
aren't you?

762
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:30,254
I don't know, either.

763
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,324
I guess I must feel empty.

764
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:33,644
What a load of  bullshit.

765
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:36,134
If you feel empty, eat some f***ing soup and rice like Young Pil.

766
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,784
Should I?

767
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:42,434
That asshole must've felt empty all the time, too, then.

768
00:51:44,804 --> 00:51:46,924
Aigoo. Seriously.

769
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:03,126
Is this true?

770
00:52:03,126 --> 00:52:05,546
How could I dare to lie in front of you?

771
00:52:05,546 --> 00:52:07,206
I really didn't do it out of a personal grudge.

772
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,006
I swear, Hyungnim.

773
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:14,266
Even so, you try to kill him off for pocketing some money?

774
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:15,956
No, that's not all.

775
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:20,136
There was also a rumor that the bastard would take you out while building up his force.

776
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,346
That's why he bought his men favors with the pocketed money.

777
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:25,116
You know, don't you?

778
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,826
Lately, the men...

779
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:30,676
are more obedient to his orders than yours, Hyungnim.

780
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:33,546
Also, I was only going to break a leg or two.

781
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,646
Doo Hak, that asshole...

782
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:46,766
That double-faced, bloody traitor.

783
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,446
Hyungnim!

784
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,626
I never heard...

785
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:08,786
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei stole money and backstabbed Liu Bei.*
(Referring to "Romance of the Three Kingdoms")

786
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,276
Is this Oath of the Peach Garden?

787
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:15,206
I also never heard Liu Bei suspected his own brothers.

788
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,326
I'll bet my neck...

789
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:20,696
that this ledger has been fabricated.

790
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:22,146
Hey,

791
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:24,176
you guys bet your necks, too.

792
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:26,456
This bastard. He's asking to be killed.

793
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:29,136
We have a witness here.

794
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:31,356
Hey, Director Park.

795
00:53:31,356 --> 00:53:33,436
You're saying you laundered money for me?

796
00:53:33,436 --> 00:53:36,376
Hyungnim, it's all over already.

797
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:38,306
Please admit it now.

798
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:42,526
Hyung.

799
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:47,416
Please come in!

800
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:56,006
My, my. Long time no see.

801
00:53:56,006 --> 00:53:59,046
- What's this?
- Aren't they your partners? And...

802
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:02,436
they're also the best counterfeit artists in Korea.

803
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:05,566
Hey, Young Pil, you know them as well, right?

804
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:09,406
All right, so. What do you need us to examine?

805
00:54:09,406 --> 00:54:11,816
It's a ledger that contains liquor transactions for the past two years.

806
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:15,626
They're saying there's proof I stole 80 million won in  here.

807
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,166
So please confirm it.

808
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:20,116
Oh, my, 80 million won?

809
00:54:20,116 --> 00:54:22,236
Hey, did you take kickbacks?

810
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:24,176
Aigoo. If you pocketed kickbacks,

811
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:26,566
you need to have some senses beaten into you.

812
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:29,556
Or if you framed someone,

813
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:31,436
- you need to be beaten to death.
- Yes.

814
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:34,266
Eyes, nose, and mouth for an eye. Limbs for a  tooth.

815
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:38,166
This field's laws are quite strict.

816
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:41,526
Hey, how dare you come here?

817
00:54:41,526 --> 00:54:42,876
Get lost right now.

818
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:44,796
Oh, my. How scary.

819
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:46,376
Hey...

820
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:49,016
- should we leave?
- No.

821
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:51,226
Examine.

822
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:54,266
Hyungnim, this is our family problem.

823
00:54:54,316 --> 00:54:56,916
They're also my family. Continue.

824
00:54:56,986 --> 00:55:00,306
- Poong Ho, you need to take a good look, okay?
- Yes.

825
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:01,996
Take a seat and start.

826
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:20,736
This is just way too shabby.

827
00:55:20,736 --> 00:55:23,166
They mismatched the papers' ages,

828
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,876
so the colors are way too different.

829
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:28,736
Also, they knifed some numbers out here.

830
00:55:28,736 --> 00:55:31,286
Even amateurs don't do their jobs like this!

831
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:36,516
This is why this work must be entrusted to pros like me.

832
00:55:36,516 --> 00:55:40,586
- What do you mean? There's no way.
- Hey...

833
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:43,936
- Come closer and tell me more in detail.
- Oh, okay.

834
00:55:43,936 --> 00:55:45,956
All right.

835
00:55:49,176 --> 00:55:51,286
I'm so sorry, Chairman!

836
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:52,976
I was j-just...

837
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:56,316
- ordered by Young Pil hyung—
- You f***ing asshole, cut the bullshit!

838
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:58,436
Hyungnim, one second—

839
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:04,866
A gangster, right?

840
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:08,056
A gangster fights it out one on one.

841
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:11,136
This is why they say...

842
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:15,586
that you're a scum. You piece of shit!

843
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:23,116
From now on, if I ever see you again...

844
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:24,846
you'll get a posthumous execution.

845
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:26,426
Do you understand?

846
00:56:27,606 --> 00:56:29,526
- Get him out.
- Yes.

847
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:31,036
H-Hyungnim...

848
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,726
Come this way.

849
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:41,876
Let go!

850
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:58,286
Gosh, seriously!

851
00:56:58,286 --> 00:57:00,626
Stop worrying whether people are looking for her or not!

852
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,506
Things happen when you're doing business!

853
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:07,066
What a talkative woman you are! I'm hanging up!

854
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:09,766
Gosh! Seriously.

855
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:12,706
Hyungnim...

856
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:15,186
it's almost time now.

857
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:17,266
She thinks I can't do it, huh?

858
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,416
Gosh! Ouch!

859
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,286
Let me prove her wrong, then.

860
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:24,036
Who does she think I am!

861
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:27,846
Thank you, Hyungnims.

862
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:29,166
And you, too, Noonim.

863
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,006
Gosh, what are you saying?

864
00:57:31,006 --> 00:57:33,416
You're our boss, aren't you?

865
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,116
If the boss dies,

866
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:37,526
- we're all going down, too.
- He's right.

867
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:42,916
Wait, anyhow, you were really close this time.

868
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,346
Wait, let me—

869
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:45,656
So the thing is...

870
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:48,316
the ledger seemed extremely real.

871
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:51,576
They must've got it done by someone better than me.

872
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:54,156
- What?
- After seeing that thing,

873
00:57:54,156 --> 00:57:57,086
I had cold sweats breaking out on my back.

874
00:57:57,086 --> 00:58:00,146
- Aigoo.
- It's only because that  guy called Director Park

875
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:01,766
gave in at the last second.

876
00:58:01,766 --> 00:58:03,746
You were this close to death!

877
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,666
I thought I was going to die of a heart attack on the spot there.

878
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,256
Hey, we did this because we trust you,

879
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:14,326
but we almost got thrashed ourselves!

880
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:15,646
Doo Hak...

881
00:58:17,186 --> 00:58:20,026
We don't have several lives.

882
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:21,746
Let's not step on  the gas too much, okay?

883
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:23,966
You're the one who said it.

884
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:26,966
You don't want to see any of us going down.

885
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:28,216
I'm sorry.

886
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:29,736
I just felt rushed.

887
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:31,206
It's fine if you know it.

888
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:34,956
All right, now. Then let's not interfere with Boss' business and

889
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:37,576
- let's take our leave now. Okay?
- Yes.

890
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:42,056
- We're...
- <i>Family!</i>

891
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:44,606
Family!

892
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,266
We're going, okay? Be careful.

893
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,266
- Okay.
- My, long time no see!

894
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,816
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

895
00:58:51,816 --> 00:58:56,046
Hey, we looked through all of the gangs in Seoul with all the men we have,

896
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:59,096
but seeing how she's still not found, they must be a rural gang.

897
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:02,246
It's not like we're a nationwide gang, so it's out of our hands.

898
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:04,306
I asked  a detective I know to look into this.

899
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:07,486
But that President Byun guy doesn't even have any records. He's clean.

900
00:59:10,086 --> 00:59:12,756
A person like him went into hiding?

901
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:14,696
And time isn't on our side.

902
00:59:14,696 --> 00:59:17,966
If he intends to hide forever, even the police or the prosecution

903
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:19,736
won't be able to find him that quickly.

904
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,276
That'd be the case, right?

905
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:22,996
However...

906
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:25,106
when you watch movies, right?

907
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:28,136
Places like the CIA in the U.S.,

908
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:33,056
they just find the person in mere tens of minutes.

909
00:59:33,056 --> 00:59:35,016
That's only in the movies, you punk.

910
00:59:35,016 --> 00:59:37,636
They're all lies. Lies.

911
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:38,876
Lies. Aigoo.

912
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,486
- Hey, Seon Woo.
- Yes.

913
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,596
- Get the car ready.
- Where are you going?

914
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:45,666
If we don't have the power, we need to borrow it.

915
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,806
H-How can you be telling me this now?

916
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:50,586
There's no time,

917
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,606
so just tell me if you can find her or not.

918
00:59:52,606 --> 00:59:54,516
Hyung...

919
00:59:54,516 --> 00:59:57,226
I'm not a prosecutor yet, okay?

920
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,146
Just tell the police—

921
00:59:59,146 --> 01:00:01,246
You should've called the police.

922
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:04,246
We have to find her no matter what. There's no time, either.

923
01:00:09,716 --> 01:00:10,996
By the way...

924
01:00:11,826 --> 01:00:13,476
you said you have no feelings for Jung Shin anymore,

925
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,686
but you were looking after her all this time?

926
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,406
That's because...

927
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:22,116
I'm doing business with Jung Shin's boss.

928
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:24,156
I also found this out by chance, too.

929
01:00:26,976 --> 01:00:28,756
If you help me...

930
01:00:28,756 --> 01:00:31,196
I think there might be  a way.

931
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:35,006
What are you getting at?

932
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,276
The one who tried to use you as a spy back then...

933
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:40,386
- from National Security Planning Agency.
- Shit!

934
01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:45,116
How could you say that to me right now? Huh?

935
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:46,686
Don't you...

936
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,596
know who those people are to me?

937
01:00:48,596 --> 01:00:51,446
The debt you owe me...

938
01:00:51,446 --> 01:00:53,656
I'll count half of it as paid.

939
01:00:54,576 --> 01:00:57,026
I need you to step up.

940
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,326
There's no other way.
