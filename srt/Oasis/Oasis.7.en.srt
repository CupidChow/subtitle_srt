3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,290
I'd like to have someone watched.

4
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,020
Who is it?

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,040
<i>Doo Hak may hit other gangsters, </i>

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,180
<i>but he'd never be a scum.</i>

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,670
His name is...

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,570
Lee Doo Hak?

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,450
You want someone to watch him?

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,310
Usually, there is an end result that one is looking for.

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,200
If you tell me what that is,

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,050
then the job could be a lot easier.

[Episode 7]
 One hundred redevelopment sticker for Myeongdang-dong?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,230
Yeah.

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,250
Supposedly, they bought a 700 sq. ft. sticker

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,790
for less than 3 million won,

17
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,660
but that's now going for 40 or 50 million won...

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,690
My goodness!

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,110
The value increased so dramatically!

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,320
- Stickers?
 - Not the stickers that kids play with.

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,730
They call the right to residency for an apartment during a redevelopment a sticker.

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,370
Supposedly, it was a war out there.

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,110
Everyone from the Blue House, government agencies and ministries, and City Hall

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,080
all had their relatives buy it up before the redevelopment news got out.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,150
Gosh, that's why the news didn't reach us.

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,420
Gosh, seriously. It's literally a war.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,260
Make sure the the evictees can't come back in.

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,780
Make sure there is no bloody situation like before.

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,660
- Yes, Hyungnim.
 - I'll come back tomorrow to change shifts with you.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,910
Good luck.

31
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,380
- Hyungnim, make sure to come quickly.
 - I got it, you bastard.

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,580
You went through a lot to take care of something big.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,720
Use this to feed the guys some meat, and use this for yourself.

34
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,180
Hey, do you really have to check the money?

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,250
Hyungnim, this really will only be enough to feed the guys some meat.

36
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,580
The guys got hurt and injured in many places.

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,490
Just their hospital bills would be quite a bit...

38
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,090
Hey, if I received a lot for this, I would give you generously, too.

39
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,550
Why, what?

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,610
Gosh!

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,410
I mean it, man!

42
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,550
You really think I would siphon the money earned by the blood and sweat of my brothers?

43
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,600
Hey.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,120
We can't get full from just the first bite.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,570
If the next contract with them goes well,

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,820
I will make sure to pay you handsomely.

47
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,700
I should get going.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,320
Hey, Gil Su, someone threw up in the restroom.

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Please clean that up. It's disgusting. Who'd use it like that?

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,380
Yes, I'll have that cleaned up right away, Hyungnim.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,310
Bye, Hyungnim!

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
How much is that?

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Two million won for the guys, and 1 million won for me.

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,830
Is he joking?

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,750
It would cost 2 million won just to apply red ointment on the guys!

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,950
Gosh, this is too much!

57
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,210
We could earn this much from scalping baseball tickets!

58
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,470
Hyung, give this to the guys.

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
- Okay.
- What about us?

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,970
- We get our monthly pay from here.
- Wait, uh...

61
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,530
All right.

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,130
I should add to the guys' share.

63
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,540
I can't take away what little they're getting.

64
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,010
- She is here, Hyungnim.
 - Have her come in.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,010
Come in.

66
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,810
Welcome.

67
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,450
You were surprised because I asked to see you suddenly, right?

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,330
You know the amount Hyungnim asked you to deposit?

69
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,920
How much was it?

70
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,530
Well...

71
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,330
if the CEO finds out,

72
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,680
then I'll be in big trouble.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,890
Don't worry.

74
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,550
We will definitely keep it a secret.

75
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,910
How much was it?

76
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,000
Fifty million won...

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,050
F-Fifty millions won?

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,820
Did Kwang Tak hyungnim really give you 50 million won to deposit?

79
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,870
Yes, it's true. He gave me five

80
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,170
10 million won checks.

81
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,370
Geez! He's blown a hole in our loyalty!

82
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,060
Gosh, seriously!

83
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,700
Fifty million? Fifty million!

84
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,420
The guys have lots of complaints, and they have a good reason.

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,090
Now is the time.

86
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,160
The time has come!

87
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,650
Doo Hak, let's

88
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,150
overthrow Kwang Tak.

89
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,690
I will stand at the forefront and fight!

90
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,170
It's true that the time has grown ripe.

91
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,600
The big hyungnim wasn't like that before...

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,420
It's because of greed! His greed!

93
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,240
Doo Hak said it himself.

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,990
Although you would split a bean,

95
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,320
you would never split a crate full of beans.

96
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,610
Then,

97
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,550
are we going to do it?

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,620
- No, we can't.
- Why? Why can't we?

99
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,980
Because that's what I decided.

100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,080
Hey, Doo Hak.

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
Doo Hak!

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,350
I'm sorry.

If I knew earlier,

107

I would not have put Cheol Woong through all of that...

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm really sorry.

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,700

I'm asking because I'm curious,

114
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,120
but it's been a while since you saw Deputy Director Hwang, right?

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Yeah.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,180
Did he completely stop coming here?

117
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,580
I guess so.

118

If Deputy Director Hwang stops coming here,

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,170
she will be stranded out here by herself.

120
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,770
I know. Maybe we should look for another location.

No, not that.

how could you not have eaten dinner until this hour?

137

Then what can I do?

146
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,250
She told me over the phone to sleep elsewhere tonight.

147
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,450
I don't have any relatives in Seoul,

Yeah. You did well to come here.

150

It appears that she's found a man.

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,590
She must be seeing a man.

152
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,730
If not, why would she have you leave so urgently?

153
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,260
What kind of nonsense is that?

154
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,810
How is that nonsense?

155
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,670
She doesn't even have a husband. So what's wrong with that?

156
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,170
W-W-W-What?

157
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,120
Does she have to live a loyal widow and die alone like in Joseon era?

158

I will sleep in Jung Ok's room.

You guys go to sleep soon.

160

Gosh, what is going on here...

Gosh!

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,800
Cheol Woong used to wear these pajamas. I don't know if they will fit you, though.

167
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,850
If you told me earlier, I would have bought one in advance for you.

168
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,070
Please rest comfortably.

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,930
The pajamas will probably fit me well, even if I don't try them on.

170
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,230
They're my son's pajamas.

171
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,700
Oppa!

172
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,210
Let's live together.

173
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,990
I don't ever want to miss

174
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,720
my meals or you.

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,830
I will compensate you

176
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,850
for all that you've suffered.

177
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,250
I like the way things are right now, Oppa.

178
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,530
Thank you, Oppa.

179
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,310
I will look for an opportunity to tell Cheol Woong soon, too...

180
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,250
about our relationship.

181
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,040
You understand what I'm saying, right?

182
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,300
I told you, I got it.

183
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,250
How many times are you going to tell me?

184
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,540
If anyone asks,

185
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,870
I will tell them I delivered your baby myself,

186
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,350
so don't worry!

187

Non-obstructive azoospermia?

188
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,850
Please, I beg you, Doctor.

189
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,610
Supposedly, there might be an issue

190
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,340
with my son becoming a prosecutor due to the ideology of his father.

191
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,840
Please help me, Doctor.

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,300
Now, all I have is that child.

193
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,510
If something happens to him,

194
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll have no choice but to end my life.

195
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,170
Please help me.

196
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,460
I won't ever forget this debt.

197
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,370
Is it you, Kyeong Ja?

198
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,220
Yes, it's me.

199
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,340
Have you been well these days?

200
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,810
Kyeong Ja, I'm sorry, but you should go outside for a bit.

201
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,350
Yes.

202
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,910
So...

203
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,070
what did you tell him?

204
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,370
I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything.

205
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,520
But right then, this guy entered

206
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,600
and told him that he was your real son.

207
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,640
I've heard that doing a background check

208
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,590
is standard if you want to work in an important position.

209
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,750
But something felt really off.

210
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,480
It was a bit strange that he came looking for us when we had left our hometown.

211
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
- And...
 - And what?

212
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,830
I felt like his face looked a bit familiar.

213
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,490
When we used to live in Yeosu,

214
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,650
I passed by this guy who used to drop by your place often.

215
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,110
He kind of looks a bit like that guy.

216
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,510
No way. You probably saw incorrectly.

217
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,610
I felt like he came knowing something

218
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,560
so I was so scared.

219
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,280
Know something?

220
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
What are you saying that he knows?

221
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,840
- Excuse me?
 - Erase those wrong thoughts from your mind.

222
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Cheol Woong is my son.

223
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,410
You got that?

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,670
Gosh, I wish that was true, too...

225
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,800
but it's because I can't control how I feel.

226
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,210
Honey!

227
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,990
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,100
I will make sure to keep her mouth shut.

229
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,570
Then, we shall be on our way.

230
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,760
Hurry up and get up!

231
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,240
Wait.

Won't you help me out with my work?

234
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,180
Excuse me?

235
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,720
I did ask a lot of favors of you,

236
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,880
and I was hoping I could be of some financial support to you as well.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,900
I seem to remember that you were quite good driving the cultivator, 새ㅐ.

238
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,360
I just can't believe it.

239
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,380
She used to avoid me like I was a snake, and she's asking me to help her with work?

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,100
Also, she is asking me to get a driver's license at my age?

241
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,150
Gosh, so ridiculous.

242
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,670
Don't be naggy and just help her.

243
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,110
No matter how I look at it,

244
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,720
it appears she is trying to keep watch over me because she is worried that

245
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,120
I might say that Cheol Woong is not her real son?

246
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,870
So why do you have lingering desires for Cheol Woong!

247
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,450
How can I erase that from my memory and forget?

248
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,070
If there is an eraser like that in the world, bring it to me.

249
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,810
This woman! Seriously!

250
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,320
So are you saying that you won't do it?

251
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,830
Of course, I should do it.

252
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,430
I'd get to see my baby often who is about to become a judge or a prosecutor.

253
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,520
Geez!

254
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,570
Just try to say that one more time.

255
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,470

 - Okay, okay!

I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't!

257
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,150
Gosh.

258

All right. So these are the redevelopment plans.

262
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,700
The regions left are these three sections.

263
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,230
I think it would be good to do all three.

264

If we were to choose just one, I would get this one.

Congrats on becoming a prosecutor.

270
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,220
I tried to live with some distance between us.

271
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,140
But since you really became a prosecutor,

272
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,160
I thought you'd sulk all your life if I didn't congratulate you.

- So it took a lot for me to come here.
- All right.

If you didn't come out today, I was going to prosecute you.

Thanks.

on your record even if it's a fine.

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,540
What do you want me to do?

327
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,440
You should pass on info like this to me and help me out.

328
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,740
A prosecutor...

329
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,680
help a thug?

330
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
Have you forgotten?

331
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,790
It's true that I'm indebted to you, Hyung.

332
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,300
But still, I don't think I should repay you like this!

333
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,680
Whatever it is that I do,

334
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,520
and whatever it is that you do,

335
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,130
you should repay me until I tell you to stop.

336
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,850
Okay, okay! But...

337
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,790
don't get Jung Shin involved.

338
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,680
She'll become miserable because of you.

339
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,670
I never got her involved.

340
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,200
That's why I moved. Also,

341
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,580
you're the same.

342
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,150
You're afraid of losing Jung Shin to me.

343
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,050
Why?

344
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,020
Because you can't stand losing. But...

345
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,510
that's not love but greed, you bastard.

346
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,160
He's here! He's here.

347
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,200
Who is he, Hyungnim?

348
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,820
I don't know.

349
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,660
<i>Welcome, Hyungnim!</i>

350
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:41,113
You've done well, CEO Yeom.

351
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:45,133
Thank you. Call on me whenever I can be of service to the country.

352
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,283
Hey.

353
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,533
Oh, say hello.

354
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:57,723
This is Team Captain Oh, who is serving our director as his right hand.

355
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,553
He's the real boss behind our company, you know what I'm saying?

356
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:03,423
Team Captain Oh said he wanted to see you, so he came along.

357
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,583
I am Yeom Gwang Tak. Thank you in advance.

358
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,243
I am Oh.

359
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:16,793
Oh, I see. This here is my junior who led this past operation.

360
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:18,903
He is my sworn brother

361
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:21,143
who is like Guan Yu and Zhang Fei for me.

362
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:22,753
All right, please introduce yourself.

363
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,913
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

364
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,223
We've met before, right?

365
00:23:36,223 --> 00:23:38,213
All right, great job.

366
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,103
Although a bit of violence broke out,

367
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:42,023
you did a great job of it.

368
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,213
Thank you.

369
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:45,503
Mr. Yeom.

370
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:46,953
Yes.

371
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:53,673
- You know the apartment in the redevelopment site?
- Yes.

372
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,103
You can be sole contractor

373
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,973
- for delivering the windows.
 - Excuse me?

374
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:01,423
So, I'm not getting stickers?

375
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,453
Stickers?

376
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,293
It's not good enough for you?

377
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,863
Do you know what great profit windows bring in?

378
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:14,543
Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you, Manager.

379
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:17,293
What are you doing not bringing in the girls?

380
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:24,103
Manager, I called a special girl to come in just for you.

381
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:25,763
Oh, really?

382
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:29,823
- I'm looking forward to it.
 - You can look forward to it.

383
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:31,743
- Yeon Joo!
 - Boss!

384
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:33,363
- Let me ask you a favor!
 - Wait!

385
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:35,603
I've never asked you for something like this before!

386
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:37,623
- This is really not it!
 - I'm sorry, Yeon Joo.

387
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,283
- I really don't want to do this!
- Yeon Joo!

388
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,873
Please just save me this once!

389
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,183
Boss, you spare me.

390
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,993
You know I hate this stuff!

391
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,353
I know, I know. I know it very well, so...

392
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:51,113
just this once!

393
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:53,203
Please, I beg you!

394
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:56,643
One of the men who came today is really powerful.

395
00:24:56,643 --> 00:25:00,603
Hey, it would be really good for you to get to know him, too!

396
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:02,663
I will just quit being an actress instead.

397
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:04,253
Hey!

398
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:09,553
Hey. Are you seriously going to be like this when I'm begging you?

399
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:10,933
Are you seriously going to be like this?

400
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,293
Boss, you really shouldn't be like this!

401
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:16,373
I took it easy on you, and you are acting like this? I should just–

402
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:18,403
What are you doing?

403
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:20,053
What the...

404
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:22,163
Let go of me.

405
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,323
<i>- Move!
- W-Wait—</i>

406
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,653
<i>- Aigoo.
- Gosh, no!</i>

407
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,173
<i>You assholes!</i>

408
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,993
<i>Gosh, this little!</i>

409
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:31,333
<i>Hey.</i>

410
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:33,723
<i>Escort her politely.</i>

411
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,263
<i>- Yes, Hyungnim.
- I'm sorry.</i>

412
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,283
Hey, hey!

413
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:39,453
I came to see your boss!

414
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:42,373
Then go inside by yourself. She said she doesn't want to go.

415
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:43,493
What?

416
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,183
Get going quickly.

417
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,253
Hey, Song Yeon Joo. Hey, Song Yeon Joo!

418
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:54,043
Hey, where are you going?

419
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:57,183
- Wait, wait, wait! That hurts!
 - Why's it so loud out here?

420
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,453
That hurts!

421
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:00,463
What are you doing not coming inside, CEO Yoon!

422
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:01,883
Where is Song Yeon Joo?

423
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:06,593
So, this bastard bent my arm back

424
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:08,533
and just sent Song Yeon Joo off.

425
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,273
- Gosh!
 - What?

426
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,283
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. He was dragging her in when she didn't want to.

427
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,933
You bastard! You asshole...

428
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:19,793
Do you know what an important meeting this is?

429
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:24,053
Also, who do you think you are to tell her to go or not!

430
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:25,813
You should stop, Hyungnim.

431
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,483
What's this?

432
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,963
You'd better move it.

433
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,883
Hyungnim.

434
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,063
You rude bastard!

435
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:43,453
Are you going to teach the kids like this?

436
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:46,543
Go run over there and bring back Song Yeon Joo.

437
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:50,593
- I told you to go bring her back–
 - Hyungnim!

438
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:53,303
It's my fault. Please hit me instead.

439
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,193
Look at these bastards.

440
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,123
Hey, Lee Doo Hak.

441
00:26:58,123 --> 00:27:01,533
Educate this bastard in front of me.

442
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,993
Hurry up and do it, you bastard.

443
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,573
You should do your job properly.

444
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,693
Are you joking?

445
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,943
This is how you educate someone, you bastard.

446
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:24,943
Get up, get up. Come here. Come here.

447
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,893
Educate him.

448
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:37,863
Look at this bastard.

449
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,793
What's this?

450
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:43,953
Geez.

451
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,053
What?

452
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,013
Stop!

453
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,623
Song Yeon Joo!

454
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,053
CEO Yoon. Hurry up and take her!

455
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:58,733
- Yes.
 - You guys.

456
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,893
We'll talk about this later, okay?

457
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:05,023
CEO Yoon, hurry up!

458
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:08,243
Yeon Joo, hurry up and come!

459
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,533
Hello, I'm actress Song Yeon Joo.

460
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,413
I'm a fan.

461
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,863
I've watched every movie you're in, Ms. Song Yeon Joo.

462
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,723
Without my wife knowing.

463
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,433
All right. Look at her. She's pretty, good at acting,

464
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,873
and lacking nothing.

465
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:29,793
Thank you.

466
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,643
Well, Ms. Song Yeon Joo will sing a song for us.

467
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:36,083
All right. Give her a round of applause!

468
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:40,543
Thank you, but...

469
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,893
I don't want to sing.

470
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,423
And I don't want to pour you drinks, either.

471
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:49,253
H-Hey, S-Song Yeon Joo, why are you suddenly doing this?

472
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:51,993
I don't want to be Song Yeon Joo, either.

473
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:56,493
You guys came to see actress Song Yeon Joo, right?

474
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,853
My real name is Park Jeong Mi.

475
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:04,283
So from now on, I am no longer an actress nor Song Yeon Joo.

476
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:07,553
I will just live as Park Jeong Mi.

477
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,613
Then I can go, right?

478
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:13,003
- W-What... get her...
 - Why's she being like that?

479
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,973
I will go and bring her back quickly!

480
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:20,063
I'm sorry. It appears something went wrong...

481
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:32,343
Do you want to have a rolled omelette and a drink?

482
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,383
No honorifics?

483
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:37,553
I'm older than I look.

484
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,573
I don't drink with actresses.

485
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,633
I just quit not too long ago.

486
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,523
I don't drink with a woman who's older than me.

487
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:08,513
An egg is useless for getting rid of bruises.

488
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:11,163
Apply this on it.

489
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:13,193
After you ice it a couple more times,

490
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,203
when the pain goes away and the bruise spreads out more,

491
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:17,123
apply a warm wet towel on it.

492
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:19,123
It'll get better really quickly.

493
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:22,913
Are you also a thug?

494
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,803
You know that well.

495
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:28,483
Of course, I know it well.

496
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,643
At least gangsters get to hit back when they get hit.

497
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:40,033
It's always one sided beatings in my field.

498
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:43,263
Since rumors spread if you go to the hospital...

499
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:46,643
you can't help but become an expert on bruises.

500
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:51,693
Well, ask away if you're curious about other types of injuries.

501
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:57,463
What if your bone breaks from getting hit by a club?

502
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,313
Why?

503
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:02,273
You don't know about that one?

504
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:08,513
You need to go to the hospital, then. You idiot.

505
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:12,123
You're such a nutcase.

506
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:20,493
I'm really sorry about this.

507
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:21,693
Please forgive me.

508
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:24,023
Gosh, it's okay.

509
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:27,063
I didn't come to drink in the first place.

510
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:30,273
I just came to have a discussion with you.

511
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:31,273
So don't worry about it.

512
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:33,203
If there's anything I can help you with...

513
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:35,033
I'll do anything.

514
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:38,453
Monopoly on the sashes isn't enough for you, is it?

515
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:41,343
O-Of course, it is enough.

516
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,643
Instead of just dealing with the tenants,

517
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:47,053
- why don't you do the construction yourself?
- Pardon?

518
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,593
The construction...

519
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:53,013
Well, I'd wish I can do that, too.

520
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,913
But I don't have enough capital for that, yet.

521
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:01,513
CEO Yeom, you just prepare 20% of the construction cost.

522
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:04,403
We'll fill in the rest for you.

523
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:10,203
Also, we'll personally tell you where to do the construction.

524
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:12,693
It's 100% certain.

525
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:15,153
This isn't only about Seoul.

526
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:17,783
It's a development project encompassing the entire area around the capital.

527
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:20,423
It's a phenomenal amount of money.

528
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,293
There's a condition, though.

529
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,733
Please go ahead.

530
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:31,253
Firstly, we get 70% of the shares and you get 30%.

531
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,143
We're giving you 10% more shares than your capital

532
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:37,593
because you'll be taking care of laundering the funds and the taxes.

533
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:38,783
I understand.

534
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:41,313
Secondly, you may not tell even King of Hades

535
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:43,793
that we're involved in this.

536
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:46,133
If you violate this condition,

537
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,783
you won't be able to handle it.

538
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:51,873
I'll swear to you!

539
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:54,043
you'll have my loyalty.

540
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,623
Oh, and also...

541
00:32:57,623 --> 00:32:59,513
I have one more favor to ask of you.

542
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:01,143
Yes, sure.

543
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:04,603
Please take care!

544
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:06,283
Please take care!

545
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:11,623
Please take care.

546
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,903
Aigoo.

547
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:18,313
Yes, Doo Hak.

548
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:21,623
Hey, I was a bit too harsh earlier, wasn't I?

549
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:23,333
Not at all, Hyungnim.

550
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,833
- But what did he want to see you for?
- Huh?

551
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,833
Oh, it's nothing.

552
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,503
He just asked for my help from now on, too.

553
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:35,403
Just like I've been doing so far.

554
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,463
- How anticlimactic.
- Seriously, those people.

555
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:40,013
We do our job right even without them telling us.

556
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,743
Hey, Doo Hak.

557
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:45,643
Feel better, man. All right?

558
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,783
I'm the so-called boss, right?

559
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:52,053
So I got a little carried away, being humiliated in front of the customers.

560
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:53,503
Oh, that's right.

561
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:55,763
Take this.

562
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:58,553
Treat the boys to some good food.

563
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:00,523
And let them have unwind a bit.

564
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,573
- Thank you, Hyungnim.
- Sure.

565
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:05,383
You can all take off now.

566
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:08,773
<i>Take care, Hyungnim.</i>

567
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:24,953
Gosh, there's no space.

568
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:26,763
Where is it?

569
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:30,023
Oh, it's right here.

570
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:50,813
No, this isn't enough capital.

571
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:59,893
Gosh, there's just no answer.

572
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:25,583
Take a shot.

573
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:34,173
There's nothing to waste about a cow, from its head to its tail.

574
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:40,423
We're probably the only ones who even make a stew out of the insides.

575
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:45,763
Gosh, we ate so many intestine soups at this place, right?

576
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:47,543
We did.

577
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:50,893
And you were the one who said we'll be

578
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:54,563
brothers who are transparent to the intestines with each other until death.

579
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:55,803
Of course!

580
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:59,613
That's why I came back to see you.

581
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,723
You remember what I said, right?

582
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:03,513
The one who will inherit my business

583
00:36:03,513 --> 00:36:04,963
isn't Lee Doo Hak who came in from outside.

584
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:08,683
It's you, who has been through shit with me since we were young.

585
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,143
Hey, tigers, you see...

586
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,143
They push their offspring against a cliff

587
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:16,893
and only raise the ones who climb back up, right?

588
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,853
That's who you are!

589
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:25,523
Also, Doo Hak that bastard will never be the one to eat intestine soup with me.

590
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,783
Come on. You hung in there.

591
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:47,913
<i>Firstly, we get 70% of the shares and you get 30%.</i>

592
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,823
<i>We're giving you 10% more shares than your capital </i>

593
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:54,223
<i>because you'll be taking care of laundering the funds and the taxes.</i>

594
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:55,313
<i>I understand.</i>

595
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,413
<i>Secondly, you may not tell even god</i>

596
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:59,863
<i>that we're involved in this.</i>

597
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,453
<i>If you violate this condition,</i>

598
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,533
<i>you won't be able to handle it.</i>

599
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,863
I had to know what Big Hyungnim was scheming.

600
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,753
Just how much does 30% of the shares in a construction company come out to?

601
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,993
Even if it's 30%, it's at least on the  billion won scale.

602
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:18,963
On top of that, if it's the entire area around the capital,

603
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:22,423
- it'll be more or less the same as a major corporation.
- Whoa...

604
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:31,573
Let's...

605
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:34,543
take this deal for ourselves.

606
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:38,053
It was given to Big Hyungnim.

607
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:41,253
Will they give us the job if we get rid of Big Hyungnim?

608
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:42,763
Seriously.

609
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,633
What matters to these people isn't the person who's doing the job.

610
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:48,903
It's how good of a hunting dog you are.

611
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:51,553
You said we're talking major corporation level.

612
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:52,883
Let's pull of a big one and

613
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:55,803
let's get ourselves out of this shithole.

614
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:58,623
How long are we going to live like this?

615
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:03,443
You at least have a guess on what company these people are from, right?

616
00:38:03,443 --> 00:38:05,593
What about that? Why does it matter?

617
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,463
Let's be careful here.

618
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:11,323
These people are on a different level from us. They're people who...

619
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:14,683
can get all of us here killed without breaking a sweat.

620
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:18,553
Get us killed? All of us?

621
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,963
Which organization are they from?

622
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,293
We already experienced them once, you idiot.

623
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:25,873
It's the KCIA!

624
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:28,323
KCIA again?

625
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:29,963
Damn, this is giving me chills.

626
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:31,783
Step out of it if you're scared.

627
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:35,223
Are we doing it?

628
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:44,703
I heard you're selling drugs these days.

629
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,463
Sorry?

630
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,423
Wait, how did you know?

631
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:53,193
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:55,283
I was just making quick money to get me by.

633
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:56,843
I know you really hate it, though.

634
00:38:56,843 --> 00:39:00,353
- I'll take my hands off right away—
- No, no.

635
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:04,193
Hey, it could happen when things aren't going well.

636
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,813
Also, since you're doing it anyway, go big like a man.

637
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,063
I'll have your back.

638
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,343
Hey, for gangsters nowadays,

639
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:15,653
money is power and what gets things done.

640
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,423
Especially if you're trying to become national level.

641
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:23,303
You can take your hands off the drugs when things are going well again.

642
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,293
Hyungnim, why so suddenly?

643
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,313
Young Pil...

644
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:31,353
how long must we live in this single bedroom house?

645
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:33,573
Shouldn't we at least

646
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:35,253
be able to let out

647
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:39,313
a big fart in a proper mansion, even if it's not the 99 bedroom one?

648
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:44,133
So that it'll look nice and grand when you succeed me.

649
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:47,533
Hyungnim...

650
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,683
it could be dangerous and there will be rumors if I start going big out of nowhere.

651
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,173
- Even you could—
-  Just go ahead.

652
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:58,653
This is only a final test for the baby tiger, all right?

653
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,033
However,

654
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:06,463
my name can never be involved with drugs.

655
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:07,893
You know, right?

656
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:09,823
I'll keep that in mind, Hyungnim.

657
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:12,683
We can't.

658
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:14,063
Wait, why?

659
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,593
Why on Earth? Why do you always say we can't?

660
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:19,643
Just because you say we can't, does it mean we can't?

661
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:23,963
Of course it does.

662
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,713
Am I a dog, huh? Do you think I'm a dog?

663
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:29,903
I'm the boss, am I not?

664
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:38,093
This must be kept between only you and me.

665
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,493
No one else in our company may know about this.

666
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:41,683
Yes.

667
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:45,453
By the way, how much do they know about this?

668
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:48,963
Only the chief manager and the chief of security know.

669
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,113
Don't support them with our company's funds.

670
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:53,443
Let them get a loan from the banks.

671
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:56,393
Don't leave any trace of trade with us.

672
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:58,443
- I understand.
- Oh, and also...

673
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:01,893
take aside about 10% of ours for yourself.

674
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:05,413
There's no guarantee how long I'll be sitting in this seat.

675
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:09,253
And you also need to prepare for retirement, don't you?

676
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:15,173
Thank you.

677
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:30,943
What are you doing? Hurry up and get in position.

678
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,373
Doo Hak, o-one second please.

679
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:35,853
What kind of a capo dares to call his boss' name

680
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:37,643
without hesitation, huh?

681
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:39,723
Get in position!

682
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:55,113
Doo Hak, that's enough.

683
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,863
Hey, try embezzling one more time.

684
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:04,933
I'll really get you your coffin then. Okay?

685
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,653
Are you okay, Hyungnim?

686
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:15,033
- Easy.
- Let go, you bastards!

687
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:23,273
One million won?

688
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,023
He beat you up like a ragdoll

689
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:27,283
just for stealing a mere million won?

690
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:29,453
And it's not even that I used it for myself.

691
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,793
I gave it out to Wolf and Rotary, the rookies,

692
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:34,133
so they can buy themselves a suit.

693
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:36,113
Since he doesn't let them use a penny

694
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,463
besides for rent and food.

695
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,473
Gosh, seriously. Big Hyungnim and Lee Doo Hak, those bastards.

696
00:42:41,473 --> 00:42:43,873
They're really too harsh.

697
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:51,013
Did you guys really work without any allowances?

698
00:42:51,013 --> 00:42:53,923
Yes, Hyungnim. I borrowed money from my family.

699
00:42:53,923 --> 00:42:57,553
I borrowed money even from my friends, Hyungnim.

700
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,183
Are you saying those two shoved everything in their pockets only?

701
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:03,333
It was so bad—

702
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,953
That I had to steal company money.

703
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:10,623
They say family this and family that everyday.

704
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:14,213
But is this what family does?

705
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:16,333
We're not really a family.

706
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,293
Hey, Young Pil...

707
00:43:19,293 --> 00:43:21,173
please take us in.

708
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:24,923
I'll lead this revenge at the frontlines.

709
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:28,703
You used to be with Doo Hak since from jail.

710
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:30,833
How could I trust you?

711
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:52,823
I stole it from the safe in Doo Hak's office.

712
00:43:52,823 --> 00:43:56,293
30 million won. I could've just taken it and ran.

713
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:57,893
But I came to you.

714
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,973
To get my revenge!

715
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,793
Whoa, I'm feeling your sincerity now.

716
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:05,193
This is only  a drop in the bucket.

717
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:08,843
There's more than 10 times that in Gwang Tak's vault.

718
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:12,723
I know well because I run money errands every month.

719
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:15,903
You know how Gwang Tak never liked the banks.

720
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,423
That's true.

721
00:44:17,423 --> 00:44:19,603
For gangsters nowadays...

722
00:44:20,903 --> 00:44:22,583
money is power, isn't it?

723
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,603
If we just heist Gwang Tak's vault,

724
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:27,393
we can gather at least a few hundred more men.

725
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:29,863
We can get rid of...

726
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:33,523
Gwang Tak and Doo Hak, those bastards, at once.

727
00:44:38,223 --> 00:44:40,803
Hey, I want to do that, too.

728
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,263
But the timing isn't that great.

729
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,843
- Hey!
- Who are you?

730
00:44:45,843 --> 00:44:48,193
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

731
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:49,453
Move aside!

732
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,763
- Move aside.
- Everyone freeze!

733
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:56,943
Oh, I'm...

734
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:59,533
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong.

735
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:03,003
You're Young Pil, huh?

736
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:06,413
Nice to meet you.

737
00:45:13,152 --> 00:45:14,562
Actually...

738
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:17,901
my target isn't...

739
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:20,461
you, but Yeom Gwang Tak.

740
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:24,601
You know how Yeom Gwang Tak kicked you out and

741
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:28,711
has been building up his gang with this guy named Lee Doo Hak, right?

742
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:32,991
Well, night clubs and liquor stores are just the classics.

743
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,501
Breaking off union strikes with thugs,

744
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,451
assault and violence against tenants of redevelopment sites...

745
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,961
he's such a pain in the neck.

746
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:40,381
However...

747
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,211
I don't know if someone's got their backs,

748
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:46,121
but they keep getting loose like snakes.

749
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:49,391
That's why our reputation is the worst in the media.

750
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:53,711
Saying the government protects them and stuff. That's why...

751
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:56,981
we need to execute one figure as a symbol,

752
00:45:56,981 --> 00:46:01,021
in order to calm the media, as decide by our chief executives.

753
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,751
You just need to hand over evidence of

754
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,871
Yeom Gwang Tak and Lee Doo Hak's crimes to us after taking over the gang.

755
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:11,451
In the end, we did our part of patriotism, calming people's anger.

756
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:14,461
And you'll get your revenge and also take over the gang.

757
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,141
A favor for a favor, I scratch your back if you'll scratch mine.

758
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:19,661
How is it?

759
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:24,221
Are you telling me to believe that right now?

760
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:26,641
Young Pil...

761
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,201
what's the use of arresting a small fish like you?

762
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,311
Our goal is to have a big catch.

763
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,151
Even if your name comes out on the newspaper, no one would know.

764
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:37,651
We need someone at least on Yeom Gwang Tak's level for people to know.

765
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:39,871
Don't look down on me!

766
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:43,291
No one knows what will happen in the future.

767
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:46,831
Sure, yes. That's why...

768
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,851
Young Pil...

769
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:53,601
in this world, day and night must exist.

770
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:55,001
All right?

771
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,931
How can we only have grass and flowers?

772
00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:59,391
There's also rabbits that feed on those grass and flowers.

773
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:03,391
And there are wolves and tigers that feed on those rabbits, yeah?

774
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,841
Even if you don't, someone's going to take over that position.

775
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:08,301
So you go ahead and take it!

776
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:09,991
Instead,

777
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:13,691
you just need to cooperate and don't cause any major trouble.

778
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:15,211
Okay?

779
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:19,941
Hey, step on it more!

780
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,461
Y-Yes.

781
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:28,941
[The Prosecution]

782
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:34,491
During the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592,

783
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:37,261
Admiral Yi Sun-sin didn't obey the king's order to move out,

784
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:40,951
after which he was beaten and removed from his position, right?

785
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:45,651
If you don't listen to the king, it's the death penalty right away. However...

786
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:49,151
Admiral Yi Sun-sin made great contributions before that,

787
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:51,301
so the king gave him a letter of pardon.

788
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,531
What's a letter of pardon?

789
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,381
It's a certificate that says you'll be pardoned

790
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:59,911
from death penalty once, regardless of whatever crime you commit.

791
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:04,211
This is what that is.

792
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:08,711
Hey, this is really hard to get, all right?

793
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:12,351
You can't show it to other people or brag about it, okay?

794
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:17,221
All right. Now, I'll stamp—

795
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:19,091
I mean, I'll put my fingerprint on it.

796
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:22,441
And after you put yours, your safety is guaranteed.

797
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,841
And it's game over.

798
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:27,241
[Certificate]

799
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,921
You're here?

800
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:47,891
- I'm sorry for coming late.
- It's okay.

801
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,591
Please take a seat.

802
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,111
- I think I'll order some tea first.
- No.

803
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:57,101
I don't need the tea.

804
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,891
I'm thankful that you thought of me,

805
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:02,371
but I really retired.

806
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,891
When did you retire?

807
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:06,601
Yesterday.

808
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:08,921
So please cast another actress.

809
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,721
This movie will really succeed.

810
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,691
The role is perfect for you, too.

811
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:15,731
- And I'll give you a good guarantee—
- Then...

812
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,341
an actress who fell in love with a gangster.

813
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,441
Will that be okay?

814
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:25,731
Not in a movie, in real life.

815
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:28,091
I'm also a crazy bitch.

816
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:33,731
You know those gangsters who took me from a filming set before, right?

817
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:36,881
O-Oh, yes.

818
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:40,171
I can't help my feelings for him.

819
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:42,201
Yes, I'm going to date him.

820
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,501
I'm crazy, right?

821
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,961
Thank you for coming out today.

822
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,431
Now, then.

823
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:04,541
You're indeed crazy.

824
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,381
You'll get indigestion. Take your time.

825
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,111
I need to finish eating quickly and

826
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,621
go back to work right after.

827
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:29,261
By the way, what's the serious talk you mentioned?

828
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,931
Don't you have any woman you're seeing?

829
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:39,221
I heard matchmaking madams flock to other judges and

830
00:50:39,221 --> 00:50:42,141
prosecutors ever since they're in the training institute.

831
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:46,321
You called me in to ask me that?

832
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:47,611
Why?

833
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,191
Are you worried your son won't get married?

834
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:51,731
That's not it.

835
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:53,681
What is it, then?

836
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:57,221
If you get married,

837
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,321
your father's seat will be empty, you know?

838
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:06,281
Never mind.

839
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:08,941
Let's talk about it again later. Do you want coffee?

840
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,071
Mom, are you dating someone?

841
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:17,771
That's not it.

842
00:51:17,771 --> 00:51:20,321
You are. Right?

843
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:22,241
Well...

844
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,951
How great.

845
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:26,251
That's really great.

846
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,061
Is that really what you think?

847
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:29,711
I mean it!

848
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,271
For my mom, who's so young and pretty,

849
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:35,301
does it make sense for her to spend the rest of her life alone?

850
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,371
If you didn't have such interests,

851
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:39,841
I was thinking about getting you a guy myself.

852
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:42,311
It's really great.

853
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:48,571
Cheol Woong...

854
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,501
Wait.

855
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:01,391
Were you worried I was going to be against it?

856
00:52:02,381 --> 00:52:04,341
Because of Dad?

857
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:10,971
Dad has me, who's continuing the Choi family heritage.

858
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:18,461
By the way, what does he do for a living?

859
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:21,971
When, where, and how did you meet him?

860
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:25,041
He's a good person.

861
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,731
I'll arrange  a meeting later.

862
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:32,311
My, goodness. I'm really excited.

863
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:36,161
Mom, dating and all...

864
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,631
you're better than your son.

865
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:45,941
It's cold.

866
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:47,481
Hurry up and go inside.

867
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,621
- Take care.
- All right. I'm off.

868
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:14,831
"Baseball stadium. The audience is cheering loudly."

869
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:16,711
Hey, Jung Shin!

870
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:18,821
If you sign the papers with Director Lee Jang Ho,

871
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,801
you have to let me sing one of the OSTs, okay?

872
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:26,301
If you don't, I'll pack my things and go to Yeosu.

873
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:30,261
Just go now. All right?

874
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:33,621
Who is it at this time?

875
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:38,091
"Today's victory alone is really..."

876
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:41,411
Oh, my. Cheol Woong!

877
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:45,231
Well, pork belly with soju?

878
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:47,601
Hey, Jung Shin!

879
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:52,251
Hey!

880
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,561
What's the occasion?

881
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:03,461
This is for your mom getting a boyfriend?

882
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:06,961
You need to drink with your mom. Why are you celebrating here?

883
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:15,941
- Are you unhappy my mom got a boyfriend?
- I'm not.

884
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:18,451
Can't you just congratulate her, when you're not even  a stranger?

885
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,591
All right. I do congratulate her. I do.

886
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:26,321
But I'm just not sure if it's in my place to congratulate. It's weird.

887
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:30,741
I sincerely congratulate you and your mom, Cheol Woong.

888
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,911
Hey, Cheol Woong...

889
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:36,911
you're really cool.

890
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:43,181
There wouldn't be that many men in this world who celebrates his mom's remarriage.

891
00:54:43,181 --> 00:54:48,221
Cheol Woong, would you like to listen to a song I wrote?

892
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:50,681
Sure.

893

900
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:39,081
Listening to this song, it feels...

901
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:41,381
just like how I feel.

902
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,041
Oh, my, is that so?

903

905
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:18,201
Gosh, that stupid dog.

906
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:21,551
What's wrong with them?

907
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:28,071
I'll take care of Hyungnim.

908
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:31,561
Take both Achilles' heels from Doo Hak.

909
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:07,051
You mustn't fail.

910
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,461
If Doo Hak joins forces with Hyungnim, things will be harder.

911
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:21,371
- Hey!
- What the hell?

912
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:26,591
Die!

913
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,211
Hey—

914
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:32,771
Stop!

915
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:40,211
- Hyungnim! Hyungnim!
- Why?

916
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:43,281
- What's the matter?
- Hyungnim, please escape through the emergency exit.

917
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:48,301
That son of a bitch.

918
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,511
Shit!

919
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:27,161
Where did he go?

920
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,521
Gosh.

921
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,811
Who is it?

922
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:52,481
- You're here?
- Who is it?

923
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:01,521
Whoa! Young Pil.

924
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,731
Hey, you came just in time.

925
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,371
You're really the only one.

926
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:10,811
Hey, this is Doo Hak that asshole's doing, right?

927
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:13,331
That f***er. I knew it.

Hey, Young Pil...

00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:21,691
how did you know to come here?

931
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,401
Seriously.

932
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:27,821
How do you think I knew?

933
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,711
Young Pil!

934
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:20,051
Even though we ambushed him, he fought back so much.

935
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,951
We had a bit of trouble.

936
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,701
Great job.

937
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:25,121
