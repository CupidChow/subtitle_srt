2
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,499
As such, the prosecution is
indicting Choi Cheol Woong with

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,219
100,000 won fine for assault.

4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,910
For Lee Doo Hak...

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,749
Sorry.

6
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,419
Didn't I tell you that I was
going to watch a movie today?

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,089
I forgot.

8
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,839
I feel like you're slacking off these days.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,819
You want me to hit you with my nunchucks?

10
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,279
One of them came but the other didn't?

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,989
I should just beat these guys up!

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,190
Of course, he'll come. Just wait a bit.

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,650
Gosh, that scared me!

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,259
Gosh, that took me by surprise.

15
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,490
Gosh, seriously!

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,750
First, I'll meet you.

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,400
But with whom?

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,309
I don't know. Let's wait
and see for that one.

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,029
How can I pick when I've
only seen you a couple times?

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,669
How long are you going to wait and see?

21
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,990
For...

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,959
about a year?

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,650
Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,080
He's really gotten gutsy, hasn't he?

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,299
He would dare stand up Oh Jung Shin?

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,049
Do you think he forgot?

27
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,689
He forgot?

28
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,699
You guys are just the same!

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,179
What are you guys, brothers?

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,559
Let's just go inside by ourselves.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,439
W-Wait, let's not do that.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,859
How about we wait for him a bit longer?

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,620
I'm dating you! I'm not dating Cheol Woong!

34
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,779
Cheol Woong doesn't know that yet...

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,259
I will tell him today.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,060
It's already time for the movie to start.
Let's just go inside.

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,320
W-Wait.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,169
Gosh, I don't think we should.

39
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,459
Let's look around for
Cheol Woong a bit more.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,789
You just wait here.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,270
I will be right back
after circling the block.

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,710
Hey!

43
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,060
Gosh.

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,660
Look who it is! It's Choi Cheol Woong.

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,699
Come and look at our new and latest!

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,910
Please come!

47
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,830
Aigoo... Aigoo.

48
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,069
What... Look at this bastard.

49
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,990
Where did you hide your money?

50
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,749
The money...

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,799
It's my family's bank,

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,289
so try going to the bank, you bastard.

53
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,619
Gosh, look at this crazy bastard.

54
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,089
Just see how he talks to a hyung.

55
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,560
- You haven't had enough, you bastard.
- Cheol Woong!

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,969
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my!

57
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,209
Go away.

58
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,259
I told you to go away!

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,799
Just leave me be!

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,339
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

61
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,629
Is she your girlfriend?

62
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,329
She's so scary. Much scarier than you.

63
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,299
What are you guys, thugs?

64
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,129
Piss off before I report you guys!

65
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, my! Oh, my!

66
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,729
Let's go, Choi Cheol Woong, please!

67
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,010
Let's hurry up and go.

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,539
Hey.

69
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,280
Let go of me!

70
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,409
You f♪♪♪ing pieces of trash!

71
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,670
This bitch!

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,430
You f♪♪♪ing son of a bitch!

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,489
No, Cheol Woong! No!

74
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,089
Let's just report them! You can't do this!

75
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,670
Put that away!

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,240
Someone save us!

77
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,689
Someone save us!

78
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,809
I thought educated guys
wouldn't use weapons.

79
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,699
Stay still!

80
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,950
I might have to start wearing a
steel plate underneath my shirt.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,009
You try wielding a knife at me again.

82
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,580
I'll crush you then.

83
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,790
Let's go.

84
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,350
Let's go!

85
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,360
Are you okay?

86
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,189
Are you okay? Oh, no...

87
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,940
You...

88
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,589
That f♪♪♪ing son of a bitch!

89
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,059
I'll kill him with my own hands!

90
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,789
No, Cheol Woong! It's okay.

91
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,779
- Don't fight him. Let's just report him.
- No.

92
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,949
I will pay him back ten, no,
a hundred times for this!

93
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,659
No, Cheol Woong.

94
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,289
Doo Hak will be here soon.

95
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's just go back.

96
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,980
Why?

97
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,969
Are you telling me I should
tell on them to Hyung?

98
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,989
Why are you being like
that when we're friends?

99
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,800
Friends?

100
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,900
Friends?

101
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,849
I'm back.

102
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,309
Hey, you don't stop by Cheol Woong's school

103
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,649
after you finish school, right?

104
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,370
Oh, I went a few times, but Cheol Woong
said I didn't have to come anymore.

105
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,519
Cheol Woong.

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,440
Cheol Woong!

107
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,840
Let's at least go to the
pharmacy to treat your wounds.

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,140
Didn't you say we should stay
friends for about a year?

109
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,790
You said it.

110
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,180
That you can't pick since you've
only seen us a couple times.

111
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,489
My feelings...

112
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,060
just turned out like that.

113
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,709
I understand.

114
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,160
So hurry up and go home.

115
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,759
Cheol Woong. Doo Hak is waiting for us–

116
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,459
I don't want to see the two of you today!

117
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,500
That's how I feel!

118
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,820
Cheol Woong!

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,509
Cheol Woong.

120
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,130
It's me.

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,790
I heard you got hurt.
Did you get in a fight?

122
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,039
Am I someone who would go
around getting beaten up?

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,219
I got a bit hurt after tripping.

124
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,259
Did you get hurt badly?

125
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,329
Let me see your wound.

126
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,999
I'm fine,

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,319
so just go.

128
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,010
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,870
Come on,

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,080
let me see it!

131
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,390
I told you I'm fine!

132
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,070
Who is the bastard that hit you?

133
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,479
What do you mean someone hit me?

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,249
I told you I just tripped!

135
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,010
Just leave!

136
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,229
Mom.

137
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,139
Why are you here?

138
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,000
I was worried about the kid.

139
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,660
Who did he fight with?

140
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,250
He says he just tripped.

141
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,519
Do you actually believe that?

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,369
Cheol Woong is too proud

143
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,800
to admit it even if he did get hit.

144
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,199
I told you...

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,609
to just leave, didn't I?

146
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,800
Cheol Woong, it's me.

147
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,259
Hyung...

148
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,979
just left a moment ago.

149
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,049
It's not about that.

150
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,960
I just heard that you
got hurt a little bit.

151
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,769
I bought this at the market last time.

152
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,189
It's made in the U.S.!

153
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,629
It's really good for bruises or sprains.

154
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,369
I tried using it before

155
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,439
and the next day, it
didn't hurt at all anymore!

156
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,379
What are you doing here?

157
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,530
Aigoo!

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,229
Oh, it's not like that, Ma'am... Oh, no...

159
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,929
I just heard that Cheol
Woong was a bit hurt,

160
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,439
so I was trying to give
him some good ointment...

161
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,509
We have first aid
medication at our home, too.

162
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,939
Also,

163
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,299
even if we are neighbors who are
comfortable with one another,

164
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,859
isn't it too rude of you to come
to our place at such a late hour

165
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,159
without permission?

166
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,220
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,959
Doo Hak, you, too.

168
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,579
Don't come by here when it's late.

169
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

170
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,830
Let's go.

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,620
Just get going.

172
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,329
Aigoo! I have no affection
for her whatsoever!

173
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,150
She's so young and yet she
thinks she's the wife of a lord!

174
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,929
But who did Cheol Woong
get beaten up by like that?

175
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,259
When he was hanging out with you,
things like that never happened.

176
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,099
Gosh, when your father said he was
sending you to agricultural high school,

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,970
I should have done everything to stop him!

178
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,149
Are you upset that I went to
an agricultural high school,

179
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,290
or that Cheol Woong got beaten up?

180
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,279
I'm upset about both.

181
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,899
Both.

182
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,270
Gosh.

183
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,210
Geez...

184
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,579
I'm sure I told you not to come.

185
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,799
I didn't come to go with you.

186
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,139
Jung Shin said she really
needs to see you tonight.

187
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,700
She says she has something to tell you.

188
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,940
Where we ate grilled clams.

189
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,310
What about you, Hyung?

190
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,740
I'll come later.

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,109
I'm ashamed of myself, Oppa.

192
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,109
He's quite an amazing man.

193
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,639
But...

194
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,109
he would reject our nomination
and run independently?

195
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,319
I know it's like hitting your
head against a brick wall.

196
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,899
I'm going to do whatever I
can to make him reconsider.

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,579
We don't even have money,

198
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,380
so how could he run
independent of a party...

199
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,639
He kicked aside a feast table laid
out for him. How would you stop him?

200
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,089
Madam Kang, you are going through a
lot after marrying a lofty-minded man.

201
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,760
Okay. You can go now.

202
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,919
And take this with you.

203
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,489
- No, how could I?
- Just take it.

204
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,969
This is probably the money you
gathered from your emergency funds.

205
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,599
You should use it to
provide for your household.

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,500
No, I–

207
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm sorry, Oppa.

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,129
What's the likelihood that Choi
Young Shik will be elected?

209
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,649
Well...

210
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,219
I also spoke with the KCIA.

211
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,259
- What did they say?
- It's likely that he will receive more than 30% of the votes.

212
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,520
So it's possible he wins
the election in first place.

213
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,690
Really?

214
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,309
He's got such a following in
the region as a familiar face,

215
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,710
and he's got the afterglow of his father
being a leader of the independence movement.

216
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,669
Have you looked into his weaknesses?

217
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,140
His history with both his
business and women are clean.

218
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,529
If you had not done something
about it in advance,

219
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,940
it would have been quite
the headache, Commander.

220
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,500
I am Ki Young Tak.

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,020
Do you want to get
expelled and go to prison?

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,039
I'm sorry!

223
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,589
I won't ever bully these guys again.

224
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,990
I mean it, I swear!

225
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,430
What?

226
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,900
That's not what you need to do.

227
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,390
You know this guy, right?

228
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,779
Oh, yes.

229
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,469
He always goes everywhere

230
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,449
with the guy he calls Hyung.

231
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,379
Choi Cheol Woong.

232
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,699
Yes.

233
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,960
Well, all you have to do is get
beat up by Choi Cheol Woong a bit.

234
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,139
If you bleed, even better.

235
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,580
Excuse me?

236
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,689
Geez...

237
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,829
Seriously.

238
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,629
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,889
You don't love me?

240
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,549
Gosh, this bastard.

241
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,399
How could you turn your back on me?

242
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,219
Gosh, this bastard, seriously!

243
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,539
He's so weak!

244
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm going to go throw up.

245
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
Damn it.

246
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,059
What's this?

247
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,839
Jung Shin isn't coming.

248
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,219
Also,

249
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,660
I heard what this bastard did.

250
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,550
Did I ever tell you to do this, Hyung?

251
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,209
I was going to beat him up
even without your help, Hyung.

252
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,629
What, you think I would lose?

253
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,249
Do you think that I would
lose to someone like him?

254
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,539
Hurry up and ask for his forgiveness.

255
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,749
And tell him that you won't
ever bother him again.

256
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,760
Are you joking?

257
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,779
You're a man and yet you bring someone
else because you can't beat me on your own?

258
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,489
You retard.

259
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,019
Hey, Ki Young Ta. What
did you say, you bastard?

260
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,839
Forget it.

261
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,510
You should stay out of this, Hyung.

262
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,069
Cheol Woong.

263
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,649
You should stop.

264
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,349
He already got beaten up enough by me.

265
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,199
I told you to move aside.

266
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,869
No?

267
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,639
What are you going to do?

268
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,300
I can get over me getting hit,

269
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,299
but this bastard...

270
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,980
This bastard hit Jung Shin!

271
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,499
Even I can't forgive him,

272
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,689
so you shouldn't forgive him all the more!

273
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,779
Since you guys decided to go out,

274
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,800
isn't that right?

275
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,340
Did Jung Shin really
get hit by this bastard?

276
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,370
Hey, Ki Young Tak.

277
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,659
It's great not having your minions here.

278
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,279
I will fight you
one-on-one, fair and square.

279
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,909
If you win, I'll give you my money too.

280
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,549
But if you lose, you will die here,

281
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,140
you got that?

282
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,550
You talk too much.

283
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,679
- Hey.
- Let go of me!

284
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,060
You can't beat me.

285
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,049
- Fight me.
- Get up, you bastard.

286
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,219
No?

287
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,350
I told you to get up!

288
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,049
Don't come over here!

289
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,200
If you get involved, I won't hold
back even if you're my hyung.

290
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,339
People like you who fools
around trusting others

291
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,210
to bail them out are so disgusting.

292
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,819
Don't ever act like you're all that

293
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,670
in front of that girl.

294
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,349
Are we finshed here?

295
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,110
I can go now, right?

296
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,670
Cheol Woong!

297
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,809
Get up and fight me again!

298
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,190
I told you to get up.

299
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,499
Ki Young Tak, wake up.

300
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,630
Young Tak!

301
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,430
W-What's this...

302
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,690
Is he dead?

303
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,479
Hey, Young Tak!

304
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,109
Ki Young Tak!

305
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,609
Gosh, damn it!

306
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,109
Doctor!

307
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,979
Yeosu Police Station received
a call from a hospital.

308
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,649
Two students brought in an injured
Ki Young Tak on their shoulders,

309
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,950
and he's currently in a coma.

310
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,909
He won't die, right?

311
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,320
Hyung, people don't die that easily, right?

312
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,659
He won't die.

313
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,950
He'll definitely live.

314
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,420
Cheol Woong.

315
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,429
Let's turn ourselves in.

316
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,170
Even if he were to survive,
we should pay the consequence.

317
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,069
Hyung.

318
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,339
I didn't do anything wrong.

319
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,889
This is self-defense.

320
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,559
Okay,

321
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,229
so let's go to the police
station and tell them.

322
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,779
I-I can't!

323
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,660
I won't go!

324
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,989
Also,

325
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,949
is this my fault?

326
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,879
When did I ever tell you to bring
that bastard Young Tak to me?

327
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,669
You tricked me by lying to me.

328
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,709
You said Jung Shin wanted to see me.

329
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,509
Didn't you bring that
bastard knowing full well

330
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,309
that I would do something
to him if you brought him?

331
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,159
So, all of this is your fault, Hyung.

332
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,060
Am I wrong?

333
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,090
I asked if I'm wrong!

334
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,550
You're right.

335
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,319
I guess this was all my fault.

336
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,440
It's all my fault.

337
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,250
No...

338
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,279
I must have lost it just then.

339
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,789
I'm the one who struck him with a rock.

340
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,940
All you did

341
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,549
was try to help me, Hyung...

342
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,070
Right?

343
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,700
Hyung...

344
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,560
I'm so scared.

345
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,199
If that bastard dies,

346
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,339
then I would become a
murderer and go to prison.

347
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,699
And my father's bid to become an assemblyman?
Forget that! He'll face public shame.

348
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,229
And my mother, who sees me as
her only hope, will collapse.

349
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,699
What should I do, Hyung?

350
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,500
What do I do?

351
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
Hyung.

352
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,229
Can't you please save me just this once?

353
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,790
Can't you tell them that you were the one who
hit Young Tak with a rock, instead of me?

354
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,310
Cheol Woong...

355
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,420
Hyung. Hyung, Hyung!

356
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,300
Please save me.

357
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,449
If you do this for me just this once,

358
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,409
I will take responsibility for your life!

359
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,719
No,

360
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,819
I will devote my life
to becoming successful

361
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,089
and I'll give you everything I have.

362
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,749
I know, Hyung,

363
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,759
that you always gave up a lot for me.

364
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,329
But really, I'll let
you live in first place

365
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,509
instead of me.

366
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,469
Hyung...

367
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,070
Please save me this once!

368
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,010
Hyung...

369
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,840
Why do I have to do that?

370
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,439
You're the one who did that,

371
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,020
so why do I have to take the blame?

372
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,189
Both my father

373
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,689
and I

374
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,569
lived like your servants all our lives!

375
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,350
Why do I have to take blame for
something like this as well!

376
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,509
Is it fine for you to live

377
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,780
and for me to die?

378
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,389
Is your life a human life,

379
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,900
and my life a dog's or a pig's life?

380
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,079
Hey.

381
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,010
What are you doing not going to bed?

382
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,229
Ahjussi,

383
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,379
if something goes wrong with Cheol Woong,

384
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,809
then both me and my husband,
and our entire family will die.

385
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,409
I'm begging you. Please save him...

386
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,909
You're my only hope, Ahjussi.

387
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,999
The only one who can save our family–
Ma'am!

388
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,259
I've never said no to anything

389
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,259
you have requested of me.

390
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,709
But...

391
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,799
But this...

392
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,529
I don't think this is right.

393
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,449
How could I do that to Doo Hak

394
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,019
- just to save Cheol Woong!
- Ahjussi!

395
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,059
Once my husband gets elected,

396
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,799
he will make sure he gets
out of prison in no time.

397
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,329
I will make sure that happens!

398
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,829
I will make sure to hire
the best lawyer available...

399
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,499
Ahjussi...

400
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,149
If my husband loses the
election, we will all die.

401
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,189
Only if he wins the
election will we all live.

402
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,269
Please, I beg you! Save us!

403
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,569
Save us, Ahjussi...

404
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,430
Gosh, damn it...

405
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,909
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

406
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,679
No, Ahjussi, please!

407
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,149
Save us, Ahjussi, please!

408
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,829
No, Ahjussi!

409
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,959
Let me go!

410
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,669
- No!
- Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

411
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,660
Ahjussi!

412
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,509
Aigoo...

413
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,069
No, no! Ahjussi!

414
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,489
Ahjussi!

415
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,989
I'm really sorry!

416
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,179
Just this once...

417
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,719
Please save me just this once!

418
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,670
Please save me this once!

419
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,139
Please save me this once!

420
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,500
Ahjussi...

421
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,550
Gosh, damn it, you bastard!

422
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,820
Why did you do this, you bastard!

423
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,099
Why did you do that...

424
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,229
- Ahjussi!
- Please, just this once...

425
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,770
Please save me just this once...

426
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,900
Doo Hak...

427
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,260
Wait!

428
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,439
You must have made a mistake and came.

429
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,729
My son is definitely not
someone who would do that.

430
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,899
Please look into it again before you come.

431
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,849
We're going to question him when
we get to the police station,

432
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,919
so just wait a bit.
What do you mean, question him!

433
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,189
You can ask everyone in this neighborhood,

434
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,449
if there is anybody as studious
and upright like my Doo Hak!

435
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,399
If you keep doing this, I'll also bring
you in for obstruction of justice!

436
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,589
Go ahead! Go ahead and bring me in!

437
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,510
Bring me in too!

438
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,729
You can't take my child!

439
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,919
You can't!

440
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,349
Doo Hak, hurry up and
tell them it's not you!

441
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,820
Tell them that you did nothing wrong!

442
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,519
Gosh, this is going to drive me nuts.

443
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,710
Hey, Officer Kim and Officer Park!
Why aren't you doing anything?

444
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,400
Gosh, seriously.

445
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,029
Doo Hak...

446
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,159
Doo Hak, what's going on?

447
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,639
Gosh, what's with this girl now?

448
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,929
It's not you, right?

449
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,690
You would never do
something like that. Right?

450
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,649
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

451
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,009
Look into my eyes and tell me.

452
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,179
You're not the type of guy
who would do that. Right?

453
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,629
It's not you!

454
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,239
Please step aside.

455
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,769
Please wait!

456
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,200
Lee Doo Hak! Lee Doo Hak!

457
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,659
Doo Hak, Doo Hak.

458
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,759
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong,
you know it, right?

459
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,709
Doo Hak isn't someone who would do that.

460
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,979
Choi Cheol Woong, Lee Doo Hak!

461
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,340
Answer me!

462
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,409
Please, just a moment! Guys...
Just a moment!

463
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,989
Doo Hak!

464
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,630
Doo Hak!

465
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,310
Doo Hak!

466
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,850
Doo Hak...

467
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,350
do not...

468
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,200
forgive your father...

469
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,519
Doo Hak! You can't take my child away!

470
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,469
You can't take my child away!

471
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,829
No, you can't! You can't take him!

472
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,939
You can't do this!

473
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,819
- Mom!
- Doo Hak...

474
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,719
- Mom!
- Doo Hak...

475
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,369
Doo Hak!

476
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,269
- Doo Hak!
- Mom! I'm sorry...

477
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,209
Doo Hak...

478
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,830
Those mean bastards...

479
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,009
Take me with you!

480
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,470
You can't take my child away...

481
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,169
What? His friend confessed to the crime?

482
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,129
Yes, his name is Lee Doo Hak.

483
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,879
He testified that when he saw Choi Cheol Woong get
severely beat up in his fight with Ki Young Tak,

484
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,739
he struck Ki Young Tak with a rock.

485
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,180
No! This won't do!

486
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,429
Lee Doo Hak is useless to me!

487
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,159
Keep delaying the court date
until after the election.

488
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,809
We need to turn Choi Cheol Woong, the son of
Choi Young Shik, into a murder accomplice.

489
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,239
Understood.

490
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,199
- Kim Wang Geun, Kim Wang Geun! - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam!
- Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

491
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,029
- Kim Wang Geun, Kim Wang Geun! - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam!
- Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

492
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,710
I am Candidate 2, Kim Wang Geun!

493
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,449
Everyone!

494
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,759
Should we not end the
totalitarian regime this time

495
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,780
and move towards the democracy
we long for, everyone?

496
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,689
Thank you!

497
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,480
Yes, thank you!

498
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,789
Choi Young Shik, the father
of a murderer, should resign!

499
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,019
Choi Young Shik, the father
of a murderer, should resign!

500
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,379
Choi Young Shik, who raised
a murderer, should go away!

501
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,019
Everyone! Yes, although there
was unfortunate accident,

502
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,749
- that has nothing to do with my son–
- Resign!

503
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,559
Resign!

504
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,780
Resign!

505
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,719
Come to your senses!

506
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,430
Resign!

507
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,189
(Vandalized posters of Choi Young Shik)

508
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,689
(Vandalized posters of Choi Young Shik)

509
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,659
Hey, didn't you tell me that
Cheol Woong was a witness?

510
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,779
You said he didn't fight him!

511
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,039
Why did you lie? Why?

512
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,319
Supposedly, he did get in a fight...

513
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,459
But supposedly, Cheol Woong only
ended up receiving a beating.

514
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,849
Supposedly, after seeing
that, Doo Hak got angry

515
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,400
and struck him with a rock.

516
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,009
No.

517
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,370
That's not true. The Doo Hak
I know would never do that.

518
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,570
By chance,

519
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,140
is our Cheol Woong
responsible for this mess?

520
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,769
Honey!

521
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,419
Honey.

522
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,349
You're hiding something from me, right?

523
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,460
Tell me the truth!

524
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,770
Mr. Choi.

525
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,849
That day,

526
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,210
Doo Hak told me everything.

527
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,000
He said he did it.

528
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,380
Is that true?

529
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
Yes...

530
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,820
It's the absolute truth.

531
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,540
Then, what about the fight?

532
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,070
Who was the one who started the fight?

533
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,339
W-Well...

534
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,809
- about that...
- Hyungnim.

535
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,120
Please tell me.

536
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,159
It's true...

537
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,910
that Cheol Woong started it.

538
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,260
It is true that my son

539
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,130
was involved.

540
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,060
Because of a loser like me,

541
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,340
you all

542
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,429
have gone through a lot.

543
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,389
I don't know what to say.

544
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,039
Truly,

545
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm sorry.

546
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,389
No, you can't!

547
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,049
You must not resign from the election!

548
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,139
The murderer is Doo Hak, not Cheol Woong!

549
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,599
Also, even if you are not
elected in first place,

550
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,369
you could still be elected in second place!

551
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,070
It's all over.

552
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,099
How could someone so false
like me serve in office?

553
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,009
It's not over.

554
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,809
- We can't let it be over!
- Honey...

555
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,440
Do you know how much money
we've spent for this?

556
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,179
If we back out now,

557
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,700
we will lose our lumber
mill and our farmland, too!

558
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,480
Did you...

559
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,749
get even the farmland
secured as collateral?

560
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,410
Yes!

561
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,529
I bet my life on your election.

562
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,509
If you resign here...

563
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,610
we'll be going down as a family.

564
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,309
Why a public attorney?

565
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:51,140
Didn't Cheol Woong's father say
he'll provide an expensive lawyer?

566
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,520
Doo Hak's father...

567
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,390
refused.

568
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,219
As such, the prosecution is
indicting Choi Cheol Woong with

569
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,659
100,000 won fine for assault.

570
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,899
For Lee Doo Hak for bodily
injury resulting in death,

571
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,169
he'll receive a maximum of five years

572
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,100
or a minimum sentence of
three years in imprisonment.

573
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,829
Aigoo...

574
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,299
My poor child...

575
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,800
How on Earth?

576
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,720
Attorney. Last defense please.

577
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,040
Defendant, are you regretful?

578
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,099
Yes.

579
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,509
Your Honor,

580
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,430
the defendant says he's regretful.

581
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,480
No way!

582
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,170
This can't be!

583
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,700
Aigoo...

584
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,570
This is the verdict.

585
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,699
You call yourself a father?

586
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,979
How could you still call yourself a father?

587
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,849
Why didn't you let us use a good lawyer?

588
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,390
For what?

589
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,170
You also know well what
Mr. Choi's finances is!

590
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,789
Also, if he committed a crime...

591
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,759
he needs to be punished.

592
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,889
The dead child's parents probably
have a stake in their hearts.

593
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,730
How could we be shameless
to lighten his sentence?

594
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,739
Doo Hak!

595
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,839

Choi Cheol Woong?

624
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,739
I haven't watched...

625
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,429
that one yet, either.

626
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,029
Hey, don't you even have a girlfriend?

627
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,779
Not having watched stuff
everyone else watched?

628
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,529
You're right.

629
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,739
Come to our theater.

630
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,299
Your noona will let you in for
free through the projection room.

631
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,529
Well, that sounds great.

632
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,490
Free movies.

633
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,540
By the way...

634
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,890
why didn't you let me know?

635
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,470
Oh, my dad's passing?

636
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,179
I didn't want to bother you
to come down from Seoul.

637
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,090
It must've been hard on you.

638
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,769
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,610
A friend should've been by
your side at times like these.

640
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,119
I'm okay.

641
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,849
My relatives are helping me out a lot, too.

642
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,450
Anyway, what are you going down for
when it's not even the vacation?

643
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,499
I'm also going for Dad's memorial service.

644
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,400
Right. It was about this time of the year.

645
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,980
Gosh, we're so in the same boat.

646
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,489
Never mind.

647
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,739
You're a college student, and I'm
a business owner who quit school.

648
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,770
It's going to take you at least 20
years to become a business owner.

649
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,160
What about Doo Hak hyung?

650
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,159
I haven't heard that name in a while.

651
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,739
Don't know.

652
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,930
I guess you can say he
was gone with the wind?

653
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,000
What about you? You probably
keep in touch with him.

654
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,979
I also didn't get to see him at all.

655
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,210
Why? Weren't you two like brothers?

656
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,470
He always refuses my visit.

657
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,749
Also, my situation is a little troubled.

658
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,570
What's wrong with your situation?

659
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,889
Aigoo, can they really
catch spies like that?

660
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,349
Jung Shin...

661
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,539
looks like we'll have to
watch the movie next time.

662
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,280
Don't ever make it known
that you know me, okay?

663
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,729
Get that bastard!

664
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,700
Hey, get that asshole-

665
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,239
I see you got promoted.

666
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,229
Are you going to Seoul?

667
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,689
Yes.

668
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,110
I plan to transfer to
reserve force soon after.

669
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,370
Why?

670
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,979
It's well known that the
elder favors you a lot, Oppa.

671
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,229
I'm sick of wandering all my life and

672
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,070
the world has changed as well.

673
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,449
Sir keeps telling me to take
charge of a different job.

674
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,200
What kind of?

675
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,020
Later.

676
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,520
I don't think I'll be able to
visit too often once I go up.

677
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,789
Hang in there.

678
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,239
Contact me if you have any problems.

679
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,369
Okay.

680
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,239
(Let's not buy illegal tickets that undermine
social order.) (Soonyang Theater in Gwangju)

681
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,450
(Bushman)

682
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,759
Was your visit to Seoul all right, Boss?

683
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,649
Are we getting any customers?

684
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,329
As you see, we're selling out every day.

685
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,739
The audience are totally loving it!

686
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,729
Anyhow, just like "Raiders,"

687
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,939
if we just say the Hollywood punks made it,

688
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,789
it's bound to be a daebak!

689
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,600
It's an African movie, you idiot.

690
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,929
By the way, the print is too worn out.

691
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,749
So I think we'll have to cut
out at least 10 minutes of it.

692
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,739
How much screen time do you think will
remain when we send it down, then?

693
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,029
Since we need to cut out about
20 minutes out of 109 minutes,

694
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,879
there should be about 90 minutes left.

695
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,989
Will the audience
understand the story, then?

696
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,629
Don't cut out too much and

697
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,159
just send it out as it is.

698
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,710
I understand.

699
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,600
- Director Go!
- Oh, my!

700
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,949
You're back again?

701
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,019
I must get the print today, no matter what.

702
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,539
What's the deal with this little girl?

703
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,969
Who are you, Ahjumma?

704
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,239
If you don't want to get
hurt, stay out of this.

705
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,619
How dare this little girl-

706
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,379
Move aside!

707
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm sorry. Please come this way.

708
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,229
Okay!

709
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,579
- Without spending a penny, you'll get a lot of...
- H-Hey!

710
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,259
Advertising tomorrow on
the news about the theater!

711
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,429
What are you doing right now?

712
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,059
Is your nose not working?

713
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,869
Don't you smell something pungent?

714
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,430
Whoa-Have you gone mad?

715
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,659
Yes.

716
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,989
I've gone mad.

717
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,979
You won't listen to me when I talk sanely,

718
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,919
so I need to go insane. Am I wrong?

719
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,829
Wh-Whoa! Put that match down right now!

720
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,739
Are you going to give it...

721
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,029
or not?

722
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,539
Darling.

723
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,240
The matches must be wet.

724
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,109
Use that.

725
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,429
It's guaranteed to light.

726
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,090
It's made in the U.S.A.

727
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,950
She's gone mad, huh?

728
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,179
Are you going to give it to me or not?

729
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,649
Oh, you're the daughter of
Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?

730
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,329
I did hear your father passed away.

731
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:38,349
I felt really bad for not being able to attend
the funeral because I was in Seoul back then.

732
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,899
- Director Go.
- Yes.

733
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,080
You attended, right?

734
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,919
Well, the thing is...

735
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,540
I was also busy, so...

736
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,689
Is that so?

737
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,720
Well, you are always busy
with something, Director Go.

738
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,489
So the short story is

739
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,499
you paid for half of the
sale price of "Bushman,"

740
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,759
and you were to pay the rest today,

741
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,239
but you're going to pay up after showing it
in Yeosu since your finances are in trouble?

742
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,749
That's what you're saying, right?

743
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,950
Yes.

744
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,349
- Director Go.
- Yes.

745
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,079
Did our distributing agency ever do that?

746
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,029
It has never happened before and will
never happen in the future, either.

747
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,029
- Don't use fancy words.
- Okay.

748
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,689
How unfortunate, Young Lady?

749
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,760
He said it won't work.

750
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,839
Will you lend me that lighter again?

751
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,180
Oh, my. Th-This wicked-

752
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,999
- Director Go.
- Yes.

753
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,229
As soon as we're done with the showing,

754
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,279
give her the "Bushman" prints.

755
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,359
Sorry?

756
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,619
Give it to her.

757
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,629
O-Okay, Boss.

758
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,929
Boss, thank you so much.

759
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,369
Thank you so much, really!

760
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,479
I won't ever forget your favor.

761
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,569
Take your leave.

762
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,260
Thank you.

763
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,089
Wait, Boss...

764
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,230
Why are you doing something
you don't usually do?

765
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,139
Hey, you asshole.

766
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,319
Take 20% off since the
print is already worn out.

767
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,309
And if we take 30% off for not doing our duties
as human beings, skipping out on the funeral,

768
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,509
we don't need to get the remaining balance.

769
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,799
Do you still think yourself human?

770
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,169
- This little...
- My, my. It hurts.

771
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,559
- It hurts so much.
- Also...

772
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,319
two years ago, I'm sure

773
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,479
you wrote in the ledger 50,000 won as an
expense for condolence payment for Mr. Oh.

774
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,289
You embezzled that money,
didn't you, you bastard?

775
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,509
Whoa, Boss...

776
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,780
Gosh, this little...

777
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,820
It hurts.

778
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,549
Boss...

779
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,470
You're coming now?

780
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,360
Why are you sitting there, Uncle?

781
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,589
The chair was so nice and comfy,

782
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,480
so I was just getting a feel.

783
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,099
Having competence makes you a boss,

784
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,219
not just sitting in the boss' seat.

785
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,939
Honey, why would you
say something like that?

786
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,869
Jung Shin works so hard to
keep this theater alive.

787
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,709
So did it come alive?

788
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,639
I got the "Bushman" print,

789
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,609
so I'll be able to pay back a portion.

790
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,339
Please take your leave now.

791
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,549
A portion?

792
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,009
How much of a portion?

793
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,369
Are you even doing your accounting right?

794
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:56,369
Your father alone took 50 million won!

795
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,899
I'll pay back whatever it is,
50 million or 100 million!

796
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,139
So take your leave now.

797
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,749
How dare you raise your voice?

798
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,509
- Huh?
- Gosh.

799
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,299
You have nothing to say even if I
say this theater is mine right now.

800
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,709
Gosh, Honey.

801
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,979
She said she'll pay us back.

802
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,739
It's not like we're loan sharks.

803
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,589
We can't be doing this

804
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,699
to another family member.

805
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,059
You have no idea what
that money means to me.

806
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,969
Because our father left all
of his inheritance to Oppa,

807
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,999
I had to work like a dog and an ox to

808
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,429
make that money, not
spending a single penny!

809
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,049
Is that why you're playing with
interest like a dog and an ox?

810
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,339
- What?
- I paid back...

811
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,459
more than the principal amount
in interest already, Aunt.

812
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,979
It was secured as a collateral anyway,

813
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,809
so if I fail to pay you back later,

814
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,639
you can take this theater.

815
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,760
But please take your leave now, I said!

816
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,389
You're finally showing your true colors!

817
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,809
All right.

818
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,519
If you don't pay me back within this year,

819
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,209
- this theater is mine!
- Aigoo, let's go. Come on.

820
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,729
How dare she raise her voice
when she owes us money?

821
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,059
What has this world come to that

822
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,269
scammers and debtors are so shameless?

823
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,370
Aigoo, Jung Shin, we're leaving now.

824
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,460
Aigoo.

825
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,429
What about Cheol Woong?

826
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,059
I waited at the station all this time,

827
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,870
but I haven't seen him still.

828
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,620
What could be the matter?

829
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,049
He said he'll be coming
down for sure, though.

830
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,100
What could've possibly happened?

831
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,869
The last bus comes one hour later.

832
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,079
So I'll go out to the station
one more time and wait.

833
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,199
Okay...

834
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,649
The night air is cold.

835
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,970
So please go inside now.

836
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,039
I heard your father passed away.

837
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,150
And you took off college, too.

838
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,090
I heard everything from Jung Ok.

839
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,089
I see.

840
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,779
I mean, Father has been
sick for a long time.

841
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,120
So I've been preparing myself.

842
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,739
I'm okay.

843
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,119
I'm really okay.

844
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,740
Jung Shin...

845
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,510
please stop coming now.

846
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,669
Is something wrong?

847
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,060
I...

848
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,909
don't have the confidence.

849
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,099
Let's break up.

850
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,039
Hey, what the heck are you saying?

851
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,039
You can get back up on
your feet no problem.

852
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,289
You passed the GED and

853
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,619
you can get into a college, Doo Hak.

854
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,880
I've...

855
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,860
been thinking hard for a long time.

856
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,120
But this was all because of you.

857
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,590
What do you mean?

858
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,590
Had you not shown up, I wouldn't
have competed with Cheol Woong.

859
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,119
More than...

860
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,929
Cheol Woong,

861
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,389
when I heard you got hit by Young Tak,

862
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,040
I already wanted to kill that bastard.

863
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,779
It wasn't an accidental death by assault.

864
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,970
I really wanted to kill him.

865
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,359
Lee Doo Hak...

866
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,769
are you filming a tear jerker?

867
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,339
Do you feel sorry for me that my
father passed away and I quit school?

868
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,419
So, since you're a murderer
who's future is doomed,

869
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,609
you're going to step out of my life
for me, although it breaks your heart?

870
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,339
Is it something like that?

871
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,070
Did I say I'll marry you or something?

872
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,819
It makes me feel even more
miserable if it was pity.

873
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,149
You're really...

874
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,380
Whatever you say doesn't matter to me,

875
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,280
but what's certain is...

876
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:36,270
that you're a worse prison than this place.

877
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,129
Please let me go now.

878
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,990
I mean it.

Do you want to get locked up that badly?

You clearly said you'll take
responsibility of my life, didn't you?

00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:11,529
Back then, my father owed
a debt to your family.

919
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,959
Now, you owe me a debt.

I'll have you work as my underling.

prepare for the bar exam.

934

According to what I experienced in jail,

be the most powerful.

Hey, hurry up and come inside.

All right, now. Gather around.

995

- Why?
- Why aren't you doing your errand right?

1003
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,539
I bought an apple just like you told me to.

1004

Try taking a bite. You try it!

Aigoo, had you done this earlier,

1019
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,960
we wouldn't have had to raise our voices.

If you just pay back the money, I'll
give you the theater back right away.

She's right.

1025
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:00,090

a theater in Gwangju, right?

Nothing good will come out
of getting involved with him.

1052
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,619
I'm not sure. He just seems a
little different as a person.

1053
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,829
I don't know about the money,
but you need to hand those over.

1054

It has a proper owner.
