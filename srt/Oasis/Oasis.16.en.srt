Well,

19
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,678
he wasn't that affectionate.

20
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:41,848
And it was something that our parents decided,

21
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:45,728
so I wasn't able to feel much of that kind of emotion.

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,348
The only man that I've felt

23
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:52,288
such emotion for was you.

It's not like you were powerful from your birth.

27
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,698
You were...

28
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:05,018
so unsophisticated and poor.

29
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:07,008
Yeah, I was.

That's when I knew.

34
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,568
Love is...

35
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:23,788
not when a person is particularly lovely,

36
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:27,558
but when my heart that sees the person

37
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:30,488
is full of love.

38
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,418

You seem a bit wistful and sentimental.

00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,908
I have one thing to ask of you.

47
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:07,578
What is it?

48
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:10,818
Everyone has...

49
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,528
at least one secret that they can't tell even to those closest to them.

50
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:22,408
A secret that becomes poison to the person who finds out.

51
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:26,198
Do you have something like that?

52
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,028
No.

53
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,798
That's a relief.

54
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:37,848
Even if you ever happen to get such a secret,

55
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:40,828
if it's something that would hurt you or me,

56
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:45,788
I hope you keep it buried without telling anyone.

The city is full of police who are doing blind inspections!

Why are they doing this to you?

116
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:33,678
How could they call you a spy?

117

Is this it?

119
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,828
It will be dangerous for the time being,

Where are you going to go?

123

Wouldn't it be better for all of you not to know, just in case something happens?

Yes...

126
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:24,138
I killed him.

00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,298
He was working with Lee Doo Hak.

128
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:32,788
He even threatened your mother with the death of Lee Doo Hak's father.

129
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:35,118
So...

130
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:38,778
I killed him in order to protect our family.

131
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:43,618
However, a wiretap device was found on Team Captain Oh's body.

132
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,918
Lee Doo Hak was recording it.

133
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:53,398
I mean it.

134
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:56,838
I never knew I would be betrayed by a subordinate I trusted.

135
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,378
Still, I don't think it's right to kill Lee Doo Hak.

136
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:07,248
Then tell me if you have a better way to protect our household, our family.

137
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,818
Don't worry.

138
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,978
Your father will take care of everything.

139
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:25,708
Nothing will happen to our household.

140
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:41,048
I knew you would come.

141
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,408
Recently, things have become a bit noisy.

142
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,968
It appears so.

143
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,738
So didn't I warn you already, Chairman?

144
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:51,848
But still. A spy?

145
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,198
Then are we getting arrested, too?

146
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,598
Of course not.

147
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:59,358
Chairman, you were just used by him.

148
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:02,478
All you need to do is get investigated as part of the process.

149
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,218
And once we take care of Lee Doo Hak,

150
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:08,328
our business will proceed as expected.

151
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:13,238
Is this the work of the young prosecutor, or...

152
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,288
What age are we in that you would call this a "work"?

153
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,198
Then are you saying he's really a spy?

154
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,138
That makes no sense!

155
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,738
That's not important.

156
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:26,068
If that's what you've decided, then that's that.

157
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,628
I will cut ties with him.

158
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,768
What's important is our business.

159
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,328
You are wise.

160
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:35,598
Then, I will leave with that in mind.

161
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:37,648
- Boat?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:40,808
You know the boat captain that I asked to smuggle you out last time?

163
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,398
Stay on that boat for the time being.

164
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:45,168
You could just leave as well.

165
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,648
I can't do that. I don't want to leave again.

166
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,008
I can just visit you where you are.

167
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,198
They are probably watching all the escape route by boat.

168
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,338
Also, that captain would have seen the news.

169
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,818
No matter how much money you give him,

170
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,818
you think he would help a spy?

171
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,988
Then, what do we do?

172
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:07,408
Nobody would hide a spy,

173
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,908
unless they were a spy themselves.

174
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:11,878
Hwang Choong Sung, that evil bastard!

175
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,988
How could he frame someone as a spy!

176
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,428
I should turn myself in.

177
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,988
What?

178
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:24,218
Prosecutor Kim Sung Yeob.

179

Here.

No Sook Ja?*
(It means "homeless" in Korean)

181
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,798
You live alone after your divorce, right?

182
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:37,428
Aigoo, I live simply since I'm alone.

183

[Lee Doo Hak on wanted list, suspecting spy activities]

185

You will remarry soon.

186
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,578
Suddenly?

187
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:53,538
Will you introduce me to someone to remarry or something?

188
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,698
Aigoo, who would marry me

189
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,918
when my wife ran away from me?

190
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,548
You will soon be a daebak hit. Then...

191
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:03,368
you could get back together with your ex-wife.

192
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,578
Daebak?

193
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:07,278
With that slush fund ledger you gave me?

194
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,698
Is that even trustworthy?

195
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:12,048
What would make you believe me?

196
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:15,878
If he's trying to kill me because of that slush fund ledger,

197
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,998
would you believe me?

198

Listen.

199

You're saying the NSA Director who could cause a flying bird dive into water

200
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,118
would try to kill a homeless man?

That spy that Hwang Choong Sung fabricated is me.

Now will you believe me?

206

Gosh, this is...

207
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,688
If I just catch the spy,

208
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:02,798
I would become a daebak hit as a prosecutor.

209

212
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:14,628
Since that mouse sometimes

213
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,838
bites the nose of the cat.

I mean, the printer is closed–

222

Do you prefer to have a difficult time, or close your business?

223
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,448
It's better to have a difficult time.

224

So, I'm telling you to go to your office right now.

Hello?

240
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:46,108
Is the person that the news is reporting on right now really you?

241
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:54,358
Did you not know this either?

242
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,838
I asked if you didn't know about this as well!

243
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:01,858
I heard that she was investing a bit into Chairman Geum Man Cheol's business.

244

But I didn't know that it had to do with Suseo preferential housing sales.

Still, you should have told me!

It looked like something that Mother seemed to keeping from you...

247
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,248
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,628
They dared to do this against me?

249

Yes. Understood.

Let's start.

260

When did you become the publisher of Sisabakgyeok?

261
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,328
I told you.

262
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:15,688
I will protect Doo Hak myself.

263
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,948
Hey, Jung Shin. Doo Hak hyung could really die like this.

264
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:21,478
Look at that. His opponent is the governmental powers.

265
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:24,258
What if you get hurt, too?

266
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,848
Cheol Woong.

267
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:30,028
There's one thing I learned from watching a lot of good movies.

268
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:33,818
People get more severely drunk from power than alcohol.

269
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,988
But, those who have a knife wield their knife

270
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,308
holding it upside down when they are drunk.

271
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,038
Instead of holding the knife handle,

272
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,438
they hold it by the blade and wield it,

273
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:46,588
even though they are bleeding profusely from their hand.

274
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,948
It's not that the people who don't have a knife win because they are strong.

275
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:52,928
So don't be so cocky.

276
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,318
You probably know this since you're smart.

277
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,458
Hey Jung Shin, don't be like this.

278
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,608
There's a limit to how far I can protect you.

279
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:02,978
It's okay.

280
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,788
I won't die from getting struck a bit by that knife handle.

281
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:10,308
Also, I really don't know where Doo Hak is.

282
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,828
He didn't even tell me either.

283
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:18,988
I ended up becoming in charge of the investigation.

284
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:21,888
- Congratulations.
 - What do you mean, congratulations?

285
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,218
It's probably thanks to your hard work, Homeless Man.

286
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:25,978
Also,

287
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,298
should I also connect the slush fund files as well?

288
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,568
You can't release all of that at once.

289
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,188
He will definitely deny the charges or minimize it,

290
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,218
and there will most likely be external pressure as well.

291
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,048
I may be imprisoned as well,

292
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,168
so we need to hold off for a bit right now.

293
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:41,998
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:45,118
I really didn't know that it was an illegal preferential sale.

295
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,478
Was what I did for you not enough for you?

296
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,308
I wasn't being greedy for my sake.

297
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:51,928
I know that your dreams

298
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,928
are big.

299
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:57,428
You need to enter the next presidential elections,

300
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,638
and you also have plans for after that.

301
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:02,308
And down the line, Cheol Woong also needs to follow your footsteps.

302
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:04,068
That's why...

303
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:07,208
I did it thinking I'd store up as much wealth...

304
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,718
If I did anything wrong,

305
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:13,418
I'll receive the punishment.

306
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:16,408
I will hand myself over to the prosecution

307
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:20,228
to make sure you are affected negatively in any way.

308
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,808
Please take care of Cheol Woong, Honey.

309
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:27,538
Cheol Woong

310
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:31,028
really is our son, right?

311
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:36,168
I will protect our family, so don't worry.

312
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,768
Honey.

313
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,688
When all of this is taken care of,

314
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:49,078
I would like to dance with you again.

315
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,658
Next time,

316
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,638
I will practice so I can dance even better.

317
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,208
I love you, Yeo Jin.

318
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:11,578
Even the Blue House?

319
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:13,488
How much did you give them?

320
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:17,088
About 150.

321
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:20,378
Then you would have also given some to the ruling party as well.

322
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,278
What about the opposing party?

323
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,418
I gave them as well.

324
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:27,698
Did you really lobby the opposing party as well?

325
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,898
Yes.

326
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:32,158
It was less than why I gave the ruling party, but yes.

327
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:35,818
Deputy Director,

328
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:38,728
I'm able to survive this, right?

329
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,928
I'm not doing this to save you, Chairman.

330
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,388
But if I die,

331
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:47,498
then you know that nobody else would be able to survive.

332
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:51,758
That also includes your wife.

333
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,358
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,988
Even if you retain your life,

335
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,128
you would have to be ready to give up an arm or so.

336
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:05,938
<i>It's me.</i>

337
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,698
<i>They paid money to both the ruling and the opposing party.</i>

338
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:10,458
<i>Please tell His Excellency</i>

339
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,388
that both the ruling and opposing parties need to stop making this a bigger deal and come to an agreement.

340
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:16,258
Also, they would have to agree on a common strategy

341
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:21,988
and wrap things up at the level of just punishing the congressmen who was in direct contact with Chairman Geum Man Cheol.

342
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:25,808
Of course, some would have to be sacrificed.

343
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,838
And a public apology would need to be issued.

344
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,238
All right.

345
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,288
All right!

346
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,598
Let's start again.

347
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:40,728
Gosh, I'm hungry.

348
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:44,698
Well, please order me a bowl of beef bone broth soup.

349
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,588
Gosh, it's so good.

350
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:53,858
Please eat up.

351
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,898
I really only did what my superiors told me to do.

352
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:59,228
I mean it.

353
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:05,748
We already have the recording of the three of you.

354
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:10,828
That was just me going to greet Chairman Geum Man Cheol, who frequents my establishment.

355
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:14,728
And I merely just invested in his business since he recommended it to me as a good opportunity.

356
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:16,808
If I knew it was illegal,

357
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,858
would I, the wife of a government official,

358
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:23,158
do something that would cause harm to my husband?

359
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,598
Excuse me? What do you mean, let go of the case?

360
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,488
I'm just getting started!

361
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,938
It's been decided another team will handle it,

362
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:34,058
so act like you don't know anything and come off the case.

363
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:37,708
Seriously, why are you being like this to me?

364
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,608
You told me before that I should try to do my work properly!

365
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:43,788
That would apply if this was a normal case!

366
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:47,718
I mean, I'm not superman.

367
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,338
What can I do when my superiors apply pressure to me?

368
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:54,438
Please keep your pride at least.

369
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,038
How are you going to look your juniors in the eyes later!

370
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:00,418
Gosh, seriously!

371
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,348
Damn it.

372
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,228
Then,

373
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:11,038
shouldn't we release the slush fund ledger?

374
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,778
If we release a news article about it right now, they will bury that as well.

375
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:16,898
Then, what do you want to do?

376
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:20,618
Isn't that slush fund ledger the reason why he's framing you as a spy?

377
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,758
There is a different reason.

378
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:26,288
What is that?

379
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:28,288
What is it?

380
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:30,468
I asked what it was!

381
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,948
You don't...

382
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,318
Do you have the evidence as well?

383
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,778
Please give me a bit of time.

384
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:47,098
This... How does this make any sense!

385
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,758
Just a few underlings were put in jail

386
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,988
and a public apology!

387
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:56,318
They think of the people as dogs and pigs!

388
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:59,158
Seeing how things are like this, how can this country run properly!

389
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:04,448
Gosh, damn it! I should just shave my head and go into the mountains.

390
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,058
Jung Shin–

391
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,258
Who are you?

392
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:10,818
Oh,

393
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,568
it's my guest.

394
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:15,008
CEO Shin, I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

395
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:17,688
Oh, okay.

396
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,608
What is this?

397
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,108
The reason why he's framing as a spy.

398
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:25,168
- What?
 - This is...

399
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:27,018
my last bomb.

400
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:28,428
If I set this off,

401
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:32,848
I can bring down Hwang Choong Seong and Choi Cheol Woong in one blow.

402
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,868
<i>Does anyone else besides you know this fact?</i>

403
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,898
<i>You're the first one I told, Deputy Director.</i>

404
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,548
<i>For my family,</i>

405
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:44,198
<i>please be loyal to the end...</i>

406
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:47,998
Doo Ha– Doo Hak...

407
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,288
Hwang Choong Seong will go to jail,

408
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,648
and Choi Cheol Woong

409
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,948
will also fall.

410
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:56,718
So what are you hesitating for?

411
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,508
Perhaps

412
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,038
I may be punished for setting up the slush fund

413
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,588
and fleeing by boat.

414
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:03,698
Then what can we do?

415
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,888
You are being framed as a spy,

416
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,408
and there isn't any other method!

417
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,938
I'm thinking of making

418
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:12,938
one final offer.

419
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,378
With who?

420
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:16,158
With Hwang Choong Seong?

421
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:18,368
Would he take our offer? No,

422
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:20,288
he will try to kill you as soon as he sees you!

423
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,538
Jung Shin.

424
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:24,748
Will you go with me?

425
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,588
Do you want to die?

426
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:45,338
I won't say much.

427
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:51,328
It's the Deputy Director and Cheol Woong's lives.

428
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:53,338
It is also your life as well, Cheol Woong's Mother.

429
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,798
What?

430
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,158
<i>Deputy Director...</i>

431
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:01,378
<i>For my family, </i>

432
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,008
<i>please be loyal to the end...</i>

433
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:12,038
No way...

434
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:17,168
Where did you manage to get something fabricated like this?

435
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,588
You dare threaten me!

436
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,408
If it's not that,

437
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:26,208
then why else do you think he's trying to frame me as a spy and kill me?

438
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,168
You...

439
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:40,958
- You!
 - I won't say much.

440
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,888
Deliver this message to the Deputy Director.

441
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,568
Clear my name of being a spy

442
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:47,628
and let me, Jung Shin and my family

443
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,878
go to a foreign country and live quietly abroad.

444
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:53,198
- What?
 - Whether Cheol Woong

445
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:55,548
gets ostracized by society or not

446
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:58,568
is now up to you, Ms. Kang.

447
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:01,128
I'll give you 24 hours.

448
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:03,678
Oh.

449
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,538
If you try to lure me in with lies and do something to me,

450
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:11,708
then that recording will be released to the public immediately.

451
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:22,108
- Lee Doo Hak, this bastard!
 - Honey!

452
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:24,398
Do you think I'll lose to that thug bastard?

453
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:25,868
Me, Hwang Choong Seong?

454
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,168
Don't worry.

455
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,118
That bastard will be caught soon.

456
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:30,288
I will kill him.

457
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,738
I will kill him myself with my own hands!

458
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:33,748
But if that tape recording is released publicly–

459
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,958
Who would believe the words of that thug bastard!

460
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,048
Also, all the media outlets are censored right now.

461
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,538
Still, in the off chance that something goes wrong,

462
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:44,468
you are also at risk because I got involved in the Suseo case.

463
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,078
Nothing will go wrong.

464
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:47,968
I cannot bend down for that guy.

465
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:52,038
So, don't ever bring this up again.

466
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:56,028
Honey.

467
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,798
Honey...

468
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:01,958
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:05,038
And thank you.

470
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,298
Yeah.

471
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,688
Don't worry, and just trust me.

472
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:17,858
Now,

473
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:20,068
you're the only one I have.

474
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,398
[Lee Doo Hak wanted under charges of espionage]

475
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:52,018
Mom.

476
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:55,688
You should go inside and get some sleep.

477
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:56,978
Please?

478
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,738
You're going to collapse like this!

479
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,488
Jung Ok.

480
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:08,868
I must have committed some great sin in my past life.

481
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:13,658
If it wasn't for that, there's no way something like this could happen to me.

482
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,408
Mom...

483
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,988
There's no way something like this could happen to me.

484
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,858
Ms. Kang.

485
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:36,048
Doo Hak's mother...

486
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,258
Cheol Woong...

487
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:42,338
Please save my Cheol Woong.

488
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:45,538
Excuse me?

489
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:52,658
So are you saying that in order for my Doo Hak and Cheol Woong to both live,

490
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:56,448
Doo Hak can't ever release the tape recording that he has?

491
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,048
Is that what you're saying?

492
00:28:58,048 --> 00:28:59,698
That's right.

493
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,958
But what is that tape recording?

494
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,748
I can't tell you that.

495
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:06,738
If you find out what that is,

496
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:09,468
you would also be in danger, Doo Hak's Mother.

497
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:14,148
What is it that it's that scary?

498
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:17,738
In any case, if people find out what that is,

499
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,988
Doo Hak will die

500
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:22,318
and Cheol Woong will also die.

501
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,398
Please,

502
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:26,938
please dissuade him from doing so!

503
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,168
If they could just live,

504
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,828
then I should hold him back.

505
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:35,758
I should hold him back with my life on the line!

506
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,386
Cheol Woong.

507
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:51,956
What brings you here, Ahjumma?

508
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:56,226
I came because I was worried.

509
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,856
Oh.

510
00:29:57,856 --> 00:29:58,946
I see.

511
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:00,806
They say Doo Hak is a spy,

512
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:03,566
but I have no idea what they mean.

513
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,716
I can't go to sleep

514
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,606
because my heart pounds so hard.

515
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,786
First, take a seat.

516
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:19,826
What did you call me here for?

517
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:22,036
Just wait a bit.

518
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,536
Doo Hak!

519
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,246
- Doo Hak.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

520
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:35,066
What in the world is going on?

521
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,286
Are you all right?

522
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:38,716
You're not hurt anywhere?

523
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,186
- I'm fine.
-What's the meaning of this?

524
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,026
You said you were coming alone.

525
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:45,646
I told him to come to find the optimal solution.

526
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:49,186
Why? You think I'll eat him up or something?

527
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,986
So, did you get an answer from him?

528
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:53,516
What answer?

529
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,716
What is he talking about?

530
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:01,016
I asked your father for a favor.

531
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,486
To send Doo Hak and Jung Shin...

532
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:08,786
and their families safely abroad.

533
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:11,586
- And settle that as an exchange.
- Mother!

534
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,296
We must save Doo Hak, too.

535
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:15,106
Who gave you permission?

536
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,546
You don't want Doo Hak to die, either.

537
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:20,366
I didn't know you cared about me so much.

538
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:22,716
And Father?

539
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,046
Does he permit this?

540
00:31:25,046 --> 00:31:27,246
He needs some time.

541
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:32,406
Doo Hak, I'll convince him for sure,

542
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,036
so give me some more time.

543
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:35,546
That's enough, Mom.

544
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:37,726
This has nothing to do with you.

545
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:39,676
You know what the tape holds.

546
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:41,286
If your father falls,

547
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:43,636
you and me. We all go down.

548
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:46,546
- You just stay put.
- Shit!

549
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:50,046
No need to say more.

550
00:31:51,046 --> 00:31:53,846
Hand over the tape and turn yourself in.

551
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,656
That's the way you'll survive.

552
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,046
Turn myself in?

553
00:31:57,046 --> 00:32:00,526
On top of framing me for your murder,

554
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:03,376
you want to frame me for your dad's murder, too?

555
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:04,926
You little...

556
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:10,916
Doo Hak! Cheol Woong! You two mustn't fight like this!

557
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:13,246
You absolutely must not!

558
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:17,416
Madam, we can't keep it a secret any longer, Madam!

559
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:21,266
Y-You two are brothers.

560
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:25,226
You're both...

561
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:28,186
brothers who I...

562
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:31,226
gave birth to.

563
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,186
Mom, what are...

564
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,856
Mom, what are you talking about?

565
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:40,846
Mother, what you said when you were drunk last time...

566
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:42,876
Ahjumma...

567
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,266
what are you saying?

568
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:48,026
Why would I be your son?

569
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:50,986
Mother,

570
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,256
say something.

571
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,646
Madam...

572
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:58,906
tell them.

573
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:01,526
You need to tell them now.

574
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:05,236
You said we must save both of them!

575
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,086
Everything is my fault.

576
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,786
- Cheol Woong...
- She's right.

577
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:18,396
I adopted you.

578
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,586
But...

579
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:25,996
I raised you as if you were my own.

580
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,186
So...

581
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:30,986
let's save your hyung.

582
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:33,686
Let them live abroad.

583
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,396
Doo Hak,

584
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:38,556
let's burn that tape for the sake...

585
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:40,876
of your younger brother.

586
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:45,226
Cheol Woong is your brother by blood,

587
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,946
but he's also Deputy Director's son.

588
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:49,266
We need Deputy Director

589
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:53,576
for Cheol Woong to live out his dream.

590
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:58,206
Do as Madam Kang says.

591
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:03,666
I... I can't live if you die...

592
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:08,596
nor can I live if Cheol Woong dies.

593
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,636
Please...

594
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,516
Don't say something so absurd.

595
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:21,276
Just to get that tape...

596
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,956
Mother, gosh...

597
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:27,356
Why would you make up something like that?

598
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,606
We didn't make this up.

599
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:32,776
Deputy Director knows as well.

600
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:36,586
That you're not his biological son.

601
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,356
Then...

602
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:49,786
Hyung is my biological brother?

603
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,036
Cheol Woong...

604
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,806
Why did you do it?

605
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:05,256
It wasn't enough to fool me my entire life.

606
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,336
And you tell me Deputy Director is my birth father.

607
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:10,796
Why did you do it? Why? Why?

608
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,956
It was for you.

609
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,586
- Everything was for you.
- "It was for you."

610
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,726
"It was for you." That's enough!

611
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:21,636
I'm sick and tired of that, Mom.

612
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:26,396
You should've told us a bit sooner.

613
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:29,056
Why?

614
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:33,856
I... I didn't think it would come to this.

615
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:40,366
This is all because of your stupid mom.

616
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:45,356
Everything is my fault.

617
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,246
I'm sorry.

618
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:53,136
I'm really sorry...

619
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,996
Cheol Woong,

620
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,846
let's stop now.

621
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,356
What do you want me to do?

622
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:17,566
Does the fact we're biological brothers change anything?

623
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,726
It does.

624
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:28,256
My entire life...

625
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:32,246
suddenly feels a lot more unfair.

626
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:33,706
It would've...

627
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:38,436
felt less unfair if you were just a rich bloke.

628
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:41,726
But it's more unfair because you're my brother, you bastard!

629
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,856
Stop!

630
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:46,136
Both of you, stop. Okay?

631
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:47,946
Let's leave for now, Doo Hak.

632
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:49,526
Let's go.

633
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:52,566
- Who says you could move!
- Hey, Choi Cheol Woong, are you crazy?

634
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:55,236
Cheol Woong, don't! Don't!

635
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,936
He's your biological brother, Cheol Woong.

636
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:01,046
Cheol Woong, you can't.

637
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:06,596
Leave the tape behind.

638
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:11,616
Then I'll convince Deputy Director to send you abroad.

639
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:13,336
I can't do that.

640
00:37:13,336 --> 00:37:15,796
It's my lifeline.

641
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,916
Just go. Just hurry up and go!

642
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,006
Don't you hear me?

643
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:22,196
Choi Cheol Woong, have you gone mad?

644
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,506
Cheol Woong...

645
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,816
Move, Jung Shin.

646
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:32,086
If you're going to kill Doo Hak, shoot me, first.

647
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:39,816
Cheol Woong,

648
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:44,256
what kind of man are you?

649
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:48,906
Did you even know Hwang Choong Sung killed our father?

650
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,756
What?

651
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:55,416
W-What are you talking about?

652
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,866
Who killed whose father?

653
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,826
That's a lie.

654
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:01,836
That's all a blatant lie!

655
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:03,766
She's right.

656
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,866
Joong Oh ahjussi...

657
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,456
was killed by Oh Man Ok.

658
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:09,816
Oh Man Ok ordered someone...

659
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:13,246

She was afraid that her lie would be exposed about you being Deputy Director Hwang's son,

670
