3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,440
What brings you here without giving me a call?

4
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,266
Don't do it.

5
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:23,606
What's with you? What do you mean don't do it?

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,876
Marrying Lee Doo Hak.

7
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:31,296
I didn't come to whine about why you chose Lee Doo Hak over me.

8
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,126
You just can't marry Lee Doo Hak.

9
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:35,956
I told him to leave the business for good.

10
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,186
In return, I will be with him.

11
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:39,376
It's not that he left the business for good,

12
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,306
he's handling it under the table.

13
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:45,276
Lee Doo Hak is currently managing the funds of an even larger organization.

14
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,896
Lee Doo Hak? Isn't he hyung to you?

15
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:50,696
Well, he could become a defendant.

16
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,386
When he commits a crime, then put him in jail.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,466
When that happens, I'll leave him, too.

18
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,856
You will...

19
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:02,286
definitely get hurt.

20
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:09,156
That is for me to handle.

21
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:12,786
- You don't know what kind of a man you're with.
 - Cheol Woong.

22
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:15,696
Please just leave Doo Hak and me alone.

23
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:17,936
If you don't, only you will suffer.

24
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:23,796
Hello?

25
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,646
<i>It's Yeo Jin.</i>

26
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,686
<i>I was blackmailed today as well.</i>

27
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,336
I really feel like dying...

28
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,246
<i>Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin!</i>

29
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:37,866
<i>Yeo Jin!</i>

30
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,406
Team Captain Oh.

31
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,496
Yes, please speak.

32
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:48,396
This has nothing to do with the country or the people,

33
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,976
but it has to do with my family.

34
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,506
I need you to take care of some difficult business.

35
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:58,066
All by yourself, without anyone else knowing.

36
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:05,356
I believe your peace is connected to national peace, Deputy Director.

37
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,606
Just give me your orders.

38
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:11,946
Thank you.

39
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:15,296
I will be with you until the day I die.

40
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,976
I heard from Mother.

41
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,696
That you're my biological father.

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,796
Really?

43
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:14,426
You must've been shocked.

44
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,446
[Episode 10]
Yes.

45
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,236
I planned on being together with your mother for the rest of our lives.

46
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,736
It is not your mother's flaw.

47
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:26,556
I know.

48
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,336
But...

49
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:30,796
I will keep Choi as my last name.

50
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,386
Please understand.

51
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:34,226
Also...

52
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,486
I have a favor to ask you.

53
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:39,286
Lee Doo Hak...

54
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,886
please cut ties with him.

55
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,166
I will do so as well.

56
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:55,446
Is it because he knows your secret of being a murderer?

57
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:00,886
I thought he was a pretty useful hunting dog.

58
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,626
Please find another hunting dog.

59
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:09,136
Why are you so concerned with Lee Doo Hak?

60
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,786
Since he is a criminal

61
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:14,006
and I am the one who catches criminals.

62
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,186
Weren't you guys friends?

63
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:18,846
Lee Doo Hak helped you out before, too.

64
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,696
I know how to differentiate between private and public affairs.

65
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:24,776
If you do not cut ties with Lee Doo Hak, Deputy Director...

66
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,566
If I don't?

67
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,336
Then I will handle this according to the law.

68
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,696
I mean it.

69
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,666
I'll consider it.

70
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:48,996
Gosh, you scared me!

71
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:53,376
Hey! What time is it right now that you're not sleeping?

72
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:57,186
Aren't you sleepy?

73
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:58,836
Are you waiting for a call?

74
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,796
Did you fight with Doo Hak?

75
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:04,306
Gosh, you're being so bothersome.

76
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,716
Just go back inside and sleep.

77
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:09,236
I'm going to the bathroom.

78
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:15,156
Also, you're more bothersome, bitch!

79
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:21,006
She should just hurry up and get married! Aigoo.

80
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,526
Is that you, Doo Hak?

81
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,056
What on Earth is going on?

82
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,596
Does it have to do with the news from earlier?

83
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,766
My father passed away.

84
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,306
What did you just say?

85
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,546
Your father?

86
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:42,146
Yeah.

87
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,976
Why did your father die?

88
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,106
I know...

89
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,276
Why did he die here...

90
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:55,136
Maybe you saw incorrectly? You sure it's your father?

91
00:05:55,136 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>The cigarette that Father used to always smoke is here</i>

92
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:05,826
and the matches from the restaurant where we last ate together

93
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:08,226
is here, too.

94
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:11,896
So, I think it really is Father.

95
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,186
Oh, no...

96
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:20,536
Oh, no...

97
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,766
I should have...

98
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:49,926
I should have told him to eat before he left.

99
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,366
I should have held onto him...

100
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,316
I didn't even get to say that...

101
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,576
Damn it...

102
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:47,976
Where were you all this time instead of working?

103
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:16,306
Gosh, your hand is like tree bark.

104
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,906
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

105
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,476
You've really gone through a lot.

106
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:31,716
Gosh, it appears you've finally grown up.

107
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:34,956
Be good to me from now on, okay?

108
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:47,486
Where are you going now? You should eat!

109
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,026
Doo Hak's father!

110
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,826
Doo Hak's father!

111
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,606
Doo Hak's father...

112
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:05,366
Doo Hak's father!

113
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,836
Doo Hak's father!

114
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:17,206
Is this old man cheating on me or something?

115
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,396
Why does he keep making me worry like this!

116
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,956
Lee Doo Hak?

117
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:45,876
I am Prosecutor Park Ji Hwan from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

118
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,766
You are under arrest for charges of violence and related offenses.

119
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,666
You have the right to remain silent.

120
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,616
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

121
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:59,306
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,296
Doo Hak!

123
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:13,846
- Hyungim!
 - Doo Hak!

124
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,706
- Move over!
 - I told you to move!

125
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:18,576
Who are you guys! What are you doing!

126
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,796
We're from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,

127
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:22,176
and we are arresting Lee Doo Hak, the ringleader of gangs.

128
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,866
- Excuse me?
 - What kind of BS is that?

129
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,676
He is a normal businessman!

130
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:30,186
That's right! He's left the gang business for good!

131
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:32,146
You guys are his underlings, aren't you?

132
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,896
Don't worry.

133
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:37,256
I will reunite you guys and have you interrogated together.

134
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:39,056
His father just passed away.

135
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,576
This is too much!

136
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:44,326
My father passed away, too, but I am in the middle of executing official duties,

137
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:46,356
although that was a few years ago.

138
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,636
You're happy about this?

139
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,726
You sons of bitches!

140
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,946
Father's cigarettes...

141
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,126
Father's cigarettes!

142
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,126
Don't worry. I'll make sure to hold onto it.

143
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,356
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

144
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:04,116
Doo Hak! Let go!

145
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:11,736
<i>We suddenly got a problem.</i>

146
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:15,426
<i>Prosectuor Choi took things into his own hands.</i>

147
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:17,786
What did you say?

148
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:20,476
Lee Doo Hak just got arrested.

149
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,446
<i>Because he had another prosecutor do the work</i>

150
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:27,496
instead of him, I didn't realize it.

151
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,376
<i>What should I do?</i>

152
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,646
Hurry up and go! Stop struggling!

153
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:36,116
I'm Goo Pan Shik of the Council!

154
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,506
Hurry up and move!

155
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,736
Tell me where Moon Dong Soo is hiding.

156
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:50,706
I'll let you rest easy if you do.

157
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,476
I really don't know.

158
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:56,426
How could I tell you what I don't know?

159
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,686
I know you guys are dating.

160
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,526
So how could you not know?

161
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,786
We are not like that.

162
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:10,406
I'll ask you one last time.

163
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:13,156
Where is Moon Dong Soo?

164
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,026
The gangs in your Council

165
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:23,156
have committed a whole variety of crimes.

166
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,986
Is it a department store? Anything and everything can be found there.

167
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:29,836
And you, Lee Doo Hak, are their ringleader.

168
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,656
The Council...

169
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:35,326
is just a fraternity.

170
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,266
If a member of a joint fund society steals,

171
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,006
does the group's president become the ringleader of thieves?

172
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,326
What did you say?

173
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:49,856
Is a union meeting of gangs the same as a common fund society?

174
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,706
I will exercise my right to remain silent from now on.

175

[Lee Joong Ho]

176
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:07,616
I wondered why that old man was acting so mature all of a sudden.

177
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:12,316
What about Doo Hak?

178
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:18,216
He is at the Prosecutors' office because he had to be questioned about something.

179
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,246
What about Jung Ok?

180
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:25,746
We are asking around about her whereabouts.

181
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,376
Then...

182
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,966
I'm the only one left?

183
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,746
I'm sorry, Mother.

184
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,726
Let's hurry up and go.

185
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,696
Doo Hak's father will be lonely by himself.

186
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:38,146
Why are you here like this?

187
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,986
It must be cold.

188
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,976
Why are you here...

189
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,636
<i>Cheol Woong...</i>

190
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:33,136
<i>let me give you a hug.</i>

191
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:39,926
<i>I'm...</i>

192
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,726
<i>really proud of you.</i>

193
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:48,626
<i>I'm totally fine, okay?</i>

194
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,626
<i>I really...</i>

195
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:54,806
<i>don't regret it at all.</i>

196
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:20,496
It's yulmoo tea. Drink it.

197
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:26,736
I was really shocked after hearing the news from Jung Shin.

198
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,126
About my father?

199
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,946
Or about me?

200
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,246
Both.

201
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,266
I don't know if you'll believe me,

202
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:46,686
but I really liked Ahjussi a lot.

203
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,746
Sometimes,

204
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:54,526
he was even nicer to me like a father than my own father.

205
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,766
The autopsy results came out.

206
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:08,176
It is a hit-and-run accident by a truck.

207
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,866
I'm sure Ahjumma couldn't get in touch with Jung Ok.

208
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:16,026
Ahjumma will be going through a lot by herself.

209
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:23,506
I asked that they resume the investigation after the funeral rites are over,

210
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:26,456
so you should go.

211
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,516
Jung Ok.

212
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:44,806
- Oppa.
- You've been through a lot, huh?

213
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,466
I had no idea you were here.

214
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,106
I went through a lot trying to find you.

215
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,876
Let's go.

216
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,306
Your father must be waiting for you.

217
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,306
Great work.

218
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:29,296
I don't have to worry about the driver, right?

219
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,176
I took care of that completely.

220
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,176
You should not worry about it.

221

[Funeral Home]

222
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,156
It looks like Lee Doo Hak is here.

223
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:44,916
What should I do?

224
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,666
If Lee Doo Hak is arrested, there will be major problems with the redevelopment

Oh, my God...

bury Ahjussi at the burial site of the Choi family.

Excuse me?

Yes.

257
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:52,986
Ahjussi was pretty much an elder of our family.

258

I also want to bury Ahjussi there, just like my mother said.

We have always been in his debt.

Please allow me to repay some of my indebtedness.

263

That would also be...

good for these young kids here.

00:26:14,136 --> 00:26:17,106
Things are hectic for them because

266
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:19,536
they suddenly lost someone.

267
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,226
No, I can't allow that.

268
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:26,256
Are you saying Father should serve the Choi family even in death?

269
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:29,036
Hyung, what did you just say?

270
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:33,806
Even if Father put that in his will, I can never let that happen!

271
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:38,346
You know that's not what we mean. Why are you saying this?

00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,156

00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,264
It's okay.

278
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:24,704
Everything will be okay.

You came.

281
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:07,664
The elder asked me to convey that he is sorry he couldn't come.

282
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,234
You should've been more careful.

283
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:21,814
It appears that the prosecutors are not communicating well with you, Team Captain.

284
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:24,274
I ask that you take care of this quickly.

285
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:27,434
I received the report, and it's already been concluded.

286
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,444
- Thank you.
 - No.

287
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,994
The prosecution's leadership are opposing your release

288
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:36,744
since you are the ringleader of a criminal organization.

289
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,294
Making the Council was your downfall.

290
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:43,824
Since they are viewing all of the gangs in the country as part of the Council.

291
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,844
Go on trial for now.

292
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:49,264
Excuse me?

293
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:55,104
Did you say the ringleader of a criminal organization can get life or death sentence?

294
00:28:56,894 --> 00:28:59,334
Yes, that is right.

295
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:02,004
But the business is one thing,

296
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:04,484
and there is no guarantee

297
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:07,924
Lee Doo Hak will keep his mouth shut during the trial.

298
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:11,244
Since Prosecutor Choi decided to do this, let's support him all the way.

299
00:29:11,244 --> 00:29:13,744
We also have a debt to repay.

300
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:19,534
- Deputy Director–
 - It has to do with my son.

301
00:29:21,824 --> 00:29:23,464
Then...

302
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:28,684
I will expose the crimes committed by the Council members and depict the overthrow

303
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:33,244
of Yeom Gwang Tak as a horrific gang war on news media.

304
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:35,014
Go ahead and do that.

305
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:37,344
We don't just catch spies.

306
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,804
We need to clean up society, too.

307
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:43,784
Also, it could be wrapped up before the trial.

308
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:48,524
Since all sorts of things could happen in prison, you know?

309
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:51,794
Such as a rival gang taking revenge,

310
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,714
or taking one's own life.

311
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:00,724
I will get you out on bail in the process,

312
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,834
so don't worry.

313
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,524
No way...

314
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,254
Are you ditching me right now?

315
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:11,324
Ditching you?

316
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,934
I remember you saying you will even die if you were told.

317
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:23,934
Right now is a very important time for me.

318
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,334
My father passed away and

319
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:29,324
I need to get married soon, too. Please help me out.

320
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:33,114
I'll die if you tell me to die next time.

321
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:34,624
Next time?

322
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:38,374
There's no next time for us.

323
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,234
Just push your important matters for next time instead.

324
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:47,464
- Team Captain Oh...
- Don't get other ideas, either.

325
00:30:50,454 --> 00:30:52,354
Wait, Team Captain!

326
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:09,504
What? There's no other way?

327
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:11,244
Is that something you should say right now?

328
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,964
If there's no way, you need to find one.

329
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:17,084
He's finally trying to live properly, and will you watch him fall to the bottom again?

330
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:19,244
That's not the case. All right?

331
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:25,444
Jung Shin, this is the higher-ups going at him full throttle, okay?

332
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:28,634
Regardless of the investigation, the result is already set.

333
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:31,094
You heard of Samchung Re-education Camp, right?

334
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:32,664
Just like Samchung Re-education Camp,

335
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:37,764
they're quarantining all gang leaders as a way of purifying the society.

336
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:40,374
Your marriage isn't the problem right now.

337
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:42,674
Doo Hak hyung...

338
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:45,824
will get at least 10 years and maybe...

339
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:49,624
he could even get life or death sentence.

340
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,144
What?

341
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:57,704
This isn't something I can meddle with.

342
00:31:57,704 --> 00:31:59,544
So, what did I tell you?

343
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:01,364
I told you this marriage isn't right.

344
00:32:01,364 --> 00:32:04,264
That you'll be hurt for sure.

345
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,364
You're...

346
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,064
not the one who planned this, right?

347
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,704
Do you...

348
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:16,574
really see me as that low?

349
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:24,114
Hey, I also...

350
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:26,544
tried to look for other ways.

351
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,114
I also want to save Doo Hak hyung if I have the power.

352
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,294
Then do whatever you need to do to save him.

353
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:35,764
Doo Hak's father passed away.

354
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:38,574
And Jung Ok is under arrest right now.

355
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:40,764
You saw his mother earlier.

356
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:46,114
I don't have to get married. So save Doo Hak, no matter what.

357
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:49,044
If you don't, I won't ever see you again.

358
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:58,644
Wait, h-how did so many things happen at once?

359
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:02,064
All of Loyal Brotherhood's bosses are under arrest right now.

360
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,104
We'll also have to stay low for a while.

361
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:08,094
The higher-ups also gave him up?

362
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,194
Something isn't right here.

363
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:15,204
If Doo Hak is locked up again, he'll never get out. We have to get him out.

364
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,514
Yeah, I agree with you.

365
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:18,874
But what do we do?

366
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:22,034
The cops are keeping a watch without blinking an eye.

367
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,914
We do whatever it takes to get him out.

368
00:33:27,514 --> 00:33:31,564
I'll take care of this with Seon Woo, so you stay out of this.

369
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:35,264
Will your brains be smart enough?

370
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,834
Is this not going to work without you, Honey?

371
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,614
I'm sorry.

372
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,614
Hurry up and go.

373
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,834
Thank you.

374
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:06,254
We just came back from the honeymoon.

375
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:09,354
I'll kill you if you get caught by the cops.

376
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,704
Don't worry.

377
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:14,304
I don't want to die by your hands.

I can't. We're taking him back right after from here.

00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:59,584
That's why...

490
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:04,844
we need to put thing back, so it's peaceful again.

491
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,384
Hey, Lee Doo Hak...

492
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,754
Doo Hak.

493
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,524
Hey, Lee Doo Hak.

494
00:44:15,924 --> 00:44:17,394
Doo Hak...

495
00:44:20,664 --> 00:44:24,064
If we shove the slush fund records into their faces,

496
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,964
they'll also have to give up one arm, at least.

497
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,274
If they don't accept it, they'll try to...

498
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:33,744
get rid of you completely, not just send you to jail.

499
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:36,764
Let's just kneel.

500
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:40,904
- We can start again and get strong.
- Hyung...

501
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:42,984
I almost died...

502
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:45,504
at least twice on the way here.

503
00:44:46,694 --> 00:44:47,984
I was lucky.

504
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:51,284
I haven't heard of a guy who escaped three times out of luck!

505
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:55,244
I think I want to test that.

506
00:44:55,244 --> 00:44:58,094
- Doo Hak!
- Hyungnim!

507
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,144
The guy who hit your father turned himself in.

508
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:03,244
He's called Lee Yong Deuk, and he has four criminal records.

509
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:05,194
Assault, fraud, and gambling.

510
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:08,674
He was driving drowsily, so he didn't even know he hit someone.

511
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:12,244
We told our boys to look into him.

512
00:45:12,244 --> 00:45:14,654
Also, the most shocking thing is...

513
00:45:16,564 --> 00:45:19,194
Choi Cheol Woong's mother is remarrying,

514
00:45:19,194 --> 00:45:21,554
and the man is...

515
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:23,614
Hwang Choong Sung.

516
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:25,364
What did you say?

517
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:36,224
Hello.

518
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:38,284
<i>It's Lee Doo Hak.</i>

519
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:42,924
I saw you caused quite the spectacle.

520
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,514
What's the reason?

521
00:45:44,514 --> 00:45:47,394
<i>I told you. Things grew out of our hands.</i>

522
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:49,804
<i>It shouldn't become a burden on the company.</i>

523
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:53,414
I know it's something you all can easily take care of.

524
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,494
What's the real reason?

525
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:57,514
You're quite doubtful.

526
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:04,244
A hunting dog shouldn't be thinking too much.

527
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:13,064
You'll be getting a package.

528
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:14,824
Discuss it with the elder.

529
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,144
I'll call you again.

530
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:23,274
A slush fund ledger?

531
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:33,774
Didn't we agree not to leave these things?

532
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:35,114
I'm sorry.

533
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,734
My marriage is this week!

534
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:39,564
Make sure to end it before then.

535
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:41,284
And secure the original copy.

536
00:46:41,284 --> 00:46:42,794
I understand.

537
00:46:43,974 --> 00:46:45,634
Geez!

538
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:52,194
I had an investigator and a police officer watching everyone he might contact.

539
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:55,834
But the core persons are nowhere to be found.

540
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:59,464
They're more or less the same as one person.

541
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,644
You should've gotten them with Lee Doo Hak!

542
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:03,494
What did I tell you?

543
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:04,884
Hey...

544
00:47:04,884 --> 00:47:07,204
I'm sorry. Okay?

545
00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:13,284
Gosh, but how did he undo the cuffs?

546
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,894
Lee Doo Hak...

547
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:27,654
has been found.

548
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:39,974
Why, you don't like it?

549
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:43,474
Not at all.

550
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,604
It's pretty.

551
00:47:47,604 --> 00:47:49,374
Thank you.

552
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:52,344
Did you hear from Prosecutor Choi?

553
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:54,744
That Doo Hak ran away.

554
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:58,664
From Doo Hak's mother.

555
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:05,924
She was asking if I can help Doo Hak out...

556
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,434
Sorry?

557
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:10,384
I know it's shameless of me to ask this.

558
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:13,184
But if something happens to Doo Hak...

559
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:15,624
when his father passed away like that...

560
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:19,214
I really don't think I'll be able to live on.

561
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:21,264
I know.

562
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:26,004
I know how you feel better than anyone.

563
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:31,144
Still, this matter is out of my hands.

564
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:33,944
He's on the run after committing a serious crime.

565
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,924
How can I help him evade the punishment?

566
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:39,354
Of course, I know.

567
00:48:39,354 --> 00:48:43,004
He deserves punishment if he committed a crime.

568
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:47,234
But what I'm saying is that men created the laws.

569
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:48,864
Judges and the prosecutors are also human.

570
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:51,844
Wouldn't they have some sense of compassion?

571
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:56,214
They might sentence only half of what they would've sentenced.

572
00:48:57,244 --> 00:49:00,424
But even if a country bumpkin like me goes and begs,

573
00:49:00,424 --> 00:49:03,594
it's obvious no one would listen to me.

574
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:05,444
Since...

575
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:08,414
your sir is at a high position...

576
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:12,854
if he'll just give a word, wouldn't they at least pretend to listen?

577
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:15,784
You don't really know well, Doo Hak's mom.

578
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,744
Every high ranking official— In other words,

579
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:22,184
the higher up you are, you get in huge trouble for accepting such requests.

580
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:26,224
He might also get in trouble.

581
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,434
Why wouldn't I want to help?

582
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:34,604
If I can, I'll do anything I can.

583
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:39,724
However, this really isn't what I can help with.

584
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:47,904
Please help him, Madam.

585
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,884
If you'll help me...

586
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:56,564
I'll even pluck out and sell all of my hair to make you a pair of shoes.

587
00:49:56,564 --> 00:50:01,674
I-If something happens my Doo Hak, how can I live on?

588
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:04,444
Please, please. Just once...

589
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:08,734
Please help him just once. Just once, please.

590
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:10,884
I'm sorry, but this won't help with anything.

591
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:12,904
Hurry up and stand up.

592
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:22,514
Is it really impossible?

593
00:50:22,514 --> 00:50:24,334
Yes.

594
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:26,704
Even if my Doo Hak is...

595
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:32,554
Cheol Woong's brother, who shares the same blood?

596
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:36,744
Will it still be impossible?

597
00:50:38,984 --> 00:50:41,334
Doo Hak's mother.

598
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:43,984
Even after giving my child to you,

599
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,374
did I ever once ask you for a favor?

600
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,534
Must you really...

601
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,474
bring that up as well?

602
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:58,834
You see, I'm not in the right mind.

603
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,484
Should I seek out Cheol Woong...

604
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:05,364
and plead with him?

605
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:07,834
Doo Hak's mother,

606
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:09,824
are you really going to be like this?

607
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:13,334
Exactly... so please... just this once.

608
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:15,874
Please help me just this once.

609
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,544
Just this once.

610
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,674
All right.

611
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:30,104
When Doo Hak undergoes the prosecution investigation,

612
00:51:30,104 --> 00:51:32,714
I'll ask him for a favor.

613
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:35,554
Thank you.

614
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,764
Thank you so much.

615
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,094
But don't hold high hopes.

616
00:51:40,094 --> 00:51:42,824
I'd be grateful if you could just put a word in.

617
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:46,164
I'm very, very grateful.

618
00:51:48,894 --> 00:51:50,504
And don't ever...

619
00:51:51,504 --> 00:51:54,004
talk about Cheol Woong again.

620
00:51:54,004 --> 00:51:58,034
All right. That... that was my mistake...

621
00:51:58,034 --> 00:52:02,014
Of course. I'll never do that again.

622
00:52:02,014 --> 00:52:05,114
So what are your thoughts?

623
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,314
Do you want me to pull some strings...

624
00:52:08,314 --> 00:52:10,624
for Lee Doo Hak?

625
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,474
I wish...

626
00:52:19,324 --> 00:52:22,974
you'd pull some strings.

627
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,544
Just for our son.

628
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:34,474
He's not hiding in escape...

629
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:37,414
but coming to fight with his life at stake?

630
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:43,034
What does Deputy Director think?

631
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:48,514
He's not someone who compromises with his hunting dogs.

632
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:55,744
Oh Jung Shin.

633
00:52:57,794 --> 00:53:01,274
Absolutely don't lose sight of Oh Jung Shin.

634
00:53:01,274 --> 00:53:06,604
Lee Doo Hak will surely show up in front of Oh Jung Shin.

635

Gosh, you two are working really hard...

642
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:55,648
keeping an eye on me all day.

643
00:53:56,548 --> 00:53:58,908
Well, I have no idea what you're saying.

644
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:01,588
I think you've got the wrong people.

645
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,408
You think I'm stupid?

646
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:06,968
Waiter! Bring us some alcohol.

647
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:08,458
It's on me.

648
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,858
- Young lady, you're very drunk.
- Gosh.

649
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,718
Who are you calling drunk?

650
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,808
Do you know anything about Lee Doo Hak?

651
00:54:17,808 --> 00:54:20,428
I'm also dying to know.

652
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:22,918
Tell me if there's anything you know.

653
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:27,098
It's my wedding soon and the groom must be present.

654
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:31,218
You think he'll be there or not?

655
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:33,598
We should make a bet.

656
00:54:33,598 --> 00:54:35,348
What will you bet on, Ahjussi?

657
00:54:35,348 --> 00:54:37,728
Ahussi? Are you crazy?

658
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,268
Yes, I'm crazy.

659
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:43,718
Wouldn't you bastards go crazy, too?

660
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,568
- Shit.
- Damn it.

661
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:49,508
What? Didn't you tail me, so you could see me like this?

662
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:51,718
What's wrong with you? Come here.

663
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:53,018
I said, come here!

Hey, you guys come out, too.

665

I'm going to crush both of you with my nunchucks.

666

I'm sorry.

667

She's very drunk. Sorry.

Where the hell are you going?

672
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,928
Why don't you tail me until the end, huh?

673
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:11,348
I said, that's enough!

674
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:13,968
Gosh.

675
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:16,198
They left. That's enough.

Oh, Yeon Joo.

677
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,528
Doo Hak asked me to safely bring you to him.

678
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,308
What?

679
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:34,018
It's so romantic.

There is. That way.
