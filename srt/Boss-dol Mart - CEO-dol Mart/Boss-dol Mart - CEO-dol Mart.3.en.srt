161
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,670
I wondered if you were bedridden because you worked too hard yesterday.

162
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,960
I have seven years of work experience at Boram Mart.

163
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,670
I won't fall sick from that much work.

164
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,800
But...

165
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,890
will you really continue the mart business?

166
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,150
Yes.

167
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,260
We even held the bosses' inauguration today.

168
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,270
Then you must also be looking for part-timers.

169
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,580
Why? Do you want to work at our mart?

170
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,900
Well, you always ask me out of the blue.

171
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,440
- You might as well just-
- I'll think about it.

172
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,930
Apply for the job if you want it. And submit a resume.

173
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,190
Oh, you'll be interviewed, too.

174
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,570
Whoa, who was the one who asked me for help?

175
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,220
Now, you're acting like the boss.

176
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,170
So stingy. Forget it. Just go.

177
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,620
Gina must be your favorite idol.

178
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,830
Don't say Gina's name so casually.

179
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,820
Is Gina unni your friend?

180
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,310
Gina's been through a lot.

181
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,540
Please don't change and remain her fan.

182
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,410
One!

183
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,150
Two!

184

Geez, why is the class taking so long?

185
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,740
Choi Ho Rang's going to make a fuss about being late.

186
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,730
<i>Thank you, Ma'am!</i>

187

Oh, it's over.

188
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,750
- Good day, Mr. Shin.
- It's not a good day.

189

Let's get in the car.

190
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,860
Are you upset because I revealed your nosebleed and betrayed you?

191
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,990
That's right. I was very upset.

192
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,750
I got this for Sang Hyeok, but you can have it.

193
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,240
My disciple asks for forgiveness, so I shall graciously forgive you as your teacher.

194
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Class ended ages ago. Why are you still here?

195
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,010
You're the one who ended 10 minutes late!

196
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,430
- And I have plans.
- What plans could you have?

197
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,820
Don't go around doing fruitless things.

198
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,620
Just focus on the taekwondo studio!

199
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,880
That's how you can earn a steady monthly pay.

200
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,970
I don't need to listen to you

201
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,920

202
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,900
- What are you-
- I'm not saying right away.

203
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,440
I, Shin Tae Ho, don't want to get kicked in the ass by money.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,980
But money is the only destiny that can save us from the darkness.

205
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,000
Which leads me to shed tears once again.

206
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,730
So don't look for me in the afternoons.

207
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,210
A bunch of ruffians won't let me drive the shuttle bus in peace.

208

Ho Rang, will one check-out lane be enough?

215

216

Hey, Ho Rang.

219
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,450
The showcase fridge is a relic.

220
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,500
- I'll buy a new one if you say so.
- Showcase?

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,020
What's that?

222
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,670
The meat fridge.

223
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,790
Should we move the stand to the back again?

224
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,870
Hold on. Let me think.

225
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,420
There is a showcase fridge I kept my eye on.

226
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,400
- You're talking about that, right?
- Ho Rang,

227
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,900
should I look into a POS machine company?

228
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll look into it. Hold on.

229

Again?

232
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,020
It's not a blackout.

To run away without paying off the debt?

You're mistaken. We'll continue business.

239

A bunch of people came to the closeout sale! What do you mean?

240
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,090
- You conman!
- Who are you calling a conman?

What are you doing? Let's retrieve our products.

Are you hiding the money somewhere and not paying us?

Sang Woo, it hurt a lot, right?

322
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,330
- I'm okay.
- How long do you need to have it on?

323
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,160
I need to work tomorrow, so I'll take it off then.

324
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,470
The lights are on?

325
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,510
You came back? Cut it out now!

326
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,980
What's the pot for? You broke the juice bottle earlier,

327
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,480
will you break the pot now?

328
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,270
Why would we break the pot?

329
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,660
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da.

330
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,430
It's a present.

331
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,360
You should've told me you'd pay off the unpaid balances this quickly.

332
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,550
You embarrassed me for getting angry.

333
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,660
<i>Sorry?</i>

334
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,740
What happened to the unpaid balances?

335
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,820
Honestly, we were going to wait if even a portion of it was paid back.

336
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,110
But you paid it off with one payment, and we actually feel sorry now.

337
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,750
Wait, who paid them back?

338
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,050
The payment was from President Choi Ho Rang.

339
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,730
- Ho Rang did?
- Yes.

340
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,990
He's just as broke as we are.

341
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,610
Where did he get the money?

342
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,300
Wait, you called him a fraud a few hours ago,

343
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,520
but he's "President Choi Ho Rang" now?

344
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,560
Is he a president now that you're paid back?

345
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,050
Come on, are you upset over what we said out of anger?

346
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,990
What's wrong with you?

347
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,250
Don't skip the honorifics!

348
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,240
Why'd you skip the honorifics?

349
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,870
Do you know who we are?

350
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,130
To tell you about us...

351
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,210
Thunderbolt and lightning.

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,040
Come on, you people suck.

353
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,340
Thunderbolt and lightning!

354
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,460
We're...

355
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,210
<i>Thunder Boys.</i>

356
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,790
There you go.

357
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,720
Thunder- What?

358
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,390
Is it a butane gas brand?

359
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,650
Listen, Bosses.

360
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,130
I'm sure by looking at just my face,

361
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,010
you'd think I'm 19, but I'm actually 29.

362
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,180
The savings a 29-year-old worked like a dog for five years to save...

363
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,420
was withdrawn today.

364
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,940
Why?

365
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,160
To pay off your unpaid balances.

366
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,530
Does your heart feel lighter now that you got my money?

367
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,100
Does it feel lighter?

368
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,910
My bank account became lighter, too.

369
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,590
Aigoo, we understand now.

370
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,740
President Choi Ho Rang, forgive us.

371
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,620
The honorifics-

372
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,980
- Please.
- Okay.

373
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,780
Please leave. We're not in the mood to laugh, so leave.

374
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,280
- We're just sorry.
- No, the thing is-

375
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,820
<i>Take your leave.</i>

376
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,930
Hold on, we came because we're sorry.

377
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,880
- No, we're sorry-
- Please leave.

378
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,650
- Wait- Aigoo.
- Take care.

379
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,820
They left.

380
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,840
Aigoo.

381
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,580
Aigoo.

382
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,230
Just how much did you drink when you can't even handle alcohol?

383
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,700
Did you even have food with drinks?

384
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,770
Don't you think he only drank alcohol like an idiot?

385
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,150
Aigoo, what a handful.

386
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,480
Aigoo.

387
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,030
Eat it.

388
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,270
It's delicious.

389
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,130
Make sure you pay for the jerky later.

390
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,080
It's the third duty, idiot.

391
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,710
Hey, of course, I should pay.

392
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,220
I will! Hey, let go.

393
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,150
Please ring me up!

394
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,070
- Boss Shin.
- What the heck?

395
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,780
Huh?

396
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,670
This idiot is completely drunk, huh?

397
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,460
Hold on.

398
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,120
Ho Rang...

399
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Did he withdraw his five-year savings for us?

400
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,160
Whoa, I need a drink, too.

401
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,580
We're the ones who were all for doing business,

402
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,570
but why did he take all the responsibility alone?

403
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,510
Since Ho Rang is doing this much for us, I must do something as well.

404
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,840
What are you going to do?

405
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,520
These are really delicious Kyoho grapes. Just have a taste.

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,370
Gosh, it doesn't look good for merchants to be day drinking.

407
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,370
His coworkers should give him an earful.

408
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,450
What do you even know?

409
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,750
He drank alcohol because of you guys when he can't even take alcohol!

410
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,410
Also, listen up now.

411
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,260
We're not coworkers.

412
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,960
We're friends.

413
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,570
I need to go see...

414
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,850
I need to go see the rental room tomorrow morning.

415
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,580
Aigoo.

416
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,330
Why are things still salty when we're 29 years old?

417
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,650
There's just no sweetness in my life.

418
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,450
Oh, my God!

419
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,060
Oh, you came out just in time.

420
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,630
Excuse me, the landlord is here.

421
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,140
Excuse me!

422
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,710
- Huh?
- Where am I?

423
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,960
You're asking where you are? You just came.

424
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,970
You came to see the rental room.

425
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,240
Ma'am, this person is a tenant candidate?

426
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,440
P-Please show me the room quickly.

427
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,230
- Hurry.
- O-Oh, it's over there.

428
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,160
It's really clean.

429
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,780
Let's go in together.

430
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,550
Aigoo, was he that curious about the room?

431
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,590
He's ISTJ. His MBTI, that is.

432
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,050
His sense of responsibility is too strong.

433
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,700
Aigoo, he already marked his territory, huh?

434
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,180
Let him take the room, or you'll have to clean up all that yourself.

435
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,370
Aigoo.

436
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,170
<i>This is all I need.</i>

437
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,840
<i>Become an undercover agent and...</i>

438
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,600
we'll infiltrate into Jinsung Mart.

439
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,080
Cover what?

440
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,300
I mean, we know way too little about marts.

441
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,470
We'll go to a rival company as customers and

442
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,470
see how they arranged sections, what fridge they use for meats,

443
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,040
and how they manage the cashiers.

444
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,820
- Let's spy on them and find out.
- Sure.

445
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,760
You can go alone.

446
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,130
- Good luck.
- Hey!

447
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,710
Thanks for coming with me, Agent.

448
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,970
Hyung, but you said we're undercover.

449
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,130
Everyone was staring at you.

450
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,360
Jingsung Mart's owner might not know your face, but he knows mine.

451
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,520
That's why I disguised.

452
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,310
Don't worry, Agent.

453
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,210
Ma'am...

454
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,460
- Huh?
- Whoa.

455
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,990
My goodness.

456
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,360
How upsetting?

457
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,280
I gave you so much discount on sweet potatoes that day.

458
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,780
And you're grocery shopping here?

459
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,320
Ma'am, when Boram Mart reopens,

460
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,870
make sure to come to us instead of here, okay?

461
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,590
It depends.

462
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,010
Depends-

463
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,600
I'm really about to get upset.

464
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,610
Come on. It's because my son asks for fish every day.

465
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,400
But does Boram Mart have fish?

466
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,590
It doesn't.

467
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,410
[Fishermen's World]

468
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,450
Hyung, you can't be advertising Boram Mart here!

469
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,800
Let's get out of here.

470
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,360
The arrangement of sections wasn't the issue.

471
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,970
There was...

472
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,740
something we forgot to include.

473
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,760
What did you forget?

474
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,960
Jo Yi Joon, I knew it.

475
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,190
Aigoo.

476
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,350
Whoa!

477
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,730
Hey, let people know when you're here.

478
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,920
- What's this?
- How is it?

479
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,230
My dad bought a good one and sent it from my hometown.

480
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,360
Let's have a team dinner tonight so we can taste the meat as well.

481
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,240
Sure, sure.

482
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,630
You're back again, Grandma?

483
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,660
But we didn't get our goods yet, so we can't sell you anything.

484
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,050
You've got one here. Pork.

485
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,690
Huh? Should I cut you some meat?

486
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,520
Yes, yes. It's for a stew, so just 10 ounces.

487
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,180
Okay. Come follow me.

488
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,950
Three thousand...

489
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,980
four hundred and fifty.

490
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,250
Take it off.

491
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,020
Grandma, even I pay to eat candy here.

492
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,410
My fellow boss is really evil.

493
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,120
Just tell him I told you to take it off.

494
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,790
How rich could you get from getting 450 won from an old lady?

495
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,190
[Noona]

496
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,770
Hurry up and write up the points. So, I can go.

497
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,300
Okay.

498
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,870
<i>Aren't you hiding the cash somewhere and not paying me?</i>

499
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,560
<i>Who pays with cash these days? Everyone uses cards.</i>

500
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,040
<i>- There's no hidden money in there!
- Shit!</i>

501
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,120
Wait, Grandma, I think the points paper disappeared.

502
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,660
What did you say? Find it.

503
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,720
I didn't spend it once and saved it all this time!

504
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,470
Come on, the points can't be worth that much even if you saved.

505
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,770
Hey, Noona.

506
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,270
<i>The class is over. Where are you?</i>

507
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,220
<i>Where are you?</i>

508
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,200
Well, the thing is...

509
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,970
Find the paper.

510
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,220
I said I don't know where it is!

511
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,770
<i>Why wouldn't you know where you are?</i>

512
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,450
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

513
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,390
I wasn't saying it to you.

514
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,570
Gosh, okay. I'll be there. I'm coming!

515
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm not going.

516
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,310
I'm not going until you find the paper.

517
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,690
Since you spent 3,450 won today,

518
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,500
that's one sticker,

519
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,670
two,

520
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,610
and three.

521
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,950
Okay! Four stickers!

522
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,720
That one's on us.

523
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,590
Those are your points. Come buy something once you fill it up.

524
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,400
How about the points I saved so far?

525
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,500
Gosh, I'll find the paper.

526
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,990
Aigoo, Grandma, seriously.

527
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,440
I gave you that!

528
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,120
Take care.

529
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,670
[You have 2 missed calls]

530
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,860
What did I say? I'm telling you he's a spy from Boram Mart.

531
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,370
Why would you film someone else's mart?

532
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,000
Why did you erase that when it's not even from here?

533
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,960
It's a video for my vlog!

534
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,230
And you.

535
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,490
I heard there's a new part-timer coming today.

536
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,420
You caught a spy as soon as you started.

537
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,900
Good job.

538
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,290
I wouldn't have caught him if it wasn't for you, rookie.

539
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,540
Sorry?

540
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,350
O-Oh, not at all, Boss.

541
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,710
I'll work even harder from now on.

542
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,690
I couldn't even film a lot because of this worker.

543
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,340
Never even think about coming to my mart again.

544
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,860
If you come again, I won't let you be.

545
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,320
Leave!

546
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,950
Who are you telling to leave?

547
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,220
Boss. You came to our mart, too.

548
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,790
Is it illegal for us to come to yours?

549
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,730
It's not like they caused harm. Why are you telling them to leave?

550
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,650
Sang Woo, you're also a boss. Don't be scared.

551
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,100
Who's Sang Woo?

552
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,670
No way.

553
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,150
Sang Woo isn't scared at all.

554
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,990
Don't worry.

555
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,390
What's wrong?

556
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,880
Sang Woo is hungry.

557
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Should we go eat?

558
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,010
Those nutcases.

559
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll get them for good one day!

560
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

561
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,170
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

562
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,360
Gosh, wait up.

563
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,370
Whoa, whoa!

564
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,470
Man, it looks really amazing.

565
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,550
My goodness. It's got great color, right?

566
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,780
I think it's almost done.

567
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,900
No, it needs to be cooked more.

568
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,150
S-Should we try cutting them?

569
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,870
The guys are here.

570
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,530
You said you're an undercover agent.

571
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,750
- I heard you got caught right away, huh?
- Be quiet.

572
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,960
I got totally busted, okay?

573
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,610
All the sources for my vlogs were busted, too.

574
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,740
Aigoo.

575
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,180
What about Sang Woo?

576
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,290
He's working at the mart.

577
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,980
Why is he working alone? Tell him to come up.

578
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,900
Not this mart.

579
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,410
He's working at Jinsung Mart.

580
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,300
<i>What?</i>

581
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,400
Yi Joon.

582
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,650
Even if he confused Sang Woo as his part-timer, you should've brought him back. No?

583
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,210
What information are you trying to get from Jinsung Mart?

584
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,070
They'll make me do it for sure once I mention seafood.

585
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,320
So, did you get anything of value?

586
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,280
How could he have? He was just getting yelled at when I arrived.

587
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,550
The meat is here.

588
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,670
But still, our scaredy-cat Yi Joon made an attempt to infiltrate.

589
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,390
Let's just eat the meat.

590
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,250
All right, let's eat.

591
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,020
I'm sorry, guys.

592
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,740
I don't even deserve to eat meat.

593
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,930
Young Min!

594
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,630
Is this butter?

595
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,270
It just melts in my mouth.

596
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,230
Hey, you guys try it, too.

597
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,340
Whoa!

598
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,500
We'll sell something this high quality at the mart?

599
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,110
Hey, we'll hit it big with meat.

600
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,220
You really can't leave out alcohol for premium food like this.

601
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,370
Is it that delicious?

602
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,250
I guess I should try the taste of my hometown, huh?

603
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,010
Delicious, right?

604
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,920
It's really delicious.

605
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,600
Should we eat one more pack?

606
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,020
Young Min, let's have one more pack.

607
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,330
Grill one more pack.

608
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,630
Please?

609
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,390
Did I make him angry by asking for more?

610
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,480
You should take the grill.

611
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,270
What brings you here?

612
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,360
Hey, it's terrible customer 1!

613
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,600
Did you come to get another refund?

614
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,580
It's my resume.

615
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,440
Forget about saving face. I'll just apply.

616
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,330
You can interview me if you need to.

617
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,440
You'll agree to an interview, too?

618
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,470
You're acting tough when you have a fear of interviews.

619
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,430
Are you saying you found one of my weaknesses?

620
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,960
I even bought you a book so you could ace your interviews.

621
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,400
Why do you want to work a part-time job?

622
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,770
If I fail my interview again tomorrow,

623
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,760
I'll stop looking for full-time jobs out of spite.

624
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,620
I see...

625
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,970
So Boram Mart is just an insurance?

626
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,400
Okay.

627
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,310
You'll be joining us soon for work. Come and eat some meat with us.

628
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,720
It feels oddly unpleasant even though you're accepting me.

629
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,680
Cheers!

630
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,130
Another one right away?

631
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,330
So...

632
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,580
she'll be joining us soon?

633
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,740
It's not set in stone yet.

634
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,980
Welcome!

635
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,770
All right. One-shot!

636
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,650
Drink up.

637
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,840
Hey, we have drinking chemistry.

638
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,920
There's no alcohol.

639
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,640
I'll bring some more.

640
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,570
Father,

641
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,090
I got the meat.

642
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,980
But...

643
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,040
why did you send the ones you raised?

644
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,530
That precious meat.

645
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,810
I'm sorry, Father.

646
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,290
I know you're disappointed that I can't come out on TV.

647
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,050
I'll make money and repay you.

648
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,970
Your son...

649
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,930

650
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,250
I can't drink.

651
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,250
I saw you down a whole bottle of soju yesterday.

652
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,850
What crazy bastard- I mean, who takes a bottle of soju

653
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,720
after winning first prize?

654
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,080
My goal wasn't

655
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,100
to win first prize in the first place.

656
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,850
I wanted to test myself to see if I could do something crazy.

657
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,080
There are moments when ninety-nine people say

658
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,120
something's crazy, and you still do it knowingly.

659
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,500
What I needed at that moment was alcohol.

660
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,630
I gathered the courage thanks to the soju

661
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,450
and I canceled my five-year installment savings with four months left.

662
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,890
Because I wanted to defend our mart.

663
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,360

But there's no more alcohol.

669
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,130
Where's the boss who went to get the alcohol?

670
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,050
Tae Ho isn't back yet?

671

What if he's passed out on the streets again?

672
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,620
Gosh, he always does something weird when he gets drunk.

Whoa.

They really organized the place.
