00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,860
You couldn't even make it to the nationals
because I beat you. Don't get me started.

159
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,859
Should we look at the
picture from back then?

160
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,579
If we look at your bruised face
with a bleeding nose from my kicks,

161
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,789
it'll be hard to distinguish
first and second place, right?

162
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,809
Whoa, I'm getting competitive
for the first time in 12 years.

163
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,339
Hey, you're going to Busan, right? Save
your money for KTX♪. (Korean Train Express)

164
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,199
I'll send you to Busan with my kick.

165
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,709
- Hey, okay?
- Young Min.

166
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,759
These two are talking
about the nationals again.

167
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,559
They always bring up the nationals,
regardless of what the fight is about.

168
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,949
Hey, how is it? Should
we do it here or there?

169
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,429
I'm so sick of this fight narrative.

170
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,180
Just cut it out now, okay?

171
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,890
Guys.

172
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,599
We've lived our own separate lives
for five years after disbanding.

173
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,160
And now, we're going to run a
mart together all of a sudden?

174
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,189
What's the reason not to? We've got a mart.

175
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,519
We just have to do it.

176
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,699
What if someone recognizes
us while working?

177
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,789
What are you going to do, then?

178
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,949
It's better than being looked down
on for having achieved nothing.

179
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,320
Also,

180
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,829
who would ever remember our faces?

181
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,500
"Thunder Boys."

182
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,260
Who would know us?

183
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,420
They didn't look all that thuggish.

184
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,369
Gosh, no way. Would they
really just sell the mart?

185
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,040
Boss Bong Soo must've
been just exaggerating.

186
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,299
Let's sell the mart.

187
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,990
Let's do business.

188
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,320
They said no one's interested
in buying the mart!

189
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,350
All right. Let's settle it democratically.

190
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,400
All for doing business, raise your hands.

191
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,589
I haven't finished the mart vlogs.

192
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,630
I'll also get to do
additional shootings, so...

193
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,649
Okay, that makes us the majority.

194
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,149
We're doing business, okay?

195
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,030
Bang, bang, bang.♪.
(A judge's gavel sound.)

196
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,570
Guys, we were doing just fine
without Boram Mart, right?

197
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,140
And I'm not going to watch
you guys running a mart.

198
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,300
Hey, we already decided by majority vote.

199
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,629
Does it make sense to decide our
livelihoods by majority vote?

200
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,899
Do it by unanimous vote. I'm
against it, and the case is closed.

201
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,209
What the hell?

202
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,939
You're not the leader anymore.
Who said you can decide?

203
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,910
It's for you guys.

204
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,659
So, because we disbanded by your decision,

205
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,710
do you think we liked it?

206
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,130
It's true we didn't know
Boram Mart belonged to us.

207
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,720
But it's not like I was doing just fine.

208

I only look handsome, splendid,
noble, cute, and adorable.

Gosh, I'm all rotten inside.

210
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,390
I also had a hard time.

211
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,500
That's why I went back to my hometown.

212
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,669
Are these sweet potatoes ours?

213
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,199
Yes, you can eat them. I heard
they're really delicious.

214
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,300
I'm sure sweet potatoes will
taste great in this mood.

215
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,470
What's this?

216
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,270
Is there honey inside?

217
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,680
When I was in Bali, I worked
part-time in a Korean mart.

218
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,169
Mart work is more fun than you think.

219
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,660
That's right. What made you go to Bali?

220
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,900
Because they said

221
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,560
there's no snow in Bali.

222
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,619
That's obvious.

223
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,570
They have a tropical climate.

224
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,019
Why are you talking about
the climate suddenly?

225

Anyhow, I'm your senior
regarding mart work.

All right! Joony the Solomon
will resolve the issue now.

228

Shin Tae Ho is for doing business,
and Choi Ho Rang is against it.

229

forget doing business, as Ho Rang said.

idea coming from a creator?

If we're to sell all of the items here,

247

00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,299
I'll become the ex-employee who becomes
the worst customer in Boram Mart's history.

472
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,839
Not "you will become." You
already are the worst customer.

473
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,709
Move aside!

474
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,819
Hey.

00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,680
Gosh, I'm in a hurry.

476

She's driving me nuts.

477
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,100
Here!

478
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,790
Take this and leave, Number One.

479
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,800
Wait.

480
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,039
You have to give me 20
won in change, Number One.

481
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,889
I don't have any 10 won.

482
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,120
I'll give you 10,000 won, and
you can give me 9,980 won.

483
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,390
Don't force a sale on me.
I won't buy these!

484
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,039
It's a closing sale gift.

00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,490
I remember you're having a
memorial service this week.

No! Make her pay-

487
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,540
Take these.

488
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,170
Happy? Go now.

489
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,219
Why did you add rotten sweet potatoes?

490
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,110
You thought I didn't see them?

491
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,779
I put in a bag of sweet potatoes on
the house without the others knowing.

492
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,809
I guess I'll take them
back since you're mad.

493
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,099
Shit, they only have red caps!

494
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,099
I won't pay, damn it!

495
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,679
Gosh, sir.

496
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,169
You can't drink the red caps, either?
We have the same taste.

497
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,109
Don't drink on an empty stomach. There's
a jerky that pairs well with this.

498
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,230
Two for the price of one.

499
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,189
Customers! You've waited a long time, huh?

500
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,799
Yes, we did.

501
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,910
I'm so sorry, I'm going to
give you a "sorry discount!"

502
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,929
Anyone who can make cuter poses than I can

503
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,519
will receive an additional 10% discount!

504

Okay, then. Adorable,

Whoa! The grandma in the middle
with the floral shirt is too cute.

508
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,380
The winner!

509
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,049
It was on the house? I didn't realize.

510
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,529
- Thank you.
- Enjoy!

511
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,749
- This is good.
- You want another one?

512
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,160
- Yeah, give me some.
- This way.

513

Have you thought about how much
you'll buy the contract for?

514
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,569
Your quick decision is appreciated.

515
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,939
I'll bring the contract and meet you soon.

516
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,430
All right.

517
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,150
Awesome!

518
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,399
I'll deliver these to your house tomorrow.

519
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,189
It's heavy, so just take the fruits.

520
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,629
It's fine. Free delivery is
only for totals over 30,000 won.

521
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,079
It's on the house.

I'm grateful for all your help.

Is today really the end for Boram Mart?

524
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,769
My mom used to shop for groceries
here, even before she became a mom.

525
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,339
Even when she couldn't eat
anything because of chemo,

526
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,810
she still ate oranges from here.

527
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,949
Jinsung Mart across the street
is too far for the grandmas.

528
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,599
Although Boram Mart runs a crappy business,

529
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,200
there are regulars who
can't leave this place.

530
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,549
Wait, you've got interview
fears when you speak so well?

How did you know?

532
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,139
Why would I go to a mart that's going
out of business? That's bad luck.

533
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm not going.

You think one book will do?

Well, then.

and you deliver sweet potatoes here?

Does the owner here know
your service is total trash?

He's not a deliveryman. He's
the owner of this place.

you was also the owner.

you even have health permits?

The day I heard we own a mart,

560
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,049
I made one because I was excited.

561

I also told Sang Woo to get one.

562

Yi Joon, did you make one
out of excitement as well?

563
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,510

Seriously. Hey, Yi Joon.

571
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,620
Why do you have a health permit
when you're into fashion?

572
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,949
I mean, I lost all my
savings doing stocks and

573
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,729
I make no money from my channel.

574
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,149
So, I worked part-time at
a café to make a living.

That's when I got it.

Gosh, I was going to hide it to the end.

How embarrassing.

Aigoo, it's okay. You're
a good fit for cafés.

can work at my mom's butcher shop.

629
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,830
Yes, Foreman.

630
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,259
Oh, the thing is...

631
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,900
I don't think I can go to
the construction at Busan.

632
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,829
Because I'm a mart owner starting today.

633
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,459
♫ I'll show you who I am,
a little more about me ♫

634
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,379
♫ The only secret I know,
I'll show you what it is ♫

635
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:31,730
♫ The dream hidden deep inside my
heart, I'll show it only to you ♫

636
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:39,800
♫ Beyond the horizon, there will be the sun
that never sets and a brightly shining star ♫

637
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,269
♫ Everything that you want ♫

638
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,539
♫ This a different world here ♫

639
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,609
♫ Try casting the spell, say you love ♫

640
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,259
♫ My pounding heartbeat
toward you sounds like ♫

641
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,369
♫ More and more ♫

642
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:56,750
♫ This place we met through
the storm is, mayday ♫

643
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,800
♫ Let's go now, we'll go ♫

644
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,430
♫ Let's go now, we'll go ♫

645
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,940
♫ Feels like walking on clouds ♫

646
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,749
♫ The moment you came to me ♫

647
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,200
♫ The moment I saw you ♫

648
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,659
[Idol Mart]

649
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,249
[CEO-dol Mart]

650
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,679
Those guys are doing business?

651
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,019
Congrats on officially
becoming Boram Mart's owner.

652
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,479
Trying to ignore us and fly by night?

653
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,579
You fraud!

654
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,029
This person is a tenant candidate?

655
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,729
We know way too little about marts.

656
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,479
Become an undercover agent and...

657
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,049
I'm telling you he's a spy from Boram Mart.

658
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,560
We'll infiltrate into Jinsung Mart.
