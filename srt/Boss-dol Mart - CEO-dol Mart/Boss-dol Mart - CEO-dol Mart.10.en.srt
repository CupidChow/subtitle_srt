They probably did. We did well.

We heard the mart's about to get demolished because of some scammer.

Going on the radio show was worth it.

Nothing has changed since Father's time here.

He did all that legwork to place this here.

It's still sturdy.

Father-in-law wiped this every day, saying built-up dust blocks prosperity.

The bosses must've managed it well.

When Father was the boss here,

Hyeon Yi would always hand the customers a drink.

My fortè is calculating money.

Is it? Marts open early,

248
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,340
so you have to wake up early and sleep late.

can't you just leave the mart as is?

366
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,770
This place has our family's memories.

367
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,090
- I'm not in those memories.
- Yes, you are!

368
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,830
After Unni remarried, we raised you and Hyeon Yi like brothers.

369
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,570
Like brothers?

370
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,770
Hyeon Yi was your only real son, anyway.

371

374

377

540
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,100
I can easily handle multiple trucks.

541
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,500
Hey, Ye Rim became scary after becoming a boss, right?

542
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,820
Scary?

543
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,840
She's cute.

544
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,190
What?

545
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,840
Huh?

546
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,580
As expected, things are going smoothly now that Boss Oh is here.

547
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,370
Oh, Mr. Park.

548
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:33,040
You read my five-year plan for Mr. Park's Fruits and Vegetables, right?

549
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,040
I mean, my eyesight worsened these days.

550
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,450
Aigoo! And the report was way too thick.

551
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,730
So you didn't finish reading it?

552
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,870
I'll finish reading it this week.

553
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,670
It's a promise!

554
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,180
Yes.

555
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:59,780
You know the Uglies Fruits and Vegetables direct transaction app meeting is next week, right?

556
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,640
Aigoo, she's such a strict boss.

557
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,250
I'm going first.

558
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,890
Mr. Park, don't be late for tomorrow's meeting!

559
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,780
Ye Rim...

560
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,950
I know it's late, but congrats on becoming a boss.

561
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:24,400
Gosh, it was only nice in the beginning. I'm way too busy now.

562
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,260
Was being a boss always this hard?

563
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,760
I'm not sure.

564
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,540
I became unemployed as soon as I became a boss, so I don't know.

565
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,750
When you need a break, hit me up whenever.

566
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,560
I'll buy you some meat.

567
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,820
Gosh, my back.

568
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,870
Gosh, I'm so tired.

569
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,970
I think it's because I'm lacking protein.

570
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,610
I'll finish work within an hour. Wait for me.

571
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,080
Really?

572
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,690
Yay! I'm so happy!

573
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,770
- Tae Ho.
- Yes?

574
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,740
Do you want to come eat with us?

575
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:06,210
Oh, I also have plans to eat meat with someone.

576
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,890
You'll have to excuse me.

577
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,490
Sure. That's too bad.

578
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,910
- Buy me some beef.
- Okay.

579
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,320
Here you go. Whoosh...

580
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,500
- Tasty, right?
- Yes.

581
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,520
One more.

582
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,240
But can we be like this?

583
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,640
What if someone takes a picture?

584
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,350
People can't really recognize me if I don't put makeup on.

585
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,960
But still.

586
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,910
I'll try my best to look like the manager just to be safe.

587
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,640
Wait, you can't take pictures. Sorry, you can't.

588
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,450
Gosh. Just be natural.

589
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,770
We can't help it if someone takes a picture.

590
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:05,000
By the way, why did you stop using the dialect I like?

591
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,120
Really?

592
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,690
If it's good for you, then it's good for me.

593
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,470
Also, I really wanted to eat the grilled mackerel back then.

594
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,060
I was really sad.

595
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,990
Really?

596
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,650
It was definitely and clearly my bad.

597
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,240
Let's go.

598
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,390
I'll grill some for you right away.

599
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,540
Since it was your fault,

600
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,640
you'll be grilling my mackerels for life.

601
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,310
For life?

602
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,060
Only mackerels?

603
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,700
Ribeye, chuck, short ribs, and tomahawk!

604
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,950
I'll take care of all of your meats.

605
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,620
Just trust me.

606
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:12,050
Will you take care of only the meats?

607
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,030
I'll take care of you, too, Gina.

608
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,470
I love you.

609
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,840
Love you, too.

610
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,460
Gosh, they look delicious.

611
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,670
There.

612
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,430
Noona, eat all you want.

613
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,120
Eat and order some more. You said you wanted meat.

614
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,360
Showing off with pork belly? It's not even A++ Korean beef.

615
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,110
Noona,

616
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,970
thank you for raising me

617
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,300
in Mom and Dad's place.

618
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,290
I'll do better from now on.

619
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,180
Did you get scammed again?

620
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,490
How much is it this time?

621
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,160
Gosh, that's not the case, okay?

622
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,240
I'm mature now.

623
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,760
Here.

624
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
This is a present.

625
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,310
I knew it. Hey, you're giving me a used one?

626
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,670
What?

627
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,640
What the heck?

628
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,510
Who used it?

629
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,680
Put some here.

630
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,610
Hey, why's the tone so different from your face?

631
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,030
- All right, next.
- Already? Put some more!

632
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,420
I need to finish before Shin Tae Ho comes.

633
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:22,520
Oh, Sang Woo. You're too perfect, so there's nothing to be done.

634
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,420
You don't need it, right?

635
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,160
I need it.

636
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,920
What are you guys doing?

637
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,890
Could it be...

638
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,570
you guys are nervous?

639
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,990
Gosh, Jo Yi Joon!

640
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,040
Joony J, what would be the best color for the end-of-the-year?

641
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,430
Color for end-of-the-year?

642
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,730
Everyone, what's the answer for end-of-the-year?

643
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,060
It's vivid. You know, right? The primary colors.

644
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,550
There are some people who wear clothes in pastel tones.

645
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,900
Nope! Like the one I'm wearing right now,

646
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:39,740
I strongly recommend these bright Santa Claus red.

647
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,940
We'll all up our game with vivid colors and become fashionable people, okay?

648
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:49,460
All right, let's also promise to cut ties with dark-colored clothes around year-end.

649
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,900
Wait! It's a promise, DJ noona, okay?

650
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:01,300
All right. That's been our daily guest, Joony J.

651
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,830
Is it over already?

652
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,560
You have to invite me again next time, okay?

653
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,510
Okay, I'll say my farewells.

654
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:15,330
Everyone, Happy New Year!

655
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,150
Lastly, please read a comment for you before you go.

656
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,230
Okay.

657
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,130
Hey, Unemployed.

658
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,010
Let's eat some rice cake soup on the first day of our thirties.

659
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,410
Rawr.

660
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,300
Who is it from?

661
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,440
No, no.

662
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,240
You just need to scan the barcode once and enter six.

663
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,540
When will you ever finish scanning all six?

664
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,490
- Hey!
- What?

665
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,950
Explain it one more time, please.

666
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:05,070
So y-you're saying do what after scanning the barcode?

667
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,820
So, as I said, scan the barcode-

668
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,010
My goodness. Move aside.

669
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,330
Why are you so angry?

670
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,750
You need to slowly- Why are you so bad-tempered?

671
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,640
O-Okay, okay.

672
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,400
Today is really the last day.

673
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,020
If you don't want to get fired, watch closely and learn.

674
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,800
I got it.

675
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,990
Scan it...

676
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,370
and change quantity.

677
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,180
- Should I try it now?
- Try.

678
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,410
Why can't you just scan it?

679
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,910
You're too close.

680
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,120
See? How nice is it to teach me one by one?

681
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,450
Scan it, right?

682
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,140
[Wish you great fortunes in the New Year.]

683
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,520
[Rice Cake Soup]

684
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,670
I should've told you before we started eating.

685
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,960
Guys...

686
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,830
happy freaking new year.

687
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,590
Aigoo, listen to how rude that sounds.

688
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,400
And he's 30-years-old.

689
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,750
You guys are fighting first thing in the New Year?

690
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,560
You're supposed to bid good fortune when eating rice cake soup.

691
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,460
Hurry up and try.

692
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,680
Sure.

693
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,820
Choi Ho Rang,

694
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,320
I hope you'll become a heavy equipment operator in the New Year.

695
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,780
My gosh...

696
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:55,200
I took a break, and no one's looking to hire me.

697
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,570
And it's wintertime, so there are no construction jobs, either.

698
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,610
I also need to find a job,

699
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,020
so I'm conflicted.

700
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,370
Huh?

701
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:11,500
Young Min, you're using your dialect again?

702
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,440
Listen now. Gina said my dialect sounds sexy.

703
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,840
Shit.

704
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,650
Hey, the rice cake is coming back up.

705
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,540
Hey, Sang Woo, was the main round next week?

706
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,760
You're nervous, right?

707
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,350
I'm strangely not nervous at all and

708
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:33,710
just happy to sing in a long time.

709
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,950
That's right. Yi Joon has a lot more subscribers now.

710
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,530
10,000 subscribers.

711
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,540
I've got more than that.

712
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,340
But it's not as fun doing it alone.

713
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,860
It was fun when I was bickering with you guys at the mart.

714
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,860
It's already a memory.

715
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,360
Gosh, we can just make more memories.

716
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,830
