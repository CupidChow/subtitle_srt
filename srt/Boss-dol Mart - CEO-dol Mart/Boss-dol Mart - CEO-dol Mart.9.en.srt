I'll sign it only because it's a hassle if the mart is gone.

185
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:58,668
I intentionally got the move wrong because I wanted to help you.

186
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,598
Aigoo!

187
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,678
I was going to sign it even if you didn't give me these clothes.

188
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,178
You shouldn't have.

189
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:25,338
You probably already have a lot on your plate.

190
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:32,428
Selling you fresh fish was my joy in life.

191
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:36,728
But now we can't even do business because of the scammer.

192
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:40,348
Don't say that.

193
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:42,808
You're making me cry.

194
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:49,448
I'll collect a bunch of signatures for you at the Women's Association.

195
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,268
Don't worry.

196
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:53,808
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

197
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,468
As expected, our customers are the best.

198
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:04,308
Hello, Boss.

199
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,948
Do Yoon, did you come to get a drink?

200
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:12,398
No, I just saw you from outside.

201
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,638
I want to sign one, too.

202
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,528
Do you know what this is?

203
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:22,978
Isn't it a letter asking for help?

204
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,588
Ten years old is old enough to understand that much.

205
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,168
Sure.

206
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:41,318
Then which gift should I give our smart Do Yoon?

207
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,048
I don't need a gift. Please just edit the vlog I filmed.

208
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,508
What?

209
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,438
I diligently filmed the birthday banquet.

210
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,988
<i>W-Wait, little man!</i>

211
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:56,538
<i>Please be gentle with my camera there.</i>

212
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:03,268
The one who brought the camera into the store

213
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:05,078
was you?

214
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:14,268
Whoa, that's really the love of the century.

215
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,258
You said you'd come.

216
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:26,968
I was going to, but-

217
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,608
Forget it.

218
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,448
Take these.

219
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,098
Gosh, my arms hurt.

220
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,828
You shouldn't have.

221
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:50,958
You should've told me sooner.

222
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:55,048
I was shocked when I saw the demolition notice the last time I came to see you.

223
00:17:57,008 --> 00:18:01,178
I won't allow you to keep an ounce of secret from me.

224
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,378
Okay.

225
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,848
I'll fill you up with my love instead of an ounce of secrets.

226
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:18,688
Your arms must hurt from writing this.

227
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:22,338
Come here. I'll massage them.

228
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:24,968
- My fingers, too.
- Your fingers?

229
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,448
Yeah.

230
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,008
- This side, too.
- This side, too?

231
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,988
As expected, romance galore.

232
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,798
- Feels good.
- Does it?

233
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,128
Yeah.

234
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,058
- It hurt so much.
- Did it?

235
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,728
I wrote 10 letters,

236
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,938
so, one more onion!

237
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,408
Boss!

238
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,608
Isn't an onion per letter too much?

239
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,458
It's so spicy! Let me do something else.

240
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,418
I need them for the sample corner later. Hurry up!

241
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:13,288
Why do you need so many onions for a sample corner?

242
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,918
- No wonder your business is slow.
- Hey!

243
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:20,138
I was going to get signatures from my employees, too.

244
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,008
I shall begin peeling onion No. 10.

245
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:29,138
Please prepare another letter.

246
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:32,478
Gosh...

247
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:36,798
I'd get so bored if Boram Mart's bosses all go away.

248
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,708
How may I help you?

249
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,668
We're temporarily out of business.

250
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:01,908
That's why I only brought one box of sweet potatoes

251
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,858
instead of 10.

252
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:07,118
Share this with the bosses.

253
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:09,648
By chance...

254
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,718
are you Mr. Park?

255
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,288
I am.

256
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:19,908
I felt bad about Boss Choi's accident.

257
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,328
Oh, how is he now?

258
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:23,748
He's all better.

259
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:27,898
He can probably spin on his head now.

260
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,758
That's good to hear.

261
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:36,568
But Boss Ho Rang will say something if I take this for free.

262
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,558
You're making me feel awkward.

263
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,298
Just take it.

264
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,058
- What are these?
- They're the uglies.

265
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:54,718
I made them.

266
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:56,128
Uglies?

267
00:20:57,008 --> 00:21:00,548
They look weird on the outside, but they taste just as great.

268
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:04,258
I had planned it all out, naming it the "Uglies Collection Set."

269
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:09,048
But I can't sell them because of business suspension.

270
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,958
I'll give you one box as a present.

271
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,958
This is a great idea.

272
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,498
How much would this cost?

273
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:20,998
Well, it's only 14,500 won.

274
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,248
Huh?

275
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:27,408
Wait, will you make a profit selling all these at that price?

276
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:31,888
They're unsellable vegetables, so we bought them cheaply.

277
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:35,688
They all taste the same when cooked.

278
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:38,178
So the customers would like it if they're cheaper.

279
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:41,778
Your name is?

280
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:45,058
Oh, it's Oh Ye Rim.

281
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:47,148
Ms. Oh Ye Rim?

282
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,548
You've got a great business mind.

283
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,968
If you get any good sales ideas,

284
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:02,208
give me a call.

285
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,508
Okay.

286
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:15,488
Aigoo, the onion smell!

287
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:19,438
The one who wanted to play always tastes his own medicine.

288
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,408
Oh, Mr. Park?

289
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:23,978
What brings you here?

290
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:26,928
I came to see if you're okay, Mr. Choi.

291
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,858
I'm okay. I'll start working again today.

292
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,448
No, I found a worker.

293
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,268
Anyhow, did you think about my offer?

294
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:46,368
What offer?

295
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:50,278
- The thing is...
- He said the mart's in trouble,

296
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:54,368
so I told him to wrap up this place and take over my store.

297
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:55,698
Pardon?

298
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:31,048
Attorney, you're on the way, right?

299
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:34,128
I'm sure you know,

300
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,928
but Choi Ho Rang is the target.

301
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:56,008
The administrative clerk says the not-guilty verdict is difficult

302
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,248
and you hop onto Mr. Park right away?

303
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,898
It's not like that.

304
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:05,848
I cried my eyeballs out, peeling onions to get a single petition signed,

305
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,538
but you were looking for a way out for yourself, huh?

306
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:16,558
Hyung, it's not like he accepted the offer already.

307
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:20,428
Since Ho Rang invested his money in the mart,

308
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:23,408
he needs to make money, even for a day.

309
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:25,488
I understand.

310
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,228
I said it's not like that.

311
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:30,218
Hey, I also got an offer.

312
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,548
Did you find a job, too?

313
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:36,318
An agency had contacted me for a contract.

314
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:37,748
However,

315
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:42,218
I refused outright, unlike you-know-who.

316
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:44,328
Because I have the mart to take care of.

317
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,748
I'm not taking over Mr. Park's store, either.

318
00:24:47,748 --> 00:24:49,458
Happy now?

319
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,558
What's wrong with all of you?

320
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,788
Hello!

321
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:34,138
The mart is disorderly, so you should at least keep the light on.

322
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:36,098
What's your deal, all of a sudden?

323
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:40,678
There's something I need to tell you all.

324
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:42,438
Shall we have a moment?

325
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,128
Boss Jo Yi Joon?

326
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,818
M-Me?

327
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,918
I'm also a Joony J subscriber.

328
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:09,668
Really? Are you my channel's subscriber?

329
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,098
You should've said so.

330
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:13,948
I really liked the mackerel episode.

331
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,408
But you haven't uploaded anything lately.

332
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,878
It's because the mart's in this state.

333
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:26,988
I'm getting more subscribers, but I don't have the time to film videos.

334
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:30,478
If you keep neglecting it, your channel will go down.

335
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:32,468
Pardon?

336
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,068
This is half of the moving fee.

337
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,498
And...

338
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,028
once you sign the memorandum of renunciation, I'll give you the other half.

339
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:52,768
Wrap up the mart and go all in on making fun content.

340
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:56,828
You need to succeed and get back into the entertainment industry.

341
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,778
Entertainment industry?

342
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:13,458
It'll be 10 million won per person.

343
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:16,508
Ten million won?

344
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:19,448
You should consider running a specialty butcher shop.

345
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:23,248
This much money should be enough for a new start.

346
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,648
Try all you want.

347
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,718
I won't fall for it.

348
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:42,128
The mart is bound to be handed over according to the contract.

349
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,488
I'm not interested in money.

350
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,328
You applied to an audition, right?

351
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:52,958
You might be coming out on TV in the future.

352
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,798
Just how far will you go against us?

353
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:59,318
Cut your bullshit!

354
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:01,558
Did you tempt my members like this, too?

355
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,358
Boram Mart is a special place for us.

356
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:07,688
Hand it over for a mere 10 million won?

357
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:12,728
Fifty million won of the mart's debt.

358
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:15,488
I heard Choi Ho Rang paid it off with his personal funds.

359
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,998
Mr. Choi's dream was to become a heavy equipment operator.

360
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:22,648
Did you know that?

361
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:24,778
I heard he gave that up for the mart.

362
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,538
Once he gets kicked out of the mart, he'll lose the money

363
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:31,398
and he'll also lose his dream, huh?

364
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:37,288
Honestly, other bosses have nothing to lose since you came empty-handed.

365
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,948
Isn't that why you're putting on a show?

366
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:43,188
Frankly, you guys don't have the money to repay Mr. Choi.

367
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,178
Mr. Shin...

368
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:49,918
you can't even seem to decide for yourself without Choi Ho Rang.

369
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:19,668
Why are they taking so long? I'm getting anxious.

370
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:30,858
What about my members?

371
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:41,768
What's this?

372
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:47,158
Your friends will know what it is.

373
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,228
[Memorandum of Renunciation of Real Estate Equity for Boram Mart]

374
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,018
What's this money for?

375
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:51,758
Let's just accept it.

376
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:53,978
What?

377
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:56,898
No way.

378
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:59,748
Did you accept this money?

379
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:02,748
You guys, too?

380
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,438
We didn't...

381
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,878
- accept it yet.
- Yet?

382
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:14,558
Well, then.

383
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,538
Did you sign this?

384
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,178
We're thinking about it.

385
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,598
You should've refused.

386
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:27,888
Why would you think about this?

387
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,988
Choi Ho Rang.

388
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:37,888
Let's give up the mart.

389
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,668
What did you just say?

390
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,028
Let's accept the money and go rather than getting kicked out like beggars.

391
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:49,448
Accepting this money is what a beggar would do, just like you.

392
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:50,778
What?

393
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:59,388
- You have no idea how I feel, and you're running your mouth.
- If we give up like this,

394
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,018
how about the customers who signed petitions for us?

395
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,708
Also,

396
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,018
is money everything to you?

397
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:22,158
<i>Please convince Boss Choi Ho Rang, Bosses.</i>

398
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:25,818
If you want to protect Mr. Choi's money and future,

399
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,408
it's better to convince him.

400
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:32,748
Boss Lee Ji Wook will take the mart one way or the other.

401
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:36,978
So don't torture yourselves anymore and quit the fight now

402
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,978
since you know you'll lose anyway.

403
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:44,558
You need to look out for your own life.

404
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:58,048
This is enough.

405
00:32:58,048 --> 00:33:01,788
Let's get the moving fee and go our own ways.

406
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:05,148
Yes. We're not 19.

407
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,008
We're 29.

408
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:10,438
We need to think about our survival before fighting.

409
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:12,808
Just how much is the moving fee

410
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,948
that you all are turning your back at once?

411
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:19,328
You don't even see the mart with a lump-sum in front of you, huh?

412
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,098
That's not the case.

413
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:34,878
We were going to pay you back your savings with the moving fee.

414
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:37,448
Did I ask you to pay me back?

415
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:41,428
Whether I lose my savings or not, why do you decide on your own and notify me?

416
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,838
Because it's been a burden on us all along!

417
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,688
Burden?

418
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,578
We came in empty-handed.

419
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:02,448
But you bet your life savings on this.

420
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:05,028
That's why I wanted to make money quickly.

421
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:07,028
So we can pay you back.

422
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:10,258
I see.

423
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,438
I was a burden to you guys, huh?

424
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,948
So, you want to quit the mart to lift your burdens?

425
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:18,838
Hyung, you know that's not what he meant.

426
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:21,898
Let's not say hurtful words like this.

427
00:34:22,718 --> 00:34:25,388
He's right. Let's quit everything

428
00:34:25,388 --> 00:34:27,338
and go separate ways.

429
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:29,408
All of you have a place to go to.

430
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:32,878
I heard an agency contacted you, Yi Joon.

431
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,768
Go there. You prefer to get all the attention by yourself.

432
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:38,758
It's perfect.

433
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:42,628
Hey, it's not like I contacted them first. It was just an offer,

434
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:45,488
but you're making it sound like I betrayed you guys.

435
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:50,378
Yes, honestly, I was interested. But can't I even be interested?

436
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:52,508
I'm not even good enough...

437
00:34:57,348 --> 00:35:00,328
to go on an audition like Sang Woo.

438
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,588
Am I wrong? You're the one who told me so.

439
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,498
Are you a kid?

440
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:09,108
Were you that jealous of our youngest going on an audition?

441
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,168
I won't stop you, so go on the audition.

442
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:14,078
What's the matter with you, Hyungs?

443
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,788
If you'll keep fighting like this,

444
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,228
- I'm not going on the audition.
- Sang Woo!

445
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:26,228
How could we work together like this?

446
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:28,268
Let's all just go solo.

447
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:31,588
Yi Joon and Sang Woo, go on the audition.

448
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,138
Ho Rang, go to Mr. Park's vegetable store.

449
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,108
And go back to your hometown, Young Min.

450
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,878
I'm the only one with nowhere to go, yet again.

451
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:41,428
Wait, what do you mean?

452
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,818
You also have your sister's Taekwondo center.

453
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:47,068
I can't go back home that easily.

454
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:53,688
My father raised those cows, getting blisters on all 10 fingers.

455
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:56,028
He sent those precious meats

456
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,398
because his son said he's working in Seoul.

457
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:03,668
But things ended up like this, and I sent all the meats back.

458
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:06,788
How do you think my father felt when he got the meat?

459
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:09,338
Without even knowing that,

460
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:11,448
you're telling me to go back?

461
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,818
And you still call yourself my friend?

462
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,698
Hey, what about you telling me to go to the Taekwondo center?

463
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:20,458
Am I useless without my sister?

464
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:31,508
While I was at the mart, people acknowledged me for the first time.

465
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:34,208
"Boss."

466
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,938
That one word...

467
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:40,018
changed the person I was.

468
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,438
But if I leave this place,

469
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,338
where will I be accepted?

470
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:56,598
I'm also frustrated!

471
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:59,358
But his money is at stake!

472
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,318
Boss! Boss!

473
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:31,118
If you also want to quit, I won't stop you.

474
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,338
What?

475
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,508
I heard you talking

476
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:38,078
to your sunbae on the phone back then.

477
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:40,098
Telling you to join the study group.

478
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:43,308
I don't need the study group.

479
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,918
I already have all the plans I need.

480
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,698
The bosses should be taking care of you.

481
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:53,368
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,928
We always show you our ugly sides.

483
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:06,998
Give me your hand. I'll give you a photocard of luck.

484
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,458
I don't need it.

485
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,148
Give Gina's photocard to Young Min.

486
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:33,088
It's Thunder Boys.

487
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,368
Where did you get it?

488
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:46,718
It was really hard to get.

489
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:49,508
Boss,

490
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:52,578
even if each day feels like a bomb,

491
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,958
look at this photo card of luck and cheer up.

492
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:25,558
<i>That's right.</i>

493
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:28,998
<i>He knew I was wearing a funeral garment.</i>

494
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,918
<i>I'm certain I tore down the CCTV.</i>

495
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:41,118
[Attorney Ko]

496
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:48,798
Attorney Ko, long time no see.

497
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,458
What's the occasion?

498
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,978
<i>You got a business suspension, right?</i>

499
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:56,498
<i>Chairman had especially requested that when we signed the contract.</i>

500
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:59,788
<i>You need to hand over the mart as promised.</i>

501
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,248
Oh, I see.

502
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:05,788
Will the mart's ownership get transferred to the landowner?

503
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:10,628
<i>Chairman changed the contents of his will before passing away.</i>

504
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:14,948
<i>There's a separate person who will inherit the mart.</i>

505
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:16,288
Pardon?

506
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:28,628
<i>Boram Mart is the best, and Boss Jo is even better!</i>

507
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:31,578
<i>I come when I'm feeling down, even if I've got nothing to buy.</i>

508
00:40:31,578 --> 00:40:35,448
<i>Seeing Boram Mart's bosses just makes you feel better.</i>

509
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:37,008
<i>The marketplace was so fun!</i>

510
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:41,888
<i>Open it one more time. I'll become Boram Mart's regular for life!</i>

511
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,298
Aigoo.

512
00:40:46,298 --> 00:40:49,288
This was the best part about the mart business.

513
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:53,608
<i>Hello. Do Yoon's ramen shopping vlog starts now!</i>

514
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:57,678
Aigoo, I told him so many times not to touch it.

515
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:06,158
[Sang Woo: Hyungs,]

516
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:08,168
[Sang Woo: if you don't make up by midnight,]

517
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:10,278
[Sang Woo: I'll make you do the "I love you" punishment. Come to the mart right now.]

518
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:20,988
Huh?

519
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,848
What the heck is that?

520
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,878
Gosh, how long are you going to not talk?

521
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:02,188
Once it's past midnight, there will be a penalty.

522
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,688
You're asking to be burned.

523
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:14,248
Have some.

524
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:22,018
It's hot!

525
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,258
See? You were going to talk anyway.

526
00:42:26,258 --> 00:42:30,098
Sang Woo, are these sweet potatoes or hot coals?

527
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,338
You're ever so whiny.

528
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:37,348
Oh, it is hot.

529
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:39,418
See? It's hot, right?

530
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:43,778
Hurry up and eat. I worked hard to roast them.

531
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,588
As always,

532
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:58,068
Mr. Park's sweet potatoes are the best.

533
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:06,438
But why isn't Yi Joon coming?

534
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:08,368
Is he still upset?

535
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:11,388
It's because of you.

536
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,818
You should've praised him for getting an offer.

537
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:16,558
Why would you be sarcastic about it?

538
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:21,558
Hey, says the person who discouraged him from wanting to go on audition.

539
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:39,498
You still didn't make up?

540
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,328
What's this?

541
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:58,558
Whoa, the chicken smells crazy good.

542
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:01,548
That's our Ye Rim.

543
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:03,508
You bought beer, too?

544
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:07,128
Today's craft beer set is on me.

545
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:16,568
Thanks.

546
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,188
Hurry up and eat. Have the wing, too.

547
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:36,688
Gosh, I spent an hour making the fire to roast sweet potatoes.

548
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,538
You betray right away as soon as chicken's here.

549
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:46,768
You have one, too.

550
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:06,548
Hyungs,

551
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:08,458
did you know this?

552
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:12,148
It's 12:03 a.m. right now.

553
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,408
- N-No!
- No way.

554
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:18,378
I won't let you off the hook this time.

555
00:45:18,378 --> 00:45:21,998
You need to make up for sure, so you don't fight again.

556
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:23,648
Gosh.

557
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:26,888
I think I'm getting indigestion right now.

558
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,048
All right.

559
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:32,298
Everyone will take turns and say,

560
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,828
"I love you," okay?

561
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:38,828
Wait, Yi Joon isn't here yet.

562
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,108
Guys!

563
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:48,448
This is totally nuts.

564
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:51,028
Hey, do you know what I brought?

565
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:54,058
Don't change the subject and come sit here.

566
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,568
Boss Yoon's not messing around today.

567
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:05,208
Hey, this is urgent!

568
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,468
The penalty is urgent, too.

569
00:46:08,658 --> 00:46:11,238
All right. I'll go first.

570
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:16,178
Young Min, your hands.

571
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:29,238
It is actually hard to do...

572
00:46:29,238 --> 00:46:31,348
facing the person.

573
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,798
Gosh, what in the world...

574
00:46:34,648 --> 00:46:37,498
What if I go like this, then?

575
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,438
I love you.

576
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:49,108
I love you, too.

577
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,058
I love you.

578
00:47:14,018 --> 00:47:15,608
Yes.

579
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:17,218
I love you.

580
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:18,568
Yes.

581
00:47:40,888 --> 00:47:42,168
Love ya.

582
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:45,018
What did you say? We couldn't hear you.

583
00:47:45,018 --> 00:47:46,678
I heard him.

584
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:48,288
Heard him loud and clear.

585
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:50,868
Okay. That's a pass.

586
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,508
All right. It's Ho Rang's turn now.

587
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,148
I...

588
00:48:01,468 --> 00:48:03,388
I-I...

589
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:08,418
I won't let it end until you say you love him.

590
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:21,328
I actually...

591
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:27,278
was thankful you guys tried to pay me back my savings.

592
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:35,208
But I really...

593
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:39,448
had no intention to get my savings back.

594
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:47,928
When I consider you, accepting the moving fee is right.

595
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:51,578
But when I thought about the customers who signed the petitions,

596
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:54,558
I couldn't do it.

597
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:03,318
I'm sorry, Ho Rang.

598
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:11,048
I'm the one who's really sorry to you guys.

599
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,198
I'm sorry for...

600
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:17,828
giving up on Thunder Boys first.

601
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,588
Back then,

602
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:24,508
when CEO Yoon...

603
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:28,128
told me to keep working without Hyeon Yi after the accident-

604
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:30,428
Yoon Min Soo, that bastard said that?

605
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:37,298
I just couldn't bring myself to dance and smile on stage.

606
00:49:38,198 --> 00:49:40,768
I'm sorry for deciding to disband

607
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:45,358
on my own.

608
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:48,928
What do you mean?

609
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:52,878
I would've done the same in that situation.

610
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:56,698
We didn't disband because of you.

611
00:49:57,778 --> 00:49:59,648
Back then, none of us

612
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:03,178
could endure it without Hyeon Yi.

613
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:09,448
We were too young.

614
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:18,018
That's why I don't want to give up this time.

615
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:23,108
Let's try until the end.

616
00:50:30,938 --> 00:50:32,918
My dear bosses,

617
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:37,178
I love you.

618
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:46,338
I'm the last one, right?

619
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,668
I love you.

620
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:50,338

621

623
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,168

625
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:06,368
<i>This place is Boram Mart.</i>

626
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:09,808
<i>I'll go to my favorite ramen section.</i>

627
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:14,578
<i>Oh, right. My favorite candies are over there.</i>

628
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,088
Who's that?

629
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:57,458
It's the scammer!

630
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,848
The landowner.

631
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:00,968
We got him!

632
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:04,408
This is clear enough of an evidence, right?

633
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:07,938
Yi Joon's done it this time, huh?

634
00:52:12,558 --> 00:52:14,158
Gosh.

635
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:21,558
The battery died.

636
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:26,158
The power socket is over there.

637
00:52:32,468 --> 00:52:34,158
Good?

638
00:52:34,158 --> 00:52:36,118
Huh? What's this?

639
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,208
There's a doorknob here.

640
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:43,588
Ye Rim, do you know anything?

641
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:45,268
I've never seen it, either.

642
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,398
Even Ye Rim doesn't know?

643
00:52:49,258 --> 00:52:53,308
Perhaps there's a dead animal or a corpse-

644
00:52:53,308 --> 00:52:55,338
