I ended up promising her an 80th birthday banquet and a celebratory song.

182
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,437
Gosh, what was I thinking?

183
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,167
What is this?

184
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,197
Dried seaweed I ordered from Busan.

185
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,977
I bought it during my business trip.

186
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,737
This is why you went?

187
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:05,937
- You should've told me.
- It's okay.

188
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,267
Only one person should have to suffer.

189
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,167
Same with the sweet potatoes.

190
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,677
Let's go together next time.

191
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,327
- You heard from Mr. Park?
- That's right.

192
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,717
Are you the only boss? I'm a boss, too.

193
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,337
CEO Yoon said seaweed is the next ingredient on the show.

194
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:28,667
You guys were disappointed because I declined the interview.

195
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,867
I felt bad asking you to go buy seaweed with me.

196
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,707
I chose a good batch from Busan.

197
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:41,697
Seaweed?

198
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,807
Everyone!

199
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:49,267
Did you miss me? I missed you to death, too.

200
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:52,747
Joony J's seafood channel is finally back with a vlog!

201
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,967
Who's our guest this time?

202
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,417
I just...

203
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:02,417
obtained secret information about "Food is Power."

204
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,277
Our guest is...

205
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:06,907
Seaweed.

206
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,837
What?

207
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,257
How did you know?

208
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,027
What do you think? CEO Yoon told me.

209
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,877
He didn't just tell me?

210
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:32,777
Guys, guess what I bought.

211
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:40,117
- On this week's "Food is Power" episode-
- We know.

212
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,477
We know. It's seaweed.

213
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:43,977
Seaweed!

214
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,117
What the heck? I'm the only one who knew.

215
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:50,017
Was it telepathy?

00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,167
[Wild Seaweed]

217
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:13,607
Damn, CEO Yoon.

218
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:18,467
He brought information about seaweed and blabbered on about it to everyone.

219
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:22,207
Everyone was bummed about not going on TV,

220
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,607
yet you all went to buy seaweed?

221
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:29,207
Wow, we must really adore Boram Mart.

222
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:33,007
Yes, it's so lovable I could die.

223
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,537
How are we going to sell all this?

224
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,657
How about we eat it all starting today?

225
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,517
I can eat 10 bowls.

226
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:42,737
Yeah.

227
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,537
Bosses, focus.

228
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:49,347
I have a brilliant idea of how we can sell this seaweed.

229
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:50,747
An idea?

230
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:02,237
So, you want to open a seaweed marketplace here?

231
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,527
Yeah.

232
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:07,847
We'll set up the seaweed and cook seaweed soup in a big pot.

233
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:12,007
Hyung, why would we cook seaweed soup, though?

234
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,517
Think about it.

235
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:16,317
How was the reaction when we grilled mackerel?

236
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,357
It was awesome.

237
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,857
We have to spread the aroma.

238
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:26,357
If Young Min adds beef to the seaweed soup and we open a sample corner,

239
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,557
it's game over

240
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,967
for our seaweed sales.

241
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,457
It sounds reasonable hearing about it,

242
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,807
but why does your expression give peddler vibes?

243
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:42,647
Hey, I just came up with an idea. Why complain?

244
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,237
What could I possibly trick you into?

245
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:49,817
Did you get conned into buying a big pot or something?

246
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,787
You think I get conned all the time?

247
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:56,847
You saw me win over the Korean and Chinese restaurant bosses.

248
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,237
Fine, as the boss in charge of seafood,

249
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,867
I approve of the seaweed marketplace.

250
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,707
My seaweed soup is killer.

251
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:08,237
I also approve of the seaweed marketplace.

252
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:09,937
I also approve.

253
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:14,387
Tae Ho, how did you come up with such an idea in this short time?

254
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,967
Are you all here, bosses?

255
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:28,537
The part-time lady told me I could find you here.

256
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:36,717
What time will my 80th birthday banquet start on Friday?

257
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,187
"I'm sorry for causing trouble."

258
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,897
I only did as our agency told me to.

259
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,537
Did you even compensate him for doing something like this?

260
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:03,577
He must've requested something unless he's an idiot!

261
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,647
Open the ice box next to you. His request is in there.

Gosh.

00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:18,397
What an idiot.

265
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,817
He's not an idiot. He was pretty smart.

266
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,457
He said not to come by again.

267
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,707
That was his second request.

268
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:32,797
He broke my heart and gave me an ice cream.

269
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:38,597
An 80th birthday banquet?

00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,857
the preliminaries.

541
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:50,567
How did you know?

542
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,127
I know you still want to do music.

543
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:56,427
Stop thinking about it and apply to the audition.

544
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,467
Hyung,

545
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:03,867
don't you...

546
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:07,187
want to go on stage again?

547
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:18,937
Living without a big dream

548
00:46:18,937 --> 00:46:21,277
like this is comfortable for me.

549
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:26,847
Then, your life would be so lonely.

550
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,607
I'm not the only one.

551
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:33,717
But I hope you get to do what you want, Sang Woo.

552
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:35,867
Instead of being mindful of your hyungs.

553
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:38,377
Hyung...

554
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:40,617
Boss, are you here?

555
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:56,827
We're from the Food Safety and Sanitation Department of the city.

556
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:58,557
The city?

557
00:46:58,557 --> 00:47:03,087
We got a report that you're selling expired foods.

558
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,717
Let us inspect.

559
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:09,107
Look over here.

560
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:19,407
Who organized the return products yesterday?

561
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:25,057
I did it right.

562
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,237
What are they doing?

563
00:47:32,237 --> 00:47:34,327
They're defects?

564
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:44,497
How can you display so many expired products like this?

565
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:47,767
You violated Article 44 of the Food Sanitation Act.

566
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:49,267
What?

567
00:47:58,107 --> 00:48:01,667
I took out all of these to return yesterday.

568
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,397
It's true!

569
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:07,237
Why are they on the shelves if you removed them to return?

570
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:11,707
On top of that, they were slyly hidden in between regular products.

571
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:16,257
Sir, we'll be more careful from now on.

572
00:48:16,257 --> 00:48:18,437
Could you let us go with a warning this time?

573
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,797
There are too many products in violation to be a simple mistake.

574
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:26,277
Come in for police interrogation tomorrow.

575
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:28,377
Police interrogation?

576
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,047
Are we getting arrested?

577
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:34,967
You'll probably be suspended for business.

578
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:37,307
Hear the details at the police station.

579
00:48:37,307 --> 00:48:41,177
Who on earth reported this? Give me a name.

580
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:43,527
Public informants are protected by law.

581
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:46,347
We'll take the products we removed.

582
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:47,817
Let's go.

583
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:02,367
It's strange.

584
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:08,217
I'm sure I put the milk products to return outside.

585
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:13,657
Who was in the store today?

586
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:23,957
Something must've happened while we were gone.

587
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:25,927
Damn it.

588
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:31,017
Business suspension means we can't do business with perfectly fine products!

589
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:35,647
If we can't open, what do we do about the fresh products?

590
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:37,547
Fresh products?

591
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,847
Scrap vegetables are still in the return boxes.

592
00:49:59,517 --> 00:50:02,107
The scrap fish are still here, too.

593
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:12,637
Looks like they went after only products with expiration dates.

594
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,757
I think someone mixed them in on purpose.

595
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:21,487
Shit, who is this bastard?

596
00:50:27,177 --> 00:50:28,967
Damn it...

597
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:30,907
Another blackout?

598
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:50,047
Hyungs!

599
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:54,977
Come look at this.

600
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:03,367
Someone tore Tae Ho's drawing.

601
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:06,837
Gosh, my masterpiece!

602
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:16,677
What is this?

603
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,537

[Idol Mart]

613

[CEO-dol Mart]

614
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,817
Once your business is suspended, according to the bestowal agreement clause...

615
00:52:15,817 --> 00:52:18,337
Business suspension? What does that mean?

616
00:52:18,337 --> 00:52:21,607
That's enough now. Why are you so serious?

617
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:24,697
Don't you get it? I'll demolish the mart and build a building.

618
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:27,747
If the mart is gone, so is the reason I came here for.

619
00:52:27,747 --> 00:52:31,037
Even the worst problem can be resolved if you talk about it honestly.

620
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:33,037
No matter what happens, I won't lose it.

621
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,257
Don't mess around in a losing fight.

622
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:36,237
Just wait and see.

623
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,967

624
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:41,117
I'll protect the mart.
