181
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,100
How are we supposed to sell the vegetables you took apart like that?

182
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,400
You're really headstrong for a businessman. Are you a novice?

183
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,890
Do you know who we are?

184
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,540
Do you know how many wholesalers are in business thanks to my Chinese restaurant?

185
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,360
You don't need to feed us.

186
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,910
You just need to pay for the vegetables you touched.

187
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,010
Stop it.

188
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,230
Madams, you can just go, and please try the greens.

189
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,100
Forget it!

190
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,020
Aigoo!

191
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,150
Shin Tae Ho.

192
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,860
Is getting paid for the vegetables the issue at hand?

193
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,830
You can't even retrieve the scammed money, let alone succeed with that mindset.

194
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,210
What did I do wrong?

195
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,830
- Do we have to allow their power trip?
- Those people

196
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,650
got a good look at all the ingredients.

197
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,900
They wouldn't even look at us if we went to them with our goods.

198
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,020
Also, is petty cash for the vegetables such a big deal?

199
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
What a saint.

200
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,920
Why don't you give them some meat, too?

201
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,370
Oh, should we serve them alcohol as well?

202
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,030
Are you a little kid?

203
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,190
Don't meddle if you don't know a thing about service.

204
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,690
That's...

205
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,330
how you protect the mart's money.

206
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,860
Is that all you have to say?

207
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,400
What are you arguing for? Just fight with taekwondo.

208
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,720
Let's see who croaks once and for all.

209
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,920
Damn it.

210
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,840
Shouldn't someone follow him?

211
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,400
Nope, don't worry about that.

212
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,170
Tae Ho will come back when it's time to eat.

213
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,860
No way. Is he crying?

214
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,340
My goodness. My bosses are such a handful.

215
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,710
- Boss!
- W-Whoa! No...

216
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,970
You startled me.

217
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,660
I was more surprised. Why did you scream?

218
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,500
What's that?

219
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,930
I'm sorry. Did it break because of me?

220
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,460
It's okay.

221
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,990
I bought it to raise my blood sugar.

222
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,170
My goodness.

223
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,500
I was worried you'd be drinking yourself silly somewhere.

224
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,460
Let's go back inside now.

225
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,080
It's the same whether I'm at the mart or not.

226
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,430
I'm working without knowing anything, huh?

227
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,200
I mean, everyone learns on the fly.

228
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,390
Yi Joon practiced all night to sell mackerels.

229
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,590
And Choi Ho Rang, with such an ego,

230
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,470
endured the bossy customers just to sell some greens.

231
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,100
But I...

232
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,910
got scammed out of 1.2 million won.

233
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,590
I try my best, but it won't work out.

234
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,800
Boss...

235
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,420
if you want to study marts, go meet Master.

236
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,060
Master?

237
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,390
There's a person Boss Ho Rang serves.

238
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,700
Mr. Park from the wholesale market.

239
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,870
I heard other merchants call him the "God of Business."

240
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,440
He started working at the wholesale market at 19,

241
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,250
but he owns 10 stores under his name now.

242
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,670
Really?

243
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,770
[Gina spotted in a neighborhood mart]

244
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,730
"B Mart's employee forced Gina out by her wrist.

245
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,230
The employee is thought to be one of the two.

246
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,460
He's either an obsessive fan...

247
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,890
or her boyfriend."

248
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,590
They said they'll expose the mart's name and location if there's no explanation.

249
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,270
I'm sorry to you guys.

250
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,720
We already have it tough.

251
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,340
It's not because of you.

252
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,230
But Young Min,

253
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,910
- if Gina once again causes you-
- I'll take care of it.

254
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,970
Don't worry.

255
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,200
Looks like you got over it quickly today.

256
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,810
Oh, shush.

257
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,980
Right, today's Saetbyeol Taekwondo's anniversary.

258
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,470
So what?

259
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,370
Want to do a birthday party at the Taekwondo center?

260
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,730
I need to go to Mr. Park's store.

261
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,630
Our Taekwondo center opened the same day as your mom's birthday.

262
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,710
Gosh...

263
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,760
That's true. It's today.

264
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,400
What should I do?

265
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,270
Go see your mom.

266
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,120
I'll go to Mr. Park's store instead.

267
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,120
What?

268
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,210
I said I'll go.

269
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,990
Why is it so heavy?

270
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,070
Aigoo, seriously!

271
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,150
Why is it so heavy when it's so small?

272
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,900
Aigoo, there!

273
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,510
Gosh, I'm tired.

274
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,380
Boss, do you have water?

275
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,190
Give me some water, please.

276
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,960
You didn't even unload half. You're taking a break already?

277
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,150
I think your sweet potatoes are heavier than other places.

278
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,060
My back's about to give.

279
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,490
Thank you.

280
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,570
Are you the friend who works with Mr. Choi?

281
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,800
Yes.

282
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,790
We're working together after five years,

283
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,860
but we're really completely different.

284
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,270
Even I can see you two are very different.

285
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,190
He's so mean to me but pretends to be so nice to customers.

286
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,330
He doesn't charge them even if they throw greens at him.

287
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,810
He says okay to every refund and exchange request, too!

288
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,540
Gosh, I'm worried we'll go bankrupt from being too nice and giving.

289
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,740
There's no way a diligent merchant like Mr. Choi will go bankrupt.

290
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,470
I've got good eyes for people, okay?

291
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,930
I saw how diligent he is, which is why I allowed him the sweet potato farm.

292
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,970
The farm?

293
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,530
Weren't the ugly sweet potatoes bought from your store?

294
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,310
Mr. Choi harvested all of them himself from the farm.

295
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,680
Sorry?

296
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,730
That amount isn't something anyone can do alone.

297
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,590
But he somehow even knew to take the sweet potato stems, too.

298
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,460
Mr. Choi really is a great merchant.

299
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,160
Oh, no wonder.

300
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,280
He came completely covered in dirt that morning!

301
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,560
Merchants have to be sincere, even if they're selling one item.

302
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,610
Once the other person realizes that, even bad customers can become regulars.

303
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,390
<i>I'm not moved by these vegetables.</i>

304
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,380
<i>Aigoo, thanks for the showing.</i>

305
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,370
<i>I'm just not getting the feel.</i>

306
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,000
<i>It's vague.</i>

307
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,760
- By the way, Boss.
- Huh?

308
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,290
Do you happen to have a cabbage farm?

309
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,600
Huh?

310
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,400
- I'll harvest them until I fall apart!
- What?

311
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,880
You can barely unload the boxes!

312
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,380
I really want to be accepted.

313
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,590
I want to stop getting scammed and

314
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,670
become a helpful coworker to my friends.

315
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,080
That's why I came to see you, Mr. Park.

316
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,890
Aigoo, that's so unfortunate.

317
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,320
I don't have any cabbage farms.

318
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,130
I see.

319
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,830
You don't.

320
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,500
Instead, if you go to that store with the green sign,

321
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,680
you'll find the most delicious cabbages in this market.

322
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,300
They don't sell their vegetables to just anyone,

323
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,980
but they'll sell them to you if you say I sent you.

324
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,250
Whoa, daebak! Really?

325
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,220
Boss, thank you so much!

326
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,690
Here's the most important part.

327
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,980
Go buy their vegetables, but don't sell the vegetables.

328
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,930
Sorry?

329
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,530
[Mom's Taste Side Dishes]
Yes, please take care and enjoy!

330
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,300
We have a lot of side dishes. Take a look.

331
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,690
Have you had seaweed soup?

332
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,690
Where's the need for that?

333
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,730
You only had to come. Why'd you buy all this?

334
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,050
You need to save every penny.

335
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,770
You're regularly adding to your savings, right?

336
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,350
Y-Yes.

337
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,820
Are young radishes in season lately?

338
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,700
How do you tell which young radishes taste good?

339
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,880
Why ask something you never asked before? What about young radishes?

340
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,900
I mean, they just look delicious.

341
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,090
- Mom.
- Yes?

342
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:26,570
What do you do when customers complain about the food you made with so much care?

343
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,790
Even if I'm boiling inside, I keep it in and sell.

344
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,670
Just as I thought,

345
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,680
keeping it to yourself is the only way, huh?

346
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,870
But still,

347
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,190
even if I need money,

348
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,670
if they never tried my goods

349
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,260
or are messing with me when they don't intend to buy,

350
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,840
I don't consider them customers.

351
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,420
All right!

352
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,560
Take them. Make sure not to waste them and eat them all.

353
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,350
Gosh, it's heavy.

354
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,440
Why is there so much more today?

355
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,950

536

Right?

537
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,760
Wait, was this your plan all along?

538
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,300
I'm sure this will be the talk of the town.

539
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,330
We're the first mart to satisfy those ladies' terms.

540
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,480
Wait, does that mean Boram Mart has a fixed income now?

541
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,580
I'd say all of this fortune started with my sell-out of mackerels.

Whoa, Tae Ho.

561
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,850
I checked with the real estate office, and you really took the mart off the market.

562
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:07,110
Per our agreement, I came to tell you the ingredient for "Food is Power."

563
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,110
In that case,

564
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,710

565
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:20,010
I was also curious how the kids who only danced and sang were running a business.

566
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,550
You even disbanded not to work together.

567

Looks like money keeps you together, huh?

568
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,300
It feels like I did my best throughout my 20s,

569
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,350
but the guys and I are not any better off than we were 10 years ago.

570
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,820
If that's my fault,

571
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,210
I want to take responsibility.

572
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,580
So there won't be a second failure.

573

That's why...

574

Don't look at just the trees. Look at the forest, too.
