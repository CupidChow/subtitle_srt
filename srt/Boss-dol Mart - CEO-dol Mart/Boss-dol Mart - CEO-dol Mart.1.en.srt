317
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,253
what do I do when it snows for real?

318
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,213
[R.I.P. Song Hyeon Yi]
[12/31/1997 - 12/21/2017]

319
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:13,084
I told Ho Rang that I'm an adult now.

320
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:21,363
All the hyungs must've

321
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:23,544
become adults now, right?

322
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:32,864
Everyone!

323
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,363
It's the vlog of Joony J, a mart owner.

324
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,533
The place I'm at is...

325
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,203
Ta-da!

326
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:42,843
Gosh!

327
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:44,343
You scared me!

328
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,923
You're just as noisy as ever, Jo Yi Joon.

329
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:48,843
Your clothes are blood red.

330
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:50,684
Are you gochujang♪?
(Korean chili pepper paste)

331
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:57,583
Are you criticizing my
fashion as soon as we meet?

332
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:59,873
You've finally gone mad, Ho Rang.

333
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:03,223
I'm a fashion celeb.

334
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,933
I know. 440 subscribers.

335
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:10,753
But shouldn't you be quitting if
that's all you got after five years?

336
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:13,423
On top of that, I'm one of them.

337
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:17,243
Really? When did you quietly subscribe?

338
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:21,923
I subscribed and clicked dislike
because your videos suck.

339
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:24,533
Hey, unsubscribe.

340
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:27,454
I'll just live with 439 subscribers.

341
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:35,183
Whoa, your fashions are out of this world.

342
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:38,673
Oh, it's because I came right
after dropping off the kids.

343
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:41,523
Let's hurry up and talk
before Master calls me.

344
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:42,893
Huh?

345
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:46,443
Whoa, Jo Yi Joon!

346
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:48,564
Are you Taeyangcho♪?
(Korean chili pepper paste brand)

347
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:51,093
Looks like you two were
really in one group.

348
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:55,583
Your eyes for fashion equally suck.

349
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,004
Aigoo.

350
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:01,963
He's totally gochujang.

351
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:04,253
What's this?

352
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:07,754
Rice delivery? Did you sell rice?

353
00:30:08,884 --> 00:30:11,693
- Well, it's...
- What the heck?

354
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,783
Didn't we gather to sell the mart?

355
00:30:13,784 --> 00:30:16,283
But you're doing business?

356
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:18,453
I'm not doing business.

357
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:20,283
But...

358
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,604
she said she dislikes
fruits but likes oranges.

359
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:27,074
Am I the weird one?

360
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:30,303
I'm hearing bullshit from you.

361
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:33,083
But you earned 62,000 won.

362
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:36,053
What? Sixty-two thousand won?

363
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,544
It's true.

364
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:42,384
- We're not open for-
- Hey!

365
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:45,323
What are you doing?

366
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:47,944
Why stop a customer from coming in?

367
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,113
Here.

368
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:56,333
You go and deliver the rice.

369
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,733
Go.

370
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,634
Go, go.

371
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,764
Hey, come here.

372
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:07,574
How much is one bag of this?

373
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:39,084
Just give me 2,000 won.

374
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,754
Is it a bit expensive?

375
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,723
One thousand five hundred won.

376
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:49,394
One thousand five hundred won?

377
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,924
For one bag?

378
00:31:58,804 --> 00:31:59,913
What are you buying?

379
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:01,633
- It's a sale!
- My goodness!

380
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:04,864
- Come right now!
- Let's go quickly!

381
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:40,103
You never used a POS machine and
never made a delivery, either?

382
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:43,053
You can just ring the bell
and leave it at the door.

383
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:45,823
How are you going to
deliver everything on time?

384
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,743
I mean, what if someone
takes it after I leave it?

385
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:51,664
And I bothered to wait.

386
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:04,593
Gosh, I can't see anything.

387
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:08,594
The screen! My phone got destroyed!

388
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,664
By the way...

389
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:15,583
- at the concert hall, did we-
- By the way,

390
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:18,993
if you need help at the mart,
you can ask me to work for a day.

391
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:22,223
Instead, let me use your phone right now.

392
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:24,474
I can't read my text.

393
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:31,163
What if I say no?

394
00:33:31,164 --> 00:33:34,894
Of course. I'm not the
one to get permission.

395
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:43,263
Oh, hello.

396
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:45,553
I'm the applicant who had the interview.

397
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:49,293
Could I find out the
results over the phone?

398
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:52,504
Oh, yes. It's Oh Ye Rim.

399
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:59,184
Oh, I see.

400
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,944
Could you tell me why I failed-

401
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,973
Is it on sale?

402
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:14,353
- I need this.
- The onions.

403
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,853
- The radish!
- How much are they?

404
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,693
Why are they selling them so cheap?

405
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:20,263
- Oh, my!
- My gosh!

406
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:24,934
How could a mart part-timer look
so handsome, like a celebrity!

407
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:27,803
You're handsome!

408
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:31,043
- He's handsome.
- Never seen such a handsome person.

409
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,793
Whoa, I should come here often.

410
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:38,233
By the way, how much is one bag of onions?

411
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:40,083
Onions?

412
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:42,743
Let's be cool and...

413
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:44,313
make it 1,000 won!

414
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,843
Oh, my, my! So great!

415
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:49,123
Hurry up and pick one up!

416
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:51,784
Quickly! Get it, get it!

417
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:05,463
Who's the new owner of the mart?

418
00:35:05,464 --> 00:35:07,364
Let's have a word.

419
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,093
I won't wait any longer.

420
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,483
Pay off the balance right now!

421
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:15,613
The balance?

422
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,123
We sold him the goods for free for months.

423
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:21,843
Because Mr. Yoon sounded so desperate.

424
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:24,904
Didn't you hear anything when
you bought the mart from him?

425
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:28,873
- I don't know anything.
- Gosh.

426
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,383
You think that's going to cut it?

427
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:32,823
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

428
00:35:32,824 --> 00:35:36,384
Pay for the four months'
of unpaid bills right now!

429
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,364
Just how much is the unpaid balance?

430
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,294
How much is all this?

431
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:56,843
Are you okay?

432
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:01,423
It's my 19th rejection, so I'm used to it.

433
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:03,233
Thanks for the phone.

434
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:06,243
If you're thankful, you can
give me one more photocard.

435
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:07,624
Okay.

436
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,164
Sorry?

437
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:14,114
You're from the concert...

438
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:24,253
- Hey, what?
- Choi Ho Rang!

439
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:27,394
A gigantic bomb went off.
Hurry up and come back!

440
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,254
What's this?

441
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:38,283
Ho Rang, how do I use the calculator?

442
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:42,023
- I just don't get it.
- Are you talking about the POS machine?

443
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:43,394
You just...

444
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,904
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

445
00:36:56,784 --> 00:36:58,753
I need that right now.

446
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,504
The part-timer help.

447
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,223
Can't you run faster?

448
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:17,693
I mean, you should've given
me time to change, at least.

449
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,574
The pajamas are embarrassing.

450
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,663
They were pajamas?

451
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:25,824
They were cute, so I didn't know.

452
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:29,844
What the heck?

453
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:33,393
You don't need to cover up.

454
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:34,944
Or you can...

455
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:44,134
hide behind me and run.

456
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,873
Are you crazy? Why would I hold your hand?

457
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:01,104
No, not my hand. My sleeve.

458
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,373
I don't have time.

459
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:25,714
What does he know how to do?

460
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:28,233
Cut up the meat for me.

461
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:31,013
- It's for a stew.
- Hurry up!

462
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:33,003
The meat?

463
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:35,604
One second. I'll look it up.

464
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:39,573
You don't even know how to cut meat?

465
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,943
- Grandma.
- Huh?

466
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,854
Bring me the meat here.

467
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:11,984
Who is that?

468
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,513
So, when are you going to pay us?

469
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:21,113
- He's frustrating.
- We're busy people-

470
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:22,933
- Whoa!
- W-Wait!

471
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:23,963
Hey.

472
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:26,593
We owe the wholesalers
more than 30 million won.

473
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:28,224
What do we do?

474
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:38,014
They're doing everything to rip you off.

475
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,383
Sir.

476
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:49,803
You came alone last time and got
paid a bit in advance, didn't you?

477
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,013
But you didn't mark that
amount on the receipt.

478
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,793
Oh, I forgot about that...

mandarins, and apples you sold us.

Why didn't you take it out of the balance?

482
00:40:04,764 --> 00:40:06,923
I'm sure we complained about it back then.

483
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:09,524
Are those included? I
thought I took them off.

484

Although Mr. Yoon is the one who's
been buying the goods from you,

485
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:21,274
we'll pay off the balance since
the mart was turned over to us.

Instead, please give me some time.

There are a lot of customers
in the mart, as you can see.

489
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:36,884
We should do business now instead of
arguing here to pay off the balance sooner.

ease now that I'm here.

Didn't we do our part in Boram Mart
still being here and not out of business?

516
00:42:55,964 --> 00:43:01,943
That's right! I'm sure we bought tens
of boxes of ramen during practices.

We ate good stuff sometimes, too.

won for one bag of onions?

We were busy for no reason,
and there was no profit.

538

But running a mart was pretty fun.

But why are we all here?

540
00:44:22,154 --> 00:44:26,504
Because we're Boram Mart's owners.

541
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:31,313
You remember doing a commercial
for Boram Beverages five years ago?

542
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:34,913
They gave us Boram Mart instead of the
signing fee we didn't get back then.

Let's sell the mart quickly

00:44:40,534 --> 00:44:42,934
They might seize the store before that.
