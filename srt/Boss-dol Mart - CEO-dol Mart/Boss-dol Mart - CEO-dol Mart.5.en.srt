We can sell ugly mackerels, just like we sold ugly sweet potatoes.

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,980
Yi Joon, the ugly sweet potatoes were only shaped that way,

Jo Yi Joon,

121
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,140
you wasted all the money we earned from the closeout sale.

Why is that Yi Joon's fault? It's our shared responsibility.

And...

124
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,910
must you nitpick everything?

125
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,320
We need to be clear about what's right or wrong to improve ourselves.

126
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,740
What if we let it go and keep suffering losses?

127

Are we rich?

128
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,160

- Why should I?

You must've just gotten off work.

Well, then...

By the way,

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,500
you have no plans to start music again?

157
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,220
It's just that our company is preparing for an audition program.

158
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,320
How do you feel about joining the preliminary round?

159
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,150
I've never thought about that.

160

Think about it starting now.

161

Don't you want to sing again?

162
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,510
By the way, the other members also work at Boram Mart, right?

163

How did you know that?

164
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,540
I saw them leaving Jinseong Mart with you last time.

165
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,990
I'll visit soon. And please...

166

Well, then.

168
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,730
You should leave first, too.

169
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,730
Excuse me, rookie boss. Where do you think I'd go?

170
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,070
After a day's business, you have to clean up even if the sky splits open.

171
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,810
What are you waiting for?

172
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,530
I'll close the register and clean up.

173
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,640
You can organize the fruit and vegetable corner and stand.

174
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,120
