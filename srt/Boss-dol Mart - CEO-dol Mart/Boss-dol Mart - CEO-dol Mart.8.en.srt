The content is strange.

"When business is suspended or fined,

35
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,030
It says the contract will be terminated if business is suspended.

36

Does that sound like a good thing to you?

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,120

Oh, the coffee I drank wasn't expired, too, was it?

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,420
How did you know about the past expiration dates?

41

But business suspension isn't the problem.

82

Is he a psycho?

156
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,810
He threw that, knowing where the CCTV was located.

157
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,940
He's the culprit. He threw that intentionally.

158
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,250
But we can't see his face because of his cap.

159
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,460
What are you talking about? What is this?

160
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,100
This is the CCTV monitor.

161
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,480
Someone was inside on the day of the birthday banquet.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,410
I think someone schemed the business suspension.

163
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,930
Shit, what kind of rat would do this?

164
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,410
- Show me his face.
- Yeah, let's take another look.

165
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,560
Geez, another power outage?

166
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,630
The lights are still on in the store.

167
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,140
What brings you here?

168
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,700
Is that how you greet your customers?

169
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,170
Are you looking for something?

170
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,100
What I'm looking for? Boram Mart.

171
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,140
Hand over the mart.

172
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,500
The seafood wholesaler! I mean, aren't you the scammer?

173
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,370
You're that mackerel customer, right?

174
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,630
You didn't show up after I salted the mackerel!

175
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,030
So?

176
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,700
What do you want me to do about it?

177
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,520
Pay back our 1.2 million won.

I'm not Park Soo Nam.

181
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,390
The person who got that money was Park Soo Nam, Chairman of the Senior Center.

182
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,500
You made a donation.

183
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,530

Excuse me, let's talk-

Didn't you see the contract yesterday?

189
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,170
Your business was suspended, so in accordance with the contract, get lost!

190
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,130
If a business suspension is issued, according to the provisions of the gift agreement,

191
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,350
the ownership of the mart goes to the landowner, Lee Ji Wook.

192
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,920
- Landowner?
- Don't you get it?

193
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,830
If the landowner tells you to get lost, get lost.

What will you do once you chase us out?

195
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,710
You think anyone can run a mart?

196
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,360
Who says I'd run a mart? I'll demolish the mart and build a building.

197
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,660
The lights went out back there, right?

198
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,180
Starting today, I'll turn the power switches off one by one.

Okay, business is over. Clear everything out and leave.

202
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,590
Then I'll give you the moving cost.

203

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,830
Boss, let's check the CCTV hard drive, just in case.

205

Oh, that's right.

206
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,620
Why would a mart like this need a CCTV?

207
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,230
The ones on the ceilings are all fake.

208
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,980
Even the part-timer is nosy here.

209

Hyung, we can't let him take the CCTV.

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,510

What about you guys?

360
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
What kind of audition is it?

361
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,050
Is it going to be aired?

362
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,610
Should I try, too?

363
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,650
It's a waste to let Sang Woo's singing go unheard.

364
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,370
You just do your best with Joony J.

365

- You're here?

370
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,450
Well, Boss.

371
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,320
I think this week will be my last delivery.

372
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,760
I'm sorry.

373
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,920
Well, is it because of the business suspension?

374
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,070
Yes.

375
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,120
Huh? How did you know?

376
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,890
It's already the talk of the town.

377
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,150
Did you discuss it with the administrative clerk?

378
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,140
Administrative clerk?

379
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,590
You need to request an administrative verdict.

380
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,320
Verdict? Isn't that a scary thing?

381
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,910

Tell me about it, too.

386

I mean...

387
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,760
it's not that big of a deal.

388
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,610
Looks like you're trying to pull another trick.

You recently went to a funeral, right?

392
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,300
Wait. Did you just see that?

393
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,720
The thing on his left arm.

394
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,110
Are there suits with such designs?

395
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,960
It's not a design.

396
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,910
I think it's an armband.

00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,390
Armband?

398
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,670

I don't have a family.

00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,260
Why were you wearing funeral clothes that day, then?

402
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,830
Pretty good.

403
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,720
But don't mess around in a fight you'll lose.

404
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,110

- The administrative clerk?
- Oh, yes!

- Yeah.

00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,750
Just like a nightmare that keeps reliving

542
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
even after you wake up.

543
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,990
♫ Although I've got lots to tell you ♫

544
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:10,120
♫ Because I can't tell you everything, I'll leave them here ♫

[Idol Mart]

546
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,150
[CEO-dol Mart]

547
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,820
Once you sign the waiver agreement, I'll give you the other half.

548
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,460
Let's quit everything and go our separate ways.

549
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,240
I was a burden to you guys, huh?

550
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,400
Did you think about my offer?

551
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,800
That fearless bastard.

552
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,000
Choi Ho Rang is the main target from now on.

553
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,460
Are you Mr. Park?

554
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,670
- What are these?
- They're the uglies.

555
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:30,990
I made them.

556
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,190
Please edit the vlog I filmed.

557
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,980
What the heck is that?

558
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,860
Even if each day feels like a bomb,

559
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,560
cheer up.
