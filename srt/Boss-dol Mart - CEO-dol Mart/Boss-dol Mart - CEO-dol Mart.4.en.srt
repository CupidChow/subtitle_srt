Don't you think Boram Mart's snack corner is too far from the entrance?

The snack corner?

Isn't it too far for the children to venture in?

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,290
The snack corner has to be close,

55
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,140
so the parents buy a few snacks for the kids on their way to pay.

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,390
I'm meeting a seller early in the morning, too.

489
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,230
You looked them up?

490
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,090
We'll be able to open the mart tomorrow, right?

491
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,420
Of course, we will. Don't worry.

And the 10 duties are in effect.

You know, right, Shin Tae Ho?

496
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,440
Let's not tick each other off.

497
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,050
We need to do a cheer. What should it be?

498
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,440
Why don't we do 'Rumble, bang, bang' for old times' sake?

499
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,630
- Gosh, Hyung.
- Hey.

500
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,600
Rumble, bang, bang?

501
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,930

Really?

520
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,740
It's our first customer of the reopening.

Let's all greet in one line.

522

Hello-

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,100
Whoa!

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,350
Gosh, looks like I'll miss out on watching something fun.

525
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,050
I'm going to the fish market, okay? Tell me everything later.

526
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,810
Gosh, let go of me!

527
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,500
Gosh, seriously.

528
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,650
I was wondering why you left the Taekwondo center so frequently over some appointments.

529
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,330
Did you start working here?

530
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,700
I didn't get a job here. I own this place.

531
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,940
Hey, who would ever make you a boss?

532
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,820
You're embarrassing me in front of them.

533
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,870
If you don't want to be embarrassed more, go quietly.

534
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,120
- I don't want to.
- Come.

535
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,910
- I don't want to!
- Noona!

536
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,260
Noona, we're really owners of this mart.

537
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,540
I get you're worried about Tae Ho,

538
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,200
but it's our first day opening the mart by ourselves.

539
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,670
I hope you'll understand.

540
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,520
Ho Rang, you know Tae Ho.

541
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,220
He can't do business.

542
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,120
He's got no sense for work and life because he grew up privileged.

543
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,700
I know.

544
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,460
He hates hard work and can't lift heavy things.

545
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,050
He never even cleaned once with his own hands.

546
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,410
He doesn't even clean his room!

547
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,440
He doesn't clean the mart, either.

548
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,080
Wait,

549
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,250
what's up with you two? Are you doing a diss battle about me?

550
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,050
But still...

551
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,100
he's crazy for money, so he's good at calculating.

552
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,710
Noona,

553
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,490
we need every single member here.

554
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,070
We need...

555
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,650
Tae Ho.

556
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,210
On top of Tae Ho lacking competence,

557
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,540
as his noona,

558
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,170
I don't want my brother working at a place like this.

559
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,860
Our late father would roll over in his grave.

560
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,720
Everyone, move!

561
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,380
I need to pay.

562
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,460
Grandma, here. I'll ring you up.

563
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,770
Let's stop all this useless stuff and go.

564
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,380
What? Where is he going?

565
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,660
- Sorry?
- Come ring me up.

566
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,970
Grandma, he's not going to work here anymore.

567
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,990
Grandma, I said I'll help you. You can give it to me.

568
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,210
No, I can't trust anyone else.

569
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,420
I'm only going to pay this young man.

570
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,180
Other employees even threw away the points I had saved for years!

571
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,320
That's right.

572
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,150
Grandma!

573
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,840
I found this while...

574
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,360
sweeping the floors.

575
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,240
You found it! You did!

576
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,280
Hurry up and ring me up for this.

577
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,660
And give me the sticker thing as well.

578
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,950
Okay, I got you.

579
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,560
If you like the mart that much,

580
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,470
don't come to the Taekwondo center starting tomorrow!

581
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,570
Noona!

582
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,270
This is our opening present.

583
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,020
Take them and give them to the kids.

584
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,740
Does this even make sense?

585
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,280
Tae Ho,

586
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,280
you're only 29. Will you be satisfied in life selling red bean jelly?

587
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,700
It's not too late. I'll pay for everything.

588
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,100
So challenge yourself to anything you want to do.

589
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,330
Being a mart owner is also a challenge.

590
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,010
This is a challenge?

591
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,500
Don't you even have a dream or a goal?

592
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,720
You told me to earn a living!

593
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,860
You're the one who said that.

594
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,710
Gosh, seriously.

595
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,420
Okay.

596
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,530
I'll give you a raise, so don't work at a place like this.

597
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:59,220
If it were a few months ago, I would've been hooked on what you said.

598
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,870
Because I was crazy for money.

599
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,710
But I realized it a while ago.

600
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,800
I'm...

601
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,200
crazy for affection.

602
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,560
What?

603
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,220
After Mom passed away when I was young,

604
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,700
after all the members separated while living together,

605
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,000
and after our scary father passed away,

606
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,830
I lived aimlessly because I was lonely, Noona.

607
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,780
But if I sit around at the mart,

608
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,010
customers come by all day.

609
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,580
And I bicker and work with the guys,

610
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,140
so I don't get lonely.

611
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,600
I want to...

612
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,060
be happy before I become 30,

613
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,580
rather than being successful.

614
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,560
So, please.

615
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,240
Let me off the hook, Noona.

616
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,080
This isn't enough for anybody.

617
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,160
Give me one more bag next time.

618
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,560
I'm going.

What about Yi Joon? Is he on his way?

623
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,880
He's not answering his phone. Did he get on a fishing boat or something?

624
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,830

Gosh, looks like our first day will be a failure.

626
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,340
Should I go out and bring in some customers?

No, let's wait a little. We opened just now.

- Sorry?
- Didn't you take a selfie with Tae Ha oppa?

I saw you on SNS, Oppa.

Oh...

Are you two friends? When are you meeting him again?

638
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,620
Aigoo, he's Tae Ha's best friend.

639
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,360
Daebak. Do you know Tae Ha oppa, too, ahjussi?

640
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,780
Ahjussi?

641
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,580
Tae Ha is oppa, but why am I ahjussi?

642

Gosh, she's too pretty.

667

How can a person be that beautiful?

668
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,290
Gosh, what did she eat while growing up?

669
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:40,530
Gosh, she's really so fresh. She's a human grapefruit.

670
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,840

Isn't it Gina from the TV?

I said I'll buy it for you.

What about all the cameras?

679
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,000
How would you know the ice cream I'm craving in this mood?

680
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,890
Where are the ice creams?

681
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,620
I-It's in front of snacks- No.

682
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,120
I-It's next to the meat section.

683
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,250
Stay here. I'll go get it.

684
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,110
Wait, don't take pictures.

685

Please don't take pictures!

686
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,760
- Don't take pictures.
- Gosh, what do I do?

Whoa, daebak.

688
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,570
I even listened to her song on the way this morning.

689
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,810
And Gina noona is right in front of my eyes.

Choi Ho Rang, this is it!

691
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,900
Go ask Gina for a selfie like the one with Tae Ha!

692
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,020
Once you post that picture,

our mart will become world-class!
