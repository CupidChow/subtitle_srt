1
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,059
I had a tough day.

2
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,521
My boss yelled at me.

3
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:22,481
Here's your beer and oolong tea.

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,442
Cheers.

5
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,033
Guess what?

6
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,790
"I finally got plane tickets to
Miyakojima Island."

7
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,333
Anything else you want?

8
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,091
Do you have to work that day?

9
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,718
There's somebody else I like.

10
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,226
You look down.

11
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,060
What's wrong?

12
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:04,147
You can tell me anything.

13
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,539
Sorry.

14
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,667
What is it?

15
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:34,762
There's somebody else I like.

16
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,976
You can't be serious.

17
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,184
I am serious.

18
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,571
I wanna break up with you.

19
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:08,128
"When I'm with that person,
I feel so warm and special."

20
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,174
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,417
Your dad won beef in the Sign Language club
and Deaf Association joint bowling tournament.

22
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:14,253
"""Join us for dinner.
We'll have sukiyaki."""

23
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,188
It's from Mom.

24
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,698
I'll visit them after work.

25
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,283
Are you working today?

26
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,284
Yeah.

27
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:26,325
"Until Rainbow Dawn"

28
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:38,548
One year ago

29
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,846
Your boyfriend?

30
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:55,022
"It's August and he's already
talking about Christmas holidays."

31
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:06,284
Maybe we don't get along.

32
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:16,085
"He's always thinking ahead,
but it's now that I care."

33
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,631
These days I feel we are so different.

34
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,018
"Remember the sign language club's
summer party, where we first met?"

35
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,854
You drove there,

36
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,398
but you drank all night.

37
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,483
I remember.

38
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,239
"I wanted to have fun and
forgot about driving home."

39
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,616
It was fun.

40
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,335
It makes me happy when you're happy.

41
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,221
What kind of shop is it?

42
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,808
It's a family-run shop.

43
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:15,434
It must be really homey.

44
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,439
They make the food by themselves.

45
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,360
Something's on your face.

46
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:22,818
Here?

47
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,070
The other side.

48
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,445
Thanks.

49
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,616
This is good.

50
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,514
When I was in Deaf school,

51
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:56,394
we only had 20 minutes for break.

52
00:07:56,475 --> 00:08:04,026
So we planned ahead using sign language during class,

53
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,863
"and dashed out of class
as soon as the bell rang."

54
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,524
I broke up with my boyfriend.

55
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,901
Really?

56
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,709
If you were a guy, I'd date you.

57
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,712
Two girls can't date?

58
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,531
Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture

59
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,588
Sorry, I got to go.

60
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,509
Pick me up at ten tomorrow.

61
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:50,758
Okay.
Take care.

62
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,592
Thanks.

63
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,630
Hey.

64
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,216
How old are you?

65
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,884
Twenty one.

66
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,680
"Wow, you're young.
Do you have a boyfriend?"

67
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,223
Yeah.

68
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,019
"Sorry to interrupt, but
how do you like your hair cut?"

69
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,645
A bit shorter.

70
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,566
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,932
Hey.

72
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,683
She's here.

73
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,689
Welcome home.

74
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,484
It smells so good.

75
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,905
I missed your sukiyaki.

76
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,284
Congratulations, Dad.

77
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,161
My third straight win.

78
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,538
You're as good as ever.

79
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,291
"You know the chairman
of the sign language club?"

80
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,209
The bald guy?

81
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:52,421
"Yeah. He didn't say a word
when your dad won."

82
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,673
I hate him.

83
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,840
He's so rude.

84
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,509
Forget it.

85
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,052
Let him win next time.

86
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,512
No, we are serious.

87
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:00,179
Oh, eggs.

88
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,388
You won enough.

89
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,767
"The lane was good.
I got many strikes."

90
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:05,434
Yeah?

91
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,645
And the ball?

92
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,103
I lucked out.

93
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,813
In short, you were good.

94
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,538
How is it?

95
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,831
Delicious.

96
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:34,255
So good!

97
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,765
"I haven't seen your boyfriend
for a while."

98
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:51,063
"He stopped coming to the club
three months ago. Is he busy?"

99
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,982
I don't know.

100
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,774
Are you still with him?

101
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,987
We broke up.

102
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:00,780
When?

103
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,783
Last December.

104
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:06,078
What happened?

105
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:10,249
He is nice and has a steady job.

106
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,834
You'll be sorry.

107
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,296
There's someone else.

108
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,633
Is he Deaf? Or hearing?

109
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,468
Deaf, but they didn't go to Deaf school.

110
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:22,970
It's she, not he.

111
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,806
What? A girl?

112
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,476
You know her.

113
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,061
It's Ayumi.

114
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,314
Oh, that girl.

115
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,734
She was in my beginners' class.

116
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
Right.

117
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,235
You remember her.

118
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,820
Oh, the pretty girl?

119
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,199
Have you slept with her?

120
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,869
Yeah, we love each other.

121
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:52,833
It's disgusting.

122
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,460
I won't approve it.

123
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,049
She's like your sister, right?

124
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,843
No.

125
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,274
You have to leave.

126
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,158
Alright.

127
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,945
Hey.

128
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,658
How was sukiyaki last night?

129
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,034
It was good.

130
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,966
Are you tired?

131
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:13,056
Let's take a break over there.

132
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,185
Yeah.

133
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,233
It's beautiful.

134
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,591
You know what?

135
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:21,978
"Last night I told my parents
about us."

136
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:34,574
"They said I should
get back with my ex."

137
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,492
They said we're disgusting.

138
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,768
You told them everything about us.

139
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:05,063
I'm so happy.

140
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,989
I'm sorry.

141
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:06,916
Hey.

142
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:12,588
I went to Hokkaido on vacation.

143
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,674
Potatoes were really good.

144
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,218
I got some for your parents.

145
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,045
Let's eat watermelon.

146
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:09,520
"Do you think your mom won't
like us being together?"

147
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,278
I don't know.

148
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,662
She raised you all by herself, right?

149
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:27,370
Yeah.

150
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:34,293
"Don't tell her about us,
if it means trouble for her."

151
00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:00,319
I studied gender theories in college.

152
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,345
"Gender"

153
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,265
"Men"

154
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,516
"Women"

155
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:31,143
"Body"

156
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:32,603
"Men"

157
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:34,396
"Women"

158
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
"Romantic Interest in: Men - Women"

159
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,397
"Ayumi"

160
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,120
"Hana"

161
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,098
Take care.

162
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,350
Thanks.

163
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,145
Someday I'll tell my mom about us.

164
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,896
Yeah.

165
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:40,064
Hello.

166
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:48,656
Coffee and this one, please.

167
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:49,991
It's 600 yen.

168
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:05,256
Thank you.

169
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:06,506
Thank you.

170
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:30,906
Hi, Mom.

171
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:31,531
Hi, Taro.

172
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:41,959
A chocolate donut?

173
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,586
School's out now?

174
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:44,336
Yeah.

175
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,963
Where've you been?

176
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,423
I went swimming.

177
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,548
The pool?

178
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,551
I can do the crawl.

179
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,261
Wow!

180
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:53,888
Your mom wants you.

181
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:54,554
Taro.

182
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,974
Did you finish your homework?

183
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,935
Do your homework first.

184
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,270
Yeah.

185
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:02,605
Good boy.

186
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,241
Thanks.

187
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,079
Hey, are you...

188
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:19,246
Excuse me.

189
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,372
She wants you.

190
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,294
One coffee, please.

191
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,962
Yes, right away.

192
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:54,406
Hey.

193
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,618
I get off work at three.

194
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,123
Why don't we go to Tokyo?

195
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,623
What for?

196
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:09,839
"There's a gathering
of people like us."

197
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,310
You know we live in a small world.

198
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:29,441
"Well, maybe we can learn
something from them."

199
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,662
If you want,

200
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,707
you can finish at two.

201
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:45,791
Really?

202
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,251
Thank you.

203
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,713
Yay!

204
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:49,729
Hey.

205
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:51,774
Hey, miss.

206
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,319
Excuse me.

207
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:56,195
Miss!

208
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,738
Tee-hee.

209
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,740
Have coffee with me.

210
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,117
I can't hear.

211
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,744
Let's have coffee over there.

212
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:05,996
I can't hear.

213
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:08,916
Talk to me.

214
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:11,919
Who do you think you are!

215
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,768
Don't leave me!

216
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,770
Sorry.

217
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,665
I wanna go home.

218
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:49,999
Really sorry.

219
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,209
We're almost there.

220
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,265
Straight ahead.

221
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,843
Have a seat here.

222
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,687
Please.

223
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,565
What would you like?

224
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,856
Cassis and orange.

225
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,526
Yes, ma'am.

226
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,047
Thank you so much.

227
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:25,885
You?

228
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,887
Oolong tea, please.

229
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,896
Thank you.

230
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,691
Enjoy.

231
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,905
Where are you from?

232
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,908
From Saitama.

233
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:49,909
Saitama!

234
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,994
Really.

235
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:55,915
Yuri.

236
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,211
Can I have a glass of plum wine?

237
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:02,172
When are you paying the tab?

238
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:06,385
As soon as I get paid.

239
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:08,721
Alright.

240
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:09,514
Yay!

241
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,520
Hello.

242
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,523
She's cute, isn't she?

243
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,149
Yes, she is.

244
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:25,237
I think I know you.

245
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,700
I've met her somewhere.

246
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:29,992
Oh, really.

247
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:31,994
Where're you from?

248
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:33,996
From Saitama.

249
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,956
Is this your first time here?

250
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:37,542
Yes.

251
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,251
Didn't you get lost?

252
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:44,298
We first got off at Shinjuku.

253
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,341
Had no idea where we were.

254
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,636
I know exactly how it is.

255
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:49,512
Thanks.

256
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,681
And take this over there.

257
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,141
Yes, boss.

258
00:32:58,978 --> 00:32:59,856
Surprised?

259
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:00,648
No.

260
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:06,986
All of our staff here are Deaf.

261
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,988
That's great.

262
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:10,990
Do you work?

263
00:33:11,576 --> 00:33:13,620
At a cafe.

264
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:18,998
I work at a café, but I'm the only Deaf person there.

265
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,167
That's good.

266
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,461
What about you?

267
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:24,003
I work at a hair salon.

268
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:28,510
"I must ask you to
do my hair sometime."

269
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:29,719
I'd love to.

270
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,401
I'm tired.

271
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,195
I need fresh air.

272
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:49,196
Stay here.
Okay.

273
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,030
Excuse me.

274
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:30,738
Did you get it?

275
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,739
No.

276
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,533
5 letters.

277
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:35,743
It's easy.

278
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,160
You don't get it?

279
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:38,788
Am I that bad?

280
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,748
I need more practice.

281
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:43,793
5 letters...

282
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:50,257
Camel?

283
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,509
Bingo!

284
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,092
Finally you got it.

285
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,208
I love you.

286
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,663
Is she alright?

287
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,081
She's fine.

288
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,178
Are you okay?
Yeah.

289
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,348
Look at this.

290
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:23,726
So pretty.

291
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:24,894
Is it real?

292
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,562
I don't know.

293
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,486
Is this a rainbow?

294
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:35,655
Yeah, it is.

295
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,992
It's beautiful.

296
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,213
Are they closing?

297
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:57,510
Yeah, they close at nine.

298
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,057
How did you like it here?

299
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,935
I'm a bit tired.

300
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:06,811
Let's go home.

301
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:07,854
Yeah.

302
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,229
I'll get my stuff.

303
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,245
Thank you so much.

304
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,463
Are you staying in Tokyo tonight?

305
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:38,509
No, we're heading back to Gunma.

306
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,636
I mean to Saitama.

307
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:45,183
Gunma?

308
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:50,312
"Can you stay a bit longer
for a drink or two?"

309
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,277
Just one or two drinks.

310
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,083
Shall we?

311
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,963
Cheers.

312
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,977
I haven't introduced everyone yet.

313
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,563
This is Ai.

314
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:33,606
Hi.

315
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:35,024
Hello.

316
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,194
She's quite a womanizer.

317
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:39,695
Oh, please, Yuri.

318
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,322
This is Sho.

319
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,742
He's my son.

320
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:48,621
Make-believe one, that is.

321
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:53,458
Guess what?

322
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,377
He got a boyfriend!

323
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,755
Really? Who is it?

324
00:38:58,756 --> 00:38:59,757
Not now.

325
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,510
And that's Yuta.

326
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,054
A real lady-killer.

327
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,347
Good to see you.

328
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,642
I'm an FTM.

329
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:15,565
"I used to be female
but now live as a male."

330
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,195
I'm transgender too.

331
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,361
You are?

332
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:27,366
So these are all my staff.

333
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:28,828
Nice to meet you.

334
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,166
I'm Ayumi.

335
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,458
Nice to meet you.

336
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,961
I'm Hana.

337
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:38,045
Hello.

338
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:41,464
Are you together?

339
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:43,259
No, we're not.

340
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:48,514
Please eat.

341
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,807
Thank you.

342
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:06,073
Sho, who's your boyfriend?

343
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:10,578
You know Ken Saito?

344
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,412
I've heard of that name.

345
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:14,540
You know him.

346
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:17,668
He was your older sister's classmate.

347
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:18,336
Right.

348
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,880
Oh, I got it.

349
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,715
So he's your guy.

350
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,424
Good for you.

351
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,262
Let's toast the new couple.

352
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:38,522
Thank you so much.

353
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:46,445
"We have this place
thanks to Yuri and Sho."

354
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,914
It's been almost seven years.

355
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,251
You were a ninth grader.

356
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:00,127
Right.

357
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:01,879
Time flies.

358
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:11,389
"There was this upperclassman
I was in love with."

359
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:56,767
Yo, you're working hard.

360
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:58,394
Wanna play catch?

361
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,562
Got a mitt?

362
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:01,105
On the bench.

363
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,148
Alright.

364
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,259
Not bad.

365
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:44,732
"You've got to keep your shoulders level
and your hips low."

366
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:48,611
Like this.
Got it?

367
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,071
Yes.

368
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:52,281
Do as I told you.

369
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:08,422
Hey.

370
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,927
"Can you practice with me
after school tomorrow?"

371
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:13,928
Tomorrow?

372
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:15,763
I have extra classes.

373
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:18,724
You'll have to wait.

374
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:20,142
That's okay.

375
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,601
Alright then.

376
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,481
Hello.
Hi.

377
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:28,400
Hey!

378
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:29,276
Hello.

379
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,320
How's baseball going?

380
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:32,071
Alright.

381
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:33,489
Good luck.

382
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:33,781
Thanks.

383
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:34,907
See you.

384
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,625
You're improving.

385
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:51,340
Now I can entrust the team to you.

386
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,632
Win the championship.

387
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,634
Leave it to us.

388
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:04,353
"Go get changed.
I'll wait here for you."

389
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,570
C'mon.

390
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:22,746
I'm really happy to be with you.

391
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:30,171
I like you.

392
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,633
"Are you in love with a guy?"

393
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:18,928
"Even kids in other Deaf schools are talking about you."

394
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,744
Your homeroom teacher is here.

395
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,212
Thank you.

396
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,385
How are you?

397
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:01,761
Are you alright?

398
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:10,479
Everyone is worried about you.

399
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:17,861
"I know what it's like
to love someone."

400
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:24,451
"But our society isn't ready
to accept what you're going for."

401
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:35,714
I understand your pain.

402
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:43,929
"But I'm sure someday you'll find
the right girl for you."

403
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:52,271
"You know, I'm happy
that I got married."

404
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:59,153
"Your mother married your father.
That's why you're here."

405
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:04,824
Don't forget to thank her.

406
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,299
I'm sorry.

407
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:25,466
I owe a lot to Yuri.

408
00:49:25,592 --> 00:49:29,386
Without her, I wouldn't be here today.

409
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:39,021
I'm grateful for having met her.

410
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,404
The pleasure's mine.

411
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:52,992
Do you mind my asking?

412
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:57,997
"So what made you
decide to become a man?"

413
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,918
People always ask me that.

414
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:02,001
In my case...

415
00:51:08,945 --> 00:51:10,404
Are you ready?

416
00:51:11,614 --> 00:51:15,074
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:20,582
You need to get ready.

418
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:27,797
What is this?

419
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,090
Why did you throw it?

420
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,095
What are you up to?

421
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,936
What's wrong?

422
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:43,102
Hey.

423
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:37,033
I was physically a woman,

424
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,994
but has always been a man inside.

425
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:46,542
"Mom never stopped me
from doing what I wanted."

426
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:58,554
"But when I got my legal name
and gender changed..."

427
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:27,917
What's wrong?

428
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:54,110
"To be honest, I don't feel ready yet
to accept you as a man."

429
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:01,576
It's not your fault.

430
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,245
It's no one's fault.

431
00:54:08,247 --> 00:54:12,251
But you've got only one life to live.

432
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:19,802
"And I want you
to live the life you want."

433
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:40,156
"I was really happy
when she told me that."

434
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:44,326
"She gets along with your wife,
right?"

435
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,284
Yeah.
Great.

436
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:03,679
I don't plan on coming out yet.

437
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:08,307
"But now that I'm with my partner,
I've never been happier."

438
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:18,110
"If my parents find out about us,
then, we'll see."

439
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:47,515
Honestly,

440
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,726
Ayumi and I are together.

441
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:02,989
I knew that the moment you got here.

442
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:12,290
But my parents are not happy.

443
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,547
We're all on your side.

444
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:20,965
Right?

445
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:34,812
"I know you're anxious
about your parents' reaction."

446
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:42,820
But remember that we're with you.

447
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:03,422
I love Ayumi.

448
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:12,474
"I just want to be happy with her
like any other married couples."

449
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:08,781
Good morning.

450
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:25,923
Good morning.

451
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:30,510
Did you sleep well?

452
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:32,972
Let's go home.

453
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:51,574
Wait.

454
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:58,998
A rainbow comes after the rain, right?

455
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:03,127
"If there's no rain,
there's no rainbow."

456
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:04,628
You understand me?

457
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,810
It was nice having you. Come again.

458
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,354
Thank you very much.
