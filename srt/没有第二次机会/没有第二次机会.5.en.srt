1
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,835
- Go away! - Why are you running away?

2
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:09,966
Just show me your belly.

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,975
- Let go of me. - Show me your belly.

4
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:23,485
You don't seem like the type,

5
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,586
but how dare you go around sexually harassing women?

6
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:28,626
What? Sexual harassment? What are you talking about?

7
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:31,696
That's not how one should live his life.

8
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:34,326
Be a decent person, got it?

9
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:38,565
That's rich coming from a gold digger.

10
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,336
Unbelievable. Let go of me.

11
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:41,806
Just show me your belly.

12
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:42,965
What?

13
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:46,175
Why on earth should I show you my belly?

14
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:47,906
Let me make myself clear.

15
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:50,315
You're not going anywhere until I see it with my own eyes.

16
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:03,955
I'm known as the head-butter of Anmyeon Island.

17
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,025
You messed with the wrong woman.

18
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:09,396
My gosh.

19
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:14,206
I should do society a favor and smack some sense into you,

20
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,905
but I'll wrap things up here since I'm busy.

21
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:20,375
Consider yourself lucky.

22
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,575
Hey, you. Get back!

23
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,515
What on earth...

24
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:34,756
I'm going to get you one way or another.

25
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:37,956
I'll make you kneel in front of my grandfather...

26
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:39,155
and beg for his forgiveness.

27
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:47,965
Your mom must've shed tears of blood...

28
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,806
while coming back from saying goodbye to your dad.

29
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,745
Yeol Mu, when you grow up,

30
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:58,316
you should be good to your mom.

31
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:00,786
Yeol Mu, I'm here.

32
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,346
He just went to sleep.

33
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,415
Right.

34
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,655
Gosh.

35
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:16,195
I bet it was a hassle watching him all day.

36
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:17,336
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,435
So did you send him off properly?

38
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:21,806
Yes.

39
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,836
Who's gone is gone.

40
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:31,975
You must raise this boy on your own now...

41
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,285
which means you need to be strong.

42
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,285
Hold back all of your tears...

43
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:40,986
and only let them drop once you've put Yeol Mu through school.

44
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,556
Yes, ma'am.

45
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,255
So...

46
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,225
that being said,

47
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:51,935
could we stay here for the time being?

48
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:54,736
I already brought some clothes with me.

49
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,535
Aren't you going back to your hometown?

50
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:59,736
His father and I are both orphans.

51
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:03,375
We have no family in our hometown anyway.

52
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,775
I'll get a job here...

53
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:09,886
and figure out why my husband died...

54
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:12,685
and was wrongfully framed.

55
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,326
According to Eun Ji, she saw on the news that...

56
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,396
It's wrong.

57
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:21,396
He wouldn't have left me and Yeol Mu all alone.

58
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,136
He's not the kind of person...

59
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,065
who'd be that cruel.

60
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,505
(Episode 5)

61
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:41,016
Director Na, how was your first day at work...

62
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,215
What happened to your forehead?

63
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:44,416
That's not what matters right now.

64
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,916
Do you have any idea whom I just met?

65
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,056
Who?

66
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:51,556
Grandpa's...

67
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:54,225
- What? - You know,

68
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:56,725
the lady who demanded to see Grandpa the other day.

69
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,796
- The pregnant lady. - Oh, her.

70
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,236
Did she come back?

71
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,035
No, she's at an inn nearby...

72
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:04,005
That's not what's important.

73
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,176
Anyway,

74
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,875
she's a con artist.

75
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,905
A con artist?

76
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:12,345
I saw her today and her tummy's completely flat.

77
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:15,445
She only pretended to be pregnant.

78
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,786
Just to get him money,

79
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,556
she put on a show and pretended to be with child.

80
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,486
Gosh, we almost fell for it, right?

81
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,526
But you know me.

82
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,395
I knew something was up the moment I saw her.

83
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,835
Shouldn't Grandpa know about this though?

84
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,036
What on earth are you talking about?

85
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,036
You're right.

86
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,645
Considering his age, this'll shock him tremendously.

87
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:49,046
We'll keep it between us for the time being.

88
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,786
Don't worry about this and just focus on your work.

89
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,526
Now that I know,

90
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,296
that woman will never step foot in our house.

91
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,825
Not even a single toe will enter.

92
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,846
What's this smell?

93
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:19,546
I'm boiling some mullet.

94
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,015
What for?

95
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:25,556
I thought Yeol Mu's mom should have some.

96
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,856
Have you ever heard of minding your own business?

97
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:31,096
Mak Rye, you might not know this,

98
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,825
but mullet is best for mothers...

99
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,125
having trouble breastfeeding.

100
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,466
Is that so?

101
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:41,366
Even a sip of it will help promote urination.

102
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:44,036
There is nothing better that can help...

103
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:46,306
with the bloating.

104
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,245
You sound like an oriental doctor.

105
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:50,445
It's common sense really.

106
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:53,046
When my wife had our second child,

107
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:56,085
she went through a lot of trouble because she couldn't produce milk.

108
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,685
I was so upset...

109
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:00,015
that I caught some mullets myself...

110
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,255
and boiled a few in a big pot.

111
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:06,726
The broth turned white like a bone soup.

112
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,866
I told her to drink it which she did...

113
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,536
and the milk started to drop the very next day.

114
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,995
When are you leaving?

115
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:15,265
- What? - You said you'd only...

116
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:18,135
stay the night, but it's been a few already.

117
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,406
This again?

118
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,906
Have you no shame?

119
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,375
But we go way back...

120
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,315
Shut it. It's not like we have good memories.

121
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,085
I'm home!

122
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,585
This is your last warning.

123
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:31,986
Tomorrow, you'll pack up your things and leave.

124
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,565
Is something up? Why is she so angry?

125
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,265
She's not angry at all.

126
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,966
That's her being adorable.

127
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,596
- That's her being cute? - Yes.

128
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,536
Who does it in such a serious way?

129
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:52,005
That's just how Mak Rye is.

130
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:55,046
That charm of hers is worth 100 million dollars.

131
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:57,575
100 million dollars?

132
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:58,575
Right.

133
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:01,945
Imagine having a lark near you.

134
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,515
Squeak, squeak.

135
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,856
Imagine how ducks quack.

136
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:09,226
How she chirps is truly adorable.

137
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,296
Her quacking is worth 100 million dollars?

138
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:12,995
Yes, of course.

139
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,395
- Of course? - Yes.

140
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:33,885
The dress is awesome, but my body is even better

141
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:38,116
Eun Ji, you still have it.

142
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,656
(The 7th Gold Miss Korea Contest)

143
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:54,166
I now have the result in my hand.

144
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,435
Who will be crowned as the woman of the hour?

145
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:00,776
The winner of the 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest...

146
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:03,046
is contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

147
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:04,346
My gosh.

148
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:06,815
Congratulations.

149
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,885
Last year's winner Kim Yu Ri...

150
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,255
will present the crown.

151
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,786
The competition was greater...

152
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,955
in this year's 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest.

153
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,195
The crown goes to Ms. Bang Eun Ji.

154
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,995
What a wonderful night.

155
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:26,036
The new Gold Miss Korea...

156
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,835
will now begin her walk.

157
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:31,406
Please give her a round of applause.

158
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,575
Thank you.

159
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,115
What are you doing here?

160
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:42,286
I was foolish to never realize how beautiful you are.

161
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,185
Please forgive me.

162
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:48,085
Don't you dare rain on my parade...

163
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:49,926
and leave this instant.

164
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:53,126
Please give me another chance!

165
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:59,136
If you want to keep your ribs in order,

166
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,965
you'll get out of my sight.

167
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,345
Thank you.

168
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:16,246
What on earth are you doing here?

169
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:17,955
I'm here to congratulate you.

170
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:22,156
Gosh, you look absolutely stunning today, Room Six.

171
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:25,296
- That's not news. - I knew you were beautiful,

172
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,595
but you're beauty is mesmerizing today.

173
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,796
I don't know if I should say this,

174
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,266
but...

175
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,705
I'm starting to swoon.

176
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:36,806
No, gosh.

177
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:40,176
Don't be. Get a hold of your mind.

178
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:43,906
I have no intention of being anything more than friends.

179
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,115
Eun Ji.

180
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,715
Eun Ji, stop it. Are you insane?

181
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:53,455
Did he have to butt in at the highlight of the show?

182
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,126
I can't keep growing old in a tiny room at an inn.

183
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:04,965
Before I age another year,

184
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,536
while I'm still fresh,

185
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,705
I must get out of here.

186
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,205
I'm trusting you.

187
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,546
Please let me hit the jackpot.

188
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,146
I'm not getting any younger.

189
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:18,975
(QS Beauty Cosmetic Surgery)

190
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,146
- Ms. Park. - Hi.

191
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:21,646
It's been a while.

192
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,786
You've become even more beautiful.

193
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:25,985
It's good to see you too.

194
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:27,585
Is the director inside?

195
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,256
Yes. He's with a patient, but he's almost done.

196
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:31,626
So today...

197
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,666
I'm here for a strong dosage of Botox.

198
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,526
Say goodbye to the wrinkles.

199
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,496
- Please have a seat then. - Thanks.

200
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:41,506
Ms. Park, can I also get a vitamin shot...

201
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,205
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,235
Are you all right?

203
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:47,975
Where are you touching?

204
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:49,605
Are you all right?

205
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,075
Get your hand off me.

206
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,176
Look where you're going, will you?

207
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:54,945
That's why you have eyes.

208
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:59,685
Is this how you were raised?

209
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,126
Why are you being rude?

210
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,585
What?

211
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:07,095
It looks like you had quite the face-lift,

212
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:09,996
but procedures like that will never make you look better.

213
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:13,865
Being polite and kind is what improves your look.

214
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,365
It'll also eliminate the wrinkles.

215
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:18,776
Mr. Gam Poong Ki, the director will see you now.

216
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,136
Sure thing.

217
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,246
Be kind and polite with your words.

218
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:25,746
That'll speed up your recovery.

219
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:26,845
Oh, my.

220
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,185
My gosh.

221
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:34,855
Where did that rude jerk come from?

222
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,195
Gam Poong Ki?

223
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,595
What a silly name.

224
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,695
Why not name yourself ganpengji instead?

225
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,575
Where's Kang Jin Gu's wife?

226
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,306
She moved to Seoul, ma'am.

227
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:58,615
Seoul? Where in Seoul?

228
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,026
Is it because the owner isn't here?

229
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,636
Even the air feels chilly.

230
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:37,786
Hello, everyone. I am the rich and privileged...

231
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,886
Hae Ri Hilton.

232
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,426
Are you Ms. Na Hae Ri?

233
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,725
Yes. Who's asking?

234
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:52,195
I'm Kim Woo Jae, your coach as of today.

235
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:00,575
Hold on.

236
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,845
You can't just leave. What about my lesson?

237
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,416
You don't seem to be ready.

238
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:09,485
Why must I be ready to take lessons?

239
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,725
What's your name again?

240
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,585
It's Kim Woo Jae.

241
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:17,955
Kim Woo Jae?

242
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:19,556
I've never heard of you before.

243
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:21,865
Are you really a pro golfer?

244
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:25,735
Well, it's not like I'm interested in the KPGA, but still...

245
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,065
You can always ask for another coach then.

246
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,636
It's fine. You're all the same anyway.

247
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:35,906
I'll film for a few more minutes, so wait there.

248
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:41,746
I'll be paying by the hour, so don't worry about that.

249
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,315
I'm a pro golfer.

250
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:49,426
I'm only here to help those who truly enjoy the sport.

251
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,626
It's not so that I can earn money.

252
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,965
Why are you laughing?

253
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:01,166
It's obviously a lie,

254
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,705
so it's funny to hear you say it so seriously.

255
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,105
I will consider today's lesson canceled...

256
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,435
and get going then.

257
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,276
It's not like I'm wrong though.

258
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,646
You wouldn't teach me if it were for free.

259
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:14,485
You're here to get paid.

260
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:19,085
I will teach you for free.

261
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:22,626
However, no selfies are allowed during my lessons.

262
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:26,996
Right, no more selfies.

263
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,996
Come on. Let's begin our lesson.

264
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:37,975
Let me take one last selfie though.

265
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,046
Ever since that first day,

266
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:51,485
I truly loved you.

267
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:54,756
You jerk.

268
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,796
Fire!

269
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:05,996
Oh, no!

270
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,335
Where's the water?

271
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:10,935
No!

272
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,735
Is that for Yeol Mu's bath?

273
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,796
Yes.

274
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,176
Thank you.

275
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:55,845
You just had a baby.

276
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,685
You should refrain from carrying heavy things.

277
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,455
Just ask for help anytime.

278
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,626
I'm grateful just to hear that offer.

279
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,185
I'm not just saying it.

280
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,396
Ask me if you need help with anything.

281
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:09,266
Okay, got it.

282
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,666
Call me when you're done. I'll carry the tub out.

283
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,565
Is it really okay for me...

284
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:16,636
to ask such favors then?

285
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,475
You see, my wrists have been aching.

286
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:21,445
Should I get you some medicine?

287
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:22,876
No, it's nothing.

288
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,975
A pain relief patch will do the trick.

289
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,575
Anyway, thank you.

290
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,296
How about a bath?

291
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,695
Yeol Mu,

292
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,335
a bath will make you so shiny...

293
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:50,906
that your father will be shocked...

294
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:52,975
to see you from above.

295
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,006
Right?

296
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:03,985
Where's your mom?

297
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:05,686
Is she sick?

298
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,885
No, not exactly, but...

299
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,956
- My gosh! - What...

300
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,026
Do Hee, what happened?

301
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,425
Well,

302
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,236
I only got a small procedure done.

303
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:24,976
All the time, your skin is cut, pulled, and stitched.

304
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:29,746
Once you recover from that, you do it all over again.

305
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,845
Why can't you just let your face be?

306
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,585
I never had a scalpel touch me.

307
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,446
A string was inserted and then pulled.

308
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,915
The bandages just make it look like a serious procedure.

309
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,686
You're the oldest daughter-in-law.

310
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,655
Instead of caring about the company,

311
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:48,196
all you worry about is your appearance.

312
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,236
Then hand me a subsidiary company just like you did with In Sook.

313
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,395
You don't let me near the company at all.

314
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,565
When I put you in charge of the bakery,

315
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:58,276
people accused us of abusing our powers.

316
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:02,246
Thanks to In Sook's father, we were able to wrap it up quietly.

317
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:05,776
Have you forgotten that you almost humiliated us?

318
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,786
We should just carry on with dinner, Grandpa.

319
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,456
It's not like you succeeded in raising your child either.

320
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,085
What exactly do you do around the house anyway?

321
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,796
Hold on. Are you talking about me, Grandpa?

322
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,026
Father, that's not true at all.

323
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,736
I raised her so that she's as perfect as any other daughter.

324
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:28,306
When Hae Jun went to Harvard to get his MBA,

325
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,736
she went to some hillbilly school...

326
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,675
in the States...

327
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,776
where we practically bought her diploma.

328
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,206
Hae Ri,

329
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,946
do you even know what MBA stands for?

330
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:40,216
MBA?

331
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,946
I do!

332
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,385
What was it again?

333
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,125
Membership...

334
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:52,325
Memory?

335
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,065
No, Most.

336
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,365
- It's Microsoft. - Right.

337
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:04,306
Seriously? Microsoft is a ridiculous answer.

338
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,105
I can't believe we have someone...

339
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,506
so reckless as our Marketing Director.

340
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,516
Hae Jun, go ahead and explain it...

341
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,385
in the English you learned at Harvard.

342
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,885
Right.

343
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:18,385
MBA stands for...

344
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:22,885
Master of Business Administration.

345
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,496
Nice.

346
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,456
We should now eat dinner, Father.

347
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:28,696
The soup will go cold.

348
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:29,865
It's already cold.

349
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:34,865
While holding hands on a picnic

350
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:38,605
We eat cotton candy

351
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:44,675
And who might you be?

352
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:48,115
I'm Kang Jin Gu's wife.

353
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,645
Kang Jin Gu?

354
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,615
He was a victim of the fire that broke out at your storage.

355
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,556
Why did you come to see me though?

356
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,996
My husband...

357
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,395
would never embezzle company money.

358
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:07,296
He would never take his own life either.

359
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:10,135
There must be a terrible mistake.

360
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,605
I came to see you because you're probably the last one...

361
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:16,706
who saw my husband that day.

362
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,175
I didn't see him.

363
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,915
If I had, I would've stopped the fire.

364
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:23,615
He set the fire in secret when no one was around.

365
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,155
When I talked to him for the last time,

366
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,125
he said he was going on a business trip to China.

367
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,296
I don't understand...

368
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:37,296
why he was in your storage instead of at the airport.

369
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,696
Your husband caused me a lot of damage too, you know.

370
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:43,135
My storage burned down and became a pile of ashes,

371
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,635
and I've been questioned by the police.

372
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,335
I'm upset as it is too.

373
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,716
Bak Ha, are you in there?

374
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:54,415
Sure, come on in.

375
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,115
Goodness.

376
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:02,956
Is Yeol Mu sleeping?

377
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:04,585
Yes, he just fell asleep.

378
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:06,895
That's actually great.

379
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:09,196
Geum Hee is treating us to samgyeopsal.

380
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:12,135
Let's go and grease our throats.

381
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,135
Sounds good.

382
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,835
By the way, did you injure yourself?

383
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,806
This was outside your door.

384
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,365
Who is it this time?

385
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,736
Which jerk dumped you so hard that you're drowning yourself in whiskey?

386
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,675
Mind your own business.

387
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,536
I'm quite on edge right now.

388
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:57,875
Three years ago, in that very spot,

389
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,446
you drank whiskey after getting dumped...

390
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:02,446
by Yangji Group's CEO's second son and were taken to the ER.

391
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,085
That's enough.

392
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,556
Who is it?

393
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,526
He's someone who that jerk could never hold a candle to.

394
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,196
He's that decent and amazing.

395
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:22,335
I don't think I've ever loved anyone this passionately before.

396
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:27,075
It does seem serious this time.

397
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:29,706
So who is it?

398
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,315
Just who on earth dares...

399
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:35,216
to make President Na's granddaughter cry?

400
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,216
Who is he?

401
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:37,786
Mind your own business.

402
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:39,385
Is it someone I know?

403
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,825
Compared to you,

404
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,496
he's someone on a whole different level.

405
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:49,165
Someone on a whole different level?

406
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,796
Which family is he from?

407
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,635
Never in a million years...

408
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:57,565
will you be able to guess who he is.

409
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,476
Someone on a whole different level...

410
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:02,946
that I could never guess in a million years?

411
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,645
Which family could he be from?

412
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,085
Is it a "she"?

413
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:15,585
Get out.

414
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,256
- Why you... - Hae Ri...

415
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,556
My gosh.

416
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:36,946
I'm known as the head-butter of Anmyeon Island.

417
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:39,575
You messed with the wrong woman.

418
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,286
How dare you strike my face?

419
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,986
Head-butter of Anmyeon Island, you made a terrible mistake.

420
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:56,365
Thank you for everything.

421
00:23:56,565 --> 00:24:00,165
Thanks to you, my wife and I felt like...

422
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:02,565
we were back in our hometown.

423
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,706
You sound like you're going somewhere far away.

424
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,546
She's right. Are you moving out?

425
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,016
No, that's not it.

426
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:15,716
My husband's just not good with words.

427
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:19,655
Ms. Bok and everyone here...

428
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:23,226
treated us like family which brought us great happiness.

429
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:26,796
We were at our ends with nowhere to go,

430
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,726
but you welcomed us...

431
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:31,996
and treated us like family.

432
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,496
That I'm truly grateful for.

433
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,936
Now this really feels weird.

434
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,105
That was good.

435
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:45,046
- Over here. - Bak Ha, over here.

436
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:47,375
Come on and have a seat.

437
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,516
- I'm glad you're here. - Now that everyone is gathered,

438
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:51,855
let's all have a drink.

439
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,355
Bak Ha, instead of makgeolli...

440
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:57,226
Mr. Choi in Room One boiled some mullet broth.

441
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:00,655
There's nothing's better than mullet...

442
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:03,466
that can help new mothers produce milk.

443
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:06,496
When my wife had our second child...

444
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:15,405
Anyway, just consider it as medicine and drink it all.

445
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:20,075
I'm not worthy of such a priceless dish.

446
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:24,686
Did you say goodbye to your husband?

447
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:26,556
Yes,

448
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:30,186
I returned him to the sea.

449
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,325
You poor little thing.

450
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:41,806
Why are you all weeping in front of well-prepared food?

451
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,635
She needs to be venomous now...

452
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:47,075
in order to survive this world as a single mother.

453
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:49,776
Crying is only for those who have the luxury.

454
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:55,016
Give her a break on a day like this, will you?

455
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,716
Mak Rye, you're always too tough on people.

456
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:03,885
All right, let's really have that drink.

457
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:06,095
Guys, please raise your glasses.

458
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:10,825
Everybody, T.L.U!

459
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:11,996
What on earth is that?

460
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,266
Seriously, Mama Bok?

461
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:15,665
It stands for "Thank you, I love you,"

462
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,635
"and I understand." Okay?

463
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:19,706
- Okay. - Got it.

464
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:21,105
T.L.U!

465
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,905
- T.L.U. - T.L.U.

466
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:25,675
- T.L.U. - Cheers and T.L.U.

467
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:27,645
Bottoms up, everyone.

468
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:29,446
Now let's get the party started.

469
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,016
Go on and liven the mood.

470
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,516
- What are you talking about? - Hurry.

471
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,226
- I must do it, right? - You know you want to.

472
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:37,286
- Wait, what's that? - Hold on.

473
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:39,696
- I'm always prepared. - Thank you.

474
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,095
- Unbelievable. - You can't carry a tone.

475
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:44,325
- Gosh. - You're beat-deaf too.

476
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,405
Don't mess with me

477
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:53,936
Fate, make way

478
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:57,175
I will now

479
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:00,716
And another day passes.

480
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,115
Everyone seems to be laughing,

481
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,726
but my elderly eyes can see...

482
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,996
the shadow cast behind their smiles.

483
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,625
To those exhausted by their brutal lives...

484
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,425
and those who have been hurt,

485
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:21,095
Nakwon Inn should be a port where they can...

486
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:25,236
rest behind closed doors, find comfort, and recharge...

487
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:26,776
for their upcoming journeys.

488
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:30,105
That is probably the purpose of this inn...

489
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,845
and the reason why I'm still alive.

490
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:36,000
And like that, another peaceful day ends at Nakwon Inn.

491
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,414
Five minutes before breakfast!

492
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:50,923
Assemble, everybody!

493
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:54,293
Does everybody eat breakfast together?

494
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:55,793
Of course.

495
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:58,664
If you miss breakfast three times, you'll be forced to leave.

496
00:27:58,664 --> 00:27:59,894
Is that a rule?

497
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:03,164
It's a tradition here since the beginning of Nakwon Inn.

498
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:06,034
Mama Bok was...

499
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:09,433
known to be a great cook,

500
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:13,403
so some people stayed here overnight just for that.

501
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,344
It must be tiring...

502
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,913
to make breakfast every day.

503
00:28:18,943 --> 00:28:22,884
That's why we respect her and treat her like our mom.

504
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,623
By the way, how do you know each other?

505
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:30,924
Mama Bok and you.

506
00:28:31,394 --> 00:28:34,293
My instinct tells me there's something very...

507
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:37,064
I'm sure you weren't just acquaintances.

508
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:39,504
We are beyond just acquaintances.

509
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:43,174
If not, do you think she would have let me move in?

510
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:45,303
We are beyond...

511
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,573
acquaintances.

512
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:50,684
Let's leave it there.

513
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,014
I'll tell you part two...

514
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,553
over a drink.

515
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:57,924
Gosh, can you say a little bit more?

516
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:01,023
Thank you.

517
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,193
Enjoy.

518
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:06,594
Where's Bak Ha?

519
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:08,434
She's not feeling well.

520
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:11,504
She didn't feel well overnight, so she didn't get any sleep.

521
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,564
After she scattered her husband's ashes in the sea,

522
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:16,773
she's finally feeling less tense.

523
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:20,174
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:22,514
Of course, you should be sorry.

525
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:25,784
Do I need to attend to my sick guests at this age?

526
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,553
You need a strong determination to endure.

527
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:35,693
You have a baby. You can't afford to get sick.

528
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:41,133
It's about time.

529
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,663
In a matter of a few days, she lost her husband and gave birth.

530
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:46,534
That was quite eventful.

531
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,034
How's Yeol Mu?

532
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:50,404
Woo Jae is giving him milk.

533
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,543
He's good with babies.

534
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,744
What's bothering you, Bak Ha?

535
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,344
My entire body aches.

536
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:01,983
It feels like somebody beat me up.

537
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:04,923
I'll give you a massage.

538
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,223
Let me know if something feels uncomfortable.

539
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:15,393
You look like an expert.

540
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:19,304
I did this for over 10 years.

541
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:22,133
I'm almost an expert.

542
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:26,244
Why did you quit then?

543
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:29,173
Something happened.

544
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,844
Where did you work?

545
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,353
Guseong Hotel.

546
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,184
Guseong Hotel?

547
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:47,733
Oh, dear.

548
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,263
This is too good to watch for free.

549
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:52,564
This is the last time, Grandpa.

550
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:56,173
She promised not to get any more plastic surgeries.

551
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,874
This is the last time, Father.

552
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:00,043
Please trust me.

553
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:03,443
She's right. Take a chance and trust her one more time.

554
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,383
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,254
I stayed up to go over some documents.

556
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:09,853
Is that right? You must be tired.

557
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:12,184
Join me in my car. Let's go to work together.

558
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,323
Okay.

559
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:19,763
Bye.

560
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,233
Have a nice day, Father.

561
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,633
Have a nice day.

562
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:27,064
Do Hee, I'm leaving for work too.

563
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,844
I don't care.

564
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:31,874
Mom!

565
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,004
You're driving me nuts.

566
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:37,073
Do you know how old I am? Why can't I get plastic surgeries?

567
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:39,013
Pull it together.

568
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:40,614
As soon as Hae Jun returned to Korea,

569
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:42,953
we're being pushed aside.

570
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:46,423
So stop dating useless men.

571
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:48,154
Focus your energy on work!

572
00:31:48,193 --> 00:31:50,754
I have to date men to get endorphin pumping.

573
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:53,393
I need energy to work and study.

574
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:54,464
Guseong Group...

575
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,494
is your dad's.

576
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,604
If you keep dating men and Hae Jun takes the whole company,

577
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,974
your dad will be outraged from up there.

578
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,474
Don't forget how your dad passed away.

579
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:06,773
If you forget, don't consider yourself his daughter.

580
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:08,544
Okay.

581
00:32:08,914 --> 00:32:10,474
I won't let Hae Jun take the company.

582
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,624
Are you going golfing with President Yu in the morning?

583
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:23,924
That's right.

584
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:28,164
Thanks to my grandson from Harvard, I get to golf on a weekday.

585
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:32,703
I have an easy life as an old man.

586
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,234
Leave work to the board members.

587
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:37,843
You should golf and travel. Enjoy your life.

588
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,244
Trust is the mother of deceit.

589
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:42,914
You get caught off guard.

590
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:46,713
You never know when the employees will turn on you.

591
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:47,883
Keep this in mind.

592
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,054
Yes, I'll keep it in mind.

593
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:55,554
(Nakwon Inn)

594
00:32:57,794 --> 00:32:59,763
Oh, dear.

595
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:00,823
What's the matter?

596
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:02,934
Even when I'm feeling good going to work,

597
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,064
I would look at that house,

598
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,203
and it would spoil my mood.

599
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:08,934
Nakwon Inn?

600
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:10,974
What a name.

601
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,703
That inn...

602
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,244
ruins the atmosphere around our hotel.

603
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:17,814
If it was up to me, I would break down that place...

604
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:20,314
and use it as our hotel's parking lot.

605
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:24,254
If he knows that she's staying there, he'll go ballistic.

606
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:30,453
Mak Rye, you're doing the dishes.

607
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,124
Hey, I'll do it.

608
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,693
- You should go rest. - I got it.

609
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:37,494
Stop it.

610
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:39,434
This is my expertise.

611
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:42,674
You do the dishes and boil mullets.

612
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,544
You must have been a great husband.

613
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,773
What? Are you jealous?

614
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:52,083
You still talk nonsense.

615
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:54,484
For the past 50 years,

616
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:57,513
I thought about you every single day.

617
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,283
Look. It's the truth.

618
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:04,924
Stop talking nonsense! Get out of my house.

619
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:15,234
She has 50 years of resentment.

620
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,843
It won't disappear overnight.

621
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:21,314
Okay.

622
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:24,143
Don't rush it. Let's take it slow.

623
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:28,653
What do you mean?

624
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,523
The North Sky Group Project was mine.

625
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:34,153
Why did the management team take over?

626
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:35,554
Well,

627
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,393
it was a direct order from the president's office,

628
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:40,023
so we're not entirely sure.

629
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:41,593
Hey!

630
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:45,934
You got my project snatched out of your hands?

631
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,164
I apologize.

632
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:49,304
Don't apologize.

633
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,304
If this doesn't get resolved, you're fired.

634
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:53,504
Get out! Get lost!

635
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:04,153
(Joint Marketing Initiative with North Sky Hotel Group)

636
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:08,754
Hey!

637
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:11,494
Do you call stealing a fair game?

638
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,064
What's wrong? Calm down.

639
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:16,763
I didn't steal it from you. President Na asked me...

640
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:18,463
to make some progress.

641
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:21,934
To be entirely honest, this project belongs to the management team.

642
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:23,403
What a joke.

643
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,573
I know you talked Grandpa into it.

644
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,713
Do you think he's that easy to convince?

645
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:32,583
You shouldn't insult him as a member of the group.

646
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:33,843
What?

647
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:36,453
I know you're ambitious,

648
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:39,724
but I'm the oldest son of the family. I'm the righteous heir.

649
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:43,294
Hey, you're not the oldest.

650
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,593
My father was the oldest son,

651
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,434
and I'm his daughter. I'm older than you, so I'm next in line!

652
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,773
Let's clean this up...

653
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,643
on our end.

654
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:05,383
I'll give you a subsidiary company,

655
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:08,083
so don't stress over it.

656
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:10,083
Are you going to do this?

657
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,283
You're already having trouble with your boyfriend. Don't stress.

658
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:14,793
Your skin will go bad.

659
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:16,293
- Is this a joke? - Yes.

660
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:23,133
I want to joke around with you.

661
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,663
I don't want a war.

662
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,074
I'm serious.

663
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:44,523
Did you find out?

664
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:48,754
Yes. Jin Gu's wife is staying at Nakwon Inn.

665
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:50,124
Nakwon Inn?

666
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:53,724
It's an old inn behind the hotel.

667
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:57,633
The one that's falling apart?

668
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,533
Jin Gu's wife spoke to the captain of the ship?

669
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:05,944
Yes, she asked whether he saw her husband that night.

670
00:37:05,944 --> 00:37:07,773
She was asking detailed questions.

671
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:08,844
And?

672
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:10,874
He denied everything.

673
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:12,484
Make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

674
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:14,214
- Yes, ma'am. - By the way,

675
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:17,714
is Jin Gu's wife still at Nakwon Inn?

676
00:37:17,714 --> 00:37:19,883
Yes, it looks like she'll be staying there for the time being.

677
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:25,023
Okay. Call me as soon as something comes up.

678
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:28,033
Sure. I'll see you later.

679
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,263
Of all places in Seoul, why there?

680
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,244
Oh, gosh. What?

681
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:56,994
I know her.

682
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,523
She's the second daughter-in-law of Guseong Group.

683
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:00,793
My goodness.

684
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:07,204
- Gosh, this hurts. - Are you all right?

685
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:10,604
Oh, dear.

686
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,504
Your heel got stuck.

687
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,513
Don't bend over.

688
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:17,173
I'll take it out.

689
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:56,683
A beautiful woman like you has to maintain her elegance.

690
00:38:57,114 --> 00:38:58,484
Don't bend over.

691
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,104
Turn back.

692
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:16,834
Turn back.

693
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,043
Turn back.

694
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:20,903
Turn back.

695
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,874
She turned back.

696
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:26,513
She wasn't as difficult as I thought.

697
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:29,354
I can start working on her now.

698
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:36,994
What was that?

699
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:40,124
I sprained my ankle and broke my heel because of him.

700
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,464
He didn't even apologize. He just said something random.

701
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:45,803
What a senseless, rude human being.

702
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:49,074
Where are you staying?

703
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:51,744
I'm staying at my friend's.

704
00:39:54,744 --> 00:39:57,913
If you don't want to see me die, come back to my place.

705
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,643
I told you this already. I need some time.

706
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,783
Sure, I'll give you some time.

707
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,653
But you can think about it while I'm there.

708
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,624
You should take some time while I'm there.

709
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:09,324
Stop being stubborn.

710
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,594
My head is about to explode because of work.

711
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:14,194
I'm about to go insane because of my mom.

712
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:18,263
You have to stay by me.

713
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:19,663
Why are you doing this?

714
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,234
I have nightmares every day.

715
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:27,204
I want to go to the police and confess and ask for forgiveness.

716
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:30,944
You're talking about that again.

717
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:34,614
What changes if you confess?

718
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:36,513
Will that man come back alive?

719
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:37,584
No.

720
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,553
He died, but what about his family?

721
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:43,494
It's not like we started the fire.

722
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:45,224
We didn't kill him.

723
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:47,163
- In the end... - Woo Jae.

724
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:50,063
I fell in love with you because of how genuine you were,

725
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,734
but this is being nosy.

726
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:53,763
Enough is enough.

727
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,234
I will...

728
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,273
find his family and compensate them.

729
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:02,944
He died soon after he got married.

730
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:05,584
I'll find his wife and give her enough money.

731
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:07,114
I'll give her a source of living.

732
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,084
Is that enough?

733
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:12,624
Woo Jae.

734
00:41:12,883 --> 00:41:15,254
Please come back to how you were.

735
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:41,683
Why does she have a newborn?

736
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,783
So she didn't fake the pregnancy? She really had a baby?

737
00:41:45,824 --> 00:41:49,053
(Postal Service)

738
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:51,293
Do you have something?

739
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:54,124
Does Ms. Geum Bak Ha live here?

740
00:41:54,124 --> 00:41:55,494
Yes, that's me.

741
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:58,803
There's a package for you.

742
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,704
A package?

743
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:25,494
What's with your shoe?

744
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,133
There's nearly a hole in it.

745
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:30,194
The heel is coming off.

746
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:32,604
It's all right. I'll fix it with superglue.

747
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:42,313
Jin Gu.

748
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:43,913
Jin Gu.

749
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:46,244
Jin Gu.

750
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:05,504
This shabby uniform...

751
00:43:05,604 --> 00:43:07,964
doesn't suit this perfect body.

752
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:11,574
Eun Ji.

753
00:43:12,143 --> 00:43:14,773
You're committing crime to your body.

754
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:31,923
Ms. Bang Eun Ji?

755
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:40,063
Please return your uniform and go home.

756
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:44,104
I just got here. I'm not done.

757
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:45,844
What do you mean?

758
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,273
One of our members complained.

759
00:43:48,273 --> 00:43:52,283
You sold fake golf clubs. They can't accept you as a caddie.

760
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:57,254
That? I didn't know they were fake when I sold it.

761
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,854
It was considered a mitigating factor by the police.

762
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:04,153
You damaged our golf course's reputation,

763
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:06,063
so please return your uniform...

764
00:44:06,893 --> 00:44:07,964
and go home.

765
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:10,994
You'll get an official dismissal notice soon.

766
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,803
This is really unfair, Manager.

767
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,673
Oh, gosh.

768
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,173
Stop crying.

769
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:24,114
That doesn't change anything.

770
00:44:27,143 --> 00:44:29,553
Was the person who complained...

771
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:31,454
short...

772
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:33,153
with a big potbelly...

773
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:37,053
that was greasy like tuna,

774
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:41,364
and had a wig and dentures?

775
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:48,333
How dare you?

776
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:07,424
Excuse me.

777
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:09,553
Excuse me. Are you all right?

778
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:31,613
Excuse me!

779
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:34,343
You left your golf shoe here!

780
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:41,553
What? It doesn't smell bad.

781
00:45:41,954 --> 00:45:44,194
It smells like flowers.

782
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:54,234
(Nakwon Inn)

783
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:03,313
(Nakwon Inn)

784
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:10,283
Okay, I finally get it.

785
00:46:13,283 --> 00:46:14,884
So...

786
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,853
that's the baby's father.

787
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:19,793
She lied and said it was Grandpa's baby.

788
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,664
Oh, my goodness.

789
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:24,263
The world is going to the dogs.

790
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:27,004
I won't leave them alone.

791
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:36,873
He wore old and worn-out shoes.

792
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:41,043
He couldn't have embezzled public funds.

793
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,813
I'm certain...

794
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,553
something happened.

795
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:51,353
Welcome.

796
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:58,063
What? What's this?

797
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:02,234
How dare you come back here again?

798
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:05,343
You are the one who should be scared.

799
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:06,474
What did you say?

800
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:09,373
So you had a baby.

801
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:13,884
Whose baby is it? Tell me who the father is.

802
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:19,224
You show up and waste my time whenever I'm busy.

803
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:22,123
Why should I tell you?

804
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:27,394
Right? Are you too embarrassed to say it?

805
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:30,763
How old are you by the way?

806
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:33,204
Hey,

807
00:47:33,504 --> 00:47:36,373
what about you?

808
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:39,004
You cheeky little thing.

809
00:47:39,004 --> 00:47:41,303
I don't know what sorts of things you do,

810
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:43,944
but how dare you lie like that?

811
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,283
What is this baloney?

812
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,583
You, get out of here. Leave now!

813
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,684
I won't leave until you tell me. Whose baby is it?

814
00:47:51,984 --> 00:47:54,053
Leave...

815
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:56,853
while I am still nice.

816
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:59,293
Tell me while I am still nice.

817
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,394
Who's the baby's father?

818
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:03,964
And why do I have to tell you?

819
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:14,144
This is your last chance to tell the truth.

820
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,343
There won't be a second.

821
00:48:15,513 --> 00:48:16,914
Who's the father?

822
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,513
Is it the man you're staying with here?

823
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:22,013
Get out. Leave!

824
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:24,954
I was going to report you to the police for sexual assault,

825
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:28,023
but I let it go, and you're doing this again!

826
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:30,394
- Get out! - Hey, look.

827
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,123
How dare you touch me? Let go.

828
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:35,464
I won't let go. Let's go to the police together.

829
00:48:35,464 --> 00:48:37,093
The police?

830
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:38,533
Yes, the police.

831
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:41,634
I'll show you what you get for blackmailing.

832
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:44,533
Hey, let go.

833
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:51,113
Fine. You're on the same side, so let's all go.

834
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:52,644
Who are you?

835
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:54,244
What about you?

836
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:55,783
How are you related to her?

837
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:01,623
Do you want me to answer?

838
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:04,023
You're the baby's father and her business partner.

839
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:05,263
In short,

840
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:07,563
you're a criminal couple.

841
00:49:07,563 --> 00:49:08,664
What?

842
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,833
Was that too direct?

843
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,603
I caught you.

844
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:19,373
You better follow me. Let's all go to the police together.

845
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:21,603
Do you know him?

846
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:23,043
I don't.

847
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,214
How would I know somebody like him?

848
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:28,144
He's mentally unstable.

849
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,154
He's not normal,

850
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,553
so let him go.

851
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,154
Hey, leave.

852
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:34,754
I'm giving you a warning.

853
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:37,194
If you come back here again,

854
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,023
I won't let you go.

855
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:42,793
Sure, I knew you weren't going to come with me,

856
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,363
so I'll leave.

857
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:47,004
I'll go through a formal process to get you arrested.

858
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:51,004
He was like this the last time too.

859
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,674
He kept on rambling on.

860
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:55,414
Attorney Kim, it's me.

861
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:57,444
I need to file a complaint.

862
00:49:57,444 --> 00:50:00,914
He's pretending like he's talking to a lawyer.

863
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:06,724
I need a DNA paternity test first.

864
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:08,154
You punk.

865
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:10,194
- That punk. - Sure.

866
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:11,494
Okay.

867
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:14,394
Yes.

868
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:17,134
That sounds good.

869
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:21,363
All right.

870
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:23,704
It's dangerous to get into an argument with weird people,

871
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:25,134
so don't talk to him. Just avoid him.

872
00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:26,773
Thank you.

873
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:29,843
I'm sorry,

874
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:33,414
but can you stay with Yeol Mu for a bit?

875
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:34,513
Are you going somewhere?

876
00:50:34,513 --> 00:50:37,484
I need to go somewhere. It won't take long.

877
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,224
I'm here to meet President Na.

878
00:50:43,224 --> 00:50:45,053
I told you last time already.

879
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:47,293
You can't see him without an appointment.

880
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:49,363
I must see him.

881
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:52,464
Can you give him a call and say...

882
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:55,004
Assistant Manager Kang's wife is looking for him?

883
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:57,434
That's how it'll proceed.

884
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:58,873
Please give him a call.

885
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:02,043
I need to see him. Give him one call.

886
00:51:02,313 --> 00:51:03,474
What?

887
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:05,113
Is she here to see Grandpa?

888
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:08,283
This woman is out of her mind.

889
00:51:08,283 --> 00:51:09,283
What?

890
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:10,283
Sorry?

891
00:51:11,013 --> 00:51:12,684
I wasn't talking to you.

892
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:14,323
If you don't call him,

893
00:51:14,323 --> 00:51:18,254
I'll wait months until he comes.

894
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:21,623
Are you threatening her?

895
00:51:22,093 --> 00:51:24,934
What? Did you follow me here?

896
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:28,204
Did you come after me?

897
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:31,273
I was going to let this one go,

898
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,904
but this won't do. I'm going to have to call police.

899
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:35,914
Is there a problem, Director Na?

900
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,254
Director?
