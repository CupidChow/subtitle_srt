00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,033
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,660
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:24,829
Did you bring your health certificate?

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,860
Yes.

5
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,039
- Here. - Thank you.

6
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,709
All right. Change into the uniform first.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,480
Okay.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,400
My gosh.

9
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,529
I haven't done this for a long time.

10
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,980
All right. Here I go.

11
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,049
I thought it was very heavy.

12
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,630
What?

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,200
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,900
I'm working here starting from today.

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,939
You work here? Who said so?

16
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,669
I don't know. Probably the person who hired me.

17
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,340
Hang on.

18
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,040
Do you even know my cousin is suffering...

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,180
from an awful headache for days because of you?

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,109
Do I have to know that?

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,419
- What? - I head-butted her for a reason.

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,350
You stay out of this.

23
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,290
"You stay out of this."

24
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,359
You're not showing the slightest bit of remorse.

25
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,730
Don't be ridiculous.

26
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,329
It's your cousin who's at fault. Why would I feel any remorse?

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,169
Don't try to push it with your arms.

28
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,470
You have to tighten your stomach.

29
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,639
You have to push it with your ab muscles.

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,609
Your abs.

31
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,549
- Go ahead and try it. - My gosh.

32
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,880
You're supposed to work here. I don't need your advice.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,350
Go ahead and get back to work.

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,790
Just try it.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,690
- Go. - I'm going.

36
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,339
Why are you smiling?

37
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,109
What?

38
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,940
Darn it.

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,209
What was that?

40
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,359
Woo Jae.

41
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,290
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,600
You must be tired from the match.

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,369
I didn't want you to take the bus.

44
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,000
So I took today off and came here.

45
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,899
You must be flattered.

46
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,399
Of course, I am.

47
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,570
I feel grateful and sorry at the same time.

48
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,780
If you're sorry, just be nice to me.

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,450
Give me a kiss.

50
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,149
Let's go.

51
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,589
I can't wait any longer.

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,730
I should separate them before it gets serious.

53
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,739
Hello. This is Do Do Hee.

54
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,310
It's time to put my money where my mouth is.

55
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,339
Teach him a lesson so he won't overstep the mark again.

56
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:01,010
Do you understand what I mean?

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,450
Hello, viewers of Gam Poong Ki's golf show.

58
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,989
I'm your coach, Gam Poong Ki.

59
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,690
Instead of coming to you from the stuffy indoor driving range,

60
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,290
- I came outdoors today. - Oh, shoot.

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,489
This is crazy. What's wrong with me?

62
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,329
Why can't I stop staring at this cheesy and tacky man?

63
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,760
What's the matter with me?

64
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,300
What am I doing?

65
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,240
What's wrong with you, In Sook?

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,149
Nice shot!

67
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,820
What's wrong with me? Why?

68
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,060
Why can't I stop watching it?

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,630
My gosh.

70
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,930
Your shoulders are too stiff.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Overdoing it with your arms and body...

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,000
doesn't give you more distance.

73
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,570
How many times do I have to tell you?

74
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,139
They say children and golf are beyond a woman's control.

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm trying to do as you say, but it just doesn't work.

76
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
All right.

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,459
Now, you should practice on your head speed.

78
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,029
Let me help you with that.

79
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,099
You should move your wrists like this.

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Again.

81
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,039
It goes like this.

82
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,979
My gosh. What are they doing sticking together in broad daylight?

83
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,810
It goes like this.

84
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,820
If you're done with her, help me with that too, Coach Gam.

85
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,219
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,089
I just started to get the hang of it.

87
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,690
I need more practice.

88
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,289
All right. I'll give you enough lessons.

89
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,060
Please stop squabbling.

90
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,099
Drink some water first.

91
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't want flowers to wither up.

92
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,130
Are you saying we're flowers?

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,570
Gosh, how squalid.

94
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:10,209
Eat this with some coffee when you're hungry.

95
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,209
If I eat this banana,

96
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,779
will I have a crush on you?

97
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,920
- Coach Gam, you are so funny. - Gosh,

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,349
that's just ugly.

99
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,690
All right. Let's try this again.

100
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,260
Watch me one more time.

101
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,899
Hit it.

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,829
Hit it.

103
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,469
That's right. Very nice.

104
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:39,839
That was good.

105
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,110
Let's try that one more time.

106
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,880
If she came here to see me,

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
it means she is interested in me, Gam Poong Ki.

108
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,789
I have a 100-percent accuracy rate of the approach.

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,219
Wow, bingo!

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,029
Room...

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,329
Room Six!

112
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,070
Please. Stop calling me Room Six.

113
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,570
Right, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,510
Where have you been?

115
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,079
I just filmed...

116
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,349
a video clip for the stage.

117
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,349
Is everyone doing well?

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,649
It sounds like you've been away for a month.

119
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,589
You've been away only for one night.

120
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,889
A day seems like a decade.

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,829
They pretend to be pretty when they are not.

122
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,630
And they all try to keep me in check.

123
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,099
I'm so tired of it.

124
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,529
Are you coming to support me tomorrow?

125
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,170
Of course, I'm coming with the people from the inn.

126
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
There will be an on-site popularity vote.

127
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,409
Make sure to bring everyone.

128
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,469
Okay.

129
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,940
I'll make sure to lure people there. Don't worry.

130
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,510
Thank you. I'll be the winner...

131
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,779
and repay your kindness.

132
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,589
- All right. - Ms. Bang Eun Ji.

133
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,149
Yes. Be right there.

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,659
See you tomorrow.

135
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,159
Gosh, it's not going to be easy.

136
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,659
I wonder what makes her so confident.

137
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,269
Gosh, my phone.

138
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,209
- This is calming medicine. - Thanks.

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,339
I'm worried that you might get ill.

140
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,579
You've been doing this from dawn till dusk for five days.

141
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,519
I think you're pushing yourself too hard.

142
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,820
I'm prepared to do this for 50 days, not just for 5.

143
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,249
I have to meet her today.

144
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,890
- We should hurry. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

145
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,329
Run.

146
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,530
What do you mean I shouldn't come back tomorrow?

147
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,129
I was told I could work here for a month.

148
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm sorry. We have a situation in the company.

149
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,499
What situation?

150
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,810
I can't tell you that.

151
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,339
I'm sorry. Here's your pay for today.

152
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,979
Okay.

153
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:02,410
I guess I have no choice.

154
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,420
I should get going then.

155
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,560
What's the situation in the company?

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,890
It's Director Na's order.

157
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,800
Why did Director Na give such an order?

158
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,030
I don't know.

159
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,300
He didn't like the part-timer, so he ordered to fire her.

160
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,369
So are you saying the situation is...

161
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,469
Director Na's order?

162
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:31,079
Gosh, why would you eavesdrop on me?

163
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,839
I'm sorry that I eavesdropped on it.

164
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,780
But this is about my job. I couldn't just leave.

165
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,450
Please excuse me.

166
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,520
Hey, we need to talk.

167
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,829
I heard you're the one...

168
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,829
who got me fired.

169
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,339
You're a director who should focus on something more important.

170
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,280
Why would you even care about a part-timer like me?

171
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,650
Let's not see each other again so I won't care about it.

172
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,020
You can't fire me with no good reason.

173
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,349
You're on a total power trip.

174
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,890
I do have a good reason.

175
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,320
You smashed me and my cousin's forehead.

176
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:22,430
Now that I know about your violence,

177
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,400
I had no choice but to fire you in order to protect my customers.

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
What?

179
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,070
If you can't find a part-time job here,

180
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,009
why don't you go to your hometown and open a gym or something?

181
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,140
There are a lot of taekwondo studios,

182
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,479
but there's no gym that teaches head-butting.

183
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,349
Gosh, it's really rare.

184
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,310
It's a unique business.

185
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,310
Yes, Director Na.

186
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,709
About Assistant Manager Kang Jin Gu who worked at the resort...

187
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,079
Can you get me his resume and work record...

188
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,849
I mean,

189
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,579
please get me all the personnel information data of him.

190
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,820
- Yes, sir. - All right.

191
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,430
Why did you meet her?

192
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,930
She keeps showing up and causes trouble.

193
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,030
I was going to meet with her and talk it over.

194
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,770
And I felt bad for her as a woman.

195
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,940
It's her husband who did wrong.

196
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,540
We don't have to treat her like a criminal.

197
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,879
And she has a newborn baby.

198
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,609
I had compassion for her,

199
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,650
so I wanted to comfort her.

200
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,520
What's up with this kindness? It doesn't sound like you.

201
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,890
Hey, you just don't see it.

202
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,950
But I often buy dinner for people at work...

203
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,859
and take good care of their family events.

204
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm quite warm-hearted.

205
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,530
What is this?

206
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,129
Were you going to give her money?

207
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,170
It's not much.

208
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,140
It's just consolatory money for her baby.

209
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,170
That didn't sound natural.

210
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,310
(Bakery)

211
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,959
You know how good I am.

212
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,259
I know you are the best.

213
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,759
But in a small bakery like this,

214
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,859
we don't need your advanced skills.

215
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,599
People wouldn't even appreciate it.

216
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,670
They just want to buy cheap bread.

217
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,469
- But once they taste my bread... - I'm sorry to say this,

218
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,410
but I can barely make my salary here.

219
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,140
I want to quit several times a day.

220
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,849
I know you're here...

221
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,079
because things aren't so good.

222
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,989
Well... Take this.

223
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,459
What is this?

224
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,410
Honey.

225
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,249
Honey?

226
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,650
With the economy so bad,

227
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,119
everyone is struggling.

228
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,589
Still, this isn't fair.

229
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,690
He can't treat me like someone getting in touch with him for money.

230
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,430
He offered me some money.

231
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,570
Don't be silly.

232
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,999
Don't take it too seriously.

233
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,339
You just met him after a long time, so he wanted to help you.

234
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,410
I have the sense to tell...

235
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:00,410
that he wasn't happy to see me as I opened that door.

236
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,849
I taught him everything from how to strain flour.

237
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,349
I treated him like my young brother.

238
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,030
Mom, I'm home.

239
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,900
What's the matter? Are you sick?

240
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,910
You took the day off. Where did you go?

241
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,749
Woo Jae went out of town for a match today.

242
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,079
I went to pick him up.

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,150
Now you're being his chauffeur?

244
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:43,619
Will you come to your senses?

245
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,390
Why are you yelling at me?

246
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,160
I heard Hae Jun rejected the daughter of SUNMI Group.

247
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,690
I guess his standards are too high.

248
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,329
Then your standards must be a lot higher than that.

249
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,900
What about you isn't better than him that you'd date a guy like that?

250
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,430
Gosh, Mom. Don't touch my face.

251
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,239
Hey, can you get me a headache pill?

252
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,979
- Did you hear me? - Yes, ma'am.

253
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,709
Gosh, my head hurts.

254
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,280
What is taking her so long to call me back?

255
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,560
(Kang Jin Gu's wife)

256
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,259
Why isn't she answering the phone?

257
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,099
Hello?

258
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:31,640
Hey.

259
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,440
You are taking calls today, I see.

260
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,239
It's been a long time.

261
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:36,770
Who is this?

262
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,879
This is Do Do Hee.

263
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,609
Do Do Hee?

264
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,509
Who is that?

265
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,579
We met at Guseong Hotel the other day.

266
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,050
My name is Do Do Hee.

267
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,119
Can I have a moment of your time so we can talk?

268
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,690
Will you excuse us for a moment so we can talk?

269
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,229
I have nothing to talk to you about.

270
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up.

271
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,800
Hello? Hello?

272
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,440
How rude.

273
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,599
How dare she hang up on me?

274
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,009
Did he tell her about my part-time job already?

275
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,310
What? They don't want me near Guseong Hotel?

276
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,150
Bak Ha.

277
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,550
(Nakwon Inn)

278
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,719
I heard you went out of town for a match today.

279
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,320
Did it go well?

280
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,959
I messed it up.

281
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,959
Sometimes you mess up things.

282
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,729
That's how you improve.

283
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:31,999
I guess you're right.

284
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,670
Are you feeling better now?

285
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:39,400
Yes.

286
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,570
Before I got the letter, I couldn't help it...

287
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,680
but doubt my husband.

288
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,680
But now everything is clear.

289
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,879
I don't know who it is, but I'm grateful to the one who sent it.

290
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,089
I'm glad to hear that.

291
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,989
It's cold. What are you guys doing out here?

292
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,690
Hello.

293
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,600
What's wrong with Man Ho?

294
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,299
Did something bad happen?

295
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:13,239
Yeol Mu, you sweetheart.

296
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:16,410
You should grow up tall.

297
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,779
Do you like it?

298
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,680
You seem quite skilled.

299
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,080
I have three children.

300
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,580
How many diapers do you think...

301
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,489
I've changed?

302
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,350
I guess you had a happy married life.

303
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,289
That's why you got three children.

304
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,590
My first love was you, Mak Rye.

305
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,989
And you are my last love.

306
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,259
Every word you say is a lie.

307
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,170
I'm not lying.

308
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,840
I swear as a man.

309
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,299
I'm serious about this.

310
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,509
That's enough.

311
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:50,440
If you keep being like this, just leave.

312
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,940
- We're back. - Hello.

313
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,549
- Yeol Mu, your mom is home. - It's your mom.

314
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,850
Have you been doing well, sweetheart?

315
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,719
Did you have a good time with Mr. Choi?

316
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,019
Hey, he didn't even cry.

317
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,620
And he eats well.

318
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
He's so docile.

319
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,729
Hey, where's Man Ho?

320
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,559
He went to his friend's place and asked for a job,

321
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,759
but he was turned away at the door. He's very hurt now.

322
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,529
He wants to be alone now.

323
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,870
Gam Poong Ki of Room Five is back.

324
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,640
- Hey. - You're home.

325
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,969
Why did you come home so early?

326
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,110
Well...

327
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,940
I need to work on my novel.

328
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,180
So I cancelled all my plans and came home early.

329
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,650
With this.

330
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,850
Gosh, it smells amazing.

331
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:35,650
We should eat it with some drinks.

332
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,160
It's not just a drink but a restorative.

333
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,390
I'll go set the drinking table.

334
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,789
- I'll take care of Yeol Mu then. - Okay.

335
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,989
Hey, Man Ho!

336
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,059
- I'll go bring him. - Will you? Okay.

337
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,170
Gosh, you guys just hit it off.

338
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,739
Eun Ji really likes jokbal.

339
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,239
Actually, I met her at the hotel earlier today.

340
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,610
She asked me to bring everyone to cheer for her tomorrow.

341
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,910
She did?

342
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,749
- Here. - Thank you.

343
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,180
(Tteokbokki, fish cake)

344
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,090
You might get an upset stomach.

345
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,090
Slow down.

346
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,360
I've been eating only vegetables for days.

347
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,019
I'm out of control now.

348
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,259
Gosh.

349
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,630
Hello?

350
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,999
Number Three, where are you now?

351
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,969
Okay. I'll be right there.

352
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Here. Thank you for the food.

353
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,319
Bye.

354
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,650
What's wrong with me?

355
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,920
My gosh.

356
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,660
Gosh.

357
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,200
Are you all right, old man?

358
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,140
Never mind.

359
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,670
If it's serious,

360
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,509
should I call the ambulance, old man?

361
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,180
No. I'm fine.

362
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,809
I just felt...

363
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,809
dizzy for a moment.

364
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,120
My gosh.

365
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,850
Please watch your step.

366
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,459
If you don't feel any better,

367
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,930
make sure to go to the emergency room, old man.

368
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,229
Who is she calling an old man?

369
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,680
Look who's here.

370
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,279
Stop right there.

371
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,680
Wait.

372
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,160
Wait.

373
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,670
My gosh.

374
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,269
Darn it.

375
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,539
- Father. - Father.

376
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,039
Is there something wrong?

377
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,110
What?

378
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,719
I'm not feeling well.

379
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,950
Don't make a fuss.

380
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,850
You should've taken him to a doctor.

381
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,590
I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

382
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,989
Mr. Yang, you may go home.

383
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,200
Yes, sir. Please get some rest.

384
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,299
Hey guys, get out of my room.

385
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,539
- Yes. Goodnight, Father. - Goodnight, Father.

386
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,640
He hasn't been in his office for the past few days.

387
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,440
Where is he going every day?

388
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,580
He's been at the golf course.

389
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,049
- The golf course? - The golf course?

390
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,150
("Gloom of Seoul")

391
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,690
"Gloom of Seoul."

392
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,759
What a fancy title.

393
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,630
Even Baudelaire would be impressed.

394
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,900
Perfect.

395
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,840
You're good at painting, writing,

396
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,239
and even sports.

397
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,779
There's nothing you can't do.

398
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:22,080
Gam Poong Ki.

399
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,219
You're the whole package.

400
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,519
You're so selfish. How condescending.

401
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,819
Now I should take care of my face.

402
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,860
Are you hungry?

403
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,190
Hang on.

404
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,999
Wait for a moment.

405
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,170
- Hello? - Is this Ms. Geum Bak Ha?

406
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,239
Yes. it's her.

407
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,110
Did you apply for a part-time job at Guseong Hotel?

408
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,650
- Yes. - We have a position opening up.

409
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,620
Can you come to the golf course by seven tomorrow morning?

410
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,420
Of course. I'll be there.

411
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,090
Okay. Thank you so much.

412
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,890
Oh, gosh.

413
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,930
Yeol Mu.

414
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,100
It must've been hard, Mom.

415
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,670
I couldn't make it this month because I had a match.

416
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,969
I'm going next month. I'll take you to the hospital then.

417
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:26,979
You didn't get your dialysis? What do you mean?

418
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:30,809
Why would you worry about money?

419
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,219
I'm not a loser...

420
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,749
who can't get his mom her dialysis.

421
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,090
Please stop being so stubborn and listen to your son, okay?

422
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
Are you doing well?

423
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,620
I miss you less these days.

424
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,489
When we were together,

425
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,289
I couldn't love you more.

426
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,120
And I tried my best for you.

427
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,900
So please don't hate me...

428
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,830
even if I miss you any less.

429
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,200
I'm sorry.

430
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,950
Eun Ji of Room Six is sleeping out.

431
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,890
She's staying two days in a hotel to train...

432
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,660
for a beauty contest that she's been looking forward to.

433
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I know it was her last option when she felt hopeless in life,

434
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,630
but I know such good luck is rare for people like us.

435
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,670
In deep darkness like a well,

436
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:02,209
the guests hope to leave for some place fancy and brilliant.

437
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,350
Maybe Nakwon Inn is a rainbow bridge...

438
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,680
that connects the two different places.

439
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,660
My job is to keep the bridge safe...

440
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,690
today and tomorrow,

441
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,160
just like I did yesterday, so it won't tremble.

442
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,860
All clear in Nakwon Inn.

443
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,999
(Nakwon Inn)

444
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,564
(Episode 12)

445
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:52,643
Who is that woman?

446
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:55,243
The golf course is closed today.

447
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:57,213
They are pulling weeds and cleaning.

448
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:59,083
I understand that,

449
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,884
but she can't go around the hotel dressed like that.

450
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:04,683
I know you're working for just one day, but please don't slack off.

451
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,493
Please do your best with your assigned duties, okay?

452
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:10,463
- Yes! - I like the enthusiasm.

453
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:12,194
- First, Geum Bak Ha. - Yes!

454
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:14,194
I like your voice.

455
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:17,204
Bak Ha, please go outside...

456
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:19,804
- and pull the weeds, okay? - Yes.

457
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,533
Are you all right, old man?

458
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,204
If it's serious,

459
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:26,473
should I call the ambulance, old man?

460
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,274
If you don't feel any better,

461
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:30,683
make sure to go to the emergency room, old man.

462
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,984
Old man?

463
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:37,984
It wasn't "mister"...

464
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,794
or "sir".

465
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:43,723
Old man? For goodness' sake.

466
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,404
President Na,

467
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:54,074
the Gold Miss Korea Contest is this evening.

468
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,273
You are presenting the award. You didn't forget, right?

469
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:57,374
I'm tired!

470
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:01,874
How dare she call me an old man?

471
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:08,814
Hello, I'm contestant number one, Moon Ji Hyun.

472
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:10,253
I hope you like me.

473
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:19,863
Hello, I'm contestant number two, Kim Se Na.

474
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:21,794
I hope you like me.

475
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,874
(Gold Miss Korea, Contestant 3)

476
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,913
I hope you don't just like me.

477
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,584
Please see me the way I am.

478
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:48,723
You'll fall into my charms.

479
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,193
Are you ready to dive?

480
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:54,293
Clap.

481
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:57,934
I'm contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

482
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:59,233
Hold, please.

483
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:01,133
Don't try to stand out.

484
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,203
Copy the lines from the other contestants.

485
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,874
I stayed up all night to come up with this.

486
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:09,344
Do exactly the same as the other contestants. Go again.

487
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:21,853
Hello, I'm contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

488
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,663
I hope you like me.

489
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,964
Don't do the hearts!

490
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,633
I can't even do the hearts?

491
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:38,674
You didn't go to work.

492
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,714
Yes, the golf course is closed today.

493
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:45,644
You look pretty natural with Yeol Mu on your back.

494
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:46,913
Of course.

495
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,883
Bak Ha's paying me half...

496
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:52,024
of what she gets paid today.

497
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:54,594
I have to do a good job babysitting.

498
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:57,924
Oh, gosh.

499
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,263
Squeeze blood out of a turnip.

500
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:03,633
Babysitting is a tough job.

501
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:05,703
I can't work for free.

502
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:09,503
Fine. I hope you make money and find a place for yourself.

503
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:14,714
Oh, dear.

504
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:16,584
(Bang)

505
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:23,483
Is the golf course closed today?

506
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,853
Yes, we're cleaning and doing inspections.

507
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:27,924
- Should I look around? - Yes.

508
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:33,663
Yes, sir.

509
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,703
You must be tired babysitting Yeol Mu all day.

510
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,674
I removed the weeds already,

511
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:44,174
so I have to put the balls away. I'm almost done.

512
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:45,804
The contest?

513
00:29:48,174 --> 00:29:50,383
Of course, I'm going!

514
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:53,213
What? I know this accent.

515
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:55,383
Yes, of course.

516
00:29:55,484 --> 00:29:58,354
I'll run home like lightning once I'm done,

517
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:01,124
so please give me a little more time.

518
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:02,753
Sure.

519
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,724
Sure. Talk to you later.

520
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:24,044
Why is he here?

521
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:33,994
Excuse me.

522
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:37,593
I got hurt because of you. Are you running away?

523
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,463
That was a mistake.

524
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,833
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,034
I know this voice.

526
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:47,034
We know each other, right?

527
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:50,343
Am I mistaken?

528
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:53,244
I think you're mistaken, sir.

529
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,343
Please, excuse me.

530
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,784
What? Look who this is.

531
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:03,854
How are you?

532
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,054
I'm not well.

533
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,253
You just attacked me again.

534
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:08,953
I didn't attack you.

535
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:12,724
That wasn't deliberate. That was an honest mistake.

536
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,534
I swear.

537
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:16,034
I'm sure I warned you yesterday.

538
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:18,003
Why are you hanging around the hotel again?

539
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,034
What? I'm not just hanging around.

540
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:22,003
I'm here to earn money for baby formula.

541
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:24,643
Yes, but why would you earn money here?

542
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:26,614
There are part-time jobs everywhere.

543
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:29,374
Why do you care...

544
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:31,544
where I work?

545
00:31:31,744 --> 00:31:34,414
Do you own this hotel?

546
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,153
Bingo.

547
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:39,554
This hotel is mine.

548
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:44,124
Goodness. Stop talking nonsense.

549
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:46,023
How's this hotel yours?

550
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,963
Are you like the owner's son or something?

551
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,164
Bingo.

552
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:51,934
I'm not the son, but I'm the grandson.

553
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,034
- Who is? - I am.

554
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:57,343
Oh, gosh. Lies.

555
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:59,374
No, it's the truth.

556
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:11,224
Are you Kim Woo Jae?

557
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,124
Yes. Why do you ask?

558
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,023
Why do you think we are here?

559
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:18,724
As you can see, we look quite intimidating, don't we?

560
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:19,934
What are you trying to do?

561
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:22,864
You'll find out in a second.

562
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:25,263
Let's get to it right after...

563
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,333
they soften you up first.

564
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:28,934
Go.

565
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,343
- Who are you guys? - For goodness' sake.

566
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:36,914
Stay calm while we beat you up.

567
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:40,513
If you try to resist, you might have to retire early.

568
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,153
Don't make this hard.

569
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,054
What was that?

570
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:48,393
I heard you're a golfer. You're not easy.

571
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:49,554
You punk.

572
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,294
Let's see.

573
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,133
How do that feel?

574
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:57,763
Look at this.

575
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,534
Oh, dear.

576
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:05,804
How dare you date a woman who's beyond your reach?

577
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,974
I wish we didn't have to beat you up.

578
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:10,044
You have to watch who you meet.

579
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:12,343
Know your place.

580
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:13,814
Keep going.

581
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:15,453
Get up.

582
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,453
We're just getting started.

583
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:19,224
How dare you?

584
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,664
This is hot.

585
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:28,593
That was so hot.

586
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:32,833
- What is this sound? - Know your place.

587
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:36,643
Don't even get near her.

588
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:38,744
You'll be accused of sexual assault.

589
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:41,314
Nobody will hire you.

590
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:43,114
Understood?

591
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:45,044
You scumbag.

592
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,383
Isn't that Woo Jae?

593
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:52,224
What do you think you are doing?

594
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:53,494
Stop it!

595
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,333
Sir. Are you okay?

596
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,634
Are you all right? Blood.

597
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:05,134
Look at me. You're bleeding.

598
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:07,573
Keep going where you were going.

599
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:09,774
- That's hot. - Why you...

600
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,414
- You witch. - It's hot.

601
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,044
Is this the police?

602
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,884
I'm by Nakwon Inn.

603
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,054
There are gangsters beating somebody up.

604
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:24,554
Please come now. Right away!

605
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:26,524
She's tiny.

606
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,424
I warned you anyway.

607
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:30,593
Make sure we don't have to meet again, okay?

608
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:32,693
- Hey, let's go. - Leave.

609
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,164
Come to the hospital with me.

610
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,404
I'm okay. It's nothing.

611
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:42,333
What do you mean? Look at your face.

612
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,703
- What should I do? - I'll put some ointment on it.

613
00:34:45,573 --> 00:34:47,613
Then I'll report it to the police.

614
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:48,613
No.

615
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:50,583
You don't have to.

616
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:51,843
I'm okay.

617
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:10,363
Yes.

618
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,934
Did he swear...

619
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:14,873
that he'll stay away from Hae Ri for good?

620
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,203
Okay. Good work.

621
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:33,123
Take my hand.

622
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,654
Take my hand, please.

623
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,564
Do Hee!

624
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:48,103
It looks like you're going on the Miss Korea Contest.

625
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,373
What about Father's reputation? Look at your outfit.

626
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:52,703
What's wrong with my outfit?

627
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:55,343
It looks like you're going grocery shopping, not a festival.

628
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:57,243
Do you wear a suit when you go grocery shopping?

629
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,243
Of course. You don't get it.

630
00:36:02,713 --> 00:36:05,184
She thinks she's a celebrity.

631
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,014
I need calming medicine. Calming medicine.

632
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:35,784
Where is it? It's here.

633
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:49,493
Is it because I'm nervous?

634
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:53,203
Why do I have to go to the restroom again?

635
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:03,213
- Is this new? - Of course.

636
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:05,014
Oh, dear.

637
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:13,323
Excuse me. Don't you see the line?

638
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:16,764
I'm sorry, but I'm a contestant for the Gold Miss Korea Contest.

639
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:18,064
I'm in a hurry.

640
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,193
Who's not in a hurry here?

641
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,164
Don't think about cutting in line.

642
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:25,703
- Line up behind us. - I'm really sorry,

643
00:37:25,863 --> 00:37:28,573
but the contest is starting soon.

644
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:32,504
Please, excuse me.

645
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:52,093
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

646
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:55,664
How could you rip my dress?

647
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,164
We didn't rip your dress.

648
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,564
It was your mistake.

649
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:01,873
You just stepped on my dress.

650
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,134
I didn't.

651
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,573
Did you step on her dress?

652
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,774
No.

653
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,873
What do I do with my dress?

654
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:12,514
I have to be in the contest. What do I do?

655
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:14,213
Tell me.

656
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:16,514
How's this nothing?

657
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:18,384
You got beat up everywhere.

658
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:22,953
I'm sorry for startling you, Ms. Bok.

659
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:24,823
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:27,093
What do you do out there...

661
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:29,863
to get beat up like that and won't let us report it to the police?

662
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,254
Why is he not picking up?

663
00:38:50,524 --> 00:38:52,083
Is he still practising?

664
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:57,764
This is not the 19th century.

665
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:00,363
Why would you hold an old-fashioned event like this?

666
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:04,863
Grandpa has a unique taste.

667
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,174
- Hello. - Hello.

668
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,073
There's one more person with a unique taste.

669
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:14,674
Hae Ri.

670
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:18,514
Gosh, what is the matter with her?

671
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:32,164
We'll now begin...

672
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,894
the 7th Gold Miss Korea Contest.

673
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,534
I shouldn't have gone to the restroom.

674
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:45,904
This is bad luck. Goodness.

675
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:53,144
You're going on stage in two minutes. Stand by.

676
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:54,654
Okay.

677
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:06,093
Contestant number one, Moon Ji Hyun.

678
00:40:09,794 --> 00:40:13,233
Hello, I'm contestant number one, Moon Ji Hyun.

679
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:14,703
I hope you like me.

680
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:18,473
Following is contestant number two, Kim Se Na.

681
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:22,414
Hello, I'm contestant number two, Kim Se Na.

682
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:23,814
I hope you like me.

683
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:30,014
Following is contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

684
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,394
I think she's the woman we saw in the restroom.

685
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:42,564
How annoying.

686
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:44,034
I hope she sprains her ankle.

687
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:48,034
You should be a fortune teller.

688
00:40:56,343 --> 00:41:00,083
Hello, I'm contestant number three, Room Six.

689
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,613
I hope you like me.

690
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:06,884
What's "Room Six"?

691
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:11,924
She said the room number of her hotel room.

692
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:16,534
She must be nervous. Please give her a round of applause.

693
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:21,973
I'm an idiot.

694
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:23,603
I'm such an idiot!

695
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,573
My instinct tells me...

696
00:41:28,774 --> 00:41:33,514
this is a lovers' quarrel between a man and a woman.

697
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:36,514
He got beat up, and he won't even say a thing.

698
00:41:36,713 --> 00:41:40,754
It's something he can't talk about.

699
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:44,463
I think he had an affair with a married woman...

700
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:45,963
and got caught.

701
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,363
That's unbelievable!

702
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:51,304
Woo Jae is a good person. He goes by the book.

703
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:52,703
He won't do something like that.

704
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:57,544
I don't think you know.

705
00:41:57,644 --> 00:42:01,514
Those who look like good people and go by the book...

706
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:03,613
usually cause big trouble.

707
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,613
Stop talking nonsense!

708
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:11,823
He's much calmer now. He's going to try to sleep.

709
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:16,193
By the way, what do we do about Eun Ji?

710
00:42:17,593 --> 00:42:19,794
Shouldn't we go now?

711
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:22,634
But I'm still shocked.

712
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:25,804
I'm drained. I don't' think I can go.

713
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:33,504
You are...

714
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:36,413
past the expiry date.

715
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:39,544
It's time to dispose of you.

716
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:42,954
Oh, my.

717
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:50,423
President Na, it's time to present the award.

718
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:51,893
What?

719
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:58,004
Do I have to go?

720
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:03,573
- Let's go. - What if it's over already?

721
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:06,073
If we go now, we'll make it there for the result announcement.

722
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,214
All right.

723
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,873
Will you be okay?

724
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,843
I won't die.

725
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:12,343
Let's grab a taxi.

726
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:18,183
We'll now announce the two finalists...

727
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:21,893
for the Gold Miss Korea Contest.

728
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:25,593
First is contestant number 13, Lee Jin Ah.

729
00:43:36,474 --> 00:43:39,403
The other finalist is...

730
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:42,673
contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

731
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:46,244
- What? - Congratulations.

732
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,514
I'll treat you to dinner.

733
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:53,123
- Hey. - Excuse me, Eun Ji.

734
00:43:53,123 --> 00:43:56,093
- You're not the winner yet. - I know.

735
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,994
- Please come up. - I'm sorry.

736
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:02,933
I'm sorry. Sorry.

737
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,264
What? Is she drunk?

738
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:13,143
The winner of the Gold Miss Korea Contest...

739
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:15,173
will be announced by the President of Guseong Hotel,

740
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:20,343
Mr. Na Wang Sam, who is the sponsor of this contest.

741
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,314
Please go on the stage, sir.

742
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:40,804
Oh, my goodness.

743
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:43,873
- Are you all right, sir? - Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

744
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,204
Look who it is.

745
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:49,573
Who will become Cinderella tonight?

746
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:53,954
The winner of the 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest.

747
00:44:56,153 --> 00:45:00,593
President Na Wang Sam will announce the result.

748
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:04,823
(Winner of the 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest)

749
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:06,423
(Number 13, Lee Ji In)

750
00:45:06,764 --> 00:45:07,764
What?

751
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:15,333
The winner of the 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest.

752
00:45:21,774 --> 00:45:23,244
Goodness.

753
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:26,784
- What's the matter with him? - Is he not feeling well?

754
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:29,383
Maybe he can't see without his reading glasses.

755
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:31,623
No, his vision is not that bad.

756
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:34,294
President Na,

757
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:36,054
if you take too long,

758
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:39,363
the finalists might pass out.

759
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:41,633
Please make the announcement.

760
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:47,133
The 2019 Gold Miss Korea Contest.

761
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,903
The honourable winner is...

762
00:45:54,913 --> 00:45:57,784
contestant number 13, Lee Ji In.

763
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:10,423
As the sponsor of the Gold Miss Korea Contest.

764
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:13,294
President Na Wang Sam of Guseong Hotel will...

765
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:16,363
crown the new Cinderella...

766
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:18,903
of the night.

767
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:20,304
Please go ahead.

768
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:48,264
I think President Na is...

769
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:49,964
slightly nervous.

770
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:51,504
The winner of the contest is not...

771
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:53,764
contestant number three, Bang Eun Ji.

772
00:46:53,764 --> 00:46:57,173
It's contestant number 13, Lee Ji In.

773
00:47:00,244 --> 00:47:02,413
You're the winner...

774
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:05,083
in my heart.

775
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:29,004
Here it is.

776
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:31,044
Is it over already?

777
00:47:31,044 --> 00:47:32,504
Let's go inside first.

778
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:33,843
Go inside.

779
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,173
Oh, dear. Coach Gam.

780
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,244
What brings you here?

781
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:41,913
- We're here to watch. - Please go ahead. I'll join you.

782
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:53,024
What a filthy world where only winners get recognized.

783
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:58,264
Please escort him.

784
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:03,833
How can a perfectionist like you...

785
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,774
make such a mistake?

786
00:48:05,774 --> 00:48:08,673
It's cold, and you played too much golf.

787
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:11,484
You should take a break from golf for the time being.

788
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:13,413
Are you all right, Grandpa?

789
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:15,683
What? Of course.

790
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,444
Who are these punks?

791
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:40,643
I'm glad I ran into you.

792
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:42,274
Calm down. Our elders are present.

793
00:48:45,143 --> 00:48:46,583
How dare you?

794
00:48:47,284 --> 00:48:49,484
You meet your enemies at the worst place and time.

795
00:48:49,484 --> 00:48:51,054
I'm glad I ran into all of you.

796
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:52,954
I agree.

797
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:56,823
You meet your enemies at the worst place and time.

798
00:48:57,224 --> 00:49:00,064
I'm glad I ran into you, Wang Sam.

799
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:01,064
I know.

800
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:03,194
It's been a while.

801
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:06,633
It's been 50 years since we last saw each other.

802
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,474
Let's have a drink another time.

803
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:17,314
Do I look like somebody who would have a drink with you?

804
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:19,714
You brat.

805
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:21,314
- Don't do that. - What's wrong?

806
00:49:21,314 --> 00:49:23,514
- Sir, please calm down. - Let go.

807
00:49:23,514 --> 00:49:25,823
I said let go. Let go.

808
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:27,724
He and I have unfinished business.

809
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,853
You brat.

810
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:30,863
Oh, dear.

811
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:32,823
Is this old man out of his mind?

812
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,734
He's not out of his mind. Watch your mouth!

813
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:35,994
Stop talking nonsense.

814
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:37,863
Stay out of this.

815
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:39,464
Is he your husband?

816
00:49:39,704 --> 00:49:42,734
I don't think he's in his right mind. Take him to the doctor.

817
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:44,704
You obnoxious witch.

818
00:49:44,704 --> 00:49:46,403
You are twisted like a snake.

819
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:48,343
Stop talking rubbish.

820
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:51,284
Wang Sam should go see a doctor. Do you understand?

821
00:49:51,284 --> 00:49:54,044
That's harsh, sister.

822
00:49:54,044 --> 00:49:55,113
"Sister"?

823
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:03,323
How am I your sister? I don't have a brother like you.

824
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:04,623
What are they up to now?

825
00:50:04,994 --> 00:50:07,863
They're the ones who ripped my dress.

826
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:11,764
We have a lot to sort out.

827
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:13,534
Where should we start?

828
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:15,403
I have nothing to say.

829
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:16,573
Let's go.

830
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:17,643
Sir.

831
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:20,444
Don't try to slip away like a loach.

832
00:50:20,544 --> 00:50:23,014
- What's going on? - You haven't changed.

833
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:25,183
- Goodness. - He won't listen.

834
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:26,284
Security!

835
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:28,883
- Where's security? - It's Director Oh In Sook.

836
00:50:28,883 --> 00:50:30,583
- Security! - Where's security?

837
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,524
I'm glad I ran into you.

838
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:41,863
Go!

839
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:43,333
Security!

840
00:50:44,163 --> 00:50:45,964
Hey, worthless women!

841
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:13,194
(Special thanks to Heo Cham for the cameo appearance)

842
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:15,194
Let's not run into each other again.

843
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,704
You never know with people.

844
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:19,903
Mr. Kang Jin Gu's wife...

845
00:51:19,903 --> 00:51:22,004
lives at the same house as me.

846
00:51:22,004 --> 00:51:24,474
I'm still young. I'm in my prime.

847
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:26,573
Do you want to see tonight?

848
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:28,113
Stop it.

849
00:51:28,444 --> 00:51:29,814
This shoe belongs to you.

850
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:33,343
I'll call you Cinderella Eun Ji from now on.

851
00:51:33,984 --> 00:51:36,184
Hold on. Aren't you Mr. Son?
