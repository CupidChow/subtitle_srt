00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:15,487
Wait a minute.

3
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,988
You are Mr. Son, right?

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,127
You have the wrong person.

5
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,427
Wait a minute!

6
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:27,227
Please talk to me. It will only be a minute.

7
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:30,537
You can't go!

8
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:38,178
Hey. Wake up.

9
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,108
Open your eyes!

10
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,218
Wake up, will you?

11
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,288
She doesn't seem to be injured, so why did she pass out?

12
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,288
Hey, wake up.

13
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:54,428
Hey!

14
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,688
My gosh.

15
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,998
Unbelievable.

16
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,197
Are you all right?

17
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:03,568
Where did the car go?

18
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,498
To where it was heading. How should I know?

19
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,338
Why would you let it go?

20
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,707
Is this what I get for helping you?

21
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:14,048
I'm positive that it was Mr. Son.

22
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:19,948
Talk about being ill-fated.

23
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,987
Nothing good happens when she's involved.

24
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,127
That was a close call.

25
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:31,198
That peanut of a woman sure can be bold sometimes.

26
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,638
Sure thing. Stay safe and we'll talk again soon.

27
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,608
What are you doing here unannounced?

28
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:43,668
Ta-da.

29
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,707
What's all this?

30
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,548
Goodness, it smells amazing. Come and have a seat.

31
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:53,248
I wonder what this is.

32
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,317
What did my son get for me?

33
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:00,157
What's with the underwear?

34
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:03,487
It's what you traditionally buy with your first salary.

35
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,957
That's why I chose something decent.

36
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,728
So, do you like it?

37
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,897
Goodness. My gosh.

38
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:13,397
Can you pass me a tissue?

39
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,707
Gosh, why on earth are you crying?

40
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,508
Oh, dear. How silly of me.

41
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:24,478
Receiving this from you...

42
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,717
made me realize that I didn't live my life in vain.

43
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,687
These are happy tears. I'm just that delightful.

44
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,598
Gosh, Mom, please stop.

45
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:41,367
- Let's see if it suits you. - Gosh, are you out of your mind?

46
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,138
I can't believe you're teasing me.

47
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:45,798
Mom.

48
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,207
You're still young and pretty.

49
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,578
So leave the company to me now...

50
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:55,008
and spend some time with someone nice.

51
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:56,908
Really?

52
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,247
Hold on. Are you already seeing someone?

53
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,378
Gosh.

54
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:03,288
I still can't believe I gave birth to a masterpiece.

55
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:07,057
My sweet boy. You're the apple of my eye.

56
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,427
Thank you for this.

57
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,828
Let go!

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,027
I said you need to make an appointment.

59
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,628
- What's going on? - I tried to stop her,

60
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,897
- but... - The man who just left.

61
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:20,267
It's Son Byeong Gi, right?

62
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,837
- What are you talking about? - Just a moment ago,

63
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:25,337
I ran into Director Son Byeong Gi.

64
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,138
Wasn't he here to see you?

65
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:29,908
Director Son Byeong Gi? No.

66
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,747
No?

67
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,017
You saw him too, right?

68
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:42,228
He was the one driving that car.

69
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,858
I never saw his face.

70
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,158
I'm positive that it was Son Byeong Gi.

71
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:48,497
Are you sure he wasn't here to see you?

72
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,897
You're probably mistaken.

73
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,837
I don't have any personal connections with him,

74
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,508
and we're not doing any business together.

75
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:58,378
Why would a former employee be here to meet me?

76
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:02,177
Anyway, why are you hoping to meet him though?

77
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,918
I'm sure he's involved in my husband's death.

78
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:08,487
I want him to tell me what happened to my husband.

79
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,617
I didn't meet with Son Byeong Gi,

80
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,388
so please leave my office.

81
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,858
You say you don't know him well,

82
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,497
but yet, you know he quit his job.

83
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,538
What?

84
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:26,497
Please let me check the security cameras.

85
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,338
- That's enough. - I'm positive...

86
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,807
I saw Son Byeong Gi.

87
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,978
But here you are saying that you never met him,

88
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,278
so I must check to be sure.

89
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,478
Are you calling Ms. Oh a liar?

90
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,048
The CCTV footage will reveal whether she's lying or not.

91
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,518
Look here, lady.

92
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,687
How dare you barge in here with these accusations?

93
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,088
Lower your voice.

94
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,257
Let her see the CCTV footage.

95
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:51,398
The cameras have been out of order since last evening.

96
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,327
I called to have them fixed.

97
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,028
That's unfortunate.

98
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,237
Apparently, the cameras are out of order.

99
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,487
Consider this a warning.

100
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,458
Don't you ever be that rude to Ms. Oh again.

101
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,757
It was Director Son.

102
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,057
I don't care.

103
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,858
I honestly couldn't care less.

104
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,598
Just don't ever be rude to Ms. Oh like that again.

105
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,067
I won't just stand by next time.

106
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,268
Ms. Oh said she doesn't know, so that's the truth.

107
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:35,367
She also said she didn't meet him, so she didn't.

108
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,908
There's no reason for her to lie to you.

109
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,117
If you wish to keep your job,

110
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,288
you should probably stay clear from mentioning your husband.

111
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,617
I won't say this again.

112
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,827
The man I love just died one day,

113
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,658
but I don't know why.

114
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,468
So how can I not do anything?

115
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:08,408
If you were in my shoes, could you?

116
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,398
You!

117
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,908
Did you deliver the files properly?

118
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,077
Yes.

119
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,278
You know, you should quit when I tell you nicely.

120
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,348
I honestly don't know why my mom hired you as an assistant,

121
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:54,887
but anyone with a conscience...

122
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,418
would've refused the job.

123
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,418
How can you work here...

124
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,987
considering what your husband did to this company?

125
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,257
My husband...

126
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,028
isn't the kind of man to do such a thing.

127
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:09,627
Then what? Are you saying he was framed?

128
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,237
The truth will eventually be revealed.

129
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,208
I'm not done...

130
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,408
Hey!

131
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:21,908
What now?

132
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:24,117
I want her fired!

133
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,718
Even though her superior is talking to her,

134
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:27,918
she always has the last word.

135
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,648
That's not your ordinary hillbilly.

136
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,588
She's trying hard to raise a baby on her own without the father.

137
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:38,927
Just let it go this once.

138
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:40,228
What?

139
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,197
Are you seriously taking her side?

140
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:43,697
It's not like that.

141
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,538
Is there something else going on?

142
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:48,608
- What do you mean? - It there another reason...

143
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,038
for you hating her?

144
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:52,478
Nonsense.

145
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,348
Then just let her be for now.

146
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,617
It's annoying how she reminds me of that day.

147
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,588
Unbelievable.

148
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:22,137
Being at the office all day is tougher than I thought.

149
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:26,978
Gosh, it's boring.

150
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:30,747
- Ms. Do. - What is it?

151
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:36,687
There's something that needs your immediate attention.

152
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:39,288
My immediate attention?

153
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:43,727
Can you look into Mr. Son Byeong Gi?

154
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:46,158
Director Son Byeong Gi? Who's that?

155
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:52,668
The chatter here and there makes the neighborhood feel alive.

156
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,337
Goodness.

157
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,508
I can almost smell the ocean.

158
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,508
Mak Rye, here are some oysters.

159
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,947
Why don't we get some?

160
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:07,587
It's good with sliced pear and radish.

161
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:11,357
You can also make some delicious pancakes...

162
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,587
- Sounds great, right? - We'll take 1kg of oysters.

163
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,957
Sure, 1kg of oysters coming up.

164
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,857
Wait, those are sand eels.

165
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:21,467
Imagine grilling those with coarse salt on top.

166
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,827
Delicious, right?

167
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,168
You seem to know your fish.

168
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:26,798
That doesn't even cut it.

169
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,067
People call me Mr. Ocean.

170
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:32,077
Give me a fishing rod and I'll...

171
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:34,138
They're all there. Sea bass, yellowtail,

172
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:36,077
mackerel, skate, shark...

173
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:38,018
Wait, probably not the shark.

174
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,778
Halibut... I've caught ones that are the size of my thighs...

175
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,817
and a variety of them too.

176
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,888
That's enough. Stop it.

177
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:49,628
I'll grill these sand eels for you, so let's buy some.

178
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,898
Have you been starving? Why can't you contain yourself?

179
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:57,097
Your husband must be a great help around the house.

180
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,168
He's not my husband.

181
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:02,437
So that the kids can join us,

182
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,538
let's buy plenty.

183
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:07,408
I'll grill them perfectly...

184
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:10,107
and put them on the table, honey.

185
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,288
Unbelievable.

186
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:16,918
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:18,658
How dare you pretend to be my husband.

188
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:21,227
I didn't lie on purpose.

189
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,758
The fishmonger thought we were married so...

190
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,128
You swindler. Everything you say is a lie.

191
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,298
It was just a harmful joke.

192
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,638
There's no need to get angry over it.

193
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,337
I already saw through you when you pretended...

194
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,738
to be a fortune teller at the police station.

195
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,437
What did you do before you landed at my inn?

196
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,418
The lady thought we were married...

197
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,677
and that elevated my mood.

198
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:49,488
I guess I went a little overboard,

199
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,687
but you never know what the future holds.

200
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,628
We might end up together soon...

201
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:57,288
as a married couple.

202
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,758
Are you insane?

203
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,028
Do you have dementia or are you delusional?

204
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,697
Look where you're hitting.

205
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,837
It's a joke, all right?

206
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,837
That's not something you should joke about.

207
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,707
I can't believe your antics.

208
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,607
I want you gone from my inn.

209
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:15,508
- Why you... - Chairman Choi.

210
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,118
Sir, were you out somewhere?

211
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,248
Chairman?

212
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:27,217
You see, he used to...

213
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:31,957
play soccer in the soccer club I was once the chairman of.

214
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:37,097
Gosh, it's been a while. How did you know I was here?

215
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,937
We should probably catch up,

216
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,268
so head inside first.

217
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,378
- Let's talk. - Right.

218
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,278
Wasn't he the one who insisted we grill fish this evening?

219
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:56,187
He doesn't seem like a soccer buddy though.

220
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,628
My gosh. It's sand eel.

221
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:06,057
Imagine grilling these with salt sprinkled on top.

222
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,467
Amazing.

223
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:12,298
How is it that the tenants here have high standards...

224
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,937
when it comes to food?

225
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,677
So Mama Bok, what happened between you...

226
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,677
and President Na of Guseong Hotel to make him your enemy?

227
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,148
When I saw him at the Gold Miss Korea Contest,

228
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:31,357
he seemed sweet and gentle.

229
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,488
A person like him should be shoved in a pot of doenjang...

230
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,998
with all his limbs tied up...

231
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,827
so that he'd finally learn his lesson.

232
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:45,168
So tell me why he deserves that.

233
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,738
What's it to you anyway?

234
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,967
Oh, well...

235
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,038
I just got curious, that's all.

236
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,077
- Hello? - Ms. Bang, it's me.

237
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,648
Gosh. Yes, hello.

238
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:02,317
I'll call you back in just a second.

239
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:15,898
Did you receive the dress and shoes I sent?

240
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:19,038
I took them since you gave them to me,

241
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,638
- but this is out of the blue. - Well...

242
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,967
There's an event I'm supposed to attend this evening,

243
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,337
and I was hoping you'd join me.

244
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,807
Are you free today?

245
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,177
Yes, I am but...

246
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:34,618
Then I'll call you when I come to pick you up at 7pm.

247
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,817
Yes, sir. I'll see you later.

248
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,868
A dress of this caliber means that he's taking me...

249
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,498
to a soiree for rich people I see in movies.

250
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:56,937
Yeol Mu,

251
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,648
this must finally be the day I debut in high society.

252
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:04,748
Peekaboo.

253
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,548
There you are.

254
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:11,018
The man you saw at the gallery was Director Son Byeong Gi,

255
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,557
but Ms. Oh lied and said you were wrong?

256
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:16,087
Yes, it's the man I saw in the photo.

257
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:17,898
- Are you sure? - Yes!

258
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,697
I'm really good at noticing these things.

259
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,327
So Mr. Son is involved in your husband's death?

260
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:26,238
Yes, I'm sure of it.

261
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,538
If not, why did he run at the sight of me?

262
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,977
- Mom! - My gosh.

263
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,177
Why are you here instead of doing your work?

264
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,477
I just can't make sense of it.

265
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,947
How can you hire someone like her as your secretary?

266
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,717
- It's my call. - I won't have it.

267
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,217
Fire her immediately!

268
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:47,187
Shut it. You don't know what you're talking about.

269
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,327
- You'll never... I'm going to... - Get out.

270
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,658
You're dead!

271
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,498
Gosh.

272
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,038
How can no one in this family be normal?

273
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,467
Good shot!

274
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,278
Nice shot.

275
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:08,008
The tip you gave me definitely helped.

276
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,378
- Nice. - Goodness.

277
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,717
Would you please excuse me?

278
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:13,618
Nice one.

279
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,217
Hi, Hae Ri.

280
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:17,288
I'm seconds away from dying from frustration.

281
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,288
Why? Is something up?

282
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,888
I never said anything since you'd worry,

283
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,857
but Kang Jin Gu's wife works here as my mom's secretary.

284
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:28,227
You're shocked too, right?

285
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:30,697
My mom's crazy for hiring such a person,

286
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,097
and I don't get why that hillbilly even took the job.

287
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:35,607
Her husband embezzled company money...

288
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,368
and caused us a lot of trouble.

289
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,577
How selfish is she to agree to work here?

290
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,847
Hae Ri, you see...

291
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,918
Mr. Kim, come on. You're up.

292
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,177
Right.

293
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,817
I'm on the golf course right now, so I'll call you later.

294
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,658
All right. Here you go.

295
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,967
It's on Tuesday at 8:30pm.

296
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,528
The book release isn't anything grand.

297
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,967
I'll be inviting some people I know...

298
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,607
to enjoy snacks and talk.

299
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:12,937
So in other words, it'll be like your fan meet-and-greet.

300
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,908
A fan meet-and-greet? That's absurd.

301
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:18,778
You're popular enough to throw one.

302
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,847
People are calling you Alain Delon of the golfing world.

303
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,488
Isn't Alain Delon an old man now?

304
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,087
I'd rather prefer Jude Law.

305
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,758
Jude Law? Who's that?

306
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:31,727
Hold on. He looks awfully familiar.

307
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,398
- He's a Hollywood actor. - How about a movie...

308
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,927
All the plastic surgery won't save you.

309
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,898
Having a good heart and saying nice things...

310
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,567
will improve your look...

311
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,008
and prevent any wrinkles.

312
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:44,238
We should study literature. Literature and art!

313
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:45,837
It's him from the clinic.

314
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:47,837
You over there.

315
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:48,878
Yes, ma'am?

316
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,707
Is he a member at this club?

317
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,577
Coach Gam?

318
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,748
No, he's the most popular golf instructor at our club.

319
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:01,758
Anyway, you're as handsome as any movie star.

320
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,587
Of course, I'll teach you.

321
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,198
Boy, am I glad to see you.

322
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,567
I hear you wanted golf lessons.

323
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,178
Hello, I'm Coach Gam Poong Ki.

324
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,948
I look forward to training with you.

325
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,788
The shock on your face...

326
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,488
tells me that you remember me.

327
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,887
I apologize for my actions that day.

328
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:40,958
I truly am sorry.

329
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,097
Whatever. Just sign me up for some lessons.

330
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:50,268
I've had a surge in clients lately that...

331
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,708
I don't have any empty time slots.

332
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,478
Are you refusing to teach me?

333
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,548
Of course not.

334
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:58,178
The remaining time slots aren't good, that's all.

335
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,448
It's against the law for cabs to refuse customers.

336
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,988
The same goes for golf lessons.

337
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:06,218
A coach refusing to teach a member of the club?

338
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,258
You'll be fired.

339
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:11,528
I never said no. Of course, I'd love to teach you.

340
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:14,258
I'll do my best although I lack in many ways.

341
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,097
If I can't break 80 after one month,

342
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,768
you'll pay.

343
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,907
What do you break currently?

344
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,778
I break 99.

345
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,577
Jim Bishop once said this.

346
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,688
"Pro golfers are like optimistic doctors who say..."

347
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,557
"they can cure incurable diseases."

348
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,627
I may be somewhat of an expert in the field,

349
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:45,258
but I can't help you break 80 from 99 in a month.

350
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,657
Do you know...

351
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:50,167
that people call me the Grim Reaper of Guseong?

352
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,137
I'm sure you're aware of what happens to those...

353
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:56,637
that get on my bad side.

354
00:18:58,377 --> 00:18:59,508
Or don't you?

355
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,048
- Gosh. - Hurry up.

356
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,617
Mister, you can't take this long.

357
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,587
Seriously? Hurry up, will you?

358
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,758
If we aren't on time, we'll have to do more rounds.

359
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:15,357
My back's a little sore.

360
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:17,928
We will rotate once you unload this truck,

361
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,498
so pick up the pace.

362
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,397
It's too slow. Push them out.

363
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,137
Will you hurry up?

364
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:26,498
Pick up the pace.

365
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,337
Is that the best you can do?

366
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,278
- Gosh. - There you go.

367
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,508
- Faster. - Faster!

368
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:42,948
What? Hey!

369
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,417
Unbelievable.

370
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,288
We're busy as it is, but now this.

371
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,528
There was a hole. Anyway, I'll clean it up.

372
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:53,258
Sweep everything up while I take a bathroom break.

373
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,998
Sure.

374
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,438
That's enough.

375
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,377
Honey?

376
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,738
Honey, let's go home.

377
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,917
- Come on, let's go home. - Honey.

378
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,917
I can't stand seeing you get treated this way.

379
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,688
So please...

380
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,428
- Please quit this job. - Okay, fine.

381
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,728
All right.

382
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:27,897
Don't just say that you understand...

383
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:29,028
and come home with me.

384
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,238
I can't just leave when I made a mess of things.

385
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:33,998
Hold on a second.

386
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,377
You jerk!

387
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,178
I'll do it.

388
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,278
Let me.

389
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:54,157
Are you hurt anywhere?

390
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,557
No, I'm as fit as a fiddle.

391
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,458
You're always this way.

392
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,897
I haven't made a single mistake before,

393
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,827
but that sack just had to have a hole.

394
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:06,137
Why did it have to be on the day you came by too? How embarrassing.

395
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:09,867
There is no one who I admire more,

396
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,038
so don't worry about it.

397
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:17,147
We shouldn't be displaying our affection in public,

398
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,718
but how about a kiss?

399
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:21,988
You can be so silly sometimes.

400
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:25,917
- Anyway, I'm hungry. - Gosh, I forgot.

401
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,167
The broth is amazing.

402
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:47,107
The cook at the sauna cafeteria makes great food.

403
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,917
I should be the one cooking you your food,

404
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,147
so I apologize.

405
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,387
How can you when we live in an inn?

406
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,587
The one who should apologize is me.

407
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:00,887
This is all...

408
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,488
because of that one Guseong Group's president's daughter-in-law.

409
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,958
It's my fault too for being naive.

410
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,567
I shouldn't have let them take over like that.

411
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,698
She'll someday be punished.

412
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,607
Why did Bak Ha get a job at Guseong Hotel of all places?

413
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,067
Isn't it her first day today?

414
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,038
She said that she must enter the tiger's den to catch the tiger.

415
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,577
She expects to uncover...

416
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,877
the truth about her husband's death while working there.

417
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,778
It's David versus Goliath.

418
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,748
You know how meticulous they are.

419
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,087
I'm sure any evidence is long gone already.

420
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:34,617
But honey,

421
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:37,528
on the day we went to the sea to end our lives,

422
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:40,857
a huge fire erupted at that storage facility, remember?

423
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:41,897
Yes.

424
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:44,567
Yeol Mu's father was in it.

425
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:48,938
So the man we saw on the news was Yeol Mu's father?

426
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:50,008
Yes.

427
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,337
Our destinies must be entwined, right?

428
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,077
You can say that again.

429
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,847
We should do our best to help Bak Ha raise Yeol Mu.

430
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,248
That we should.

431
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:03,147
Why are you glancing at your watch?

432
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,788
My shift begins soon.

433
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,458
Honey.

434
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:09,387
Give me a little faith.

435
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:13,597
If I give up this job, I might give up on my life again.

436
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,581
(Nakwon Inn)

437
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:24,800
Episode 18

438
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:31,833
Gosh. Hey.

439
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:36,703
Why are you standing out in the cold?

440
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:39,333
What have you been doing out so late?

441
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:42,842
That's exactly what my wife used to say.

442
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,842
Cut it out. Who's that man?

443
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,013
I already told you.

444
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:51,083
He was the manager of our morning soccer club.

445
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,653
Then why did he show up here?

446
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:55,352
Does he want to play soccer with an old man like you?

447
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:57,893
Well, the thing is...

448
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,153
It's a pyramid scheme, isn't it?

449
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:02,922
He wants you to buy something from him, doesn't he?

450
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,232
What?

451
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:08,102
Oh, my. I'm impressed.

452
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,372
Your hunches are still so good, seriously.

453
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,772
Don't buy anything from him.

454
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,973
I get it.

455
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:14,702
You're just saying that.

456
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,903
Don't spend even a dollar foolishly.

457
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:20,912
That's also what my wife used to say. Hey.

458
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:25,512
Let's grill those sand eels and have dinner.

459
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:28,852
It's not nice to be greedy for food at your age.

460
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:32,423
Then what am I supposed to enjoy at my age?

461
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:36,063
Why am I even talking to you? You frustrate me.

462
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:38,733
Why can't you leave me alone?

463
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:40,733
Hey.

464
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:45,432
Look at you. Are you going somewhere nice?

465
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:48,673
The Gold Miss Korea winners are having a gathering.

466
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:49,703
I see.

467
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:53,143
You want me to read your palm?

468
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:56,483
You said you'd pay me if I babysat Yeol Mu.

469
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:09,063
You asked me to babysit for an hour and came back only now.

470
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:10,792
Ms. Bang,

471
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:13,363
give me a break.

472
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:17,203
I got paid only 20 dollars by Yeol Mu's mom too.

473
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:19,973
Give me just 10 more dollars.

474
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,012
How did you know I had 10 more dollars?

475
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:26,512
Here.

476
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,042
See you later.

477
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:31,882
Thanks.

478
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,253
Goodness.

479
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:36,952
I didn't know Ms. Bang was so greedy.

480
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:48,903
Get in.

481
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:50,572
Okay.

482
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:57,102
While Cinderella steps into a golden carriage in the fairy tale,

483
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,542
Bang Eun Ji in reality steps into a sedan.

484
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:26,102
It was short notice, so I thought you might say no.

485
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:28,072
Thank you for coming.

486
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:33,512
In the fairy tale, the girl meets a prince.

487
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:35,443
But in reality, the girl meets his father.

488
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,713
I mean his grandfather.

489
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,352
Everything can't be perfect, right?

490
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:03,003
A fancy, glittery, and comfortable life.

491
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:07,012
Yes, this was the life meant for me.

492
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,142
Not the room at the inn that's rented month to month.

493
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:43,082
(Super Senior Club 2019)

494
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:47,322
When the doors open,

495
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,382
I'll see a room full of privileged people...

496
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:52,193
in dresses and tuxedos like I've seen in movies.

497
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:56,092
Glittering chandeliers, wine, the melody of a waltz...

498
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:59,762
Yes, this is the life I've dreamed of.

499
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:10,103
What's this gathering about?

500
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:13,443
Why are there only old people?

501
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,082
It's called Super Senior Club.

502
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:19,282
It's a group of CEOs over 70 who has donated...

503
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,923
more than a million dollars so far.

504
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:23,782
Over 70?

505
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:24,853
Yes.

506
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,663
What a strange turn of events.

507
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:36,762
With the first daughter-in-law there from tomorrow,

508
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:41,943
how am I going to make a move on the second daughter-in-law?

509
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,913
I'm too busy to go to the driving range.

510
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:47,543
Don't wait for me.

511
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,683
How can both of the daughters-in-law in that family be...

512
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,592
so aggressive?

513
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,663
It's not easy. No, it's not.

514
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,663
Gosh.

515
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:25,582
You got off work late.

516
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,353
I had a lot to do.

517
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:32,452
Are you sure you didn't meet Mr. Son Byeong Gi today?

518
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:34,262
I didn't. I already said I didn't.

519
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,363
How many times do I have to tell you?

520
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:40,962
Ms. Oh has no reason to lie.

521
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,433
If she says she didn't, she didn't.

522
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:46,332
Don't bring this up again.

523
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,543
It's an order, Ms. Geum.

524
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:49,743
Keep that in mind.

525
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:02,952
If she's not hiding anything, why would she lie?

526
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,293
There's definitely something fishy going on.

527
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,832
Gosh, my feet.

528
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:16,503
My goodness.

529
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:22,202
My shoes are scraping the back of my heels.

530
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:24,373
Darn it.

531
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,452
I keep running into her all day.

532
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:36,582
Why is she walking like that?

533
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:39,753
She even took her shoes off.

534
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:42,163
Whatever.

535
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,303
- Are you on your way home? - Yes.

536
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:57,103
Why are you staggering? Are you drunk?

537
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,743
Did you drink on your first day of work?

538
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,743
You did, right? You're busted.

539
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:05,882
I didn't drink.

540
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,183
- You didn't? - I've been working until now.

541
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,222
I didn't have any time to drink.

542
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,733
What are you doing?

543
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:26,772
Are you sure you didn't drink?

544
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,272
Look,

545
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:32,943
why would you keep asking if I drank when I didn't?

546
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:37,413
Then why were you staggering?

547
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:40,212
I haven't worn these shoes in a long time,

548
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,952
and they're scraping the back of my heels. Look.

549
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:43,983
Gosh.

550
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:47,353
Put them back on anyway. You might hurt your feet.

551
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:51,533
Goodness. Why do you care?

552
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,962
Fine, suit yourself.

553
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:59,033
You're unhappy whether I'm nice to you or not.

554
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,773
It's none of your business.

555
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:08,212
I knew it. Why couldn't she listen to me?

556
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:21,663
What's this?

557
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,462
What do you think? They're my sneakers.

558
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:25,362
What do you want me to do with them?

559
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,433
You can borrow them.

560
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:30,433
Forget it.

561
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:33,602
Don't be like that. Put them on before you hurt your feet again.

562
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:35,643
Goodness.

563
00:32:36,702 --> 00:32:39,043
Do you have athlete's foot by any chance?

564
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:42,212
No, I don't.

565
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,383
That's good. Put them on now.

566
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:48,383
I feel bad though.

567
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,423
I'm glad you do. Put them on.

568
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:57,462
Let me wipe my feet first.

569
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:10,002
Oh, they sure are comfy.

570
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:12,472
- Hold on. - Forget it.

571
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,043
I'm sorry.

572
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,722
- Did you do that on purpose? - No.

573
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:24,923
It was a mistake.

574
00:33:26,393 --> 00:33:29,862
Oh, my. What do I do?

575
00:33:29,862 --> 00:33:32,592
- Are you sure it was a mistake? - It was.

576
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:35,433
Why would you tie my shoelaces? You don't have to.

577
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,563
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:40,202
You're so careless.

579
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:44,043
Come here. Give me your foot.

580
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:50,112
You shouldn't be so careless.

581
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:54,053
You almost had a bad accident in front of the gallery earlier.

582
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,803
Thank you for earlier.

583
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:15,943
Better late than never.

584
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:19,342
There you go.

585
00:34:20,513 --> 00:34:21,742
Try walking in them.

586
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:26,653
Look.

587
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,023
That's much better.

588
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:35,263
Thank you.

589
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:38,293
I'll wash them before returning them to you.

590
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:41,002
Of course. Make sure they don't smell like your feet.

591
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:43,732
My feet don't smell.

592
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:44,832
What are you talking about?

593
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,043
I was so shocked when I was tying your shoelaces.

594
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:49,102
Really?

595
00:34:49,102 --> 00:34:50,572
Was it this foot or the other?

596
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,043
Was it this foot?

597
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,013
They don't...

598
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:00,252
They don't smell!

599
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:05,722
Is it this foot?

600
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,293
She's so silly.

601
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,362
Does this smell?

602
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:16,702
Gosh.

603
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:24,972
(Guseong Hotel)

604
00:35:43,962 --> 00:35:46,362
Oh, isn't that Woo Jae?

605
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:49,263
Woo Jae!

606
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,072
Where is he going?

607
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,202
(Nakwon Inn)

608
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,673
"Nakwon Inn?"

609
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:00,943
Why would he go into an inn?

610
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:04,242
You're home late.

611
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:06,183
How is the preparation for the competition going?

612
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:08,752
I'm in pretty good shape,

613
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:10,283
but we'll see.

614
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,023
It's the last competition of the season.

615
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:15,222
Win the prize money and treat me.

616
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:16,563
I'll try.

617
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,992
Why are you working out so late?

618
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:23,033
I met an unexpected obstacle today,

619
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:25,072
so I needed some time to sort out my thoughts.

620
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:31,643
I'm feeling a bit down today. Do you want to have soju with me?

621
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:33,872
Let me check on Yeol Mu first.

622
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:35,443
Are you her dad?

623
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:37,783
Why do you care so much about him?

624
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:39,513
I'll be quick.

625
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,322
That guy is too nice.

626
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:47,962
You're good with babies.

627
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,423
Are you busy tomorrow?

628
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:53,633
I have something planned for tomorrow,

629
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:57,063
and there's no one to babysit Yeol Mu.

630
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,872
Can you make some time to do that?

631
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,943
I'll give you 20 dollars.

632
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:04,842
I don't need any money.

633
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:06,643
I can babysit, so don't worry.

634
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:07,842
Really?

635
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:14,053
Oh, my gosh.

636
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:18,423
Would you like to stay here?

637
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:21,822
Unfortunately, all the rooms are taken.

638
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,462
Also, this place doesn't accept short-term guests.

639
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,962
The minimum stay is a month.

640
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,763
Leave a phone number, and the owner of this inn...

641
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:32,002
will call you when there's a room available.

642
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,372
Is there a Kim Woo Jae staying here?

643
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,212
Are you here to see Woo Jae?

644
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:42,813
Are you his girlfriend?

645
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:44,413
Where's Woo Jae?

646
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,053
Woo Jae!

647
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:47,482
What's going on?

648
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:49,923
Where are you? Hey!

649
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:51,653
- We're home. - Come out right now!

650
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,352
I said, come out!

651
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:56,063
Kim Woo Jae!

652
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:58,933
Gosh.

653
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,502
How did you find this place?

654
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:05,602
You moved out of that apartment to stay at a place like this?

655
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,332
Let's go out. Let's talk somewhere else.

656
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:11,173
You looked so confident when you packed up and left.

657
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:14,783
And you ended up in this chicken cage?

658
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:16,242
Answer me!

659
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:19,252
Well...

660
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:23,352
Why would a young lady like you use such rough words?

661
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:25,492
A chicken cage? What do you mean?

662
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,952
Stay out of it, old man.

663
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:28,462
What did you say?

664
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:30,622
Go pack your things right now.

665
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:34,033
I don't want to spend a second more in this chicken cage.

666
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:36,002
A chicken cage?

667
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:37,633
Who are you?

668
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,933
How can you be so rude?

669
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:42,972
I don't know how fancy and luxurious your place is,

670
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:44,813
but you can't call someone's home a chicken cage.

671
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:46,112
How dare you?

672
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,813
I'm sorry. Let's go out.

673
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:50,612
Let go. It hurts.

674
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,553
My goodness.

675
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:58,023
I said, let go!

676
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:00,822
What?

677
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:02,962
Are you really this person?

678
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:04,393
That's what I want to say.

679
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,563
Is this what you amount to?

680
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:08,433
How could you stay at a place like this?

681
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,533
What do you mean, "a place like this"?

682
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:12,702
Do I have to tell you?

683
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,773
It looks like some animal cage, cramped and packed...

684
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:15,943
Stop it!

685
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,872
Do you think you can say whatever you want?

686
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:20,972
No... What I mean is,

687
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:23,143
this place is...

688
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:25,582
so filthy and squalid.

689
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,712
What's the point of living in a fancy place?

690
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:32,592
Those people are more kind-hearted and elegant than anyone.

691
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:35,893
They're a thousand times better than people who trample on poor people...

692
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:37,763
just because they have money!

693
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,362
What?

694
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:42,232
Are you mocking my family?

695
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:48,803
You are. You insulted my family.

696
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:51,543
Forget it.

697
00:39:55,582 --> 00:39:56,643
In any case,

698
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,952
pack up and move out right now.

699
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:00,952
I'll find you an apartment.

700
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:05,053
I'll never live in an apartment you find for me.

701
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:07,352
- What? - I'm happier here.

702
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:08,563
Are you stupid?

703
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:10,563
How could you live at this pathetic...

704
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:17,133
Guseong Group's Na Hae Ri dates a man...

705
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:20,502
who lives at this pathetic place? I'm not okay with that.

706
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:25,242
Stop being such a snob, Hae Ri.

707
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:27,113
A snob?

708
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,312
I'm disappointed in you.

709
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:37,153
(Nakwon Inn)

710
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,962
(Nakwon Inn)

711
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:59,312
Why does it have to be that mean girl,

712
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:01,843
of all girls?

713
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:04,212
She must hurt him a lot.

714
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:06,282
I feel so sorry for him.

715
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,353
By the way,

716
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,522
she looked rather familiar.

717
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:14,863
She's the granddaughter of the president of Guseong Hotel.

718
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:16,792
- What? - Really?

719
00:41:16,863 --> 00:41:19,532
At the Gold Miss Korea Contest,

720
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:22,433
there was a huge ruckus in the lobby, and she was there.

721
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:24,903
I thought I'd seen her before.

722
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,173
She's the granddaughter?

723
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:29,143
That means she's the daughter of the first daughter-in-law.

724
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:31,173
Like mother, like daughter, I guess.

725
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:36,683
Gosh.

726
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:40,812
I'm sorry for causing a scene.

727
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,623
This inn...

728
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:46,292
means everything to me.

729
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:50,663
I can't let anyone insult and look down on this place.

730
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,093
If this happens again,

731
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,833
I'll kick you out.

732
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:57,933
Okay. It'll never happen again.

733
00:41:58,903 --> 00:41:59,903
All right.

734
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:04,373
Hey.

735
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:08,212
She's the granddaughter of the president of Guseong Hotel?

736
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:10,683
Yes.

737
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:14,012
Why do you have to date the granddaughter...

738
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,522
of the president of Guseong Hotel, of all people?

739
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:19,853
I'm telling you this because I think of you as my little brother.

740
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:22,193
Think carefully, Woo Jae.

741
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:26,462
The employees at Guseong Hotel call the first daughter-in-law ...

742
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:29,833
and her daughter Witch 1 and Witch 2 because they're so mean.

743
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:31,062
Honey.

744
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:33,373
Woo Jae should know too.

745
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:37,002
Yes, you better be prepared.

746
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:40,913
Witch One signed up for lessons at our driving range today,

747
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,643
and she sure was horrible.

748
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:46,212
I feel sorry for Ms. Geum,

749
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:48,752
who has to work for Witch One.

750
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:50,052
Well...

751
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:54,252
She's not as bad as people say she is.

752
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:55,693
She can be...

753
00:42:56,462 --> 00:42:58,393
cute too sometimes.

754
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:06,373
We're going to teach you the 100-Year Exercise.

755
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:09,802
We made this exercise with the hope that all the club members...

756
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:12,943
will have long and healthy lives. Do this exercise regularly at home.

757
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:15,943
Please stand up.

758
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:20,183
Stand facing your partner.

759
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:22,083
Interlock your hands.

760
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:24,083
Your feet should be shoulder width apart.

761
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:26,853
As you step backward, raise your arms.

762
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:29,762
1, 2, 3...

763
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:31,593
Oh, my.

764
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,562
That feels nice.

765
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:37,262
Look at your partner's face lovingly.

766
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:38,732
Stretch, stretch.

767
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:40,833
In the fairy tale,

768
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:43,643
Cinderella danced a romantic waltz.

769
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:45,772
Meanwhile, Bang Eun Ji in reality...

770
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:48,512
does the 100-Year Exercise to a trot song.

771
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:50,282
4, 5...

772
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:53,083
This reality is too scary.

773
00:43:56,823 --> 00:44:00,752
You were definitely the queen of the night.

774
00:44:01,863 --> 00:44:02,923
I was?

775
00:44:02,992 --> 00:44:06,962
Everyone including Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee were so jealous of me.

776
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:09,702
And all the old ladies were jealous of your youth.

777
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:13,802
I was the star of the day.

778
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:17,343
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

779
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:20,212
After my wife died,

780
00:44:20,943 --> 00:44:23,113
I never felt comfortable about going to gatherings.

781
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:26,012
I hadn't felt this confident in a long time.

782
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,282
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Bang.

783
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:38,262
Why are you two still up?

784
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,562
We can't sleep without having you arrive home safely.

785
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:46,373
You two are the best daughters-in-law in the country.

786
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,873
I'm one lucky old man.

787
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,542
It seems like you had fun at the gathering.

788
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:53,812
I sure did.

789
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,242
- Here. - Oh, my.

790
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:58,952
Here.

791
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,153
- You gave me two bills. - Yes.

792
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:04,052
This is the first time you've given me 100 dollars.

793
00:45:04,683 --> 00:45:06,722
It's such a historical moment.

794
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,923
- It means I'm that happy. - Okay.

795
00:45:09,962 --> 00:45:12,593
Don't feel bad. Keep it.

796
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:19,633
Something's fishy.

797
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,343
Do Hee.

798
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:28,242
The employees are talking.

799
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:32,982
How could you hire the wife of the dishonorable employee...

800
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:35,623
who killed himself after embezzling company funds as your secretary?

801
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,522
Are you talking about Ms. Geum?

802
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:41,792
Yes, please change your secretary.

803
00:45:41,962 --> 00:45:45,762
I'll find an honest person with good credentials for you.

804
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:48,363
You don't have to. I like Ms. Geum just fine.

805
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:50,802
- Do Hee! - As you probably know,

806
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:53,433
I like people who stand out.

807
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:56,343
Ms. Geum fits my style perfectly.

808
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,113
Goodness. What?

809
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:06,052
She's your style?

810
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:09,853
Gosh, I wish I could grab your hair and spin it around...

811
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:13,193
or break your legs so that you'll fall to the ground.

812
00:46:13,193 --> 00:46:15,923
That obnoxious woman.

813
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,292
Come in.

814
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:23,062
You're working so late.

815
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:25,202
What's that?

816
00:46:26,173 --> 00:46:28,472
It's honey tea.

817
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:30,373
It'll warm you up.

818
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:32,073
Do you have a lot of documents to go through?

819
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,173
There will be a due diligence review on the resort tomorrow.

820
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:37,683
Finish up and go to bed. You have to go all the way to Anmyeon Island.

821
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:41,823
Don't worry about me. Goodnight, In Sook.

822
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:43,522
You're so silly.

823
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:45,792
Wait, Mom.

824
00:46:46,623 --> 00:46:47,623
What is it?

825
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:51,792
Well... Who is Mr. Son?

826
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,363
- Why are you asking? - It's just...

827
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:56,833
Ms. Geum is looking for him so desperately...

828
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,232
that I'm getting a bit curious.

829
00:46:58,573 --> 00:47:00,873
He doesn't even work at our head office.

830
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:03,242
He's in charge of the resort's finance. That's all I know.

831
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,573
We might have crossed paths a few times though.

832
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,312
After what happened today, I just wanted to ask.

833
00:47:08,312 --> 00:47:11,383
- Goodnight. - Goodnight, son.

834
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:34,532
I can't be mistaken.

835
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:37,673
I swear it was Mr. Son.

836
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:42,712
(Human Resources)

837
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,383
We're not allowed...

838
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,812
to reveal a former employee's personal information.

839
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:51,282
Mr. Son was my late husband's boss.

840
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:53,153
I'd like to meet him...

841
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:55,323
and ask him a few things.

842
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:56,623
So please let me know where I can find him.

843
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,393
It's against company policy.

844
00:47:58,393 --> 00:48:02,732
You shouldn't always stick to the principles.

845
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:06,202
Please try to understand my situation and help me this once.

846
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:07,702
I'm afraid I can't.

847
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:24,583
You look so depressed this morning.

848
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:27,893
What's wrong?

849
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:32,062
No matter how desperately I beg,

850
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:35,962
Human Resources won't give me Mr. Son's address.

851
00:48:38,363 --> 00:48:40,272
Wait just a little longer.

852
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:43,643
It's about time my informant called me.

853
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:46,542
Okay.

854
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:52,113
Hi, it's me.

855
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:54,452
How did it go?

856
00:48:56,252 --> 00:48:57,323
You did?

857
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:01,292
You found out where Mr. Son lives?

858
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:02,462
Really?

859
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:05,633
- Where? - Where does he live?

860
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,863
Wait!

861
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:11,873
Thank you.

862
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:20,443
It's a long drive to Anmyeon Island.

863
00:49:20,443 --> 00:49:22,012
Do you want me to drive for you?

864
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:23,782
Didn't you say you have a meeting at 2pm?

865
00:49:23,782 --> 00:49:26,452
I could drop you off and head back right away.

866
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:28,982
That's okay. I can drive myself.

867
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:32,123
The doors are opening.

868
00:49:34,522 --> 00:49:36,022
Going down.

869
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:44,802
What are you doing?

870
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:48,002
I hear you're headed for the resort in Anmyeon Island.

871
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:51,502
- I am. - Oh, my.

872
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:55,343
That happens to be exactly where I'm headed for.

873
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:57,383
How about we carpool?

874
00:49:57,383 --> 00:49:58,982
- Carpool. - Carpool?

875
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:01,153
Yes. If you feel tired,

876
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:03,353
I can take the wheel too.

877
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:05,083
You know what a good driver I am.

878
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,522
Forget it.

879
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:12,193
We can share the gas cost too.

880
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:14,032
Why are you going to Anmyeon Island anyway?

881
00:50:14,032 --> 00:50:16,202
I found out where Mr. Son lives.

882
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:18,702
I have to meet him and settle things.

883
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:21,802
I'm in a hurry. Please understand.

884
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:25,443
Is it Mr. Son again?

885
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:29,482
- It's none of my business. - Well...

886
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,012
- Just this once. - Move!

887
00:50:47,492 --> 00:50:50,163
Why is he so crabby today?

888
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:54,202
Gosh. Seriously.

889
00:51:14,353 --> 00:51:16,363
Welcome, Mr. Na. Everything's ready.

890
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:17,562
Thank you.

891
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:18,933
Let's go in.

892
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:29,702
If the house number is 42,

893
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:32,272
it should be around here.

894
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:44,923
Mr. Son.

895
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:47,752
Can we talk?

896
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:52,262
Mr. Son!

897
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,062
Mr. Son!
