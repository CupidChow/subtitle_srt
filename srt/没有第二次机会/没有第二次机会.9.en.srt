00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,454
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:10,454
How many times must I say this?

3
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:13,253
My husband is not the kind of man who'd steal from his company.

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:16,453
And a suicide on top of that? It doesn't make any sense.

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,224
The case has already been closed.

6
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:20,593
It can't be reopened.

7
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:23,233
Isn't the police supposed to...

8
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,264
help the people get justice?

9
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:26,633
How is it that...

10
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,534
you're only listening to their side of the story?

11
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:32,374
I understand that you're upset.

12
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:35,474
But there is proof and being stubborn won't change that.

13
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:37,144
Where is that so-called proof then?

14
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,883
If he embezzled money, there should be evidence of it.

15
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:42,154
Where on earth is that money he took?

16
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:43,514
He probably used a check kiting scheme...

17
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:45,084
or opened a bank account under a different name.

18
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,294
Only the deceased would know.

19
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:50,593
How can you turn a blind eye like this?

20
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:55,133
I really think it'll be best if you reinvestigated the case.

21
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,463
Gosh, you really are a stubborn one.

22
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,703
There's proof on the company records...

23
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:02,273
that Mr. Kang embezzled money.

24
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:04,974
Also, it's obvious that he was setting his affairs in order.

25
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,314
We came to a conclusion after a thorough investigation.

26
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:08,873
No way.

27
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,213
Why would he resign...

28
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,183
from the company he was happy working at?

29
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,554
(Letter of Resignation)

30
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,224
What's this?

31
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,724
See for yourself.

32
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,364
(Letter of Resignation)

33
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:30,034
I'm sure you recognize his handwriting.

34
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,504
Did you know that he had written a letter of resignation?

35
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,403
I know it's hard to believe this,

36
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:40,373
but your husband wrote this without you knowing...

37
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:43,013
and committed suicide to end his life of misery.

38
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:46,444
(September 27, 2019, Kang Jin Gu)

39
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,864
This isn't you being brave. You're being immature.

40
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,373
I'll say that I was in the storage alone.

41
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,743
I won't let this get back to you, so don't worry.

42
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:15,644
This isn't because I'm scared of getting caught in the middle.

43
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:19,243
- Go back to Seoul. - But Woo Jae...

44
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:21,213
I'll call you when it's over.

45
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,093
You've got to be kidding me.

46
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,294
Where's your proof?

47
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:37,033
Sorry?

48
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:41,273
What can prove that you were in the storage with Mr. Kang?

49
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:42,773
How about a witness?

50
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,273
Without probable cause, we can't reopen the case.

51
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,514
I saw it with my own eyes.

52
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,783
Mr. Kang didn't set the fire to commit suicide.

53
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,653
The storage caught on fire by mistake.

54
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,753
There was a small altercation.

55
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,153
An altercation?

56
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,223
With whom?

57
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,794
Whoever argued with Mr. Kang...

58
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:09,134
could be arrested for manslaughter.

59
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,463
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,634
Gosh.

61
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,973
Woo Jae, we should go.

62
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:20,614
You only saw it from afar, right?

63
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,743
You could be mistaken.

64
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:26,943
Let's not waste any more of this detective's time.

65
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,153
Come on.

66
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,984
Come on! My gosh.

67
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:55,773
You never said anything about quitting your job.

68
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,544
Did you really steal from the company...

69
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:01,183
and commit suicide?

70
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:03,313
What for?

71
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,593
Are you insane?

72
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:14,593
That's enough.

73
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,263
Didn't you hear the detective?

74
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,104
You could go to prison for manslaughter.

75
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,474
Why must we suffer like this because of some random man?

76
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,243
If it weren't for him,

77
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,513
we wouldn't be in pain and arguing all the time.

78
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:31,813
You wouldn't have withdrawn from the competition either.

79
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,484
This is a disaster for us too.

80
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,654
That's enough.

81
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:48,534
Why are you in such pain over this?

82
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:49,893
The fire?

83
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,333
He was the one who started the argument.

84
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,274
The fact that you couldn't save him from the fire?

85
00:04:56,274 --> 00:05:00,373
Not even a family member would've run into it to save him.

86
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:04,414
It makes no sense for us to risk our lives for a stranger.

87
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:09,253
I promised you, remember?

88
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:10,883
I said I'd track down his wife...

89
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,154
and make sure she can have a decent life.

90
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:16,123
What about your mother who's all alone back home?

91
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,063
You said it was your dream...

92
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,933
to be a success so that she's set for life.

93
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:26,534
Woo Jae, please get a grip on yourself.

94
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:34,943
(2020 Business Plan)

95
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,243
A blind date has been set for this evening.

96
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,354
Gosh, this evening...

97
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,583
I checked with your secretary, and you're free.

98
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,253
Don't think about making any plans and meet her.

99
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:52,193
How can you set me up without asking me first?

100
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:54,864
Just look at her. Isn't she pretty?

101
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:56,234
She comes from such a great background...

102
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,864
that I said yes without even asking any questions.

103
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,164
Just meet her once.

104
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:02,333
If you don't like her, I won't push it anymore.

105
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,003
No thanks.

106
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:06,143
The blind date has already been set up,

107
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:08,114
so you'll be embarrassing me.

108
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:12,214
Son, please. Just this once.

109
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:15,013
But...

110
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,974
Let me see.

111
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,253
The Botox shots I received...

112
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:52,323
must be working.

113
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:56,094
I bet no one looks as young as I do at my age.

114
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,763
The husband of Guseong Gallery's director?

115
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:04,534
It's a title worthy of my charm and grace.

116
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:08,974
Let's go.

117
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,364
Coach Gam, is that you?

118
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:32,393
Gosh.

119
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:37,703
Sir, goodness.

120
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:39,063
Are you here to see the paintings?

121
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,703
Yes, that and I had...

122
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,034
other business too.

123
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,873
Let me introduce you to each other.

124
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,474
This is professional golfer Gam Poong Ki,

125
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,643
the greatest golf instructor and novelist.

126
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:53,284
This is Oh In Sook, the Director of Guseong Gallery.

127
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:54,914
It's a pleasure to meet you.

128
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,554
I feel like we've met before though.

129
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:01,554
It's nice to meet you. I'm Gam Poong Ki.

130
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:04,924
So how do you two know each other?

131
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,724
Oh, us?

132
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:08,734
We graduated...

133
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:11,964
from the same MBA class at Hankuk University.

134
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,873
What a nice painting.

135
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,674
Rather than showing off,

136
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,714
the artist played on the variation of colours...

137
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,614
to honestly portray his mind.

138
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,383
I find all of the pieces entertaining,

139
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:29,253
but the whole collection feels like a symphony.

140
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:32,983
The colours he used resonate as they bounce off one another.

141
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,494
They remind me of...

142
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,823
Kandinsky's composition paintings.

143
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:42,664
My gosh. You never strike me as only an athlete.

144
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:44,933
You're a talented golfer, an esteemed writer,

145
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,904
and you even know your art.

146
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,674
You're the whole package.

147
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,774
Do you write as well?

148
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:52,443
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

149
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,843
Being a writer has always been my dream,

150
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:58,014
but my elders told me that writers usually starve.

151
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,914
It's why I became a golfer instead.

152
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:02,254
I guess it comes down to how you approach things.

153
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:03,983
Your novel will be published soon.

154
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,453
It's going through the final revision.

155
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:08,093
My first novel will be released within this month,

156
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:09,654
but I'm embarrassed.

157
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,894
Goodness.

158
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,323
I'd love to have a copy of it too.

159
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,134
The honour is mine.

160
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,193
As a token of my gratitude...

161
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:25,644
That one.

162
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,613
I'd like to buy that painting.

163
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,813
- Please don't feel the need to. - It's not that.

164
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:34,613
I just love the painting, that's all.

165
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:38,254
I'm grateful for the interest you've shown in the artist.

166
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,453
- Excuse me. - Yes?

167
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,994
Can you help this gentleman purchase a painting?

168
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,193
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:49,363
I have plans with Ms. Oh, so I'm afraid we have to leave.

170
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,134
We'll get together some other time.

171
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,804
- Sure thing. - See you then.

172
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,774
This way.

173
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,713
Right.

174
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,044
(5,000 dollars)

175
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,313
("Sound of the Wind", 5,000 dollars)

176
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,524
That tiny painting is worth 5,000 dollars?

177
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:15,254
Sorry?

178
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:19,794
Are you sure you didn't add another zero by mistake?

179
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,164
You did, right?

180
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,193
No, 5,000 dollars is the correct price.

181
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,134
Unbelievable.

182
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:33,804
Can I make an instalment purchase?

183
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,894
Hole number one is a no.

184
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,193
Move to hole number two.

185
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:56,994
What do you mean you can't give back my deposit?

186
00:10:56,994 --> 00:11:00,733
You altered your outfit so much that...

187
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,634
it can't be worn by anyone else.

188
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:05,674
Also, you broke so many of our walkie-talkies...

189
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,374
and fixing them cost quite a lot.

190
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,044
You just fired an employee who worked here for nearly 10 years,

191
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,843
but you won't even give me back my deposit?

192
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,514
How can you be so cruel?

193
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,613
You're the one who cost us our reputation,

194
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,183
so be glad that we're not suing you...

195
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,483
for damages.

196
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:23,624
You're just talking through your hat again.

197
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,664
What?

198
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,164
Just because you're fired...

199
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,563
doesn't mean you can say that.

200
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,904
You know, I'm glad you said that.

201
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:36,404
Since I've been fired, I'll freely speak my mind.

202
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,274
- You. - What?

203
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:39,374
Yes, you.

204
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:42,113
Being a caddy master isn't some grand title.

205
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:45,384
Even though you're younger than me, you showed no respect.

206
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,514
Also, you acted like you own me.

207
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,554
That's not how one should live their life.

208
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,983
I never abused my power and you know it.

209
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,554
When the gimjang season came around, you rounded up all the caddies...

210
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,093
and had them salt down the cabbage.

211
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,963
What do you call that then?

212
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,264
On snowy days, you had the caddies clean up the field.

213
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,394
You took what we earned under the pretext of...

214
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,164
cleaning the carts.

215
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,333
Whenever you could, you made us get coffee too.

216
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:11,874
That's what you call abusing your power.

217
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:14,744
Give me my deposit back...

218
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,213
or I'll call the Ministry of Employment and Labour.

219
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:22,384
As if I'd be scared of such threats.

220
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,813
Okay,

221
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,723
we'll see who wins.

222
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,384
Hold on.

223
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:37,804
Eyes down.

224
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,544
I'm never even looking in this direction anymore.

225
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,304
I hope you'll be cursed for a million years.

226
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,394
I said this earlier,

227
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,054
but...

228
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:06,264
I must find the owner of this shoe no matter what.

229
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:10,494
The owner of that shoe might not be here today though.

230
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:13,164
Then I'll come back tomorrow and the day after that.

231
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:15,103
I won't stop until I find her.

232
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:19,203
I'm sure we'll someday cross paths.

233
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,483
You are just as uptight as ever.

234
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,784
You're getting old.

235
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,784
Why don't you hand over this inn and enjoy an easy life?

236
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,723
I will give you more than enough for it.

237
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,294
Unbelievable.

238
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,894
How dare you crawl over here...

239
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:40,193
and tell me to sell my inn to you?

240
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,664
My parents would...

241
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,634
break out of their coffins if they heard that.

242
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,603
Mak Rye, may I come in?

243
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,853
What's wrong? Are you sick?

244
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,093
What do you think you're doing?

245
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,894
What do you mean?

246
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,294
How dare you touch me, you pervert.

247
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,664
I wasn't...

248
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,233
putting my hands on you.

249
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,233
I was checking if you had a fever.

250
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:28,213
You're just as sly as you ever were.

251
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,284
Anyway, let this be your warning.

252
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,443
Touch a hair on my head...

253
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,983
and I'll kick you out that second.

254
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,754
Sometimes in life,

255
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,453
hands sometimes meet...

256
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:44,193
and one can touch another's hair.

257
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,063
Why are you getting...

258
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:49,063
all sensitive about this?

259
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,103
All right, fine. I'll keep my hands to myself.

260
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:00,103
So why are you all dressed up today?

261
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,544
Well,

262
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,414
I'm meeting someone today, that's all.

263
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:06,744
Who?

264
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:09,453
I'll tell you some other time.

265
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:11,353
Is it a woman?

266
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:13,983
Why? Are you jealous?

267
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:18,593
I should punch myself for even asking.

268
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,063
Unbelievable.

269
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,433
Mak Rye,

270
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:25,904
you were my first love,

271
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,973
and you'll be my last.

272
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:29,874
So don't you worry.

273
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:32,544
Again with the nonsense!

274
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:34,573
Leave if you're going to talk gibberish.

275
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:39,014
You were fine up until this morning,

276
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,914
so what's got you all riled up?

277
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:47,583
Na Wang Sam, that jerk, came by the house.

278
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,254
What?

279
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:53,463
How dare that jerk come by this place?

280
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,664
He pulled up in his big car...

281
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,833
and got out right in front of me.

282
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,473
Then he told me to sell the inn to him.

283
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,274
That weasel.

284
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,973
All the money he earned must've gone to his head.

285
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,613
Just hang in there.

286
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,483
I will make sure that...

287
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:16,914
Na Wang Sam gets down on his knees and begs for your forgiveness.

288
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,353
You and your words.

289
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,193
Anyone can move mountains with their words, right?

290
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,494
Darn it.

291
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,863
That jerk.

292
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,473
Goodness, look who it is.

293
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:41,774
- Bak Ha, is that you? - Gosh, hello.

294
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,983
He grew up a lot during your time away.

295
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:48,554
I don't care how hard his life was.

296
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:52,384
How could he take his life and leave his baby boy behind?

297
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,894
What brings you by unannounced?

298
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,823
I had some business at the police station.

299
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,563
You don't have any family,

300
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,994
so how do you expect to cope up in Seoul?

301
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,903
People may talk, but your hometown is still better.

302
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,504
Did you find a job?

303
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:08,133
As if she needs one.

304
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,833
The baby's father took all that money, remember?

305
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,744
I'm sure he left some behind for his wife.

306
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:15,573
Why would you say that?

307
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,643
It's not like I'm lying.

308
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:19,913
My gosh.

309
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,413
- You all heard it! - Goodness.

310
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,724
I can't believe I'm walking by the ocean with you.

311
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:29,323
It feels like a dream.

312
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,994
I haven't felt this great in a while.

313
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,764
You could have anyone you want,

314
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,434
so why do you like someone like me?

315
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,363
I don't know.

316
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:44,034
Maybe this is that fortune the elders keep talking about.

317
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,044
It's a rotten one then.

318
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:50,143
You're supposed to say you'll bring me happiness...

319
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,813
and not say we're doomed.

320
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,813
You really have no style, do you?

321
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,984
Like I said earlier,

322
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,694
I'll do everything I can to help his wife get back on her feet,

323
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,194
so focus on your golf swing now.

324
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:10,794
This will all be solved if you become a world-class golfer.

325
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:12,603
My mom...

326
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:15,534
will allow us to date then.

327
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:24,073
So are we...

328
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:26,214
back together again?

329
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,153
Come back to the apartment then.

330
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,294
- I can't. - Woo Jae, please.

331
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:42,034
I will find success on my own without your help.

332
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:48,804
Fine.

333
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,403
We'll revisit the idea some other time.

334
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:54,343
Are we...

335
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,214
back together then?

336
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,353
- The number you have called... - Why can't I reach her?

337
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,153
Is that the best you can drive?

338
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:15,934
Who are those people?

339
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,994
I'm not sure. They came out of nowhere.

340
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,464
I apologize, ma'am.

341
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,673
Crazy idiots.

342
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,214
Are you out of your minds?

343
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,413
You can't just step in front of...

344
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:35,913
a moving car.

345
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,573
You crazy jerks!

346
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:00,704
My gosh.

347
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:02,113
What do you think you're doing?

348
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,974
Who are you people?

349
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,484
I'm Choi Man Ho.

350
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,383
- Choi Man Ho? - Have you already forgotten?

351
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:12,123
I'm Chef Choi Man Ho, the baker who was fired after...

352
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:15,224
being accused of stealing the money you people stole.

353
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,323
What?

354
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:20,093
No wonder you looked familiar.

355
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,194
It was settled in court, so why are you making a fuss? It's over.

356
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,133
It's over?

357
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,734
Because of that scandal, we lost our house and our jobs,

358
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,204
so how is it over?

359
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:32,173
Well, that's your business.

360
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,173
What?

361
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:35,143
You just made a huge mistake.

362
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,813
Assault, overt threats,

363
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,684
- and what else? - Defamation.

364
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:43,853
Yes, that. I could have you both arrested!

365
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,724
Sure. Go ahead.

366
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,724
We have nothing to be scared of anymore.

367
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:52,024
I've worked with flour my whole life,

368
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,494
and I'd never play games when baking is involved.

369
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,234
Actually, I can't.

370
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,434
However, you people ruined our lives.

371
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,934
We were going to quit living all together,

372
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:05,673
but we didn't want to give you people the satisfaction.

373
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:07,974
I'm going to keep living my life...

374
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,774
so that I can tell the world what you did to me.

375
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:12,583
That's what I came here to say.

376
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,913
What was that?

377
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,714
Did he just threaten me?

378
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,623
Mr. Kim, call the police.

379
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,254
Also, take photos to document the evidence.

380
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,194
- Let me do it for you. - What?

381
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,823
People would love to see this in the papers.

382
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:28,494
- What? - Gosh, no.

383
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,464
Ma'am, please head inside.

384
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:33,333
- Move. - I think it'll be better...

385
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,534
- to contact your lawyer. - Fine!

386
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:36,833
Unbelievable.

387
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,234
Let go of me.

388
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,004
- Stop taking pictures. - Let go!

389
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:48,583
Her face was white like snow...

390
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,413
and all I could see were her blinking eyes.

391
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,323
She looked like a polar bear.

392
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:59,464
I'm sure she goes to spas to get facials all the time,

393
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:02,234
so we gave her a nice flour facial treatment.

394
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:03,663
Are you that happy?

395
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,163
Yes, I don't think I've ever felt this gratified.

396
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:08,974
You're right.

397
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,333
I feel amazing too.

398
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:18,173
We've run out of all our money now.

399
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,413
How are we going to put food on the table?

400
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:22,554
Don't you worry.

401
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:25,024
A job at a sauna...

402
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,254
will pay for at least our meals.

403
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:29,454
I should set aside my pride...

404
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,363
and get a job at a local bakery.

405
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:36,694
They say you should rest if you're already down.

406
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:39,964
You've worked in a kitchen all your life.

407
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,333
You should rest for the time being.

408
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:45,643
I have the ability to earn enough money...

409
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,244
that will feed my dear husband.

410
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:53,383
If it weren't for you,

411
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:55,583
I would've ended my life a long time ago.

412
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,653
Ms. Bok is the one we should be thanking.

413
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:03,054
She saved us from leaving the land of the living.

414
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,823
I'm greatly fond of her...

415
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:09,294
and the guests are all nice too.

416
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:11,363
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

417
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:12,464
You're right.

418
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:16,804
We're already backed into a corner,

419
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:20,444
so we should do anything we can to live our new-found lives.

420
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:22,573
Honey.

421
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:24,913
Good luck!

422
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,599
(Episode 10)

423
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,699
What is that?

424
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:57,529
- Oxtail. - Oxtail?

425
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,699
I went to the butchers out front.

426
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:05,432
They had an oxtail that was as thick as Tyson's arm.

427
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:08,873
It was perfect, so I bought it for you to eat.

428
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,672
You know Tyson, right?

429
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:15,182
The guy with the fist of terror.

430
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:18,212
Why are you doing that?

431
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:23,183
You should be saving your money to rent a house at least.

432
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:26,593
Why are you wasting your money on oxtails and snakehead fish?

433
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,022
Did you come to my inn to cook?

434
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:31,632
How can you talk like that? You're hurting my pride.

435
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,392
Do you think pride will feed you?

436
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:36,132
You could be carrying stuff for people.

437
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:39,632
Or push handcarts or something. You need to earn money.

438
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:42,072
I have high blood pressure.

439
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:45,072
My joints are all worn out.

440
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,572
I can't do hard labour.

441
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,782
Do you plan to eat and play without doing any work?

442
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,112
- I'm back. - Okay.

443
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,383
There is Yeol Mu. I can look after him.

444
00:24:57,483 --> 00:24:58,722
That's not work.

445
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,552
I shouldn't be talking to you.

446
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:05,032
You went out early, but it's quite late now.

447
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:08,862
Why do you look so terrible?

448
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:17,972
What's wrong with her?

449
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,523
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

450
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:33,252
What on earth happened?

451
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:36,862
Did something happen while you were out?

452
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:38,933
I think...

453
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,733
my husband did commit suicide.

454
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:46,472
I went to the police to ask them to reinvestigate the case.

455
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:50,142
They showed me the resignation my husband wrote.

456
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:55,312
He didn't say one word to me about leaving the company.

457
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:58,113
Did you look at it with your own eyes?

458
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:01,012
Are you certain he wrote it?

459
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:02,653
Yes.

460
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,623
It was his handwriting.

461
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:09,192
I think the detectives are right.

462
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,292
How could he think about...

463
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:14,562
leaving the company and killing himself in secret?

464
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:18,632
How could he leave me and Yeol Mu?

465
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,692
I heard you did your MBA at Harvard.

466
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,023
Yes.

467
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:48,262
Do you know Kim Jun Seok by any chance?

468
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:50,963
He is my cousin.

469
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:54,572
He did his MBA at Harvard and came back to Korea last year.

470
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:00,072
I'm not sure. I really don't enjoy going to social gatherings.

471
00:27:06,882 --> 00:27:08,623
- Are you all right? - Yes.

472
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:12,393
I guess it's true. I heard you guys are so busy studying...

473
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:15,192
that you don't know each other unless you're the same year.

474
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:16,463
Yes.

475
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:19,062
Actually, before coming here,

476
00:27:19,162 --> 00:27:22,232
I wanted to get more information about you.

477
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:24,333
So I called my cousin.

478
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:28,403
He was in charge of the alumni club so he knows a lot of people.

479
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,042
But he said he can't really remember your name.

480
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:36,482
He wants me to introduce you later when I get the chance.

481
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:40,382
I'm sure there will be an opportunity to meet him later.

482
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:54,162
I'm so tired.

483
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:57,463
He was fine the past few days. Why is he in a bad mood now?

484
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,173
Is there a problem at the office?

485
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,903
No. There's nothing out of the ordinary.

486
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:08,073
I am back. My loving family.

487
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,513
Hae Ri, things must be going well for you.

488
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:12,112
Is it written on my face?

489
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:15,222
It's been a while that I've seen you smile so brightly.

490
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,552
Are you back together with the guy you broke up with?

491
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:19,352
What are you talking about?

492
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:20,352
Wow.

493
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,593
You are so sharp.

494
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:25,732
- What? - I patched things up with him.

495
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,432
Isn't it a historic day?

496
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:28,633
You crazy...

497
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,833
You come with me!

498
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,273
What did you do?

499
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:40,742
Like mother, like daughter. They are exactly alike.

500
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,282
When will they grow up?

501
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:47,753
It's my Woo Jae.

502
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:50,583
He is so photogenic.

503
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,922
Are you taunting me?

504
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:55,662
There is a limit to my patience.

505
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,963
You know what will happen if you don't do as you're told.

506
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,333
I will take care of...

507
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,333
If you do that, I'll ditch work and everything...

508
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,802
and vanish abroad.

509
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:07,273
- What? - It's not like I'm marrying him.

510
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,972
I just want to go out with him.

511
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:12,513
I am so stressed out at the office that I feel like dying.

512
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:14,343
If you don't let me go out with a guy,

513
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:15,813
I will die.

514
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,443
I'm not telling you not to go out with someone.

515
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:20,182
Go out as much as you want with guys from good families.

516
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,852
They are no fun.

517
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:24,383
- What? - I'm not attracted to other guys.

518
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:25,953
Right now,

519
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:28,722
I can only see Woo Jae.

520
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:32,463
Just until grandpa acknowledges me...

521
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:34,463
and I become the CEO of the company,

522
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:37,463
pretend that you don't know anything.

523
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:40,032
- You're seriously crazy. - Yes.

524
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,643
If Woo Jae isn't there to console me,

525
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:45,672
I can't do anything.

526
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,982
Do you know...

527
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:57,182
how many times I went around 18 holes?

528
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,162
Don't make this old guy suffer.

529
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,422
Please let me...

530
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:08,602
see you tomorrow. Please?

531
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,573
What is this?

532
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,412
I spent so much on this.

533
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:27,013
Where on earth did I lose the other shoe?

534
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,253
This is so weird.

535
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:44,763
At the gallery, it looked as if it was worth 5,000 dollars.

536
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:47,872
But it looks less than 50 dollars here.

537
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:52,542
That's why background is important for both people and objects.

538
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,213
Darn.

539
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:55,443
Yes.

540
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,852
Why do keep barging in here?

541
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:01,713
What is that painting?

542
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:03,953
I bought it.

543
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,753
You bought that? How much?

544
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:08,552
You paid 50 dollars?

545
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:11,323
You have such low standards.

546
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:12,992
Forget it. What do you want?

547
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,693
Let's go to a sauna.

548
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:18,432
I need to sweat and reduce any swelling before the contest.

549
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:20,102
I need to take care of my skin too.

550
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:22,242
I'm busy. Go with other women to places like that.

551
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:25,443
Bak Ha is in her room crying her eyes out.

552
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:27,472
Geum Hee is not back yet.

553
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:30,042
Mama hates places like that.

554
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:34,052
I will treat you to eggs boiled with mineral stones.

555
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,653
Please go with me.

556
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,552
I need to review my manuscript.

557
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,693
I promised the publishing company that I'll have it sent this week.

558
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:43,693
Let me read it.

559
00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:46,862
Will you be able to understand?

560
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:49,203
Don't underestimate me.

561
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:53,032
I read a truckload of romantic novels and comics.

562
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:55,403
I can tell by the first line...

563
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:59,843
if it will become a bestseller or not.

564
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:02,242
I don't need it to become a bestseller.

565
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,782
There is just one person who needs to read it.

566
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:08,253
Just one person? Who?

567
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:12,023
It's not you, so don't concern yourself.

568
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,163
Go away.

569
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:20,063
You spelled that wrong.

570
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:26,372
You have to cut the ends of the bean sprouts, not the head.

571
00:32:27,232 --> 00:32:28,272
Really?

572
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:31,742
Hey.

573
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:35,943
Don't you think Bak Ha is too quiet?

574
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,352
Have you finished crying?

575
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,522
Just listening to you crying,

576
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:52,262
the whole neighbourhood probably thought I died.

577
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,892
You've been crying for hours.

578
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:56,303
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:59,132
Of course, you should be sorry.

580
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:01,902
Other people are living here too, so how do you think they feel...

581
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,843
listening to you wail like that?

582
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:08,112
Mak Rye, don't go overboard.

583
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:11,313
I'm letting you off the hook because this is your first time.

584
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:14,512
If you wail like that once more, I will make you leave.

585
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:18,652
I have something to tell you.

586
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:20,553
What is it?

587
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,963
I think I should go back to the countryside.

588
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,293
Why would you do that?

589
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:31,833
I thought my husband died unfairly.

590
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:36,002
And I came to Seoul only thinking of bringing him justice.

591
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:38,913
It's no use now.

592
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:42,073
I have no reason to live.

593
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:47,752
Really? That's a good idea.

594
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:48,923
You can leave.

595
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:49,923
Mak Rye.

596
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:51,752
I want you to leave right now.

597
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:55,053
I have no desire to rent my room to a weakling like you.

598
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:56,862
Why are you telling her to leave?

599
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:58,293
What are you saying?

600
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:01,132
You weren't talking to Mr. Choi?

601
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,563
You were telling Bak Ha to leave?

602
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,433
Why are you standing there like that?

603
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,232
Go right now and pack your bags.

604
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,203
Don't you hear me?

605
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,472
We are back.

606
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:19,583
Is something the matter?

607
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,652
I told you to leave right now.

608
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:24,053
I'll pack your bags for you.

609
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:25,522
Wait.

610
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:28,622
Mama Bok is so mad.

611
00:34:28,622 --> 00:34:30,563
Mak Rye, stop that.

612
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:33,463
Calm down and let's talk.

613
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:36,902
Mak Rye, calm down.

614
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:38,632
What?

615
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:41,502
"It's no use and you have no reason to live?"

616
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:44,303
How can you say that...

617
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:47,543
looking at your sleeping son who has no one to trust but you?

618
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,683
When he was born into this world, his father wasn't here.

619
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:55,752
And his mom is always whining.

620
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:57,923
What? "It's no use and you have no reason to live?"

621
00:34:57,923 --> 00:34:59,252
If you keep whining like that,

622
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:01,122
how can this little thing go on living?

623
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:05,862
Why? Did you hope to get a free ride on your husband's back?

624
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,563
Now that he is not here,

625
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,963
you want to chicken out and run away?

626
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,872
I don't want to live with such a coward.

627
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,933
Please don't be so angry.

628
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:17,902
You know she didn't mean it like that.

629
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:20,943
If you are so unsure of yourself, you should leave your son here.

630
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:23,142
I don't know how much longer I will live,

631
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:26,152
but it will be better for me to take care of him.

632
00:35:29,453 --> 00:35:31,683
I am sorry.

633
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:33,293
Please forgive me.

634
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:35,152
There is a long line...

635
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:37,522
of people who want to stay at my inn.

636
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:38,963
Empty this room.

637
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:42,732
I will refund you the money, so don't worry and leave.

638
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:49,242
Don't be angry at what she says.

639
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:54,043
She is saying that for your benefit.

640
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:55,242
I know.

641
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,752
You can't go anywhere else. You have to live with us.

642
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:06,152
That's right. You should know what Mama is like by now.

643
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:08,522
You shouldn't have said that.

644
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:11,063
You deserved her scolding.

645
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:38,222
Hae Jun.

646
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,392
Hae Jun, how was it?

647
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:41,622
Did you two go on a date?

648
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:44,793
No, we just had some coffee and said goodbye.

649
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,492
What have you been doing until now?

650
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:49,663
I went to the studio and banged on the drums.

651
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:53,472
It's been a while and I feel tired. I should wash and go to bed.

652
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:55,602
Did you not like her?

653
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:57,803
She is like a country girl.

654
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,512
What are you talking about?

655
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:02,882
She is the youngest daughter of SUNMI Group. She is a dark horse.

656
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,752
She is not a dark horse. She is just dark.

657
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:09,423
I don't like people who don't understand.

658
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:11,583
When I'm with people who only talk about themselves,

659
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,593
it really stresses me out. I get so irritated.

660
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,522
She doesn't understand you?

661
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:19,833
Honestly, I was very disappointed in you today.

662
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,833
You know I have very high standards. How could you pick someone like her?

663
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,703
It was that bad?

664
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,833
This is the first time so I won't say anything more.

665
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,742
But if you keep introducing me to anyone,

666
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:33,443
our relationship as mother and son will get hurt.

667
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:34,612
Hae Jun.

668
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,953
He is so picky.

669
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:48,093
He has such high standards just like me.

670
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,813
Bak Ha, can you come out for a moment?

671
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,083
Are you all right?

672
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:20,222
I heard what happened from Poong Ki.

673
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:25,492
I am sorry for worrying everyone.

674
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:31,262
When I thought...

675
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:36,772
Yeol Mu was abandoned by his dad,

676
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:41,073
everything suddenly became meaningless.

677
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:44,283
I said a stupid thing to Mama Bok.

678
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:47,652
She probably didn't mean what she said.

679
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,622
So don't be angry at her.

680
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:03,732
She really has a temper.

681
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,602
She said that because she was worried Bak Ha will become weak.

682
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:09,203
She gave her the bitter medicine so that she'll come to her senses.

683
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:11,402
I came to my senses.

684
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:17,742
It was as if she was speaking to me.

685
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,583
It was like I was hit on the head with the hammer.

686
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,752
Did you feel like that?

687
00:39:24,382 --> 00:39:25,783
I felt the same too.

688
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:30,093
True. I felt extremely guilty too.

689
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,892
Me too, a little.

690
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:38,463
Maybe it's because of all the commotion, but I feel weak.

691
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:39,872
I am hungry.

692
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:42,232
Shall we eat cup ramyeons?

693
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:45,843
Can I use the kitchen?

694
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:02,823
I don't need the cap for cooking snacks.

695
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:05,193
You haven't cooked for a long time, so this is a historic day.

696
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:07,063
You have to wear a cap.

697
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:10,862
True. It's been so long since I've been in a kitchen.

698
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:15,902
Make full use of your skills. And surprise everyone here.

699
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:19,313
I will do what I normally do. I don't need to do anything special.

700
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:30,522
(Nakwon Inn)

701
00:40:30,522 --> 00:40:32,152
Everyone gather around!

702
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,193
Pizza is here.

703
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:37,222
Come on Mama.

704
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,093
- They look good. - Thank you.

705
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:43,102
Come on out.

706
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,202
Aren't you packing your bags?

707
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,402
I was wrong.

708
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,043
Please forgive me just this once.

709
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:59,112
They say an accident can be the boss for life.

710
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,912
Be cool and forgive her this time.

711
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,553
You can play baby only once.

712
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:05,952
You can't do it twice.

713
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:09,493
If I do it twice, I won't exist.

714
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:12,462
At least you can talk.

715
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:13,892
What's all this?

716
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,733
Everyone seemed to have missed dinner.

717
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,372
So my husband cooked pizza.

718
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:23,273
I am not sure if you will like it, but please try a slice.

719
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:25,573
- Yes. - Okay.

720
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:26,813
- Wow. - Here.

721
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:30,543
This tastes great!

722
00:41:32,682 --> 00:41:33,952
It totally tastes great.

723
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,182
It's better than delivery pizza, isn't it?

724
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:41,093
This doesn't just taste great,

725
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:43,392
it's good enough to open a pizza restaurant.

726
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:46,632
Can I become your partner if I invest?

727
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,962
You hardly have enough to pay for your room. How can you invest?

728
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:52,533
How can you talk like that in front of the kids?

729
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,632
How can I save face?

730
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:57,642
Sorry.

731
00:41:58,543 --> 00:41:59,712
No problem.

732
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:01,973
- Do you like it? - Of course.

733
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:03,243
Can you make this every day?

734
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:06,253
It's so delicious.

735
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,652
What did you do to this pizza?

736
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,553
Nothing special, really.

737
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:15,593
- Please enjoy them. - Please enjoy.

738
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:17,993
It melts in your mouth.

739
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:19,462
Please have more.

740
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:21,892
Is there more?

741
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,503
Here.

742
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:36,442
(Nakwon Inn)

743
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:39,412
(Postbox, To: Geum Bak Ha)

744
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:45,483
You're so diligent.

745
00:42:45,652 --> 00:42:47,122
Did you go out for a jog?

746
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:48,122
Yes.

747
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:50,922
This body needs to be maintained.

748
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,493
I run 10km every morning.

749
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:56,362
You're always bragging.

750
00:42:57,862 --> 00:42:59,402
Isn't Bak Ha awake yet?

751
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:01,833
Good morning.

752
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:03,843
Hi Bak Ha. There's a letter for you.

753
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:05,902
- For me? - Yes.

754
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,212
Your name is written on it.

755
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:11,483
(Your husband didn't commit suicide, He tried his best until the end.)

756
00:43:13,412 --> 00:43:15,313
Did you see the person who gave you this letter?

757
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:18,523
No. I saw it in the postbox so I brought it in.

758
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:20,753
Bak Ha.

759
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:28,093
I don't know.

760
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:41,412
Who could have sent this letter?

761
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:42,743
Why?

762
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:51,323
(Your husband didn't commit suicide. He tried his best until the end.)

763
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:00,993
Hello.

764
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:02,932
Are you Ms. Geum Bak Ha?

765
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:05,803
Yes, this is she. Who are you?

766
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:08,573
I'm Na Hae Ri, the marketing director of Guseong Hotel.

767
00:44:08,672 --> 00:44:09,942
I would like to meet you.

768
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,303
Me?

769
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:13,412
How long will it take you to come to the hotel?

770
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,872
Why do you...

771
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:18,083
It's not something to talk about over the phone.

772
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:19,813
We should meet.

773
00:44:20,212 --> 00:44:21,553
We can talk when we meet.

774
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:23,382
Hello.

775
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:27,852
Strange.

776
00:44:28,223 --> 00:44:31,263
Why would she want to see me?

777
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:32,833
Hurrah!

778
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:36,563
Hurrah! Hurrah!

779
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:37,763
Hurrah!

780
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:40,233
What's wrong?

781
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:43,702
I got in!

782
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:44,973
I passed!

783
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,712
Where did you get in?

784
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,872
- The Gold Miss Korea Contest. - Yes?

785
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:52,212
I just got the call that I passed the preliminaries.

786
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:56,182
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

787
00:44:57,023 --> 00:44:58,682
- This is great. - Yes.

788
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:01,753
Sunlight is finally shining on my life.

789
00:45:01,753 --> 00:45:03,892
You will come in first place for sure.

790
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:05,593
I think so too.

791
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,462
I looked around when I went to hand in my application.

792
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:11,702
My appearance stood out from the rest of them.

793
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:12,902
Right.

794
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,043
Miss Korea.

795
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:23,942
(Film Crew)

796
00:45:33,152 --> 00:45:34,293
Welcome, Director.

797
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:35,493
- Hello. - Yes.

798
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,692
A TV crew is here?

799
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:40,392
Yes. A film crew from the golf channel is here to film.

800
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:42,093
- The golf channel? - Yes.

801
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:45,803
Here we go for the next scene.

802
00:45:45,803 --> 00:45:47,402
1, 2, 3.

803
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:49,473
Standby, cue.

804
00:45:49,902 --> 00:45:52,973
Hello, viewers of Gam Poong Ki's golf show.

805
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:55,773
I'm your coach, Gam Poong Ki.

806
00:45:58,612 --> 00:46:01,452
Instead of coming to you from the stuffy indoor driving range,

807
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,122
I came outdoors today.

808
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:06,852
This is Guseong Hotel's golf course where I work as the coach.

809
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:08,253
Isn't it so nice?

810
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:11,392
This time I want to talk to you about putting.

811
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:22,872
You practice a great deal on your drive and iron short game.

812
00:46:22,942 --> 00:46:26,543
But there are unexpectedly many people who are lazy about putting.

813
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:29,142
You can lose points for each putt.

814
00:46:29,142 --> 00:46:32,013
That's like ruining your nearly cooked meal.

815
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,053
This is my first tip.

816
00:46:37,323 --> 00:46:38,922
Go long when putting.

817
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:42,753
People tend to aim for the exact distance.

818
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:44,723
But grass conditions differ each day.

819
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:47,632
The ball needs enough power to pass the hole...

820
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:50,632
to get the ball in the hole, so look a meter past.

821
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:52,803
You need to practice making a more daring shot.

822
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,973
If you want to succeed in putting and in love,

823
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:56,942
you have to go a little further.

824
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:35,642
What is this?

825
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:39,382
This is sort of like severance pay when an employee retires early.

826
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:43,122
Of course, it's not applicable to your husband,

827
00:47:43,122 --> 00:47:44,852
but I arranged for it personally.

828
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:46,283
Why?

829
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:47,553
What?

830
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:52,162
Why are you giving me this when it's not applicable to him?

831
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:57,102
The company can't compensate you officially,

832
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:59,563
but as someone in charge of Marketing,

833
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:03,973
and as a woman, I felt bad. I wanted to help you personally.

834
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:14,352
I would like to decline.

835
00:48:16,922 --> 00:48:20,152
Didn't you want to see the president because you needed money?

836
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:22,892
I will give you that money, so stop what you are doing...

837
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:24,093
and go back to your hometown.

838
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:26,493
Live your life taking care of your baby comfortably.

839
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:32,033
I think you misunderstood.

840
00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:35,473
I didn't ask to see the president or ask for a reinvestigation...

841
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:36,503
for money.

842
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:39,273
I want to find out why he made that choice.

843
00:48:39,642 --> 00:48:42,172
I want to reveal the secret.

844
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:46,243
He was caught embezzling money.

845
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:50,422
What's there to reveal when he died leaving his wife and baby?

846
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:53,652
Stop being stubborn and take the money.

847
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:58,023
This will be enough for you to open a small shop back home.

848
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:06,033
Yes.

849
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,632
I know for sure now.

850
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,803
My husband's death...

851
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:15,573
seemed suspicious and it also seemed like an accident.

852
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,182
I felt so confused.

853
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,852
Now I am sure there is something suspicious going on.

854
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,652
- What? - There must be something.

855
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:26,593
Isn't that why you called me secretly and are trying to bribe me?

856
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,053
Am I wrong?

857
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:33,533
I felt sorry for you, so I was trying to be nice and to help you.

858
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:34,993
Who do you think you are?

859
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,362
I don't need pity from you.

860
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:42,273
I am not that desperate.

861
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,202
I don't think you are in a position to have any pride.

862
00:49:48,813 --> 00:49:49,942
What did you say?

863
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:53,652
I felt sorry for a country mouse and tried to help you.

864
00:49:53,652 --> 00:49:55,583
Who do you think you are?

865
00:49:58,352 --> 00:50:00,952
Do you even know how much is in here?

866
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:03,823
The amount could be so different from what you think.

867
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:10,333
Even if you give me millions, I won't accept that kind of money.

868
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:13,303
That kind of money?

869
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:17,743
Your husband died because of that kind of money.

870
00:50:21,112 --> 00:50:24,043
You should be grateful and take the money when I give it to you.

871
00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:25,642
How dare you refuse it!

872
00:50:26,182 --> 00:50:27,952
I want to make myself clear.

873
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:31,023
If this is an act hoping for more money, then you are mistaken.

874
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:32,553
There won't be any more deals.

875
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:36,793
I thought about it...

876
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:40,833
What's wrong?

877
00:50:41,962 --> 00:50:43,902
Did you just hit my cousin?

878
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:46,773
This is an assault.

879
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:49,902
What are you doing here?

880
00:50:49,902 --> 00:50:51,743
I have my reasons.

881
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:53,243
How dare you?

882
00:50:58,043 --> 00:51:01,053
Why is this woman in your office?

883
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:05,523
Is she your cousin?

884
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,323
Yes. What's it to you?

885
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:11,223
Arrogance must run in your family.

886
00:51:11,922 --> 00:51:13,593
Why you...

887
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:15,493
- Are you finished? - No.

888
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:17,602
I have so much to say.

889
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:21,233
But I have to leave because it's time to feed my baby.

890
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:30,813
What's going on here?

891
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:33,352
Why are you meeting with her?

892
00:51:43,662 --> 00:51:45,523
There is something going on for sure.

893
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:52,000
You are all dead
