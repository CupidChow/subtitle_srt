(Guseong Hotel)

11
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:15,720
Make way!

12
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,560
Please step back.

13
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,301
- What's with your shoe? - What's wrong with it?

14
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,210
The heel is coming off.

15
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,470
It's all right. I'll fix it with superglue.

16
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,611
Don't be too late, all right?

17
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:38,810
I won't!

18
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,810
You only got a fine because you're a first offender.

19
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,051
Get caught selling knockoff golf clubs again,

20
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:16,750
and you'll be behind bars.

21
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,690
I've never even spat gum on the pavement before.

22
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,661
I was duped too.

23
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:28,201
I'm not kidding. I really am not.

24
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,331
Wait.

25
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:31,701
Officer, wait! I'm not...

26
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,981
Well, you were released early.

27
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,710
You seem fine too.

28
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,720
Released? I didn't do time in prison, you know.

29
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,881
Come on.

30
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:51,690
I'll treat you to tofu stew at a nearby restaurant this evening.

31
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,520
Tofu must be eaten after being released from prison.

32
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,190
- Call? - As if.

33
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,500
I can't believe I had to spend time in a holding cell because of you.

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,430
I got caught selling knockoff golf clubs...

35
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,571
and that almost made me a convicted felon.

36
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,500
How will you make this up to me?

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,940
How will you pay me back for the damage you caused?

38
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,111
Make it up to you? Pay you back for damages?

39
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,180
Is that your way of asking me...

40
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,351
to take care of you for the rest of your life?

41
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,361
You handsy jerk.

42
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,490
Was that your way of testing the waters?

43
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,091
The waters?

44
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,760
You tried to find out whether...

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,830
you'd ever have a chance with me.

46
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,870
Are you kidding me?

47
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,940
Hear me loud and clear.

48
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,640
I don't date colleagues...

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,481
nor do I date coworkers.

50
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:50,950
So take any feelings you have for me,

51
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,950
stuff them in a bag, and throw it out.

52
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,080
Move.

53
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,580
(Nakwon Inn)

54
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,690
A trip to a holding cell...

55
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,961
has worsened her narcissism.

56
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,390
Gosh, help us.

57
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,060
Mama Bok, I'm home.

58
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm back.

59
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,140
Where is she?

60
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,070
The holding cell spirit in cuffs,

61
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,870
the knockoff spirit, and the spinster spirit.

62
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,880
Let this salt force you to leave her body.

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,411
Seriously? I can't believe you'd go this far.

64
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,010
Just look at you.

65
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,380
The only explanation for your actions...

66
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,950
is that you're possessed.

67
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,521
There must be a spirit or a goblin controlling you.

68
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,031
You even perform exorcisms for your guests.

69
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,330
The service here is great, Mama Bok.

70
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,930
Shut it. About 20 goblins are possessing you too.

71
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,171
That's right, and let's not forget the spirit...

72
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,801
who thinks of women all the time.

73
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:51,440
You're guilty of that too.

74
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,010
Why is it so quiet though?

75
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,380
The lady in Room One went back home...

76
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,911
and the girl in Room Two...

77
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,450
went to live in a dorm provided for employees.

78
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,010
Mr. Seo in Room Three...

79
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,380
went back home after reconciling with his wife.

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,120
That's great.

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,921
What about Mr. Byun in Room Four?

82
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,560
He was diagnosed with dementia and was sent to a nursing home.

83
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,830
And how long are you two going to stay here?

84
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,601
You're both nearly 50 now.

85
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,240
You should save up enough for a yearly rental...

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,041
and live in your own homes.

87
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,271
- Don't worry. - Don't worry.

88
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,640
- All it takes is one lucky strike. - All it takes is one lucky strike.

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,351
How is it that you two are so alike?

90
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:35,481
All you care about is looking good on the outside.

91
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,820
- Gosh. - My gosh.

92
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,151
- The salt... - The salt...

93
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:41,390
- Is anyone here? - I just had this washed.

94
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,021
Excuse me.

95
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:44,690
Are you here for a room?

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,430
Wait, you look familiar. Have we met?

97
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,971
- Me? - Yes.

98
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:56,500
This inn doesn't accept guests who only stay for a few days.

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,911
Monthly fees must be paid.

100
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,510
That reminds me...

101
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:03,341
It's been a while, Mak Rye.

102
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,411
It's me, Geo Bok.

103
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,921
Choi Geo Bok.

104
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,651
Choi Geo Bok?

105
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,021
That's right.

106
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:15,260
My gosh. You good-for-nothing jerk.

107
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,661
How dare you come here.

108
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,361
How dare you show yourself.

109
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,361
Darn it!

110
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,200
Mama Bok, please calm down.

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,671
Mama Bok, who is she?

112
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,841
I'd run away from him even if we met by chance...

113
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:32,640
on the way to the underworld, so how dare he comes here.

114
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,711
Who does he think he is?

115
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,640
Mama Bok, please calm down.

116
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,010
Please use your words instead of getting physical.

117
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,851
Get him out of here. I want him gone.

118
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,291
Now! Right now.

119
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,791
Mak Rye, stay with us.

120
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,461
Wake up! Get some water.

121
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,130
- Now! Mama, wake up. - Water...

122
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,161
Mak Rye!

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,630
Just a second.

124
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,901
- You can't. - How dare you block my way.

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,041
Move aside.

126
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,940
- You can't. - Move.

127
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,171
- No. - What's this ruckus about?

128
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,240
She's trying to meet President Na...

129
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,380
even though she doesn't have an appointment.

130
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:14,080
What business do you have with him, young lady?

131
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,921
I see you're a mother, not a young girl.

132
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,351
My husband is Kang Jin Gu,

133
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,791
an employee of Guseong Resort's Accounting Department.

134
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,190
Oh...

135
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,461
I have something to ask the president.

136
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,630
- Ma'am, please leave... - Hold on.

137
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,901
Let me show her the way.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,440
Thank you.

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,911
(Gallery Director Oh In Sook)

140
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,781
Hello, Manager Park, is President Na back?

141
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,751
What? Kang Jin Gu's wife?

142
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,791
Why isn't the security team doing their job?

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,090
Do Hee did what?

144
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,641
- My gosh. - Goodness gracious.

145
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,671
- Oh, dear. - How sad.

146
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,440
What a tragedy.

147
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,391
Jin Gu...

148
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,901
Jin Gu...

149
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,241
Jin Gu!

150
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,771
What brings you by?

151
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,781
I'm sure you know Kang Jin Gu...

152
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,551
from Guseong Resort's Accounting Department.

153
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,450
I'm Geum Bak Ha, his wife.

154
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,051
Why do you want to meet the president though?

155
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,450
My husband...

156
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,921
would never embezzle money from the company.

157
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,891
And he'd never...

158
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,100
commit suicide when we're expecting a child.

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,901
This is wrong.

160
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,600
He must've been framed.

161
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,871
Framed?

162
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,970
Why are you questioning what the police already figured out?

163
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,310
You should be grateful that we're not pressing charges.

164
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,741
Just ask everyone.

165
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,350
Ask his colleagues and his neighbors.

166
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,911
Ask them about him.

167
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,350
He'd never do such a thing.

168
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,651
From the looks of it, you're with child...

169
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,560
and I feel bad for you.

170
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
However, you can't make ridiculous claims.

171
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
Go home, wrap up the funeral, and have your baby.

172
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,970
Until I find out why my husband died,

173
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,171
I won't sign off on a funeral.

174
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,700
Just know that.

175
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,871
Do Hee, what are you doing here?

176
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:56,310
Well, Manager Park wasn't in,

177
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,011
so I thought I'd bring the tea.

178
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,310
It's rooibos tea.

179
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,781
There's no caffeine in it, so don't worry.

180
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,690
Thank you.

181
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,021
Don't you have a reunion to get to?

182
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,560
Goodness. Is it that time already?

183
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,901
I hope it goes well with President Na.

184
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,761
I'm sorry I can't stick around.

185
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,730
It's all right. Thank you.

186
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,631
- I'll see you around. - Sure.

187
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,771
Have a good day, In Sook.

188
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,580
Talking to Mr. Na won't change anything,

189
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,551
- so... - I can wait for him...

190
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,021
while sipping tea.

191
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,161
So don't be bothered by me...

192
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,860
and go back to your work.

193
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,560
What did you say?

194
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,401
There's definitely something.

195
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,141
Something definitely stinks.

196
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:56,840
Mom, it's Princess Hae Ri.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,610
Pick up. Hurry. Right now.

198
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,210
What now?

199
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,781
I might go crazy at this rate.

200
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:10,320
Staying home all day is suffocating me into insanity.

201
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,491
Don't you dare leave the house.

202
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,121
If you do, that'll be the end of things.

203
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,161
Also, don't post anything on social media either.

204
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,291
What?

205
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:21,360
Then I'll really go crazy.

206
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,230
Go ahead. Go completely nuts.

207
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,011
She's an evil witch in disguise.

208
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,680
Her being my stepmother is the only explanation.

209
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,011
Anyway,

210
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,320
why hasn't he called all day?

211
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:58,600
I see there's a visitor.

212
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,371
You don't seem like someone from the neighborhood.

213
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,241
It seems like you made this trip purposely from afar.

214
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,871
How do you know the deceased?

215
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,381
I... We're acquaintances.

216
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,051
You came a long way,

217
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,651
so I apologize for his family not being here.

218
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,621
Does the deceased...

219
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,350
not have family?

220
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,190
Of course, he does.

221
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,491
He has a wife with a tummy so big...

222
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,090
that she could give birth at any moment.

223
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,100
Do you perhaps know where his wife is?

224
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,230
Let go of me!

225
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,100
This isn't a place for people like you to waltz in.

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,541
So make an appointment if you wish to meet the president.

227
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,440
An innocent man died.

228
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,411
I don't have the time...

229
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:44,381
to go through proper channels.

230
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,850
Have you no shame?

231
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,220
How dare you barge in here with demands...

232
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,551
when your husband made us suffer a big financial loss?

233
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,820
Exactly. That's why I'm hoping President Na will uncover the truth.

234
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,791
Enough. Get her out of here.

235
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
You can't do this. This isn't right.

236
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,401
Just let me talk to the president.

237
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,031
Please!

238
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,340
Let go of me. Let go!

239
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,840
Touch me again and I will report you.

240
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,281
What's that noise?

241
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:17,751
Don't you feel bad for my unborn baby?

242
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,551
Our lives depend on what the president can do.

243
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,080
Let go of me.

244
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,051
President Na, please!

245
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:27,960
How dare you treat me this way.

246
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,531
I rode the bus for three hours to get here.

247
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,761
I refuse to leave without seeing you.

248
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,100
- Sir! - What?

249
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,100
No way.

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,921
Your due date isn't for another few days.

251
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:01,291
Yeol Mu,

252
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,360
let's go to your dad.

253
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,761
Your dad must be lonely by himself.

254
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,161
Let's go.

255
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,330
(Nakwon Inn)

256
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:15,940
Nakwon Inn.

257
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,970
The name feels inviting.

258
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,241
Honey, let's stay the night here.

259
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:27,080
But we agreed to enjoy a night in Guseong Hotel's suite room.

260
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,580
I changed my mind.

261
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,850
We'll sleep here instead.

262
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,521
I want you to enjoy a luxurious night today.

263
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,590
Take a bubble bath in a fancy bathroom...

264
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,830
and order delicious food up to our room.

265
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,631
It's our last night together.

266
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,641
Nakwon Inn.

267
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,570
I love it.

268
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,350
I feel like it will take us up to the skies tomorrow.

269
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,651
Don't cry, honey.

270
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,761
Are you here for a room?

271
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,291
Yes.

272
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,430
Are you the owner?

273
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:19,131
No, not the owner. I'm a guest.

274
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:20,871
Is there a vacancy?

275
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,741
There is.

276
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,411
Can I ask...

277
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,940
what your relationship is?

278
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,610
We're a married couple.

279
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,210
Are you really a married couple?

280
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,881
What are you getting at?

281
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,320
Yes, we're married.

282
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:43,220
Please don't take this the wrong way.

283
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,230
It's just that the owner is picky with her guests.

284
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,631
She can especially sniff out adultery from a mile away,

285
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:50,930
so she'll kick you out.

286
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,031
That's bold for a crappy old inn.

287
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,840
Also, she doesn't accept guests who only stay for a few days.

288
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,180
You know,

289
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,281
she only accepts guests who stay for more than a month.

290
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,511
Unbelievable. We're good then.

291
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,301
Please help me, Yeol Mu.

292
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,801
Come on.

293
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,771
We must take the bus and go to your dad.

294
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:40,080
We must get on that bus...

295
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,721
to go to your dad.

296
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,691
Just a little more.

297
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:03,741
Let's go.

298
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,971
He said the place doesn't accept one-nighters.

299
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:13,110
It's still cheaper than one night in Guseong Hotel.

300
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,551
We'll pay for the whole month.

301
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:21,521
Then head inside and sit down for an interview.

302
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,590
An interview?

303
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,590
We need to do an interview to get a room here?

304
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,761
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

305
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,471
If you're here at Nakwon Inn, you need to stick to its rules.

306
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,731
That is how we roll at Nakwon Inn.

307
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Poong Ki.

308
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,100
Oh, there you are.

309
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,380
He's a friend of mine who's also a new guest here.

310
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,511
Sorry I'm late. I had someplace to be.

311
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,511
Gosh. Let's head inside.

312
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,820
Anyway, make sure you do well on the interview.

313
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,890
We'll sit down for an interview too.

314
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,890
Honey.

315
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,261
Honey, please.

316
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,031
Why aren't you coming inside with those calming pills?

317
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,031
Mama Bok is close to losing it completely.

318
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,130
Sorry.

319
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,771
Anyway, they're hoping to get a room here.

320
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,670
And this is my friend.

321
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,610
He'll be staying here too starting today.

322
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,610
Hello.

323
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,211
Are you pro golfer Kim Woo Jae?

324
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,620
And here I thought you just carried the golf clubs.

325
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,721
I'm surprised that you recognized a pro golfer.

326
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,991
Woo Jae, I'm a fan.

327
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,360
Can I get an autograph?

328
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
Let's all head inside first.

329
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,130
- Come on. - You're more handsome in person.

330
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,600
Wait.

331
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,100
Help.

332
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:42,801
What?

333
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,941
My gosh. Are you all right?

334
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,340
I think she's having contractions.

335
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,451
- She's having a baby? - She's having a baby?

336
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,110
I think her water broke already.

337
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,221
I'll call an ambulance.

338
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,880
I think the baby will come before they get here.

339
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,991
Let's take her inside.

340
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,021
She'll have the baby on the street at this rate.

341
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,961
- That's right. - Here.

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,400
This won't do. I'll carry her. I'm a professional at this.

343
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,761
Quickly. Put her on my back.

344
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:19,271
I know I don't have the right to say anything,

345
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:21,481
but...

346
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,281
I came looking for you after 50 years.

347
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,051
If our time together meant anything to you,

348
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:31,181
then please let me stay here at least for tonight.

349
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,890
"Our time together"?

350
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:37,560
Unbelievable. You want to be slapped, don't you?

351
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:39,761
Mama, code blue!

352
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,400
Code blue.

353
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,701
- Who's this? - She...

354
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,170
fainted right outside on the street.

355
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,001
The baby must be coming. Her water broke.

356
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,441
Then you should've taken her to the hospital...

357
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,441
not bring her in here.

358
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,541
Her water broke, so the baby is coming.

359
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,451
A hospital is not an option right now.

360
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,650
You have no sympathy for others, do you?

361
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,681
Why are you still standing there?

362
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,521
Hurry up and bring her inside.

363
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,890
Eun Ji, bring me warm water.

364
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,491
You'll deliver the baby here?

365
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,521
What else can we do? Don't worry though.

366
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,261
I've brought more than 10 babies into this world.

367
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,531
This is nothing. Just bring her inside.

368
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,701
Over there. Hurry.

369
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,070
- Then... - What are you doing?

370
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:21,301
- Hurry! - Unbelievable.

371
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:23,441
Mak Rye, you...

372
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,211
(Bok Mak Rye)

373
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,741
(Choi Geo Bok)

374
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,481
(Gam Poong Ki, Bang Eun Ji)

375
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,211
(Choi Man Ho, Yang Geum Hee)

376
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,021
(Kim Woo Jae)

377
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,620
(Geum Bak Ha)

378
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,660
(Two days ago)

379
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,431
You're going too fast. Oh, no.

380
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,301
Be careful.

381
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,830
Yeol Mu, your mom and dad...

382
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,501
are on their way to take wedding photos.

383
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,570
Look at him. How cool is your dad?

384
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,910
Gosh, I almost went blind.

385
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:03,011
Your mom is shining so brightly...

386
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,150
that I can hardly pedal in a straight line.

387
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,810
You big fat liar.

388
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,850
It's not a lie. That's the truth.

389
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeol Mu, you and I are the luckiest two men on earth.

390
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:16,491
I have the prettiest wife in the world,

391
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,491
and you will soon meet the prettiest mom ever to exist.

392
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:21,931
I have the wisest man for a husband...

393
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:25,600
and a sweet child who never caused morning sickness.

394
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,670
I am the luckiest woman on earth.

395
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,870
Thank you, Jin Gu.

396
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,810
Thank you, Bak Ha.

397
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,110
Let's go!

398
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,711
Let's ride.

399
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,810
Room Six!

400
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,751
Didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?

401
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,660
Living in an inn is nothing to brag about,

402
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,360
so enough with the nickname.

403
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,531
Would you like it if I called you Room Five...

404
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,900
in return?

405
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,001
It's become a habit, that's all. I'm sorry.

406
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,830
Anyway, what are you doing here?

407
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,570
I'm here to work.

408
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,501
What about you?

409
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,271
I brought my clients to observe the game...

410
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:09,781
and I'll be cheering my friend on too.

411
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:12,650
That reminds me. Room Six, how about I set you up?

412
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,721
- A blind date? - Room Six...

413
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:19,390
I mean, Eun Ji, looks don't matter that much to you.

414
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Also, you're open to men 20 years younger or older than you.

415
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:25,431
That depends on their condition.

416
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
He's quite wealthy, you know.

417
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,701
I hear he's worth over 10 million dollars.

418
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,630
Really? I'm in.

419
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:33,701
You're in?

420
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:36,100
Okay, I'll text you when and where.

421
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
- Sure. - I need to meet my friend,

422
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,310
- but I'll text you. - Sure, take care.

423
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,981
If things go well, I'll treat you to something expensive.

424
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:45,281
Thanks.

425
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:47,451
- Okay. - Okay.

426
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,590
Who knew that I'd be...

427
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,691
thanking him for something?

428
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,630
Woo Jae!

429
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,261
From what I saw out there,

430
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,301
you'll definitely be in the top three.

431
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,301
Maintaining my seed in the tournament...

432
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,670
is enough for me at the moment.

433
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,241
You're just being modest.

434
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,900
That's not what it is.

435
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,241
Can I get some iced coffee?

436
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Hello.

437
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,221
Let me officially introduce you to one another.

438
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:30,261
She is Na Hae Ri, the granddaughter of Guseong Group's President Na.

439
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,291
And he is...

440
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,961
Lee Shin U, the eldest son of Hangang Group's chairman.

441
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,160
I hear he's the most eligible bachelor in Korea.

442
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,231
It's a pleasure to meet you.

443
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,431
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

444
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,041
Why don't continue seated?

445
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,100
- Sure. - All right.

446
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,711
The view is great during this time of year.

447
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:54,981
Our resort is hosting a KPGA Championship tomorrow,

448
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:59,021
so we asked you here so that you could enjoy the game.

449
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,840
Skipping the wedding is one thing,

450
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,551
but maybe we should've gone on a honeymoon.

451
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:27,610
Why would we waste our money?

452
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,320
Look.

453
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,491
The world's prettiest sea...

454
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,521
is all around us.

455
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,820
Then instead of skipping the honeymoon,

456
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,660
we should've at least dined someplace fancy.

457
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:41,491
Just so you know,

458
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,001
the webfoot octopus ramyeon you make...

459
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,701
is my favorite dish.

460
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:47,771
It subsided my morning sickness.

461
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,170
Still, you only get one wedding day.

462
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,441
I'm good.

463
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,181
If I had more money in my pocket,

464
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,491
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

465
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,060
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,890
Stop spewing nonsense...

467
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:17,261
and get back to your fishing rod.

468
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,431
Go.

469
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,801
All right.

470
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:23,041
- What's with your shoe? - What's wrong with it?

471
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,201
Let me see.

472
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,241
There's nearly a hole in it.

473
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,041
The heel is coming off.

474
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,610
It's all right. I'll fix it with superglue.

475
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,880
What?

476
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,251
Wait, it's the office. Hold on.

477
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,120
Yes, this is Kang Jin Gu.

478
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:43,521
What?

479
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,090
Yes.

480
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,001
Yes, I'm on my way.

481
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,370
What's wrong?

482
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,801
I have to go to the office.

483
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:00,340
- Is something wrong? - I won't know until I get there.

484
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,110
You must be hungry though. Eat the ramyeon first.

485
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,451
I will when I get back.

486
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,251
Jin Gu!

487
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:09,920
I'll call you.

488
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:14,791
I won't eat until you get back.

489
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,491
Don't be too late, all right?

490
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,590
Got it!

491
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:31,952
(The 2019 62nd KPGA Championship)

492
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:33,417
(Episode 2)

493
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,759
What are you doing?

494
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,998
Tell me what's going on here.

495
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,068
Please leave.

496
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:54,599
We're National Tax Service investigators doing a lawful search.

497
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,769
If you hinder us, you'll be punished by law.

498
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:01,778
(Assistant Manager Kang Jin Gu)

499
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,258
I said, leave!

500
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:20,958
Okay. I'm leaving right now.

501
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,639
Hello.

502
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:37,038
Do Hee must have prepared a surprise for when Hae Jun comes back.

503
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,308
We can catch the rat in the house later.

504
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,749
First, we should deal with what already happened.

505
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:44,788
Kang Jin Gu? Who was that?

506
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:47,389
Is he the one who was accompanying you to Singapore?

507
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:50,058
Hello, Father.

508
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:54,389
It's not been long since the last regular investigation.

509
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,258
Why are they doing another investigation?

510
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,499
There must have been a whistle-blower.

511
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:02,068
Who in the world would...

512
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,508
Hae Ri went on a blind date with Hangang Group's first son today.

513
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,239
He was just as handsome and polite as I've heard.

514
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,749
I'm sure you'll like him too.

515
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,678
The company is in a mess!

516
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:16,178
How could she go on a blind date in this situation?

517
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:19,118
Did something happen to the company?

518
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:20,918
Do Hee, are you sure you don't know?

519
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:22,618
I don't have the slightest idea. What happened?

520
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,558
We're undergoing a special tax investigation.

521
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,029
All our documents and computers have been seized.

522
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:29,458
- What? - My goodness.

523
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:32,168
This is why people say Guseong Group's two daughters-in-law...

524
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:33,599
will destroy the company...

525
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,099
in addition to making their husbands die.

526
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,538
- Father! - Father!

527
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,209
It's not what I said.

528
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:43,638
It's not what other people say.

529
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,508
Since I lost my husband at only 34,

530
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,219
I've been living with you without my husband,

531
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,918
thinking of you as my own father.

532
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:53,349
I've relied on you all my life.

533
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:56,358
People talk about how mean mothers-in-law can be,

534
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:59,728
but it's nothing compared to what fathers-in-law can put you through.

535
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:02,899
- What? - Mothers-in-law are...

536
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,599
sometimes more understanding as they're women too.

537
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:09,298
But with fathers-in-law, there's always a line...

538
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,439
that can never be crossed.

539
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:16,779
Do you think the same as her?

540
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:20,478
I do think she has a point.

541
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:27,488
Are you saying I'm giving you two a hard time?

542
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:31,059
Are you protesting against me together right now?

543
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,129
Do you think I always enjoy...

544
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:36,129
living with you two when my sons aren't even there?

545
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,999
Do you want me to say everything on my mind?

546
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,668
Do you?

547
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:56,018
Is he still in a meeting?

548
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,388
Are you telling me to stow away?

549
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:05,159
I've done nothing wrong to have to board a ship secretly.

550
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:07,659
What do you suggest then, in this situation?

551
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,429
I only followed your order and took care of the practical affairs.

552
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:12,168
Why should I run away?

553
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,728
As you know,

554
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:16,369
I just got married, and I'm going to be a dad soon.

555
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,108
Let me meet the president and explain...

556
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:23,078
Once Director Oh is involved, we're all doomed.

557
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:26,078
Do you want us all to go to prison together?

558
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:27,379
Gosh.

559
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:33,189
Look. Someone needs to stay and sort things out.

560
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,219
Director.

561
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:35,959
You're forbidden from leaving the country.

562
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:39,059
You'll be summoned as a suspect. If you don't respond,

563
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,959
they'll apply for an arrest warrant.

564
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,498
You're charged with accounting fraud and tax evasion.

565
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:47,168
You'll rot in prison for years.

566
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,839
Think of your wife and baby.

567
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,678
(Nakwon Inn)

568
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,589
(Nakwon Inn)

569
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,029
Those jerks.

570
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,569
They can all drop dead.

571
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:29,878
(Nakwon Inn)

572
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:37,178
The lady from Daecheon in Room 1, Jeong A in Room 2,

573
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:39,349
Mr. Seo in Room Three,

574
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,418
and Mr. Byeon in Room Four.

575
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:44,858
They all went their separate ways,

576
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:48,659
I'm left alone here at the port named Nakwon Inn today.

577
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,029
The ocean may look the same every day,

578
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:55,469
but the waves are different every day.

579
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:57,969
My days may look all the same,

580
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:00,269
but every day is a little different.

581
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,509
What kind of boats will anchor...

582
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:06,779
in this port named Nakwon Inn tomorrow?

583
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,779
(Nakwon Inn)

584
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:22,899
If you regret your decision, you can go back.

585
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:27,529
Do you want to go back?

586
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,238
If you don't,

587
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,779
neither do I.

588
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:43,149
I've been a bad husband.

589
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,488
I put you through so much.

590
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,459
You're the best man...

591
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,899
I've ever had in my life.

592
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:05,038
You're crying like a child.

593
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:28,259
She looks so beautiful.

594
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:32,699
We looked so young back then.

595
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,899
That was fast.

596
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,668
- Right? - Did you prepare it now?

597
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:38,709
Yes.

598
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,308
- Are you on a trip? - Yes.

599
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:43,409
My family graves are near here.

600
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:46,009
I hadn't visited them for a while.

601
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:49,178
- I see. Enjoy. - Thank you.

602
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,418
It looks so fresh.

603
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,319
I look good today.

604
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,998
All right. Where is she? Oh, hi.

605
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:09,498
Have you been waiting long? I'm sorry.

606
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:12,839
My client wanted to have a wash and brush-up at the sauna...

607
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,709
before going on a date with you. That's why we're late.

608
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:19,378
You didn't have to.

609
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:23,548
Have a seat.

610
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,089
Have a seat. Let's sit.

611
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,488
Don't ask any old-fashioned questions.

612
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:35,498
Let's just drink and make nice memories.

613
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:37,659
Here.

614
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,298
You didn't wait long, did you?

615
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:45,839
Pick one.

616
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:01,719
You must have forgotten your reading glasses.

617
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,888
Webfoot octopuses are in season right now. What do you say?

618
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,459
One big plate of webfoot octopuses and a bottle of soju, please.

619
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,498
Sure.

620
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,508
He worked hard running his own business when he was young.

621
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:25,549
That's why his eyesight has become so bad.

622
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,449
That's understandable.

623
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,089
You worked too hard.

624
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,819
Here's one big plate of webfoot octopuses and a bottle of soju.

625
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,858
Excuse me!

626
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:38,289
Thank you.

627
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,858
Just a moment, please!

628
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:46,429
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

629
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,839
What happened to your hair?

630
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:54,008
He had such thick, dark hair yesterday.

631
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,219
He forgot to put his wig bag on...

632
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,829
after the sauna.

633
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,728
That's no big deal.

634
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:20,069
But why does he keep whispering to you?

635
00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:22,439
Why?

636
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,408
I can't believe you.

637
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:28,138
Are you feeling shy in front of a beautiful lady?

638
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:30,238
What's the big deal if you need reading glasses and a wig?

639
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:31,709
You're still young at heart!

640
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,719
Let's just drink. Come on.

641
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,289
- Let's do that. - Here.

642
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,189
Cheers.

643
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,158
Cheers.

644
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,758
Eat some food too.

645
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:02,579
Here.

646
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:07,209
This is for you, sir.

647
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,618
I'm embarrassed.

648
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:14,549
I should probably get up.

649
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,959
Excuse me.

650
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,858
Here.

651
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:21,959
Come on.

652
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:24,028
Please.

653
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:33,738
- My goodness! - What's wrong?

654
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:36,138
- What happened? - His teeth...

655
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,138
What?

656
00:38:40,108 --> 00:38:41,778
What did he say?

657
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:46,648
He forgot to put his dentures back in after the sauna.

658
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,858
- How dare you... - Calm down!

659
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,329
I can't calm down!

660
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:54,959
This is fraud and defamation!

661
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,929
I'll sue you both! Let go!

662
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:59,929
We can talk this out.

663
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:01,969
Mister, how old are you?

664
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,039
Tell me! Tell me how old you are!

665
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,738
- Come on! - I can't believe this!

666
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:07,738
Mister, open your mouth again!

667
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,278
Hurry up.

668
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,278
Director Oh.

669
00:39:20,118 --> 00:39:21,518
Are you Assistant Manager Kang?

670
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:25,628
You must know well.

671
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,028
I'm not responsible for this.

672
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:29,929
- I only followed orders... - I know.

673
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,099
I'm embarrassed to tell you, but it's a family feud.

674
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:34,569
But things will settle down soon.

675
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:37,268
Please stay away in the meantime.

676
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,569
- Director Son. - Yes.

677
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,608
This is heavy.

678
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:47,248
Well...

679
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:53,018
Do you see how much Director Oh cares about you?

680
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,219
Oh, my.

681
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:00,228
I don't need it.

682
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:03,658
I'll meet the president and explain what happened.

683
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:12,339
Director Oh.

684
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:15,408
Our company's future depends on you.

685
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:18,849
Assistant Manager Kang, I beg you.

686
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:28,689
What? Hae Ri cancelled the dinner date?

687
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:31,059
What do I do with that girl?

688
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:34,728
Ms. Kim, let me call you back.

689
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,559
I can't believe her.

690
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:42,469
Hey!

691
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,799
Can't you do a better job?

692
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,738
Where is Hae Ri right now?

693
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,008
What?

694
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:54,378
Don't look back. Just keep walking.

695
00:40:56,618 --> 00:40:58,118
Mom put a tail on me.

696
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:01,118
If we're seen together, I'm dead meat.

697
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,858
I'll give you three.

698
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:13,028
- Please do a good job. - Don't worry.

699
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:15,868
Even the weather is on our side.

700
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:20,138
Be careful. Let's keep in touch.

701
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,908
I'll take good care of your wife. Don't worry about a thing.

702
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:26,978
We need to wait for high tide.

703
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,148
You can stay in that warehouse if you want.

704
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:48,669
I forgot to change the light bulb again.

705
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:54,008
These?

706
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:56,539
Someone asked me to get them tax-free.

707
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,849
It's illegal, but you can get them so cheap that way.

708
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:00,908
Let me see.

709
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:03,018
There should be a candle around here somewhere.

710
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:29,738
You must be tired. There's a bed in the back. Get some sleep there.

711
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,539
I have something to take care of.

712
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,118
Wait.

713
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:42,258
My wife is giving birth soon.

714
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:44,219
I have to come back to Korea soon.

715
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:47,758
I don't know exactly what happened,

716
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,299
but everything will work out.

717
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,128
Don't worry.

718
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,528
Nakwon Inn.

719
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:27,299
Mama Bok.

720
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:30,669
What's wrong with you?

721
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:33,569
Why are you drinking so late?

722
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,179
It's Mama Bok.

723
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:41,608
Reading glasses... A wig...

724
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:46,018
I can understand that much. But still...

725
00:43:47,488 --> 00:43:48,919
I mean...

726
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:52,258
Dentures are just unacceptable, don't you think?

727
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,858
I couldn't even kiss him properly.

728
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:59,599
I don't care if he's super rich.

729
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:04,039
What are you babbling about at this hour?

730
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:12,349
What does it matter if he has dentures or gold teeth?

731
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:15,378
Why are teeth so important?

732
00:44:15,378 --> 00:44:16,719
Room Six...

733
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:19,049
missed...

734
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:22,148
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today, Mama Bok!

735
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:27,628
Just you wait.

736
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,229
I'll find...

737
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:33,329
a bald and toothless woman...

738
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,339
and set you up with her.

739
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,569
Just you wait, you liar!

740
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:41,269
Why are you so picky?

741
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:43,039
My goodness!

742
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:45,749
What are these punks babbling about?

743
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,479
Come home and go to bed!

744
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:53,549
When will they come to their senses?

745
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,678
Do you know what time it is?

746
00:45:25,648 --> 00:45:26,718
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,319
I had too much to do, so I couldn't call you.

748
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,388
Have you been waiting for me?

749
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,928
Are you the only person working at Guseong Resort?

750
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,468
You seem to do all the work yourself.

751
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:43,539
Well...

752
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:47,408
I'm going on a business trip.

753
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:50,009
It's a sudden order from the president.

754
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,438
All of a sudden?

755
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,349
Where are you going?

756
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:55,408
I'm going to China.

757
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:57,349
Why are you suddenly going to China?

758
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,849
I'll explain when I get back.

759
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,589
When will you be back?

760
00:46:12,698 --> 00:46:14,628
I don't know yet.

761
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:16,938
There's an urgent matter to take care of.

762
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:20,339
Something's fishy.

763
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:23,579
Are you hiding something from me?

764
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,279
No way. Something just came up.

765
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:29,878
What about clothes?

766
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:33,188
Don't you need a change of underwear at least?

767
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,259
Don't worry. I'll buy some.

768
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,658
Listen.

769
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:40,329
If you had called me earlier,

770
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:42,799
I would have brought some to your work.

771
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:44,658
Why are you so bad at planning?

772
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:46,398
Your shoes were falling apart too.

773
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:48,499
What if you make a fool of yourself on your business trip?

774
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,009
It'll be fine.

775
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:55,009
What do you mean, it'll be fine?

776
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:01,878
I bought...

777
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,549
a new pair of shoes...

778
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:08,589
for you today.

779
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,989
Wear them when you get back.

780
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:12,989
It's a wedding present.

781
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:25,339
Okay. Thank you.

782
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:28,468
Bak Ha.

783
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:32,438
You know I love you, right?

784
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:33,878
I'm not sure.

785
00:47:33,878 --> 00:47:36,618
We just got married, and you're not even coming home.

786
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:39,289
We shouldn't have registered our marriage so fast.

787
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:42,249
We should've waited a bit longer, don't you think?

788
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:50,229
Are you scared?

789
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:51,658
Are you?

790
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:55,829
Are you scared right now?

791
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:59,408
I was just joking!

792
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,408
I'll call you when I arrive.

793
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:07,509
I love you.

794
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,519
He's acting strange today.

795
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:52,489
Woo Jae.

796
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,398
Are you angry about me going on a blind date today?

797
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,029
Let's break up.

798
00:49:01,628 --> 00:49:03,499
Stop saying that!

799
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,239
If you don't have rich parents, have some courage at least.

800
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:08,839
Are you sure you can deal with a woman like me?

801
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:12,079
I'm not done yet.

802
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,309
Where are you going?

803
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:16,718
I have a competition tomorrow. I need some rest.

804
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:19,118
How much do you get if you win that competition?

805
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:21,618
I'll give you that money, so stay with me.

806
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,789
I'm sorry.

807
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:30,158
I got upset. I shouldn't have said that.

808
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,198
Who are you?

809
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:41,208
He must have been sent by Mom.

810
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:45,638
- Get out. - Well...

811
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:50,648
What are you doing?

812
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,849
- Leave. Get out right now. - Woo Jae.

813
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:54,918
What are you doing here?

814
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:56,819
I would like to ask you that too.

815
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,188
Get out right now.

816
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:13,668
Woo Jae!

817
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:17,839
Woo Jae!

818
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:19,608
Are you okay?

819
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:20,779
What do we do?

820
00:50:20,779 --> 00:50:22,108
Let me call 911.

821
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:23,648
- No! - No!

822
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:24,918
Don't make any report.

823
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:26,948
If Mom finds out, I'm dead meat.

824
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:28,989
Help me put out the fire!

825
00:50:29,218 --> 00:50:30,388
Do we have any water?

826
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:35,289
No!

827
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:52,408
The watercock cries

828
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:56,418
Caw, caw

829
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,519
In the rice paddy

830
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:01,749
I feel so safe...

831
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:03,989
with your dad's shoes here.

832
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:06,428
Do you feel the same, Yeol Mu?

833
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:08,128
Do you feel safe too?

834
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:13,029
The cuckoo cries

835
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:17,039
Cuckoo, cuckoo

836
00:51:17,398 --> 00:51:20,468
In the forest

837
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:26,039
When my brother

838
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:30,019
Went to Seoul

839
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,718
On a horse

840
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,589
He promised

841
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:46,198
to come back

842
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,868
With silk shoes

843
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:55,968
For me
