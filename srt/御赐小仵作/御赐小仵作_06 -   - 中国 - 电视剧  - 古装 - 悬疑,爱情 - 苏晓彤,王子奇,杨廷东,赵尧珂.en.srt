1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,800
Feng’s Mansion’s mourning hall
suddenly caught fire.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,110
His Highness disregarded the danger

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,600
and rushed in the fire to rescue me.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,470
And he spoke up for me
before Minister Han.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,580
Thankfully, I didn’t betray
His Highness’s trust.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,490
I found out that

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,150
the ministers who seemingly
died because of accidents

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,390
were all killed by the same method

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,440
at Rugui House.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,360
I also found
His Highness’s little secret.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,840
However,

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,200
I’ll keep it for him.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,310
(Xiao Jinli)

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,040
Shelves with categorized files.

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,020
(Princess Xiping)

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,140
(Yan Ming)

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,820
(Xiao Heng)

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,430
These are monitoring records.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,840
How daring!

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,910
This is...?

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,040
(25th, Princess Xiping’s Mansion Banquet)

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,790
Princess’s Mansion.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,260
(Jing Yi)

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,830
(Xiao Jinyu)

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,590
His Highness.

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,110
Your Highness, what are you doing?

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,030
I’m drawing Xu Rugui’s portrait.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,110
So we can issue the writ of arrest.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,200
But wasn’t today the first time

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,440
you saw Manager Xu?

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,080
You can draw his portrait

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,800
when you’ve only met him once?

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,580
=The Imperial Coroner=

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,020
=Episode 6=

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,950
Qin Luan.

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,000
Your Majesty, here I am.

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
I’m here.

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,000
Bastard! What’s your problem?

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,270
Your Majesty.

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,350
Who taught this new guy?

41
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,710
He can’t even pour
a cup of tea properly.

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,310
Your Majesty, don’t be mad.

43
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,600
He didn’t learn the manners well.

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,830
It’s all my fault.

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,240
Why are you still here?

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,030
You’re so annoying. Go away!

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,030
Your Majesty, don’t be mad.

48
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,750
I’ll clean this place right now.

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,180
(Qianzhou)

50
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,720
Qin Luan,

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,520
where were you just now?

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,880
There are strands of beard
stuck under your shoes.

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,670
Beard?

54
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,800
Your Majesty, these are not beard.

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,520
These are my strands of hair.

56
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,880
Your Majesty,
when you demanded my presence,

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,190
I was trimming the hair on my temples.

58
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,880
I guess mistakenly stepped on it

59
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,150
when I changed my clothes in a hurry.

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,960
I’m sorry for the annoyance.

61
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,240
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,080
Forget it.

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

64
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,960
Your Majesty, it’s late.

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
The palace will host
a tea gathering tomorrow.

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,720
The tea gathering.

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,370
I’d forget it if you didn’t bring it up.

68
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,140
Go to Three Judicial Offices
yourself tomorrow.

69
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,650
Pass on my order.

70
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,340
Xiao Jinyu must be present

71
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,650
no matter how busy he is with work.

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,810
If he doesn’t come,

73
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,490
you can kidnap him there.

74
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,340
If I don’t find him a chance to

75
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,570
mediate his relations
with the ministers,

76
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,930
I’m worried that he may
get swallowed alive one day.

77
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,130
Yes.

78
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,570
It’s exactly the same.

79
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,570
Your Highness, you’re amazing.

80
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,970
But.

81
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,850
But what?

82
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,340
But I still find

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,410
Manager Xu looks a bit weird.

84
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,940
Weird?

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,250
How?

86
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,100
I can’t describe it.

87
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,290
But I had such feelings
when I say him today.

88
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,060
I just find him a bit odd.

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,250
Don’t rush.

90
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,100
Think carefully. Why is he odd?

91
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,100
What?

92
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,660
I knew!

93
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,510
His look is odd

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,700
because it’s like something
that’s pieced together.

95
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,850
Something that’s pieced together?

96
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,570
Yes.

97
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,540
People look different from each other.

98
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,840
But people born in the same regions

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
share similarities in looks.

100
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,100
It’s like there’s a mould.

101
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,940
People from the Western Regions
have a mould.

102
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,490
People from Lingnan Regions
have a mould.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,060
People from Chang’an
also have a mould.

104
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,730
But Manager Xu’s face isn’t shaped

105
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,640
by any of those moulds.

106
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,800
His face looks as if

107
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,730
someone shattered many moulds

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,220
and took parts from those moulds

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,380
to piece together.

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
On my journey from Qianzhou to Chang’an,

111
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,630
I’ve seen people from every region,

112
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,260
but I’ve never seen a man
who looks like this.

113
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,260
This is so weird.

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,760
What if his parents or ancestors

115
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,190
are descendants from other regions?

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,630
That’s not the case either.

117
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,810
For example, Mules are born from
donkeys and horses.

118
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,520
Mules don’t look exactly like donkeys,

119
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,730
nor horses.

120
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,370
However, in every parts of mules,

121
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,930
you can find features of
both donkeys and horses.

122
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,570
It seems that

123
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,230
the eyes of Lingnan people,

124
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,880
the mouth of the Northern barbarians,

125
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,170
the forehead of Jiangnan people,

126
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,810
and the chin of Goryeo people

127
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,890
are all assembled on a face from
people who’re inside Shanhai Pass.

128
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,450
Xu Rugui might have disguised his look.

129
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,130
Disguise?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,930
Leave the city at dawn.

131
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,010
There will be people waiting
for you outside the city.

132
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,660
You’d better be smart.

133
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,690
You know what are the consequences

134
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,170
if Xiao Jinyu catches you.

135
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,650
General Zhou, don’t worry.

136
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,280
Today is the only time I met Xiao Jinyu.

137
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,510
Even if he has miraculous

138
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,470
drawing techniques,

139
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,540
he can only draw my falsified look.

140
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,460
When my natural face

141
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,770
was hidden,

142
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,540
Xiao Jinyu was still
an infant in the cradle.

143
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,260
He definitely can’t recognize me

144
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,610
even if I stand right before him.

145
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,680
Cut it out.

146
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,200
Can you not boast about yourself?

147
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,710
It’s late. Hurry up.

148
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,420
What are the other orders
from Eunuch Qin?

149
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,120
He ordered you to hide for a while.

150
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,730
If he has more orders,

151
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,060
someone will contact you.

152
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,740
I’m at Eunuch Qin’s service.

153
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,940
Xu Rugui is right-handed.

154
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,610
Yes.

155
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,410
Look at the way he walks.

156
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,250
He’s trained in martial arts.

157
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,130
Martial arts?

158
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,930
I’ve never heard that

159
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,500
our manager knows martial arts.

160
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,160
Your manager is used to putting keys

161
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,180
in his left sleeve?

162
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,060
Yes.

163
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,690
I always see him

164
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,060
take out keys from his left sleeve.

165
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,150
Then what does he often store
in his right sleeve?

166
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,080
Right sleeve?

167
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,110
I don’t know that for sure.

168
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,750
I’ve never seen him

169
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,750
take out anything from the right sleeve.

170
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,990
Lord Jing,

171
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,120
why did you come back
from the outside?

172
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,990
Xu Rugui

173
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,430
is just like a rabbit.

174
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,780
He has dug up several exits
to the dark chamber.

175
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,110
Wu Jiang and I have tried all of them.

176
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,150
They all lead to the outside.

177
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,360
And this.

178
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,840
What’s that?

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
You’ll know when you see it.

180
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,780
Xu Rugui isn’t inside.

181
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,390
But there’s indeed a stove.

182
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,310
This was left next to the stove.

183
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,470
There are also many shelves.

184
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,310
Each section of the shelves
has names on it.

185
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,310
There are my name, your name,

186
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,120
and the names of many ministers.

187
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,870
And the things you’re holding now.

188
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,270
You’re worried that someone killed
Xu Rugui to keep him silent.

189
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,030
But it seems more likely that

190
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,520
he fled when he knew
we’d search this place.

191
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,310
And he tried to burn the evidences,

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
but didn’t put everything in the stove

193
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,720
before he fled

194
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,520
because he was in a hurry.

195
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,040
And I dug this out of

196
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,310
(25th, Princess Xiping’s Mansion Banquet)
the stove.

197
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,350
Wu Jiang.

198
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,910
Yes.

199
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,230
Go back to Three Judicial Offices
immediately.

200
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,700
Bring enough people to
Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

201
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,590
Ensure her safety.

202
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,540
Don’t leave before I come.

203
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,110
Yes.

204
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,830
Your Highness, what’s the problem?

205
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,600
It’s fine.

206
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,200
Jing Yi.

207
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,310
Does the chamber have a place
that requires keys?

208
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,340
No.

209
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,670
It’s just a dark chamber.

210
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,640
There’s nothing more besides the exits.

211
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,100
Xu Rugui has a chain of keys that

212
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,720
he habitually stores
in his right sleeve.

213
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,110
If those are not for the dark chamber,

214
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
he must have another residence
as a hiding place.

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,230
Another residence?

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,790
Where is it?

217
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,520
I don’t know.

218
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,830
I’ve never heard that

219
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,590
our manager has another house.

220
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,230
This is the map of Chang’an.

221
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
(The Map of Chang’an)
Squares represent neighborhoods.

222
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,830
This is Rugui House.

223
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,040
(The Map of Chang’an)

224
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,740
Jing Yi.

225
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,600
Identify the objects in this room.

226
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,770
Find out from which store

227
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,480
the items were bought.

228
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,960
Manager.

229
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,040
Think carefully about
Xu Rugui’s daily habits.

230
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,580
Mark the places he visits regularly

231
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,670
on this board with chess pieces.

232
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,720
Yes.

233
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,310
This is Huaiyuan Residence.

234
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,790
This is the East Market.

235
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,940
(Pingkang Yiyang Qinren the East Market
Anyi Daozheng Changle Jinggong)

236
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,710
(Jiahui Yanfu Huaizhen Yonghe
Yongping...)

237
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,280
(Yong’an)
He’s active in this neighborhood,

238
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,960
(Yong’an)
except this region.

239
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,160
This should be the place.

240
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Your Highness,

241
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,960
this place seems to be a small square
on the chessboard,

242
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
but, in reality,

243
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,100
it spreads across over 20 hectares.

244
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,550
Over 100 hundred families live there.

245
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,720
There was mud and rice paste mixture

246
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,600
at the bottom of his shoes.

247
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,670
There must be a residence

248
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,280
that’s under construction
next to his secret house.

249
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,990
Take this portrait and
ask the neighborhood.

250
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,430
I’ll look for his secret residence.

251
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,990
Handle things here.

252
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,550
Yes.

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,310
And,

254
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,220
send people to each city gate.

255
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,510
Tell each guard leader in my name.

256
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,230
Tell them that

257
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,700
there’s an important suspect
on the loose.

258
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Ask them to carefully
interrogate every person

259
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,480
who enters or exits the city.

260
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Those without an ID or
with a suspicious one

261
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,310
mustn’t exit the city

262
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,310
no matter what seals, letters,

263
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,600
or certificates they hold,

264
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,510
particularly those dressed
as Shence Army members.

265
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,230
I got it.

266
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,720
Chu Chu, come with me.

267
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,640
General Zhou, once I leave the capital,

268
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,990
please take care of my family.

269
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,640
Sure.

270
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,550
But how I take care of them
depends on you.

271
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,840
I get it.

272
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,960
Oh.

273
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,670
Have you taken care of those

274
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,790
who killed Feng Jie and the others?

275
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,870
I’ve taken care of them the old way.

276
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,550
General, don’t worry about it.

277
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,110
General, please take this to Eunuch Qin.

278
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,080
Let’s go.

279
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,340
(Serene Spirits)

280
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,230
General Wu.

281
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,110
Aunt Banxia.

282
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,270
What’s going on?

283
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,750
I’ll tell you the details later.

284
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,320
Where’s Princess?

285
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,400
This is the place. Search!

286
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,310
Yes.

287
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
Your Highness, no one’s inside.

288
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,040
They haven’t left for long.

289
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,870
We’re one step behind.

290
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,200
Your Highness, we found no one.

291
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,470
Your Highness, no one’s here.

292
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,310
This smell.

293
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,670
Your Highness, check this out.

294
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,400
What?

295
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,350
Look.

296
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,110
What is that?

297
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,840
Pickled cabbages.

298
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,640
Pickled cabbages?

299
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,310
Yes, pickled cabbages from Qianzhou.

300
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,100
People from Qianzhou all like sourness.

301
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,520
At our place,

302
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,110
every household knows
how to make such pickled cabbages.

303
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,670
A special ingredient is needed
to make them.

304
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,910
It’s something like a broth.

305
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,840
Without it, we can’t make
good pickled cabbages.

306
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,340
Your Highness, don’t you think

307
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,640
that Manager Xu and I might
come from the same place?

308
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,480
It’s possible.

309
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,750
Rugui House has cooks
who’re from Qianzhou.

310
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,320
They hoard fish mints regularly.

311
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,960
And there are Qianzhou
pickled cabbages in this house.

312
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,900
Even if Xu Rugui isn’t from Qianzhou,

313
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,310
he must have some ties with it.

314
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,270
General Zhou.

315
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,400
Open the door.

316
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,870
Why are you exiting the city
when it’s so late?

317
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,840
It’s none of your business.

318
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,290
Just open the door when I tell you to.

319
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,290
Someone died of pestilence
in my battalion.

320
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,280
I’ll burn his body outside the city.

321
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Wait.

322
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,900
Haven’t you heard me?

323
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,310
General Zhou, any passing vehicle needs

324
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,960
to be examined after the gate is closed.

325
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,390
Hurry. We can’t handle the consequences

326
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,660
if we let Xu Rugui slip away.

327
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,640
Hyah!

328
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
This man had pestilence.

329
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,520
If he spreads it across Chang’an,

330
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,470
you’ll assume the responsibilities?

331
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,040
The city gate has its rules.

332
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,600
General Zhou, if I let you exit the city
without permit,

333
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,550
when the superiors look for
the ones accountable,

334
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,310
me and my brothers will be executed.

335
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,050
Who?

336
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
Let him inspect.

337
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,960
General Zhou, excuse me.

338
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,870
Open the door. Let them leave.

339
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,280
Master.

340
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,960
How is it going?

341
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,110
Master, don’t worry.
Everything is going well.

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Great. Great.

343
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,750
Go to rest.

344
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,430
Yes.

345
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,870
The stove is covered by dust.

346
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,350
It hasn’t been used for a long time.

347
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,720
But the storage jars are
clean and organized.

348
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,310
They’re often moved around.

349
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,790
Master, what’s inside?

350
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,960
Black beans.

351
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,150
I’m sorry. I slipped.

352
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,610
Don’t move.

353
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,550
These beans seem to have been

354
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,430
smashed regularly

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,640
by hard objects.

356
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,350
Something was hidden in the jars before.

357
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,230
Grains can absorb moisture.

358
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,600
Only house owners touch these.

359
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,430
When valuables are hidden inside,

360
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,520
they’re hardly noticed by others.

361
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,500
This color and texture are familiar.

362
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes.

363
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,480
It’s Ruyi Pawnshop’s unique tassel.

364
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,150
The killers of Rugui House
conduct their transactions

365
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,550
(Ruyi Pawnshop)
through Ruyi Pawnshop.

366
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,940
(Ruyi Pawnshop)
Xu Rugui rented pawnshop’s lockers

367
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,960
(Rented the lockers)
and shared them with the killers.

368
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,000
(Depositing...)
They each hold a half of the tally.

369
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,240
They complete their transactions
without having to meet.

370
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,550
I hope we can catch the killers in time.

371
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,910
Vice Minister Jing.

372
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,020
Where’s His Highness?

373
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,820
Your Highness.

374
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,470
Lord Jing, how did you find us?

375
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,430
I can’t find Xu Rugui’s house.
But I can find His Highness.

376
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,600
Your Highness,

377
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,480
I’ve taken care of the things
at Rugui House.

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
The officers who headed to Tonghua Gate

379
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,840
were intercepted halfway
by men in black.

380
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,600
They didn’t intend to kill

381
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,820
and retreated soon
after hearing the whistle.

382
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,910
The officers arrived at the gate

383
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,300
only to find that Zhou Han,
from Shence Army,

384
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,420
just led a group of people and

385
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,910
left the city thirty minutes ago.

386
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,580
Did the guards search them
before letting them leave?

387
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,360
They did.
But they found nothing suspicious.

388
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,310
Such a coincidence.

389
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,550
These men in black seem to be there

390
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,550
just to buy Zhou Han more time.

391
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,360
I’ll go and check it.

392
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,670
Bring people to catch

393
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,060
the killer who murdered
Feng Jie and the others.

394
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,090
You must catch him alive.

395
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,390
Where is he?

396
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,430
This?

397
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,390
Ruyi Pawnshop.

398
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,110
Xu Rugui must have a tally

399
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,340
which is from Ruyi Pawnshop.

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
Currently, the tally isn’t kept
at the place it’s usually stored.

401
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,650
Xu Rugui might have just gone to

402
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,110
Ruyi Pawnshop to pay the killers today.

403
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,000
Rugui House was closed down today.

404
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,720
Once the killer got the news,

405
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,910
he will retrieve the money
immediately before he flees for life.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,380
Take Xu Rugui’s portrait with you.

407
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,030
Interrogate the owner of Ruyi Pawnshop.

408
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
And you’ll know
the number of their locker.

409
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,820
Keep an eye on it.

410
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,690
Whoever goes to retrieve money
is the killer.

411
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,720
Don’t worry.

412
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,270
(To Commandery Prince An)
And this.

413
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,820
(To Commandery Prince An)

414
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,540
Wu Jiang asked someone to deliver this.

415
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,240
I’ll go ahead with my work.

416
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,430
Let’s go.

417
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,240
The weather is dry.
Things are flammable.

418
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,260
Chu Chu’s birth date has been confirmed.

419
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,150
Her father’s wife has been deceased
for years.

420
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,120
The neighborhood knew Chu Chu as
Chu Ping’s daughter out of wedlock.

421
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,150
The identity of her
birth mother is unclear.

422
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,630
Chu Family led a simple life
in the neighborhood.

423
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,510
They only had close ties
with a lonely witch doctor,

424
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,470
who left the region five years ago,

425
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,080
and is still missing to this day.

426
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,640
A witch doctor?

427
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,460
That’s the one

428
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,440
who told her stories about Six Gates?

429
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,760
Your Highness, we’ve arrived.

430
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

431
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,000
Rise.

432
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,390
Have Zhou Han and his team returned yet?

433
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,270
No, Your Highness.

434
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,670
They have five riders

435
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,200
and a carriage.

436
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

437
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,390
One of them rode a flat wagon?

438
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,510
Six people in total?

439
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,720
I know all of them.

440
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,790
They’re indeed from Shence Army.

441
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,140
There was one corpse on the flat wagon.

442
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,790
The dead was dressed in
Shence Army’s uniform.

443
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,150
But his face looked unfamiliar.

444
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,670
It’s said that he died of pestilence.

445
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,240
They were in a hurry to burn him
outside the city.

446
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,430
Just one dead man?

447
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,310
Yes, just one.

448
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,740
No.

449
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,030
I mean there was only one corpse
on the flat wagon?

450
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,080
Yes, indeed.

451
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,600
A flat wagon,

452
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,840
a rider, and a corpse.

453
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,720
How can the tracks be so deep?

454
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,080
Have you checked under the wagon?

455
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,270
No.

456
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,760
My attention was caught by
the corpse on the wagon.

457
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,150
This is a cover-up.

458
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,740
I’m afraid there was another person
under the wagon.

459
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,270
Let them exit.

460
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,000
Your Highness, I’m sorry...

461
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,420
It’s okay.

462
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,880
This happened too quickly.
It’s not your fault.

463
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,660
Examine more carefully in the future.

464
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,480
I believe Zhou Han will come back soon.

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,150
Just let them get back to the city.

466
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,250
Don’t say a thing.

467
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,840
Just pretend you know nothing.

468
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,640
I’ll send someone to

469
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,990
handle the rest.

470
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,390
He even figured that out?

472
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,870
It’s midnight already. What happened?

473
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,960
Where’s Jinyu?

474
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,550
His Highness is all right.

475
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,000
It’s just...

476
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,820
His Highness is so busy with work that

477
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,100
he hasn’t had a chance
to see Your Grace.

478
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
His Highness misses Your Grace.

479
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,910
So he ordered me to come

480
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,380
and strengthen the defense
at Princess’s Mansion

481
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,630
to express his filial piety.

482
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,720
Why should he strengthen guard
if everything is going well?

483
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,390
I know martial arts and I have guards.

484
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,840
Why do you come to my place

485
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,740
when you should be protecting him?

486
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,670
I heard that the mourning hall
of Feng’s Mansion was on fire tonight.

487
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,310
Did Jinyu ignore His Majesty’s orders

488
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,670
and again make a scene
at Feng’s Mansion?

489
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,880
I’ll go and find him now!

490
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,990
Your Grace, don’t be angry.

491
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,510
Your Grace,
Scholar Xue has told you that

492
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
you mustn’t intervene with
His Highness’s work.

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,270
That’s harmful to His Highness’s
reputation in the office.

494
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,000
His Highness has been always discreet
since childhood.

495
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,270
Your Grace, you should trust him.

496
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,940
How can I trust him

497
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,110
when he’s caused so much trouble?

498
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,200
Your Grace, His Highness promised to

499
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,310
come here after work.

500
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,720
Just wait a bit longer.

501
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,150
Your Grace, His Highness is
a man of his words.

502
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,360
He promised to come here later.

503
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,880
Then he will.

504
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,760
Why don’t you sit down and

505
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,150
think about how you’ll scold him later?

506
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,150
Otherwise, it’ll be like the usual days.

507
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,510
Before you can give a good talking,

508
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,670
His Highness will have already
changed the subject.

509
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,430
Then, you’ll blame me instead.

510
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,430
Fine. Just leave.

511
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,550
You!

512
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,000
You’re always on his side.

513
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,150
Master, you finally came out.

514
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
His Majesty.

515
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,480
It’s fine.

516
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,840
How are things doing out there?

517
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,550
Master, don’t worry.

518
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,760
Everything is going well.

519
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,480
He has left the city.

520
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
It’s finally dawn.

521
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,030
This night is too long.

522
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,350
His Majesty said that

523
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,490
he was afraid that
someone may devour Xiao Jinyu alive.

524
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,710
Who do you think should be that person?

525
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,790
Devour Xiao Jinyu.

526
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,980
Devour Xiao Jinyu.

527
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,150
Devour?

528
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,020
Who?

529
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
(Tonghua Gate)

530
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Commandery Prince An is right.

531
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,910
Chu Chu.

532
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,720
Go back and take some rest.

533
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,240
You’ve been busy working
with me all night.

534
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,270
You must be tired.

535
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

536
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,240
Are you coming or not?

537
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,510
I have other matters.

538
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,240
Then when will you come back?

539
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Why are you asking?

540
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,760
I just find you rather pale.

541
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,510
Come back to rest
when you’re done with work.

542
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,840
Okay.

543
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,630
Wait.

544
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,550
I didn’t have the chance
to ask you earlier.

545
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
What’s the embroidery
on your handkerchief?

546
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,080
It’s a bone.

547
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,870
The fifth rib bone on left chest.

548
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,510
Rib bone?

549
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,840
Why that?

550
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,080
Because it’s the closest place
to a person’s heart.

551
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
When you put your hand
on the bone’s position,

552
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,340
you can feel your heart pond.

553
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,080
That’s my favorite bone.

554
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,880
Do you find it beautiful?

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes.

556
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,360
Go.

557
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,150
You embroidered this?

558
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,600
If you don’t like it...

559
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,840
Your Highness, there you are!

560
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,790
Where’s Her Grace?

561
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,550
She’s inside.

562
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,880
Jinyu,

563
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,790
where have you been all night?

564
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,030
Come closer. Let me see if you’re hurt.

565
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,760
No. Mother, don’t worry.

566
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,030
You caused so much disturbance

567
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,390
in the middle of the night.

568
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,670
Everyone was worried because of you.

569
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,500
If you don’t explain everything
clearly today,

570
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,690
I’ll greet His Majesty and ask him to

571
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,530
remove you from Three Judicial Offices.

572
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Mother, calm down.

573
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,360
You can interrogate me today.

574
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,810
I’ll tell you everything honestly.

575
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,930
Wu Jiang, take the guards and leave.

576
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,260
Yes.

577
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,050
I’ve been busy all night.

578
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,900
I didn’t even have water.

579
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,570
Can I beg for a cup of tea?

580
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,930
Tea?

581
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,810
You won’t even get cold water.

582
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,500
Miss Chu,

583
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
let me help you change the medicine.

584
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,670
No. No need.

585
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,120
I can do it myself.

586
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,880
These are just minor wounds.

587
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,430
When I made baskets at home,

588
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,150
my hands always got scratched.

589
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,310
I never whined because of pain.

590
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,150
You’re so brave.

591
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,000
No, I’m not.

592
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,720
I’m nothing

593
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,510
compared with His Highness.

594
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,960
Chu Chu. Chu Chu.

595
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
Chu Chu.

596
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,790
Oh!

597
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,880
Can I ask you for something?

598
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
What is it, Miss Chu?

599
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,430
His Highness has given us the order.

600
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,390
You can have whatever you want

601
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,390
so long as it’s not livestock

602
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,310
or growable seeds or seedlings.

603
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,240
I want a spoon.

604
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,360
A spoon?

605
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,430
Miss Chu, if you want to eat something,

606
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,150
you can ask the kitchen to cook it.

607
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,390
You don’t have to do it yourself.

608
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,200
No. I’m not trying to cook.

609
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,840
I just want a spoon.

610
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,200
A spoon of this size.

611
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,150
This size?

612
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,000
Fine. Mother.

613
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,080
I’m already full.

614
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,240
Eat more.

615
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,880
Look at how pale you are!

616
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,480
You must have stayed up late for days.

617
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,030
Banxia, go to the kitchen.

618
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,030
Bring out hasma if it’s cooked.

619
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,870
Your Grace, didn’t you just say

620
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,790
you won’t even give
His Highness cold water?

621
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,240
Of course, I won’t.

622
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,390
How can he drink cold water
in such a freezing day?

623
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,320
Go and check it.

624
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,460
Bring out hasma if it’s cooked.

625
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,930
Yes.

626
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,310
Mother.

627
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,360
I’m here today because
I want to ask you something.

628
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,510
You promised to let me
interrogate you today.

629
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,550
You are to break the promise
after lunch?

630
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,270
Now, you’ll interrogate me?

631
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,840
Don’t you want to know

632
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,600
what happened last night?

633
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,240
Take a look at this first.

634
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,380
(Xiao Jinyu...)

635
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,540
(Lynched the remaining members
of Chen Ying’s party...)

636
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,780
(Xiao Heng escaped luckily...)

637
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,510
Mother.

638
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,790
Banxia.

639
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,910
Guard the door.

640
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,430
Don’t let anyone enter
without my permission.

641
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes.

642
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,840
Where are these from?

643
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,120
A tavern named Rugui House in the city.

644
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,270
A tavern?

645
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,080
Why would a tavern
investigate your father?

646
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
That’s why I want to ask you.

647
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,120
Ask me?

648
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,390
How can I know?

649
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,030
The man who made
these investigation records

650
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,120
has fled upon sensing danger.

651
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
My men are still hunting him.

652
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,120
These are what he has left behind

653
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,150
in a sealed chamber at Rugui House.

654
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,600
There were more records
about other people.

655
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
They were destroyed by fire.

656
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,270
Among the few scrolls remained,

657
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,430
there’s one that’s about father.

658
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,890
If I’m not mistaken,

659
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,860
that man left this intentionally to me.

660
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,480
He left this to you on purpose?

661
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,480
Why would he do that?

662
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,940
(25th, Princess Xiping’s Mansion Banquet)

663
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,240
On last month’s 25th,

664
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,870
did you throw a banquet at the mansion?

665
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,600
I invited Madam Jing.

666
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,790
Someone is spying on us.

667
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,120
So, I didn’t allow Wu Jiang to

668
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,270
explain everything clearly
to you last night.

669
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,600
Mother, please forgive me.

670
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,110
The audacity!

671
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,030
Mother, don’t be mad.

672
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,960
Tell me.

673
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,100
What do they spy on me for?

674
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,630
They want to find out
something from you.

675
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,480
What do they want to know?

676
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,550
Mother, I’m wishing you to tell me.

677
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,910
How can I know?

678
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,360
Mother,

679
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,720
father passed away years ago.

680
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,630
His remains are buried under Chang’an.

681
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,840
Why are they going through
all this trouble

682
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,960
to spy on you,

683
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,080
me,

684
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,910
and those who had ties with father?

685
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,000
It seems...

686
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,400
It seems that they’re searching for
his whereabouts.

687
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,890
Nonsense.

688
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,800
A few days ago,

689
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,030
I saw the other half of this pendant.

690
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,120
Where did you see it?

691
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,120
It’s in the hands of
a girl from Qianzhou.

692
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,390
A girl from Qianzhou.

693
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,470
Is that the coroner you brought to

694
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,400
Feng’s Mansion to send your condolence?

695
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,030
Yes.

696
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,670
Then, she...

697
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,450
Mother, don’t rush.

698
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,140
It’s still under investigation.

699
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,860
No.

700
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,430
Ask your men to fall back.

701
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,480
Order them to come back.

702
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,750
Kick that coroner out of
Three Judicial Offices.

703
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,430
No, kick her out of Chang’an.

704
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,110
You can’t keep investigating this case.

705
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,760
Why?

706
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,430
Mother, about father,

707
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,030
are you keeping secrets?

708
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,600
Now, the enemies are hiding in the dark.
We’re exposed.

709
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
This is unfavorable to us.

710
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,360
Mother, please tell me
everything truthfully.

711
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,030
Master.

712
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,210
Mingde is here.

713
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,610
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

714
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,490
Put them down carefully.

715
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,260
Put them down.

716
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,710
You two. Leave. Go.

717
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,310
Yes.

718
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,810
-Close the door.
-Go ahead with your work.

719
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,240
Master.

720
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,420
Look. Everything is here.

721
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,980
Except those we’ve burned

722
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,860
and those you ordered to be left
to Xiao Jinyu,

723
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,860
every other scroll

724
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,140
is here.

725
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,980
Has Xiao Jinyu taken actions?

726
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,490
Just as you’ve expected,

727
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,420
Xiao Jinyu ordered his Chief Guardsman,

728
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,280
Wu Jiang, to lead a team of guards

729
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,700
and stand by at
Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

730
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,950
They only left

731
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,940
when Xiao Jinyu himself arrived.

732
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
I guess

733
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,560
our wise and assertive
Commandery Prince An

734
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,700
is now shaking Princess Xiping’s sleeves

735
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,630
and begging for his father.

736
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,510
Prince Consort secretly reported
the treason of Chen Ying,

737
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,180
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan,
to the imperial court.

738
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,950
Prince Consort was tragically
murdered by Chen Ying.

739
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,090
When I led Shence Army
to suppress the rebellion

740
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,890
at His Majesty’s behest.

741
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,330
It was too late.

742
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,330
These are what I can bring back.

743
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,570
I’m sorry, Your Grace.

744
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,830
His Majesty is impressed
by Prince Consort’s loyalty.

745
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,660
His Majesty has decreed the conferment.

746
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,640
Your Grace, please take it.

747
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,700
I’ve never imagined that

748
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,380
-you father would disappear
-No.

749
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,970
-like that.
No.

750
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,940
So, father’s current grave in Chang’an

751
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,220
is a cenotaph.

752
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,290
Besides accepting it,

753
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,100
what else can I do?

754
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,210
The Imperial Court at that time

755
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,580
was so different from the current one.

756
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,820
The conflict between ministers
and eunuchs were so heated.

757
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,850
When we heard your father’s
death in Chang’an,

758
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,970
Chang’an was caught in Ganlu Incident.

759
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,010
The North Yamen led by eunuchs
were on a killing spree.

760
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,390
The South Yamen led by Prime Minister
were slaughtered.

761
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,810
Even my father was
confined in the imperial palace.

762
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,330
The conferment decree for your dad
was already ordered.

763
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,290
Leng Family, from the Southwest,
supports me.

764
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,800
But if I insist to seek justice
from the Imperial Court,

765
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,650
considering the situation,

766
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,490
I would’ve already brought calamities
on you and your brother

767
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,770
before the justice could be upheld.

768
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,620
Mother,

769
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,180
it seems that

770
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,220
father might still be alive.
