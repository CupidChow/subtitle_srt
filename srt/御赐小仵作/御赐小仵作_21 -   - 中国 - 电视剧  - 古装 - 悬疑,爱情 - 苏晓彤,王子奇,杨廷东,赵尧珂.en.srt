1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,760
Chu Chu went to the river

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,350
and got the mirror back alone.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,710
I knew she did it for me.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,680
But nothing in this world

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,200
could be more precious than her life.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,310
I always put her in danger

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,840
and make her sad.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,000
How can I really be nice to her?

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
(Phoenix Mountain)
The light spots in the drawing

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,620
indicated the southwest
of Phoenix Mountain.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,680
Is there any shelter over there?

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,680
There?

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,000
There isn’t any shelter.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,080
That’s a marsh land.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
There’s a big swamp,

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,110
with many vipers and scorpions.
It’s a very dangerous place.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,590
Few people go there.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,520
If he went there,

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,950
I’m afraid he could hardly survive.

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,470
No, no, no, Your Highness.

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,720
I didn’t mean that.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,400
Sir Witch Doctor must be alive!

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,840
He’s so smart.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,630
He left such a complicated indication.

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,550
The danger in the swamp

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,040
wasn’t a big deal to him.

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,230
Maybe,

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,830
he put something there

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,550
and then moved to another place.

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,720
I mean

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,000
it’s hard to get there.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,720
If we want to get there,

33
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,160
we must be well prepared.

34
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,910
Your Highness, I...

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
I understand.

36
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,040
I’m sorry.

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,300
=The Imperial Coroner=

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,180
=Episode 21=

39
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,520
Flowers flourish in the Imperial Garden.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,750
But I remember

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
you like no flowers, but cattails.

42
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,270
Flowers are beautiful,
but bloom only in certain seasons.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
After waiting for a long season,

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,370
people can only enjoy them for days.

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,600
Soon, they wither and fall,

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,070
leaving nothing, but memories.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,910
Cattail is better.

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,530
It looks plain,

49
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,580
but it blooms all year round.

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,020
It makes people feel relieved.

51
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,250
It doesn’t sound like you.

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,300
Xiao Heng said that, didn’t he?

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,450
He doesn’t like flowers.

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,300
He likes rocks only.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
I heard that

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,190
your love token was a pair of rocks.

57
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,830
Yes.

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,520
In A Pair of Peacocks Southeast Fly,

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,320
“Like rock you should stand
all the blast.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
I will be a willow twig so pliant.

61
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,680
That, thin like silk thread,
remains tough.

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
A-clinging to the boulder giant.”

63
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,040
Did you get your love token
because of this poem?

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,030
It’s made of rock?

65
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,470
Yes, rock.

66
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,990
Where did you get it?

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,000
I picked it near the pond in my house.

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,630
You’re frank.

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you still remember I’m a princess?

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I don’t even want jewels or jade.

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,000
How dare you give me a rock

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
from your pond.

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
I know you like cattails,

74
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,030
though flowers are beautiful.

75
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,030
Then I know

76
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,960
I can’t touch you with jewels,

77
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,070
but with a rock.

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
You mean the poem
A Pair of Peacocks Southeast Fly?

79
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,520
“Like rock you should stand
all the blast.

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,120
I will be a willow twig so pliant.

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,190
That, thin like silk thread,
remains tough.

82
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,750
A-clinging to the boulder giant.”

83
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,520
It’s a good poem,
but it doesn’t mean good.

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,190
Do you compare us

85
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,060
to the miserable couple in the poem?

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,350
I don’t dare to. Please let me explain.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,310
Look, Your Highness.

88
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,310
Cattail mostly grows near shoals,

89
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,920
where there’re many rocks.

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,360
On sunny days,

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,840
rocks and cattails
stay with each other quietly.

92
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,960
On stormy days,

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
rocks stabilize cattails

94
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,150
to protect them from storms.

95
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,490
I don’t want to be a jade pendant
around your waist

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,470
as an ornament to your glory.

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,870
Instead, I want to be a rock,

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,380
to always protect you.

99
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,140
I heard that

100
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,960
you and your husband loved each other.

101
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,070
I didn’t know you loved so much.

102
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,630
Don’t tease me, Your Majesty.

103
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,560
It was Xiao Heng’s duty

104
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,800
to sacrifice everything for our nation.

105
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,680
My sons should do that, too.

106
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,310
It’s tough for you, though.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
Your Majesty, if you think

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,390
I deserve some pity,

109
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
please show some mercy

110
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,580
on Leng Yue.

111
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,620
Don’t let her suffer the same as mine.

112
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,250
You mean

113
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,210
all the officials shouldn’t get married
or have descendants?

114
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,810
Xiping,

115
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,770
I kindly make a match
between Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue.

116
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,970
As a member of the imperial family,

117
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,460
you should understand
what an honor it is!

118
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,460
Don’t be ungrateful!

119
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,860
Your Majesty...

120
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,460
Say no more!

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,210
When’s Xiao Jinli’s birthday?

122
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
As his mother,

123
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,020
you don’t need to calculate it, right?

124
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,170
Now that you fail

125
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,060
to divine their birthdays for days,

126
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,450
let the Imperial Astronomer do it!

127
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,020
Jinbao,

129
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,520
did His Majesty only say that

130
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,250
to Princess Xiping?

131
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,090
Yes. I don’t dare to lie.

132
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,820
How easy it is

133
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,730
be an emperor in the flourishing age!

134
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,540
There’s no domestic trouble
or foreign invasion.

135
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,380
He even tries to be a matchmaker.

136
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,670
All right. Go take care of His Majesty.

137
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,570
Yes.

138
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,880
Master,

139
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,340
His Majesty is quite odd lately.

140
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,970
Think about it.

141
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,610
Yesterday,

142
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,290
he asked about the birthday
of Xiao Jinli and Xiao Jinyu.

143
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,070
Today, he brought it up again

144
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,590
to Princess Xiping.

145
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,050
He even pressed for
the detailed birthdates in public.

146
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,740
Did His Majesty also think of...?

147
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,370
What?

148
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,050
Master, don’t you remember?

149
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,050
In old years

150
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,420
when Princess Xiping gave birth
to the boys,

151
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,370
people gossiped a lot.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,030
Even if His Majesty

153
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,750
was biding his time

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,520
or ignoring everything,

155
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,350
he must have heard about it.

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,350
Now that you brought it up,

157
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,190
ask your men to check on it.

158
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,560
By the way,

159
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,070
Zhou Han was sent
to ask about Duke Chang.

160
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,680
Why hasn’t he got anything yet?

161
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,470
He just hasn’t.

162
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Chang’an isn’t so big.

163
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,470
He should have even searched
the entire city.

164
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,640
Why hasn’t he got anything yet?

165
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,440
Master, think about it.

166
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,120
Zhou Han...

167
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,000
It’s hard to comment on him.

168
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,240
You have no idea

169
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,590
what he always does with your award.

170
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,080
The other day, I heard that

171
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,800
he visited Pingkang Residence every day.

172
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,780
He’s very likely

173
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,810
to enjoy himself there, in your name.

174
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,930
If your senior had come back

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,780
after searching for Xiao Heng
in the Southwest,

176
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,220
I needn’t have used losers

177
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,220
like Zhou Han!

178
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,400
Master, no offense,

179
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,900
but do you really think

180
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,170
my senior ran away

181
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,290
depending on his great martial arts

182
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,930
and has been enjoying his life,

183
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,370
regardless of anything else?

184
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,050
You finally used your brain.

185
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,250
It must be more complicated.

186
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,900
Someone must be opposing me

187
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,730
very secretly!

188
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,170
Master,

189
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,410
could it be Xiao Heng?

190
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,490
Think about it.

191
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,780
We last heard about him

192
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,810
when our men came back from Qianzhou

193
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,660
and told us they found his trace.

194
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,850
Over so many years,

195
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,340
we’ve got no news about him anymore.

196
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,730
But if it’s him, that’s also weird.

197
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,020
He rejected the bright future we offered

198
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,340
and abandoned his families.

199
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,340
What’s he after?

200
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,170
It’s what always worries me.

201
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,250
This is ridiculous.

202
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,850
Not to mention years,

203
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,220
I can’t stay here
for even one single day.

204
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
At night,

205
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,850
poison gas spreads,
snakes and worms run about.

206
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,810
How could Prince Consort

207
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,490
live in such a place?

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,900
Your Highness, are you fooling me?

209
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,370
Don’t talk nonsense.

210
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,350
Deputy Magistrate Tan, I’m warning you.

211
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,760
If you keep taking nonsense,

212
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,350
I’ll ask General Xiao to shut your mouth

213
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,910
with smelly socks.

214
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,590
I’ll say no more.

215
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,710
You really have smelly socks?

216
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,640
Put them away. How insulting!

217
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,520
Soldiers like us want convenience first.

218
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,910
We don’t bother about insult.

219
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,440
Your Highness,

220
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,390
walk ahead and we’ll reach the swamp.

221
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,340
I guess it’s where

222
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,730
Sir Witch Doctor indicated.

223
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,200
Now that Father indicated this place,

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,320
he wouldn’t try to get us killed.

225
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,150
But it’s quite a big place

226
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,910
without signs to show the way.

227
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,910
How can we find him?

228
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,380
(Phoenix Mountain)
(Swamp)

229
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,760
Chu Chu, what are you doing?

230
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,150
It’s dangerous. Come down!

231
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,590
I’m exploring the way.

232
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,950
We can’t explore the way in a swamp

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,270
unless we climb high.

234
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
So many martial artists are here.

235
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,480
You don’t need to climb high. Come down!

236
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,270
Yeah.

237
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,080
I’m better at exploring the way
in such a place.

238
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Let me do it!

239
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,760
Look, Chu Chu. What’s that?

240
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,320
Three piles of rocks, I think.

241
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,710
Were they here before?

242
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,760
It’s also my first time to come here.

243
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,560
I haven’t seen them before.

244
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,910
What are you talking about?

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,150
They don’t look like nests of animals.

246
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,910
They look like...

247
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,640
Tombs?

248
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,560
Looks like

249
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,280
someone piled the rocks deliberately.

250
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Your Highness, these are rocks

251
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,030
Sir Witch Doctor used
to make chess pieces.

252
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,760
What’s wrong, Your Highness?

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,950
Father...

254
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,510
He’s in the swamp?

255
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,910
What? How come?

256
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,120
Light spots on the wall

257
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,270
lead to this place

258
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,510
where there’s a large swamp.

259
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,320
The chess game indicates

260
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,710
the exact location in the swamp.

261
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Chess game?

262
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,280
Three piles of rocks

263
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,910
represent three chess pieces.

264
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,300
(Rook)

265
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,300
(Knight)

266
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
(Elephant)

267
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,250
(Pawn)

268
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
(Pawn)
The fourth chess piece...

269
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,590
Prince Consort...

270
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,280
No way.

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,550
It’s impossible!

272
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,470
He hid the corpse and left a chess game!

273
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,030
He took so much trouble to get us here!

274
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
He couldn’t have...!

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,760
Your Highness, could Sir Witch Doctor

276
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,840
only leave a clue in the swamp?

277
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,810
Just like the chess game.

278
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,050
It’s a clue,

279
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,930
leading us

280
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,370
to another place.

281
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,860
Yes, you’re right.

282
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,540
It must be a clue in the swamp.

283
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,980
Vice General!

284
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,450
Yes.

285
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,940
Take your men with me
and find out the clue!

286
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,570
Yes.

287
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,100
You guys, come over!

288
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,180
Yes!

289
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,020
No.

290
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,780
There isn’t another place.

291
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,250
Why?

292
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,570
I think Chu Chu makes sense.

293
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,740
If Prince Consort doesn’t want
to be easily found,

294
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,250
it’s very possible that

295
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,300
he left more clues,
leading to many other places.

296
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,690
Like Tan Gui said,

297
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,540
poison gas spreads at night.

298
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,890
Snakes and worms run about.

299
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,180
It even took strong men like us

300
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,900
half a day

301
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,740
to walk here.

302
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,370
Father had difficulty moving about.

303
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,230
When he came all the way here,

304
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,220
calibrated the location,

305
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,540
and piled the rocks,

306
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,450
he couldn’t leave before it got dark.

307
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,710
Couldn’t he come a few more times

308
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,200
and do a bit work every time

309
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,880
before it got dark?

310
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,350
He couldn’t.

311
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,280
Now that he used
such a complicated chess game

312
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,440
to hide the clues for this place,

313
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,790
it means this place was crucial

314
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,810
and he didn’t want others to notice.

315
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,340
If he came frequently,

316
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,570
someone might track him down.

317
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,050
Then his efforts on the chess game

318
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,370
would be wasted.

319
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,520
But...

320
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,910
Leng Yue, let’s check other places.

321
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,400
Why?

322
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,030
Come and you’ll know.

323
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:53,960
Come on.

324
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,200
What exactly do you want?

325
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,470
His Highness is used to
thinking of the worst.

326
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,670
But mostly,

327
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,520
for the safety of his subordinates.

328
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
This time, he’s looking for his father.

329
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,680
He wants a favorable turn

330
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,350
more than anyone else.

331
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,080
Now that he came to the conclusion,

332
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,320
he must have weighed all possibilities

333
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,800
in his heart.

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,080
As he was weighing the possibilities,

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,080
his hope was gradually shattered,

336
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,740
just like being dismembered.

337
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,390
Do you know how miserable it was?

338
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,910
The more he explains,
the more pain he has to experience.

339
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,610
If you trust him,

340
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,730
ask no more.

341
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,130
All right.

342
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,370
I was impetuous just now.

343
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,700
What about Chu Chu?

344
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,700
She understands.

345
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,430
What she told His Highness

346
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,110
that it was the clue in the swamp...

347
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,760
She didn’t even believe that.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,950
But she never lies to His Highness.

349
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
Everyone knows how to lie,

350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
but they just don’t want to
or don’t need to.

351
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,520
If Prince Consort really died,

352
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,430
what will happen to Chu Chu?

353
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
Will your father let go of her?

354
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,350
Don’t worry. When I’m around,

355
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,560
I won’t let anyone from my family
hurt Chu Chu.

356
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,350
Chu Chu…

357
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Say no more, Your Highness.

358
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,710
I trust you. I know it.

359
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,920
I believe whatever you say.

360
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,640
Thank you.

361
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Jinyu, is Father really in the swamp?

362
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes.

363
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,310
He’s waiting for the Handsome Judge.

364
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,470
After staying in the swamp alone

365
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,110
for five years,

366
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,030
what does Father still have?

367
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,350
His skeleton,

368
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,280
or even not a complete skeleton?

369
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,290
Your Highness...

370
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,710
Just tell me.

371
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,160
Could he…

372
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,190
not have even crushed bones?

373
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,680
No, I didn’t mean that.

374
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,160
Your Highness,
do you remember the corpse

375
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,350
your father hid

376
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,400
in the wall?

377
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,640
He would also have a corpse like that.

378
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,190
It’s called

379
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,470
wet corpse in our industry.

380
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,710
Wet corpse?

381
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,110
Fishes, shrimps and shellfishes

382
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,830
can hardly survive in a swamp.

383
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,400
Because the swamp is totally airtight,

384
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,310
corpses can be easily preserved.

385
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,520
They’ll be preserved in a better way

386
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,070
than your father used

387
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,280
to store the eunuch.

388
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,660
Wrapped in water-proof oilcloth,

389
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,210
a man would be in the swamp...

390
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,070
As if in a natural coffin.

391
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,190
General, we found him!

392
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,590
Jinyu,

393
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,590
if Father arranged this,

394
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,680
how did he wrap himself?

395
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,040
How...? How come?

396
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,710
General Xiao, may I borrow a dagger?

397
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,560
I’m a coroner.

398
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,350
After getting on with Sir Witch Doctor
for so many years,

399
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,040
I know how to recognize him.

400
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,760
Let me do it.

401
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,310
I can recognize him.

402
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,800
He... He’s...?

403
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,680
You know him?

404
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,230
Does he have a scald

405
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,830
on his left arm?

406
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,160
You...?

407
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,590
He gave you the pendant,

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,310
didn’t he?

409
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,400
The Handsome Judge
let out a sigh of relief

410
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,680
and felt ardent.

411
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
No matter

412
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,110
how long or how deep

413
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,170
one thing is hidden,

414
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,920
it always waits

415
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,040
to be rediscovered.

416
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,920
It’s him.

417
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,400
Considering his appearance,

418
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,920
his height,

419
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,040
the wound on his leg

420
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,110
and the scar on his arm.

421
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,830
Your Highness,

422
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,040
I’m finished.

423
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
How was he dead?

424
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,350
(Facial vessels)
There’re many blood dots

425
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,830
in his eye ground, corners of his eyes,
his face and neck.

426
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,190
(Blood dots on the neck)
His neck has obvious blood stasis.

427
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,950
(Blood vessel engorgement)
He was suffocated to death.

428
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,310
You mean he was alive

429
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,680
before he was thrown into the swamp

430
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,310
and he was drowned by someone?

431
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,110
He drowned himself.

432
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,520
Why? Why did he do that?

433
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,950
The answer may be in the casket.

434
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,830
What... What do the numbers mean?

435
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,350
The numbers are in groups of three.

436
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,000
I think they’re ciphers.

437
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,950
Ciphers?

438
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,040
Numbers or symbols are used

439
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
to replace words.

440
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,950
If we want to understand the ciphers,

441
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,950
we must know

442
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,800
in which way

443
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,230
the numbers are translated into words.

444
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,800
Numbers are translated into words?

445
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,160
For example,

446
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,310
one six three. There may be a book.

447
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
One represents the first article

448
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,000
in this book.

449
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,680
Six represents the sixth line
of this article.

450
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,000
Three represents the third word

451
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,680
in the sixth line.

452
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,400
So, one six three leads to

453
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,190
a certain word.

454
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,310
You mean

455
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,950
if we want to understand this,

456
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,350
we must find a book first?

457
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,350
Sort of.

458
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,830
But there isn’t any book here.

459
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,230
We searched Sir Witch Doctor’s house,

460
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,590
but found no book, either.

461
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,640
Could it be an article he wrote

462
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,920
or his favorite book?

463
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,560
His favorite book is
Intrigues of the Warring States.

464
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,920
I remember

465
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,760
all his letters and articles.

466
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,560
It can’t be any of them.

467
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,590
Wait.

468
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,490
It’s not something related to him.

469
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,970
In the house he stayed in

470
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,090
and on his corpse,

471
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,780
he left no clue

472
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
about his real identity.

473
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,090
He knew that

474
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,970
the one who solved the chess game
and found his corpse

475
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,090
might not know his real identity.

476
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,820
The way to decode the ciphers

477
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,970
has nothing to do with him.

478
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,060
But there’s nothing more in the casket.

479
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,130
Wait a second.

480
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,540
There’re words on the casket.

481
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,540
Yes. Let me have a look.

482
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,330
There’re words on the cover, too.

483
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,060
Looks like a poem.

484
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,940
Peach blossoms by the river.

485
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,820
A boy sits aside on the boat.

486
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,250
The lady picks...

487
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,300
Picks...

488
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,940
I can’t read this word.

489
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,560
Cress.

490
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,820
The lady picks cress on the river.

491
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,600
Water ripples.

492
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,660
It’s also a poem on the casket.

493
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,580
Spring flowers wither
and summer leaves grow.

494
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,940
The moon shines over the bridge.

495
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,940
I can’t help thinking of the past.

496
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,780
Countless sorrow comes in clouds.

497
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,300
What... What’s this?

498
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,210
I’m so sad to leave.

499
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,850
Can’t help missing you on rainy days.

500
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,940
What do the poems mean?

501
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,090
Are they the codebooks?

502
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,710
I never heard of these two poems.

503
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,160
I think Prince Consort wrote them.

504
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,670
But they’re mere doggerel.

505
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,280
Prince Consort shouldn’t have written
such poor poems.

506
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,850
Why do you think they’re poor?

507
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,420
These words are difficult
one after another.

508
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,540
Groups of three numbers for two poems.

509
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,380
How can we decode them?

510
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,130
Only about 50 words in two poems.

511
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,460
But there’re more than a hundred

512
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,180
numbers and ciphers.

513
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,900
Not to mention

514
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,530
if the poems can be translated

515
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,450
into another meaningful sentence,

516
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,260
even the numbers don’t match.

517
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,210
Lord Jing, what does this word sound?

518
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,730
I didn’t hear clearly.

519
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,130
Cress, sound likes chess.

520
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,130
The same pronunciation?

521
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,580
The reverse phonetic notation!

522
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,090
The two poems weren’t written
for no reason.

523
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,820
In this first poem,

524
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,420
there’re 23 words.

525
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,820
All initial consonants are different.

526
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,800
Also,

527
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,950
in the second poem,

528
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,760
there’re 36 words.

529
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,110
The compound vowels are different.

530
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,230
The numbers in groups of three

531
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,680
represent a word from the first poem

532
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,590
and a tone from the second poem.

533
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,230
Then we can mark
the pronunciation of each word

534
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,000
with the reverse phonetic notation.

535
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,430
I’m Censor Xiao Heng,

536
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,430
working for Emperor Wenzong.

537
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,680
I’m leaving the ciphertext,

538
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,000
wishing a scholarly and brave man

539
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,830
to solve the puzzle of my haunted house,
figure out the chess game,

540
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,760
and find where I drown myself,

541
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,040
so that the grievance will be redressed

542
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,710
and loyal men in Jiannan
can be vindicated.

543
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,160
In the ninth year of his reign,

544
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,000
Emperor Wenzong wanted
to wipe out eunuchs.

545
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,680
With a secret imperial decree,
I asked Military Commissioner Chen Ying

546
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,430
to go to Chang’an for coordination.

547
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
Chen Ying was about to leave.

548
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,190
Unexpectedly, Incident Ganlu failed.

549
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,710
Eunuchs controlled His Majesty
and killed officials.

550
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,070
Loyal generals including Chen Ying
were slandered to rebel.

551
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,310
At the behest of His Majesty,

552
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,680
Military Commissioner Chen Ying
rebelled with his troops!

553
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,850
They’ll be executed right here!

554
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,590
Go!

555
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
Go!

556
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,280
Kill!

557
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,710
-Chen Ying!
-Censor Xiao, leave!

558
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,950
We rely on you to vindicate us!

559
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,680
Leave the eunuchs to us!

560
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,760
Leave!

561
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,070
Xiao Heng ran away! After him!

562
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,400
I broke through, with the secret decree.

563
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,350
But I was encircled and badly wounded.

564
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,000
I had no choice,
but to jump off the cliff.

565
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,540
Luckily, a Witch Doctor saved me.

566
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,010
I was in a coma for over a month.

567
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,160
When I woke up,
I couldn’t retrieve the situation.

568
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,490
Eunuchs faked an imperial edict,

569
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,800
and tried to lure me out

570
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,230
with a heroic title
and the rank of nobility

571
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,110
so that they could kill me
to destroy the evidence.

572
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,920
If I took one wrong step,

573
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,640
I wouldn’t vindicate the loyal generals,

574
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,560
and would also implicate
more innocent people.

575
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,720
In desperation,
after the Witch Doctor died of disease,

576
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,830
I took over his job

577
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,880
and dwelled in Pingle Town, Guanling,
for the future plan.

578
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,040
Luckily, the Chu Family took care of me.

579
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,430
I never forgot my mission.

580
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,640
However, Guanling County
has a difficult terrain.

581
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,800
One can’t leave
unless he uses a sliding rope.

582
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,520
Eunuchs never stop searching for me
in the Southwest.

583
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,680
My legs were broken
and I can hardly walk.

584
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,710
Local officials
keep killing subordinates

585
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,470
of Military Commissioner of Jiannan

586
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,640
who escaped to this town.

587
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,040
I’ve never had a chance
to contact people in Chang’an.

588
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,950
Later, a eunuch tracked me down alone.

589
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,440
I was lucky enough to kill him.

590
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,520
I hid his corpse and sword in the wall,

591
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,910
as the evidence.

592
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,190
Unfortunately, my health condition
gets worse

593
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,000
and I’m dying soon.

594
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,950
I don’t want to die,

595
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,470
