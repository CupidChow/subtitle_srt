1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,110
For the concern about Chu Chu,

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,840
Chu He let go of Xu Rugui
without permission.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,350
The Chu family are all kind.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,340
But Chu Chu has
a complicated background.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,500
It’s challenging for them to defend her.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,210
Tan Gui brought about the old problem
of the previous dynasty

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,020
and Senior Jing.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,050
The situation is getting
more complicated.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,390
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,680
Since you work for Senior Jing,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,240
you should know why I came to
the Southwest this time.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,720
Senior Jing wants you to kill Chu Chu

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,630
to avenge my father.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,400
But if my father wants you to
let her go,

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,630
are you willing to
put off killing Chu Chu

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,200
and tell Senior Jing about
the situation first?

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,940
You mean Prince Consort is still...?

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,740
Since I came to Guanling County,

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,540
I’ve had a confusion.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,970
Chu Chu’s family background is doubtful.

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,060
My father stayed with her for years.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,610
How could he not figure it out?

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,580
But he treated Chu Chu
as his own daughter.

24
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,740
So, I guess

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,940
there’s something fishy.

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,900
You mean the Witch Doctor

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,940
who contacted the Chu Family...?

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,530
But he’s been missing,
since five years ago.

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,770
I guess

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,130
he’s still here.

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,250
I’ll go look for my father
in a couple of days.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,610
After I find him,

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,180
the truth will be known.

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,010
Now that you want to avenge him,

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,780
shouldn’t you ask him if he wants it?

36
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,330
Your Highness,

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,820
are you serious?

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,100
How about this?

39
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,780
You can go with us.

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,180
Yes,

41
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,610
Your Highness.

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,820
I’m sorry, Jing Yi.

43
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,820
I was too impulsive.

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,530
It was my fault.

45
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,060
I should have told you earlier.

46
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,900
=The Imperial Coroner=

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,300
=Episode 20=

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,530
Are you alright?

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,370
Yes.

50
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,650
Xiao Jinli was so rude.

51
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,780
He shouldn’t have hit you so hard.

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,420
Let me check on you.

53
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
We’re on the street.

54
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,620
So what?

55
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,570
No one else is around.

56
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,530
Let me check on you.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,010
I’m alright.

58
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Let me check.

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
I’m really alright.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,370
I’m glad you’re alright.

61
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,550
If Xiao Jinli dares to hurt you again,

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,830
I’ll skin him!

63
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,760
Thank you.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
We’re friends.

65
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,600
You’re welcome.

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,370
Brother!

67
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,130
Chu Chu, why did you come?

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,620
Brother, what happened?

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,320
I’m alright.

70
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,230
I was... I was just flogged.

71
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,760
Flogged?

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,950
Why were you flogged?

73
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,160
Let me check on you. Which part?

74
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,920
Don’t. Don’t check on me.

75
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,790
Why can’t I?

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,320
I’m a man,

77
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,600
but you’re a girl.

78
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,640
Why do you think?

79
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,670
My job is to inspect wounded
or dead bodies.

80
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,350
I checked on a lot of men.

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,600
Besides,

82
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,200
you also checked on a lot of women.

83
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,720
Why can’t I check on you?

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,440
Let me have a look.

85
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,950
Don’t. Don’t.

86
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,160
My good sister, don’t worry.

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,230
I’m alright.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Don’t check on me.

89
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,600
Brother,

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,550
tell me about it.

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
What mistake did you make?

92
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,390
Why were you flogged?

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Grandfather and Father worked for years,

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,950
but they never got flogged.

95
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,160
What a big mistake you made

96
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,160
that Magistrate Zheng flogged you?

97
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,390
No wonder you don’t dare to go home.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,830
It wasn’t Magistrate Zheng.

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Then... His Highness punished you?

100
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,480
No, no.

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
I did something terrible

102
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,600
and I thought it was a huge mistake.

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,510
Then I asked to be flogged

104
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,600
so that I could feel better

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,480
and then learn a lesson.

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,790
I’m telling you.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,550
No matter what happens to you

108
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,040
and when it happens,

109
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,920
you must tell me.

110
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,670
Don’t keep it bottled up in your heart.

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,480
When you were little,

112
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,230
you told us everything.

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,350
But since you came back from Chang’an,

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
you’ve kept everything in your mind,

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,510
instead of telling me.

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,000
You only tell that Commandery Prince.

117
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,490
Brother.

118
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,480
I know!

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,390
I’m not as good as him.

120
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,670
He’s handsome and virtuous.

121
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,070
Looks like he knows everything

122
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,350
and he can handle any problem.

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,160
He’s a powerful official.

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,670
If I were a girl,

125
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,790
I would like him, too.

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,200
But Chu Chu, I promise you.

127
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,600
I will help you

128
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,480
with whatever I can!

129
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,790
If he bullies you,

130
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,200
I’ll punish him for you…

131
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,040
even at the risk of my life!

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Brother, you’re always my good brother.

133
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,040
I’m always your brother.

134
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,670
Rest assured.

135
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,180
You heard Chu He say

136
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,420
he wanted to marry Chu Chu?

137
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
How dared I talk nonsense about it?

138
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,400
At least he knows

139
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,350
how to be nice to her.

140
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,590
What?

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Nothing.

142
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,550
What? Having a stomach ache again?

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,230
Did you not have meal regularly?

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,110
I told you not to do this!

145
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,000
It doesn’t matter.

146
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,070
It matters! Take it.

147
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,640
Brother, what are you doing?

148
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,040
Brother!

149
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,790
Brother!

150
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,000
Lie down.

151
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,920
Brother, I’ll be alright soon.

152
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,720
You won’t.

153
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,320
You don’t eat or sleep.

154
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,350
Look how pale your face is!

155
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,880
Tell me. What’s on your mind?

156
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,200
Since you were little,

157
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,440
you’ve kept everything bottled up.

158
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,550
You don’t tell us
until you figure it out.

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
But there’re countless things
in the world.

160
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,320
Can you figure out all of them alone?

161
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,550
I don’t mean to keep it from you.

162
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,280
But my mind is still in a mess.

163
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,200
I don’t know how to explain to you.

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
Then tell me the mess.

165
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,350
It doesn’t matter
if it’s right or wrong.

166
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
You can even complain to me.

167
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,400
Better than holding it to yourself.

168
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,520
Jinyu, remember.

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
No matter what happens,

170
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,670
you have me.

171
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,910
Brother, you never owe me.

172
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,670
You’re not having a fever.

173
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

174
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,150
I know

175
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,640
you’ve been feeling guilty

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,230
for many years,

177
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,230
only because I saved you from water

178
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,510
when we were little.

179
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,880
So, you always defend me,
make concessions to me

180
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,560
and aggrieve yourself.

181
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,200
You even let me claim father’s title

182
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,470
and be the Commandery Prince.

183
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,320
But,

184
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,030
we’re brothers.

185
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,910
We should help each other.

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,270
If it were me who fell into the water,

187
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,640
you would have saved me, too,

188
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,550
right?

189
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,230
Jinyu, it’s my first time

190
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,790
to see you think stupidly.

191
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,880
You saved me from water
when you couldn’t swim.

192
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,080
Now you care for me and trust me,

193
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,760
because I’m your elder brother

194
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,110
and your family, right?

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,030
Then why do I protect you,
make concessions to you

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,400
and care for you?

197
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,080
Also because I’m your elder brother.

198
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
It’s nothing about guilt.

199
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,440
But Brother...

200
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,640
Jinyu, I let you
be the Commandery Prince,

201
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,670
because it suits you more.

202
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,790
I always love martial arts.

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,400
You know that.

204
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,400
We’re General Leng’s relatives.

205
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,760
If I were the Commandery Prince,

206
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,710
would His Majesty allow me

207
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,590
to join the army or become a general?

208
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,550
You’re different.

209
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,960
You take charge of

210
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,280
Three Judicial Offices
at such a young age.

211
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
When you’re the Commandery Prince,

212
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,710
other officials will be fearful.

213
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,350
And you’ll be safer.

214
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,320
We shouldn’t waste the title of nobility

215
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,640
Father left us, should we?

216
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,520
It’s generous of you, Brother.
I was narrow-minded.

217
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
That’s right, then.

218
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,150
Be gentle, Brother.

219
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,670
You needn’t have been so hard.

220
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,320
Well, you’ve grown up

221
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,640
and you don’t even let me hug you.

222
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,350
All right, I’ll save my strength

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,030
to punch Xu Rugui.

224
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,350
Xu Rugui has confessed that

225
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,670
he worked for Qin Luan.

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,400
His families were kept in the capital
as hostages.

227
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,400
He failed his mission and escaped.

228
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Considering Qin Luan’s temper,

229
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,320
he’ll kill Xu Rugui’s families.

230
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,110
I asked Wu Jiang
to keep a close eye in the capital.

231
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,320
If someone tries to kill them,

232
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,030
Wu Jiang will save them secretly.

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Can Wu Jiang do that?

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
One can make great progress
in a short period of time.

235
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,590
You haven’t seen Wu Jiang
for quite a lot of periods.

236
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,550
(Three Judicial Offices)
Zhou Han took four men out,

237
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
heading for Pingkang Residence.

238
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,760
Just like what His Highness predicted.

239
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,230
Guys, go catch them with me!

240
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,470
Yes!

241
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,940
(Two Merits Hall)

242
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,180
Sir.

243
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,980
(Romance Brothel)

244
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,450
General Zhou, it’s been a long time.

245
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,910
Have you been weak?

246
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,790
-I’ve been too busy. Shut up.
-Welcome next time.

247
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,710
General Zhou,

248
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,760
you haven’t come for days.

249
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,200
I’ve been busy.

250
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,710
I was just off duty

251
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,150
and I’m coming to relax with my men.

252
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,150
You had a long day, generals.

253
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,670
Come in, please.

254
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,880
Guard at the door. Go.

255
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,640
-Rest assured.
-Come in, please.

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
-Be quick.
-This way.

257
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,150
-Don’t worry. Everything’s alright.
-I was too busy. Or I’d come earlier.

258
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Are Xu Rugui’s families all here?

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,030
Yes.

260
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,150
Don’t worry, General Zhou.

261
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
His wife, a concubine, two sons
and a daughter

262
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,760
are locked up.

263
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,080
All are here.

264
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,550
Find a chance to feed them this.

265
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,320
It’s...?

266
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,110
Having not worked for days,

267
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,000
you can’t even recognize it?

268
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,590
I can. I can.

269
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,350
General Zhou, may I ask for a favor?

270
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,000
Xu Rugui’s concubine looks quite pretty.

271
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,440
It’s a pity if she dies like that.

272
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
May I...?

273
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,150
Come on.

274
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,520
Are you out of your mind?

275
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
Are you addicted to being a procuress?

276
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,080
Feed it to her or to yourself!

277
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,880
Shall I make you a night-soil woman
next time?

278
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,840
Don’t. Don’t!

279
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,440
Don’t get angry, General Zhou.

280
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,470
I didn’t mean it.

281
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,760
Don’t worry.

282
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,080
I’ll handle them efficiently.

283
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,550
Do I need to teach you
how to handle the corpses?

284
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,350
No. No.

285
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
I would claim girls and waiters
of our brothel

286
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
died of disease

287
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,710
and take them to unmarked common graves.

288
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,030
Don’t worry.

289
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,670
Nothing will go wrong.

290
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
That’s more like it.

291
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,230
By the way, is Chunxiang in?

292
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,910
Yes.

293
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,350
When you didn’t come,

294
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,590
she was missing you.

295
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,030
Get her to me.

296
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,960
Please wait.

297
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,790
I’ll ask girls to serve you.

298
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,030
Go. Be quick!

299
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,630
My girls are waiting for me.

300
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,520
Come and get me, sir.

301
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,400
General Wu, shall we take action now?

302
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,400
Eunuch Qin, taste this.

303
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,080
It’s a new dish
the Imperial Cook invented,

304
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
Luck & Joy Soup.

305
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,960
It’s made of ingredients

306
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,670
just offered from Yangzhou.

307
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,470
His Majesty hasn’t tasted it yet.

308
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,000
Let me have a try.

309
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,820
Master.

310
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,030
It doesn’t matter. He’s one of us.

311
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,550
Zhou Han sent a message that

312
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,230
Xu Rugui’s families were all killed.

313
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,400
He finally fulfilled a mission.

314
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,600
You haven’t had dinner yet?

315
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,710
Come on. Have it with us.

316
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,590
Jinbao, get him
a bowl of Joy & Luck Soup.

317
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,960
All right, Eunuch Qin.

318
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,320
Eunuch Qin, it’s not Joy & Luck Soup.

319
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,350
It’s Luck & Joy Soup.

320
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,280
All right. Luck and joy.

321
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Thank you, Master.

322
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,280
Jinbao,

323
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,080
I have something to ask you.

324
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,520
What did His Majesty say
about the marriage

325
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,710
between Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue?

326
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,880
His Majesty complained today.

327
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,910
Then he mentioned that

328
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,350
Princess Xiping wanted

329
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,640
to divine the birthdays
of Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue,

330
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,790
but she didn’t reply yet.

331
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,760
She’s obviously stalling for time.

332
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,280
But His Majesty didn’t say much,

333
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,710
because he thought I was around.

334
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,110
His Majesty cares so much
about their marriage.

335
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,470
I’m afraid

336
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,080
he’ll use it to deal with Leng Peishan.

337
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,000
Leng Peishan must have done something

338
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,470
in the Southwest.

339
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,230
Capital Liaison Representative
of Qianzhou.

340
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,830
Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

341
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,310
Minister of War.

342
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,430
Who’s behind it?

343
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,160
Mingde.

344
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:20,950
Yes.

345
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,040
Shen Yu, the new
Capital Liaison Representative.

346
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,800
Where does he come from?

347
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,040
Shen...

348
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,510
Qianzhou.

349
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,200
He’s from Wuhou County, Qianzhou.

350
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
It’s where Duke Chang used to live.

351
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,470
Master, why do you ask?

352
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,510
Jinbao,

353
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,270
His Majesty needs you.

354
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,640
I understand.

355
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,760
Enjoy your meal, Eunuch Qin.
I’ll leave you alone.

356
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,830
What’s wrong, Master?

357
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,640
I’m telling you.

358
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,070
Something big may happen
in the Southwest.

359
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,920
Keep a close eye on Antique Store.

360
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,280
Now that a spy is put in the court,

361
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,000
I’ll find out

362
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,920
who’s behind him.

363
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,680
Speaking of it,

364
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,200
Miss Chu is so poor.

365
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,990
She nearly died before she was born.

366
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
She hasn’t even seen her father.

367
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,800
So far,

368
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,270
she hasn’t even eaten or drunk anything

369
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,910
from the Yun Family.

370
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,270
In the end,

371
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,270
she’s involved in her father’s case.

372
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,800
You’re quite different to Chu Chu.

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,080
She annoyed me many times,

374
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,630
but you’ve never complained about her.

375
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,870
If someone else annoyed me,

376
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,910
you would have kept punching him

377
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
and never stopped.

378
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,260
I’m not blind.

379
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,600
I see clearly

380
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,560
who annoys you deliberately
and who’s nice to you.

381
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,720
And I see clearly

382
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,870
if you’re really angry

383
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,840
or only complaining.

384
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,630
Apart from anything else,

385
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,110
Miss Chu has been really nice

386
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,600
to you.

387
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,580
Speaking of that,

388
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,970
I don’t even do as well as her.

389
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,250
If I were you,

390
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,730
I wouldn’t want to arrest her, either.

391
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,180
I can’t execute Chu Chu now.

392
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
There’s another reason,

393
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,130
besides what I told Tan Gui.

394
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,370
What is it?

395
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,820
Before I left the capital,

396
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,090
Mother urged me to look out for eunuchs.

397
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
She said Father

398
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,180
would also remind me that.

399
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,820
At first, I thought Mother worried

400
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,010
I might be involved in the conflict
between ministers and eunuchs.

401
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,820
But I found a eunuch’s corpse

402
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,060
in Father’s house.

403
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,370
Xu Rugui confessed that
he worked for Qin Luan.

404
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,250
Mother must have reminded me
for a reason.

405
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,970
And Father’s chess game.

406
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,330
I haven’t figured it out,

407
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,660
but I feel that

408
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,900
there’s something secret

409
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,660
about what Father suffered
in the Southwest,

410
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,060
besides the official records.

411
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,580
So, even if Chu Chu is really
the daughter of a rebel,

412
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,540
I can’t execute her casually.

413
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,970
Brother,

414
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,180
please don’t tell Chu Chu
what happened tonight.

415
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,730
She was quite scared

416
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,700
by what Xu Rugui did.

417
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,660
If she knows someone wants to kill her,

418
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,330
she’ll be freaked out.

419
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,940
You can’t execute her

420
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,420
or you don’t want to?

421
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,580
I believe you won’t act
according to sentiment.

422
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,780
I just don’t want anyone to bully you.

423
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,580
I’m the first-rank Commandery Prince,

424
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,850
taking charge of Three Judicial Offices.

425
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,090
And I’m your younger brother.

426
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,940
Since I was little,

427
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,090
whoever wanted to bully me
was punched by you.

428
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,820
Who dares to bully me?

429
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,540
You’re bullying yourself.

430
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,660
I hear they’re families

431
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,250
of the former manager of Rugui House.

432
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,900
Ask no questions. Just go.

433
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,180
Go.

434
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,410
Be quick.

435
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,940
(Three Judicial Offices)

436
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,210
How long has it been
since you fed them the antidote?

437
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,900
General Wu,

438
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,450
they’re about to wake up.

439
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,300
Where are we?

440
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,090
Don’t be scared, Madam.

441
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,730
You’re in Three Judicial Offices.

442
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,700
You’ll be safe here.

443
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,940
Three Judicial Offices?

444
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,780
What... What happened?

445
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,130
I’ll explain to you later

446
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,250
about the details.

447
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,440
In the eyes of those men
who locked you up,

448
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,460
you’re already dead.

449
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,860
(Guanling Yamen)

450
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,490
General Xiao.

451
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,060
Miss Chu.

452
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,970
General Xiao, may I ask you something?

453
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,580
About Tan Gui?

454
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,700
I told Jinyu already. Don’t worry.

455
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,820
Not about him.

456
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,580
I want to ask something

457
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,820
about His Highness.

458
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,610
He?

459
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,920
He was in a fit of anger yesterday.

460
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,830
He wouldn’t kick you out
of Three Judicial Offices.

461
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,040
When you see him,

462
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,310
say something sweet.

463
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,350
He’ll be nice to you

464
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,560
as usual.

465
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,470
No, General Xiao.

466
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,950
I don’t mean this.

467
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,230
Then what do you want to ask?

468
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,280
I want to ask…

469
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,640
If someone who works for His Highness

470
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,680
committed a crime,

471
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
will His Highness be in trouble?

472
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,880
Of course!

473
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, not of course.

474
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,520
It’s quite complicated.

475
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,760
I’m not sure.

476
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,920
Go ask Jinyu.

477
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,130
If His Highness sees someone

478
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,330
who has a blood feud

479
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,130
with him,

480
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,330
will he be angry and sad?

481
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,090
He will,

482
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,250
when he sees a normal foe.

483
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,580
But this is also very complicated.

484
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,330
I can’t explain clearly.

485
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,210
You’d better ask him.

486
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,880
I understand.

487
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,300
Thank you, General Xiao.

488
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,540
I didn’t say anything wrong, did I?

489
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,370
That’s what Jing Yi says

490
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,460
when he coaxes people.

491
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,210
Thank you.

492
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,300
You’re welcome.

493
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,910
I prepared it when cooking.

494
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,110
You have a stomach problem.

495
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,870
If you don’t have some hangover soup
after you drink,

496
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,990
you’ll have a stomach ache.

497
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,360
It’s...?

498
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,960
It’s a mirror.

499
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,630
One side is convex

500
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,520
and the other side is concave.

501
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
With this mirror,

502
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,640
you don’t need to get in a place

503
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,850
without windows.

504
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,940
I won’t tell anyone about it.

505
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,690
Let’s make a pinky promise.

506
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,150
Your Highness, Miss Chu has come.

507
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
Your Highness.

508
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,200
Chu He’s room is right ahead.

509
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,720
The third room after you turn left.

510
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,270
Your Highness,
I’ve checked on my brother.

511
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,230
Then you can go back home.

512
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,800
I didn’t summon you.

513
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,420
Your Highness,

514
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,460
I come to say thank you
on behalf of my brother.

515
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Thank you for the medicine you gave him.

516
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,730
You can leave, then.

517
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,730
I have something to give you.

518
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,660
Give it to the guard at the door.

519
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,900
No.

520
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,460
I... I must give it to you personally.

521
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,330
I can give it to no one, but you.

522
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,180
I’ll leave after I give it to you.

523
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,610
I won’t come to annoy you again.

524
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,450
Come in, then.

525
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,010
Your Highness.

526
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,640
What is it

527
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
that you must give me personally?

528
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,380
I got it back from the river
this morning.

529
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,780
Got it back?

530
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,700
Who did you go with?

531
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,540
No... no one.

532
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,010
Who did you tell before you went there?

533
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,460
No... no one.

534
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,060
Don’t worry, Your Highness.
I told no one.

535
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,700
I went there alone.

536
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,960
After I got it, I came back.

537
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,780
Ridiculous!

538
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,300
You went there alone,

539
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,460
without telling anyone?

540
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,780
It’s been raining these days.

541
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,250
The water level has been rising.

542
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,540
What if something happened to you?

543
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,180
No one would know where you went.

544
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,610
What could I...

545
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,180
What could we do?

546
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,730
What could your families do?

547
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,210
Don’t you remember how worried they were

548
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,630
when Chu He was missing?

549
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,430
Yesterday, you risked your life
for Chu He.

550
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,060
Today, you risked your life
for such scrap.

551
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,420
You don’t even know
how precious your life is.

552
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,610
How can you be a coroner?

553
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,570
Don’t get angry, Your Highness.
I know I was wrong.

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,000
I was stealthy? Xiao Jinli,

588
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,800
you were peeking

589
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,800

Do you believe it?

594
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,160
I do, General Xiao.

595
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,030
You know what?

596
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,110
This morning,

597
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,080
I was going to search for Xu Rugui.

598
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,840
But I found that

599
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,080
Miss Chu sneaked to Yong’an River.

600
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,840
I lost her near the river.

601
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,760
When I found her again,

602
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I saw her coming out of the river.

603
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,920
Then she came here.

604
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,040
I didn’t know what she was up to

605
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,110
and I was afraid Tan Gui would try
to kill her again.

606
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,040
So, I followed her back.

607
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,830
Why did you follow Chu Chu
in the early morning,

608
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,800
instead of searching for Xu Rugui?

609
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,000
You like her?

610
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,190
Nonsense!

611
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,800
It’s not me who like her!

612
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,200
Come on, Xiao Jinli!

613
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,120
It’s not you?

614
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,960
You mean

615
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,750
you know someone else likes her?

616
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,270
I’m warning you.

617
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,230
Keep your mouth shut
and don’t tell anyone about it!

618
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,800
Do you hear me?

619
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,030
Do you?

620
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Xiao Jinli!

621
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,510
Could you stop pushing others like this?

622
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,030
It’s in broad daylight.

623
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,680
Why did you push me?

624
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
I pushed you, so what?

625
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,230
You!

626
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,520
What’s wrong with that?

627
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
What’s wrong?

628
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,760
Push me, then.

629
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,640
I...

630
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,680
I’m telling you, Xiao Jinli.

631
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,920
I’m warning you!

632
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,190
If you touch me again,

633
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,560
I’ll go tell Leng Yue

634
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,440
and let her skin you!

635
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,510
You’ve got a defender, huh?

636
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,150
I want to see

637
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,270
how she can skin me!

638
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,110
Have something to eat, Your Highness.

639
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,200
Still angry with Chu Chu?

640
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,200
I may hurt her if I’m too serious.

641
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,870
But she won’t keep it in mind
if I’m not serious enough.

642
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,080
I was so anxious

643
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
that I scolded her just now.

644
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,910
But she thought
I didn’t want to see her again!

645
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,200
I was pissed off!

646
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,110
What are you laughing at?

647
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,030
Chu Chu’s always imagining things,

648
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,080
and you care for her too much.

649
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,910
It’s more interesting to look at you
than reading novels.

650
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,660
Here.

651
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,910
Your Highness, I always listen to you.

652
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,480
But this time,

653
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,030
you should listen to me.

654
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,140
Human heart is like the food.

655
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,630
You should have it when it’s warm.

656
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,030
If you don’t eat it, it’ll get cold.

657
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,510
Even if you heat it again,
the taste will change.

658
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
Considering what has happened,

659
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,400
it’s hard for you to accept her now.

660
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,350
But when you make up your mind
to do something,

661
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,500
you will make it.

662
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,840
Think about it.
If her heart for you gets cold,

663
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,270
do you want it?

664
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,680
What about you?

665
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,150
I don’t want it.

666
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,870
To be honest,

667
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,720
you’re a good official

668
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,030
and a good brother.

669
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,560
But to a girl,

670
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,280
you can’t be a good husband.

671
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,750
You keep staying at home,

672
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,030
doing nothing, but work.

673
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,230
When Chu Chu sees a bigger world,

674
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,790
you can hardly attract her.

675
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,230
I’m talking about Jing Yi.

676
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,030
What does it concern Jing Yi?

677
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,230
When you were away from Chang’an,

678
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,800
Jing Yi’s family arranged
blind dates for him

679
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,750
even more than laws
I punished him to copy.

680
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,030
But he rejected without thinking.

681
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,960
Everyone knows that

682
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,200
he has a high demand for girls.

683
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,440
He doesn’t have a high demand.

684
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,110
He has a girl he likes.

685
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,150
Who... Who does he like?

686
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,560
Go ask him.

687
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
He will tell you.

688
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,600
Your Highness, don’t do this to me!

689
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,510
(General)
I’m going to have the porridge.

690
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,270
Please go boil the medicine for me.

691
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,630
We’re going to the mountain
this afternoon.

692
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,960
I must get prepared.

693
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,600
To the mountain?

694
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,690
If Father used the light spots
in the drawing

695
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,990
to indicate his whereabouts,

696
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,860
what were the four chess pieces
used for?

697
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,160
Miss Leng,
why does Deputy Magistrate Tan come?

698
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,270
According to His Highness,

699
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,670
Deputy Magistrate Tan is native

700
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
and he’s familiar with
the Phoenix Mountain.

701
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
He may help us.

702
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,430
I asked General Xiao
to warn His Highness that

703
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
Deputy Magistrate Tan
might be a bad man.

704
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,690
Does His Highness no longer trust me?

705
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,900
No. That was a misunderstanding.

706
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,640
Deputy Magistrate Tan has explained
to His Highness.

707
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,270
Really?

708
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,270
Sure.

709
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,160
That’s great.

710
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,030
Deputy Magistrate Tan
is the best-tempered official.

711
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,520
He’s always nice when talking to people,

712
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,150
even to me.

713
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
I’m so glad that he isn’t a bad man.

714
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,570
But then I wronged him.

715
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,350
Was he rebuked by His Highness?

716
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
Will it do harm to his career?

717
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,710
He’s alright.

718
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,460
When we go back,

719
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,940
I’d better apologize to him.

720
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,130
Is it the map of Phoenix Mountain?

721
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,740
I copied it from Zheng Youde.

722
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,940
(Phoenix Mountain)

723
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,940
Where are we heading for?

724
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,060
(Phoenix Mountain)

725
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,260
He’s in the mountain.

726
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,700
You mean Father is in the mountain?

727
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,050
Father had difficulty moving about.

728
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,020
When he left five years ago,

729
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,570
the bridge available to carriages

730
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,610
wasn’t built yet.

731
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,810
One couldn’t leave Guanling County

732
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,290
unless he used a rope.

733
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,600
Considering Father’s condition,

734
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,400
he couldn’t leave alone.

735
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,610
He left all clues in his house,

736
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,570
indicating where he had gone.

737
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,980
(Phoenix Mountain)
The light spots in the drawing

738
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,090
indicated the southwest
of Phoenix Mountain.

739
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,050
Is there any shelter over there?

740
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,330
There?

741
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,970
There isn’t any shelter.

742
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,940
That’s a marsh land.

743
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,290
There’s a big swamp,

744
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,810
with many vipers and scorpions.
It’s a very dangerous place.

745
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,530
Few people go there.

746
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,730
You mean

747
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,620
Prince Consort went there?

748
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,570
He had difficulty moving about.

749
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,460
That’s a complex area

750
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,140
with no food or fresh water.

751
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,650
If he went there,

752
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,010
I’m afraid he could hardly survive.
