1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,390
Eunuchs were reckless

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,520
and gave deliberate misrepresentations.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,880
They made up the rebellion
of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,070
so that twenty thousand loyal soldiers
were slaughtered.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,600
My father wanted to vindicate them
with his loyal soul.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,840
I’ll certainly accomplish this mission.

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,470
I’m Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,020
Greetings, Duke Chang.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,700
Don’t stand on ceremony, Prefect Li.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,350
You had a long trip.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,950
Has Commandery Prince An
found out anything

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
when he’s in Qianzhou?

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,390
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,430
He found the illegal coins accidentally.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,950
I’ve taken over the case.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,310
I’ll take care of everything.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,430
Be very careful
and don’t give yourself away.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,680
Your Highness, it’s an official document
from Chang’an.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,260
When I came,

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,230
I saw the posthouse official
sorting and registering the documents.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
In case that he was too slow

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,780
and held you up,

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
I urged him to register it

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,680
and I got it to you immediately.

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,940
Thank you, Prefect Li.

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,360
You’re flattering me, Your Highness.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,860
(Han Ji, Minister of Justice)

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,400
Arrest Chu Chu?

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,550
Chu Chu?

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,270
Your Highness,

31
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,720
do you mean Yun Yi’s daughter?

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,230
You also know her?

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,910
Yes.

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,360
In an official order,

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,870
I’m asked to help you
arrest this girl in Qianzhou

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,480
and take her back to Chang’an.

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,910
But...

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,760
She stays with Xiao Jinyu every day.

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,800
I’m afraid...

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,680
What?

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,680
I’m afraid if we suddenly go arrest her

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,760
and have head-on confrontation
with Commandery Prince An,

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,360
it may hinder our big plan.

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,430
Let me think about it.

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,820
Well,

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,490
go to Guanling County with me tomorrow.

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,010
I’ll be at your service.

48
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,820
All right. It’s getting late.

49
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,340
Go back for some rest.

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,570
All right.

51
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,930
I don’t think
Li Zhang can outwit Xiao Jinyu.

52
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,600
I need a backup plan.

53
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,620
=Episode 22=

55
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,300
(Summon Military Commissioner Chen Ying
to Chang’an with his troops.)

56
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,330
It’s the secret imperial decree
Emperor Wenzong issued.

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,540
Summoned by this decree,

58
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
Chen Ying took troops back to Chang’an
to help Emperor Wenzong.

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,420
With this,

60
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,450
can we reverse the case

61
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,260
of Military Commissioner of Jiannan?

62
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,610
It’s Father’s last wish,

63
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,490
and it also concerns Miss Chu’s life.

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,300
Once the truth is revealed,

65
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,300
there’ll be a big dispute in the court.

66
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,930
We must be carefully prepared
before reserving the case.

67
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,210
Like Father said,

68
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,050
if we take one wrong step,

69
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
we’ll implicate more innocent people.

70
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,930
Don’t worry, Chu Chu.

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,650
I will vindicate your parents

72
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,700
and prove your innocence.

73
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,850
Your Highness, I trust you.

74
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,370
I’ll leave my father to you.

75
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,600
I don’t care

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,350
how you report to my father
about what happened today.

77
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,670
But you must send this to him.

78
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,510
Vice Minister Jing,

79
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,670
now that His Highness has known

80
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,270
you and Senior Jing send letters

81
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,320
and our relationship,

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,510
why do you still send letters

83
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,670
through me?

84
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,600
I’m not guarding
against Commandery Prince An.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Who is it?

86
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
The real enemy.

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
You must be very careful.

88
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes.

89
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,790
Vice Minister Jing,

90
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,440
I’ve executed nine subordinates

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,110
of Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

92
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,040
They all claimed they were innocent
before they died.

93
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,790
But I never asked

94
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
what exactly happened that year.

95
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,480
Even if you asked,

96
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
they couldn’t tell you much.

97
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,070
No one knew the secret truth,

98
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,600
but some generals.

99
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,510
The more well-trained the soldiers are,

100
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,230
the more accustomed they’re to orders.

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,720
I guess when General Chen Ying
gave an order,

102
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,870
they followed him immediately.

103
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,240
They didn’t know what exactly happened

104
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,590
even when you executed them.

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,190
When they said they were innocent,

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,520
they were truly innocent.

107
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,520
Vice Minister Jing,

108
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,070
I know I’m not very talented
or virtuous.

109
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,630
I don’t dare to call myself
a good official.

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,870
But I never expected that

111
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,910
I executed some loyal soldiers

112
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,440
by myself.

113
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,910
No matter how I’m punished,

114
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,840
I won’t complain.

115
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,870
All right.

116
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,400
A lot of people owe them.

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,150
Hope we can make it up a bit.

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,720
Go ahead.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,350
Chu Chu, you’re a coroner.

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,520
You got on with him for years

121
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,630
and you just inspected him.

122
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,280
You know

123
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,910
all his wounds,

124
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,910
right?

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
How badly was he wounded?

126
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,870
Why had he never recovered?

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,520
Five years ago,
he was in his early forties.

128
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,400
How did he know he was dying?

129
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,800
Don’t ask, Your Highness.

130
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,110
He didn’t want you to know these.

131
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,640
Chu Chu,

132
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,670
he’s my father.

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,390
Just like how much you want to know

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,390
what happened to your mother
before she died,

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,440
I also want to know

136
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,550
under what circumstance

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,160
did he know he was dying.

138
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,590
In his old notes,

139
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,670
he always said life was precious.

140
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,590
He poured scorn on people

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,680
who killed themselves.

142
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,440
He wouldn’t kill himself,

143
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,710
unless he had to.

144
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
Tell me, please.

145
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,610
There’re many old wounds on his body

146
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,460
that I didn’t know before.

147
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,610
But the wounds were recovered soon.

148
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,930
His broken leg kept torturing him.

149
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,460
His leg was so badly wounded

150
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,210
that even his bones were injured.

151
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,900
You told me that

152
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,810
his leg was badly wounded,

153
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,120
but there was hope to cure it.

154
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,000
It was held up

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,030
and wasn’t cured,

156
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
simply because of delayed treatment.

157
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,120
But it could only stop him from walking.

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,950
Why was he dead?

159
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,270
If he fell and was wounded,

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,710
he wouldn’t die.

161
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,830
But his leg was gashed.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,000
He used to tell people that

163
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,590
he fell off the mountain

164
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
and broke his leg.

165
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,830
He let no one check on it,

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,800
including the physicians,

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,030
and my families.

168
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,080
So,

169
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,150
before I checked his leg today,

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,240
I had thought

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,640
he really fell and broke his leg.

172
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,710
Now I realize

173
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,200
he didn’t want others to know

174
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,700
his leg was gashed,

175
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,050
or someone might track him down.

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,700
So, he tolerated it.

177
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,020
Now that bones are wounded,

178
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,490
what’s the difference
between falling and being gashed?

179
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,730
There’s a difference.

180
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,340
(Intact skin with fracture)
There’s a wound closure for fracture.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,260
But when a man is gashed,

182
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,930
(Open and neat wound)
there’s an open wound on the bone.

183
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,690
(Blade)
An open wound

184
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,310
would easily be infected

185
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,710
and cause disease on bones.

186
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,730
Such a disease can hardly be removed.

187
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Also, Sir Witch Doctor

188
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,610
didn’t allow a doctor to check on him.

189
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,220
He used medicine personally.

190
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,780
As time went by,

191
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,100
the disease got down in bones

192
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,780
and then throughout his body.

193
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,820
(Disease gets into bones
and then the entire body.)

194
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,580
Then he couldn’t be cured.

195
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,730
How...

196
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,490
How did he feel?

197
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,250
I think he felt painful.

198
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,220
But the pain didn’t last.

199
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,730
It happened from time to time.

200
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,540
It repeated unless it was cured.

201
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,490
When there was the pain

202
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,730
on unwounded bones,

203
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,470
he...

204
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,700
He was dying.

205
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,900
He allowed no one to check on his wound

206
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,780
and he told no one about it.

207
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,340
So, all the time,

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
no one knew

209
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,290
what he was suffering.

210
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,990
What are you doing?

211
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,270
General Zhou,

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
you’ve got more fragrance on you.

213
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
You must have visited girls
very frequently.

214
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,950
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,610
I was thinking about taking you with me

216
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,800
when I had fun with girls.

217
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,710
But I realized that
you couldn’t have fun with girls.

218
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,910
All right, I’ll report it to Eunuch Qin.

219
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,760
He couldn’t, either.

220
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,240
Can’t you take a joke?

221
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,760
I’m not joking.

222
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,470
Eunuch Qin asked you

223
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,470
to think about where you got the money

224
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,760
to pay for your happy hours

225
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,470
with girls.

226
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,830
I know.

227
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,510
I went to Pingkang Residence for intel.

228
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,710
That’s where all kinds of men visit.

229
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,950
It’s a perfect place to get intel.

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,710
Men from Three Judicial Offices
go there, too.

231
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
In such a good place,

232
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,590
what intel have you got?

233
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,000
It needs time and luck

234
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,000
to get some intel.

235
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,240
Luck?

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,470
I think it’s your greatest luck

237
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,390
when Eunuch Qin hasn’t killed you yet.

238
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,200
You’d better behave yourself.

239
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,800
Check out what Master asked you to do

240
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,030
and report on your mission soon.

241
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,080
I understand.

242
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,270
Speaking of it,

243
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,830
His Majesty also cares about Duke Chang.

244
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,150
Why doesn’t Eunuch make use of him

245
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
and check the case?

246
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,760
Who to make use of?

247
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,640
His Majesty.

248
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,800
His Majesty?

249
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,590
What’s in your mind? Rubbish?

250
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,020
Did you get your head caught in the door

251
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,350
when you left home this morning?

252
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,000
Why are you so talkative today?

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,240
Just do what you’re asked to.

254
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,320
Tell me.

255
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,830
Is there any news from the Southwest?

256
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,510
Speaking of it,

257
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,570
there’s really something fishy

258
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,880
with Military Commissioner
of Qianzhongdao.

259
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,410
I urged many times,

260
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,790
but there’s no reply yet.

261
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,560
But some of our men
escorted Xue Rucheng to Qianzhou,

262
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,560
didn’t they?

263
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,830
As estimated,

264
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,830
they have arrived in Qianzhou already.

265
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,960
Xue Rucheng?

266
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,000
Xiao Jinyu,

267
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,560
look at you.

268
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,050
You hired a female coroner
and ruined my plan.

269
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,740
Now she’s a rebel’s daughter.

270
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,250
When I catch her,

271
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,300
you’ll leave Qianzhou soon.

272
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,610
Grandfather.

273
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,180
Do you miss your mother?

274
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,720
Yes.

275
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,250
I’m thinking

276
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,180
why my mother liked my father

277
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,370
and married him?

278
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,370
When she married him,

279
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,250
she didn’t expect
what would happen, did she?

280
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
If she knew what would happen,

281
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,570
would she still want to marry him?

282
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,290
Silly girl, what are you imagining?

283
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,670
Your parents were a sweet couple.

284
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,660
After your father’s family was ruined,

285
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,140
she didn’t hate him.

286
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,750
Grandfather, how did you know that?

287
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,690
When your mother died,

288
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,100
she was pregnant for eight months.

289
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,010
With you in her body,

290
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,080
she came all the way to Qianzhou
along mountain roads.

291
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,250
If she hadn’t protected you carefully,

292
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,810
you would have died.

293
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,650
If she hated your father,

294
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,010
before your father’s family was ruined,

295
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,250
she would have had an abortion on you.

296
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,740
She was beautiful and young.

297
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,540
Without the baby,
she would easily marry someone else.

298
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,370
I inspected my mother’s corpse.

299
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,930
Seen from her pelvis,

300
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,340
she didn’t give birth before she had me.

301
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,780
I’m her first child,

302
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,100
and her only child.

303
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,050
She escaped all the way here,
to give birth to me.

304
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,180
Maybe...

305
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,930
Maybe she really loved my father

306
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,690
and tried to keep his last family member

307
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,810
as the only connection with him.

308
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,340
The last family member?

309
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,370
Chu Chu,

310
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,420
did you know anything about your father?

311
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,570
What happened to his family?

312
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,340
Why were you his last family number?

313
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,220
Nothing. I don’t know anything.

314
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,610
I just...

315
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,660
I just guessed.

316
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,910
But I know

317
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,100
my father must be a good man.

318
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,130
It’s getting late.

319
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
I’ll go make lunch.

320
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,330
Wait.

321
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,680
I have something to ask you.

322
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,230
I can tell that

323
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,200
His Highness thinks highly of you.

324
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,010
He wants you to work for him.

325
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,870
But he’s going back to Chang’an.

326
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,720
What’s your plan?

327
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,600
I...

328
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,270
I haven’t made up my mind yet.

329
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
I’m going to make lunch.

330
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,600
All right.

331
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,740
Father left such an important mission.

332
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,030
I’ll accomplish it!

333
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,230
Your Highness, a message from Chang’an.

334
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,180
(Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu,
under the command of His Majesty.)

335
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Go ask General Xiao

336
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,440
to take his soldiers to the Chu Family.

337
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,270
Without my permission,

338
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,600
let no one take anyone of the Chu Family

339
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,560
away from their house!

340
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,270
Yes!

341
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,580
(Guanling Yamen)

342
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
Sir, you had a long trip.

343
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,390
It’s my honor
to fulfill His Majesty’s order.

344
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,200
Where’s General Xiao?

345
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,110
He’s away for some business.

346
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,630
He’ll be back and see you later.

347
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,030
Magistrate Zheng.

348
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Here.

349
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,630
Looks like I’ll stay here for days.

350
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,720
It’s my honor.

351
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
What do you need, My Lord?

352
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,960
Please find me a quiet place

353
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,870
so that His Highness and I
can have a word alone.

354
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,800
All right. I’ll find it immediately.

355
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,600
This way, Sir.

356
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,110
Come.

357
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,860
(Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu,
under the command of His Majesty.)

358
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,500
Sir, congratulations
on becoming Minister of War.

359
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,560
His Majesty showed grace on me.

360
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,910
I don’t know

361
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,180
whether it’s luck or curse.

362
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,420
If I guess correctly,

363
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,420
you sent your brother away
on purpose, right?

364
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,800
Yes.

365
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,270
Sir, I don’t dare to deceive you.

366
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,440
I’ve heard about what happened
in the court.

367
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,150
Now that you’ve known it,

368
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,990
I feel much relieved.

369
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,320
On my way here, I was thinking

370
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,510
how to tell you about this.

371
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,750
When you’ve already heard about it,

372
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,440
I’ll get to the point.

373
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,750
Jinli can’t marry Leng Yue.

374
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,680
You don’t agree on this marriage?

375
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
His Majesty wants them to get married,

376
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,270
not simply because he wants them

377
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,510
to be a good couple.

378
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,270
Have Jinli and Leng Yue known it?

379
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,150
I haven’t told them yet.

380
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,360
I know it’s hard for you.

381
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,270
Leng Yue’s adored you
since she was little.

382
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,440
It’s quite difficult for you

383
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
to tell her about that.

384
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,510
No, no.

385
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,150
You get it wrong, Sir.

386
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,680
Leng Yue and I are only cousins.

387
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,270
We don’t love each other.

388
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,200
I haven’t told them about it,

389
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,750
because it was quite unexpected.

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,840
I doubt there’s another reason for it.

391
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,840
Now that you suspect,

392
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,480
you must have guessed about it.

393
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,150
I guess that

394
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,870
His Majesty wants them to get married

395
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
to restrain the military power

396
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,720
of the Leng Family.

397
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,510
Sir,

398
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,320
they have garrisoned the Southwest
for so many years.

399
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,900
I’ve never heard about their disloyalty.

400
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,580
Why does His Majesty suddenly
want to restrain them?

401
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,970
Sir?

402
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,730
I don’t know the details, either.

403
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,300
Senior Jing suggested His Majesty

404
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,730
to marry Leng Yue to Jinli

405
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,820
so that Jinli could get back
Leng Peishan’s military power.

406
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,370
But the Leng Family has settled
in the Southwest for generations

407
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,090
and has been leading the troops.

408
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,760
As the head of the Leng Family,

409
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,460
Leng Peishan wouldn’t easily
give up his military power.

410
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,580
As far as I see,

411
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,540
you’d better go back to Chang’an quickly

412
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,130
so that you can discuss with your mother

413
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,700
on how to reject the marriage.

414
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,250
There’s another thing.

415
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,060
That’s why

416
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,700
I came all the way to see you

417
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,970
before His Majesty orders them
to get married.

418
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,090
What’s it, Sir?

419
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,460
Tell me the truth.

420
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,420
When you checked on Feng Jie’s case,

421
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,990
what did you exactly get?

422
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,950
Sir, why do you suddenly ask?

423
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,700
I didn’t know it
until I took over the Ministry of War.

424
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,970
Feng Jie made a summary
when patrolling in the Southwest,

425
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,900
but it was missing
when he went back to Chang’an.

426
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,690
No one knew what was recorded in it.

427
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,420
If Feng Jie was murdered,

428
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,950
the summary must be very important.

429
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,460
Now that you asked about Feng Jie,

430
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,270
you must have had a general conjecture

431
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,490
about what he recorded.

432
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,780
I came all the way along the route

433
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,610
Feng Jie patrolled

434
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,780
and got nothing useful.

435
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,250
If I keep moving forward,

436
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,210
I’ll be reaching the military town
where Leng Peishan is stationed.

437
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,320
I stayed with my brother these days,

438
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,150
but he didn’t tell me

439
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,600
there was anything wrong in the army.

440
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,360
Jinyu.

441
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,390
Sir, do you even suspect my brother?

442
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,200
I watched Jinli grow up.

443
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,780
I know what a person he is.

444
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,840
He’s very upright,

445
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,550
but not meticulous.

446
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,480
If someone makes use of him,

447
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,510
he may not know.

448
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,610
Well,

449
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,750
I’m just guessing.

450
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,720
Hope I’m having groundless worry.

451
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,680
There seems to be trouble in Qianzhou.

452
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,480
In case Princess Xiping worries,

453
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,560
you’d better go back to Chang’an early.

454
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,930
(Jiangshan Hall)

455
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,740
Your Majesty, I’d like to check the case
in Qianzhou.

456
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,530
Your Majesty,

457
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,590
it’s a long trip to Qianzhou.

458
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,580
If we send men there,

459
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,500
it’ll take a lot of days
before they arrive.

460
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,010
Also, no one in the Ministry of Revenue
or the other three ministries

461
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,080
knows much about what happened
in Qianzhou.

462
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,380
It’s not a good plan to send them.

463
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,220
What do you think, Jing?

464
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,600
I remember

465
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,220
Commandery Prince An is in Qianzhou now.

466
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,530
The illegal coin case is serious.

467
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,340
Our enemies may be alerted
if we take any careless action.

468
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,730
The wisest way is to let His Highness
check the case,

469
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,200
according to circumstances.

470
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,320
Senior Jing made sense.

471
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,070
I agree with him, too.

472
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,630
You interrupted me,

473
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,390
so that I totally forgot

474
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,230
Commandery Prince An was in Qianzhou.

475
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,390
Fine, then.

476
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,680
Ask Hanlin Academy to draft the decree

477
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,080
that Commandery Prince An
shall investigate the case,

478
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,030
without fail.

479
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,720
Who’s that?

481
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,680
Who dares to make trouble in my place?

482
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,090
Xiao Jinli?

483
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,390
What are you coming for?

484
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,230
I don’t know.

485
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,440
You don’t know?

486
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,630
You don’t know why you come?

487
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,680
It’s hard to explain.

488
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,230
Why do you always say that?

489
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,990
What can your tongue be used for?

490
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,990
Can’t you say something sweet?

491
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,030
You can do nothing, but eat.

492
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,480
Look at your fat waist.

493
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,230
Give it to me!

494
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,510
Well done, Xiao Jinyu.

495
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,030
You even dare to grab my food?

496
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,150
I haven’t dealt with you

497
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,150
for how you bullied Jing Yi last time.

498
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,600
What does it concern you
when I bullied Jing Yi?

499
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,320
Give it to me!

500
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,630
What’s going on?

501
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,750
It’s General Xiao.

502
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,250
Give it to me!

503
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,560
He and Miss Leng are fighting

504
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,390
for a drumstick.

505
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Why? There’re more drumsticks.

506
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,420
Keep eating.

507
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,780
I’ll see if anyone marries you!

508
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,090
None of your business!

509
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,730
Why are you fighting for a drumstick?

510
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,780
He asked for that!

511
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,490
Jing Yi, let me ask you.

512
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,900
Isn’t she fatter than what she was
two years ago?

513
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,300
Stop, Xiao Jinli.

514
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,110
Trust me.

515
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,840
You’re really asking for that.

516
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,360
Anyway, is the Chu Family defended?

517
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Come on. What exactly do you want?

518
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,030
(Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu,
under the command of His Majesty.)

519
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,910
Wu Jiang wrote it.

520
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,720
All right, you’re not fat.

521
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,990
Don’t interrupt.

522
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,510
What exactly happened?

523
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu,
under the command of His Majesty.

524
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,510
What?

525
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,630
Sir, do you come here personally

526
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,750
with another mission?

527
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,390
I didn’t know

528
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,460
Three Judicial Offices could get intel

529
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,680
as fast as the Jing Family.

530
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,030
Sir,

531
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
I heard that

532
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,380
ten men from Imperial Armies

533
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,770
came to Qianzhou with you.

534
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,050
I asked about them when I came,

535
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,460
but I was told that they didn’t
come here.

536
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,010
I also heard that

537
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,740
Prefect Li Zhang of Qianzhou

538
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,620
also came here with you.

539
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,860
When you’re talking to me,

540
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,170
he’s on his way to arrest Chu Chu
with the Imperial Armies, right?

541
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,620
Jinyu, I’m sure you knew that.

542
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,490
The female coroner you hired

543
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,880
is a rebel’s daughter.

544
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,640
Prefect Li and I didn’t mean
to catch her

545
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,930
without letting you know.

546
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,940
We simply wanted to keep your safe.

547
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,240
There’s a lot of criticism about you.

548
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,810
But after all, you were deceived.

549
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,860
I don’t think
His Majesty will blame you for that.

550
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,770
Sir, Chu Chu isn’t a rebel’s daughter.

551
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,310
She isn’t?

552
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,610
But Han Ji was very sure

553
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,810
when he told His Majesty about it.

554
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,710
Sir, I have irrefutable evidence.

555
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,410
Stop!

556
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,720
Isn’t that Li Zhang?

557
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,930
Why is he coming?

558
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,500
Why do they stop me, General Xiao?

559
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,770
We have some dealings

560
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,890
in business.

561
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,700
What?

562
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,050
Your subordinates
can’t even recognize me?

563
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,050
At the behest of His Majesty,

564
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,220
I come to arrest the rebel’s daughter!

565
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,050
Whoever is irrelevant should leave!

566
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,860
Vice Minister Jing, Miss Leng,

567
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,540
I’ve got urgent business to do.

568
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
I can’t play the game with you

569
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,100
that you pretend to be
Commandery Prince An.

570
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,770
The rebel’s daughter?

571
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,700
Prefect Li, you must make it clear.

572
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,340
Who’s the rebel’s daughter?

573
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,740
She is.

574
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,260
She’s the rebel Yun Yi’s daughter.

575
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,860
Miss, surrender yourself

576
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,050
in case of being tortured!

577
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,930
What nonsense are you talking about?

578
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,530
She’s my granddaughter!

579
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,050
What Yun Yi? What rebel?

580
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,740
You’re in the wrong place!

581
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,010
Sir, if you keep fighting,

582
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,930
you’ll be sorry.

583
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,170
Take her down!

584
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,770
-Be careful!
-Father!

585
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,220
Stop!

586
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,770
Chu Chu!

587
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,410
-Go away!
-Father!

588
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,500
Father!

589
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,590
Chu Chu!

590
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,550
Father!

591
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,260
Let go of me!

592
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,370
Chu Chu!

593
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,740
How dare you wound me!

594
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,860
Sorry, Lord Li, that was an accident.

595
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,620
You!

596
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,500
Stop!

597
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,130
Minister Xue!

598
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,980
Minister Xue, Your Highness!

599
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,340
Your Highness.

600
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,860
Chu Chu, are you alright?

601
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,580
Prefect Li, why were you fighting

602
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,130
against Vice Minister Jing
and General Xiao?

603
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,930
Minister Xue, I was trying
to arrest the rebel’s daughter,

604
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,740
but they wounded me!

605
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,410
Look.

606
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,340
Minister Xue, it wasn’t our fault.

607
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,630
Prefect Li came here,

608
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,870
with these unidentified men

609
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,320
and he had no certificate at all.

610
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,270
But we’re guarding this place,

611
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,480
under the command of His Highness.

612
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,110
We wouldn’t let them break in.

613
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,080
You!

614
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,480
Why does Prefect Li have

615
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,560
so many tiny scars on his hand?

616
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,840
Minister Xue!

617
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,510
It’s some misunderstanding.

618
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,750
Prefect Li, thank you for coming.

619
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,630
Now that His Highness has come,

620
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,150
we’ll take care of the thing

621
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,230
about the rebel’s daughter.

622
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
Why don’t you go back
and take care of your wound?

623
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,560
Fine, then.

624
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,800
Minister Xue, Your Highness,

625
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,200
see you.

626
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,110
Go!

627
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,230
Leng Yue, Jing Yi,

628
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,390
guard here.

629
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,360
Yes.

630
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,110
Sir, come, please.

631
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,230
Grandfather.

632
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,920
We’re alright.

633
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,470
Don’t worry.

634
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,710
This is Prince Consort?

635
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,430
Yes.

636
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,840
It’s a petition Father left
before he died.

637
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,270
It was decoded
with reverse phonetic notation

638
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,600
according to two poems on the casket.

639
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,840
It revealed the truth of the rebellion

640
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
of Military Commissioner Chen Ying.

641
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,920
When did he die?

642
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,360
Five years ago.

643
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,230
Sir.

644
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,030
Come on.

645
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,710
This is a very serious case

646
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
where a lot of people are involved.

647
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,400
Once other officials know it,

648
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,320
I’m afraid there’ll be another conflict
between ministers and eunuchs.

649
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,800
We must have a prefect plan

650
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,560
and we mustn’t act rashly.

651
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,560
I understand.

652
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,270
Why do you keep his corpse here?

653
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
As you said,

654
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,710
this is a serious case.

655
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,400
I don’t trust anyone else.

656
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,190
Father was close to the Chu Family

657
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,600
before he died.

658
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,550
The Chu Family are upright and kind,

659
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,120
and they all work as coroners.

660
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,120
They know how to preserve corpses.

661
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,990
So, I keep my father’s corpse here.

662
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,230
Sir,

663
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,710
what do you think we should do?

664
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,210
Go back to Chang’an with me immediately

665
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,950
and report to His Majesty.

666
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,360
When the truth is revealed in the court,

667
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,230
Chu Chu can be exonerated

668
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,190
from being a rebel’s daughter.

669
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,950
Sir,

670
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,120
I’m afraid
we can’t go back to Chang’an now.

671
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,120
You asked to come to Qianzhou,

672
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,960
looking for Prince Consort.

673
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,520
Now that you found him,

674
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,250
why do you still want to stay?

675
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,230
A relevant criminal is fleeing
in Qianzhou.

676
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,900
I must hunt him down

677
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,320
and make him a witness for this case.

678
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,070
Who do you mean?

679
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,950
Xu Rugui.

680
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,910
The criminal

681
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,950
who is wanted across the nation?

682
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,140
Do you know where he is?

683
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,510
Kind of.

684
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,430
As Jinyu asked,

685
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
I’ve sent some soldiers

686
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,360
to guard all entrances and exits
to Guanling County

687
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,640
and sent other soldiers
to search Phoenix Mountain secretly,

688
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,460
disguised as local people.

689
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,200
We haven’t found him yet,

690
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,080
but we found some traces.

691
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,030
Phoenix Mountain?

692
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,650
It’s a mountain within Guanling County.

693
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,990
Tomorrow morning,

694
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,840
I’ll go up the mountain with my brother
and search for him together.

695
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,600
All right.

696
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,270
You must be very careful.

697
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,600
Yes.

698
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,360
Jinli,

699
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,750
I have something
to ask Commandery Prince An.

700
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,690
Tell me the truth.

701
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,540
