1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,470
I’m Chu Chu.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,470
I came to Chang’an to become a coroner,

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,520
who can work for the Handsome Judge,
Chief of Six Gates.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,710
(Court of Judicial Review)
Kind Lord Jing helped me to take part

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,760
in the Coroner Qualification Test.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,120
(Two Merits Hall)
But I mistook Commandery Prince An

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,470
as the testing body
who takes care of all criminal cases.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,000
(Three Judicial Offices)

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,550
His Highness is smart and kind.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,790
I think he’s Handsome Judge
that I’m looking for.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,110
But...

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,720
He looks very curious about my pendant.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,470
Greetings, Your Highness,
Vice Minister Jing.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,880
You may rise.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,970
Miss,

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,740
you must be the coroner
Commandery Prince An picked

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,340
in today’s selection test.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,000
Congratulations.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,270
No. No. The result hasn’t come out yet.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,520
I just...

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,320
General Zhou,

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,430
did His Majesty send you here
for any mission?

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,240
Here’s the thing.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
(Three Judicial Offices)
When I was patrolling in the Palace,

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,310
I picked up a bunch of keys.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,200
I guess some official lost them

28
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,310
when he left the Palace.

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,560
I’m then asking in all departments.

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,030
General Zhou,
where did you find the keys?

31
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,800
In the corridor outside Xuanzheng Hall.

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,670
Don’t bother, then.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Even if you visit

34
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,200
all departments in Chang’an,

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,030
no one will claim them.

36
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,800
What do you mean, Vice Minister Jing?

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,550
In the way

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,800
you’re looking for the owner,

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,630
soon all officials will know that

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,800
someone lost a bunch of keys.

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
It’s no problem if they’re normal keys.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,830
If they’re keys

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,360
to archives, storerooms or cells,

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,590
the owner will be in big trouble.

45
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,400
If I lost the keys,

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,270
I would never admit that.

47
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,800
You’re right.

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,390
Thank you for your instruction.

49
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,280
I’ll leave you alone.

50
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,800
(Three Judicial Offices)

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,070
Qin Luan’s Imperial Armies go
where they heard of anything,

52
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,030
just like dogs.

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,350
Don’t they fear to be battered?

54
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:08,980
Your Highness,

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,900
may I

56
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,060
have my pendant back?

57
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,220
Now that it matters so much to you,

58
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,010
keep it carefully.

59
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,810
Don’t leave it to others again.

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,530
I see.

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,170
(Princess Xiping, Emperor Wenzong’s daughter)
Heng, are you still alive?

62
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,530
Do you know I’m still waiting for you?

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,980
=The Imperial Coroner=

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,060
=Episode 2=

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,650
Come and have a look!

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,170
He’s perspicacious.

67
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,090
He punishes evil-doers.

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,810
He really looks like the Handsome Judge.

69
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,500
Are you still inspecting me?

70
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,500
By the way,

71
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,340
it’s the ointment to remove blood clots.

72
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,700
My grandfather made it.

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,700
It’s very effective.

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,260
Apply it.

75
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,420
Thank you.

76
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,450
Don’t bother.

77
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,060
I know

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,090
you think coroners bring bad luck.

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,180
But this is new.

80
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,260
I haven’t used it before.

81
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,100
It’s not dirty.

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,600
What? Regret so soon?

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,880
No, no.

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,600
You don’t think
what I touched is filthy?

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,470
You also touched me, didn’t you?

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,510
Angelica and peony
for improving blood circulation.

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,870
Ligusticum and cattail
for removing blood clots.

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,990
Boswellia for pain relief
and peach kernel for dissolving lumps.

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,870
They work for my symptoms.

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,830
You can even recognize it?

91
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,920
I know a little.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Is there anything you don’t know?

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,720
Who gave you the pendant

94
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,550
you left in the inn?

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Why did he ask about my pendant?

96
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,270
I can’t tell anyone else.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
You can’t tell me

98
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
or you don’t want to tell me?

99
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,850
Come and have a look!

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,390
Baked cake.

101
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,790
Hot baked cake!

102
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,110
Hot baked cake!

103
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
Baked cake!

104
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,640
Stop.

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,160
Jing Yi,

106
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,860
go buy a piece of baked cake.

107
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,440
Come and have a look!

108
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,160
Don’t bother.

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,650
I...

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,830
I’m not hungry. Don’t buy it.

111
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,580
Hot baked cake.

112
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
I’m hungry.

113
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,360
Xiao Jinyu is heading for Yan’s Mansion?

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes.

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,430
Besides Jing Yi,

116
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,870
he also took a female coroner

117
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,270
who took part in the test.

118
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,550
Female coroner?

119
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,880
A girl even wants to be a coroner?

120
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,470
I asked about her.

121
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,590
When she first came to the capital,

122
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,960
she met Jing Yi privately.

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
She also took part in the test,

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
for Jing Yi’s sake.

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,750
A female coroner?

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,310
Make an issue of female...

127
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,720
Sounds like what the Jing Family do.

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,470
Not only Jing Yi works for Xiao Jinyu,

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,120
but also a female coroner.

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Jing Zhi thinks so highly of Xiao Jinyu.

131
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,030
Jing Yi is smart,

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,990
but he’s a playboy
who enjoys wealth and honor.

133
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
In case of corpses,

134
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,920
he can’t help feeling terrified.

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,180
It makes sense

136
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,650
when Jing Zhi plants a female coroner

137
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,050
to spy on Xiao Jinyu.

138
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,580
I failed to figure out who she is.

139
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,050
But I find something fishy.

140
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,380
What is it?

141
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,540
When I saw Xiao Jinyu today,

142
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,450
he was holding a stone pendant.

143
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,820
As soon as he saw me,

144
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,620
he hid it right away.

145
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,730
When he stared at the pendant,

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,220
I felt that

147
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,220
he cared a lot about it.

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,570
The female coroner said

149
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,890
it was her pendant.

150
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,730
Stone pendant?

151
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,130
What does it look like?

152
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220
It’s flat,

153
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,940
with carved patterns.

154
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,970
Looks like one of two halves.

155
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,170
It has...

156
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,690
A blue tassel.

157
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,620
Eunuch Qin, you know that?

158
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,350
Did you see it clearly?

159
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,040
I’m sure I did.

160
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,480
Looks like the blue tassel isn’t

161
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,760
from any ordinary family.

162
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
I looked at it a few more times

163
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,350
and I was quite impressive.

164
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Why does a female coroner
have the love token

165
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,880
of Princess Xiping and Xiao Heng?

166
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,600
Don’t worry.

167
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,790
I’ll take her back.

168
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,270
Go. Go ahead.

169
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,070
Is Xiao Heng...?

170
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,070
I must send someone to get some intel
from Princess Xiping.

171
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,790
According to the first witness,

172
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,510
when he arrived here,

173
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,070
he found the dead man.

174
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,000
Did the witness move anything

175
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,760
in this place?

176
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,670
He claimed he didn’t.

177
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Come on, Your Highness.

178
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
What do you mean claim?

179
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,520
I didn’t!

180
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
Lord Jing, you found the dead man?

181
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,670
Yes.

182
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,190
Lord Jing, how did you find him?

183
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,840
I heard the scream.

184
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,310
That night, Yan Ming held a banquet
in the foreyard,

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,310
to show off his valuable calligraphy.

186
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,800
Unexpectedly, he didn’t come back
after a long while.

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,190
Later, his scream came

188
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,280
from the study.

189
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,350
Then came the scream of a dancing girl.

190
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,150
I rushed here immediately.

191
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,400
As soon as the dancing girl
pushed the door open,

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,350
she saw what happened in the study

193
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,150
and slumped on the ground out of fear.

194
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,910
Before she recovered from the shock,

195
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Jing Yi arrived.

196
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,800
So, he was the first
to get into the study

197
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,470
and checked on Yan Ming.

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,680
Didn’t the dancing girl or Lord Jing

199
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,000
see the murderer?

200
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,400
Not to mention the murderer,

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
there wasn’t even a suspect.

202
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Look, here’s much blood.

203
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
There must have been blood
on the murderer.

204
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,220
I asked to seal the mansion
for a thorough search immediately.

205
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,830
No one was missing.
No extra men were here, either.

206
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,030
But we found no one

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,470
who had blood on him.

208
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
Wasn’t it strange?

209
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,710
The bloodstain looks smooth.

210
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,860
I think Yan Ming took the box out

211
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,470
and put it here.

212
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,150
When he was dead,

213
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,150
the calligraphy wasn’t in the box.

214
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,760
Did he take it out

215
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,240
and show it to the murderer?

216
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,320
Where’s the calligraphy now?

217
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,640
Now that

218
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,390
Yan Ming showed it to the murderer

219
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,760
and it’s missing now,

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,350
it means the murderer
wanted the calligraphy,

221
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,070
killed Yan Ming

222
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,830
and ran away with it?

223
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,320
I don’t think the murderer
wanted the calligraphy.

224
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,590
How do you know he hid it

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,830
in this place?

226
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,800
When something is hidden
among similar things,

227
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,470
people can’t easily see it.

228
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,150
Now that the murderer
didn’t want the calligraphy,

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
the stain on it didn’t matter.
Why did he hide it?

230
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,350
If he hadn’t hidden it,

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,470
would you think

232
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,150
he was a thief who killed Yan Ming

233
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,910
so as to get the calligraphy?

234
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
I heard that the calligraphy was missing

235
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,440
after Yan Ming was killed.

236
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,120
Did Commandery Prince An find any clue?

237
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,350
He hasn’t told me about it.

238
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,880
Yan Ming was killed
because of the calligraphy.

239
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,470
It’s not appropriate to say this,

240
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,350
but what a pity
when the calligraphy is missing!

241
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,560
In my humble opinion,

242
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Yan Ming may not be killed

243
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,950
because of the calligraphy.

244
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,270
Then why was he killed?

245
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,150
If the murderer only wanted
to steal the calligraphy,

246
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,830
he didn’t have to kill Yan Ming.

247
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,950
It makes sense.

248
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,710
You checked the crime scene.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
What else did you see from the corpse?

250
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
You can tell me now, can’t you?

251
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,380
I want a try.

252
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,270
How?

253
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,830
Could you pretend to be the murderer?

254
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,410
How?

255
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Just show me

256
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
how you think
the murderer killed Yan Ming.

257
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,440
I’ll show you

258
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
how I think Yan Ming died.

259
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,120
All right.

260
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,120
What’s in your hand?

261
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,950
The weapon.

262
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,470
It’s a meter long
and as thick as wheat straw.

263
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,240
Anything wrong?

264
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,350
Someone’s dead!

265
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,200
Help!

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
What are you doing?

267
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,910
I’m pretending to be Yan Ming.

268
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,440
I’m showing you the calligraphy,

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,450
but you hold a weapon.

270
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,710
I’ll certainly yell for help.

271
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,120
You’re right.

272
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,630
I wasn’t thinking
in the murderer’s position.

273
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,680
Let’s try again.

274
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,880
Look.

275
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,310
Something’s wrong.

276
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,390
It doesn’t make sense.

277
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,080
There’s really a hole.

278
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,760
That’s how he protected himself
from Yan Ming’s blood.

279
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,640
In this way,

280
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,640
people without the bloodstain
are also suspectable.

281
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
You said something wrong. What’s that?

282
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,440
I mean

283
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,710
there’s no trace of bumping

284
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,680
on Yan Ming’s back.

285
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,590
He shouldn’t have fallen down like this.

286
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,390
But according to the bloodstain,

287
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,510
he did.

288
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,680
Then the murderer held him
before he bumped into the desk,

289
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,270
like you just did.

290
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,910
The murderer killed him.

291
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,910
Would he even worry
if he would be wounded?

292
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,320
Then why did you hold me?

293
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,440
You’re the murderer.

294
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,680
Miss Chu,

295
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,760
if you wanted to be serious,

296
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,680
you didn’t scream

297
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,740
like Yan Ming did.

298
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,480
I don’t know what you heard.

299
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,170
But Yan Ming didn’t scream

300
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,780
before he died.

301
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,260
Why?

302
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,770
Judged from the blood on the ground,

303
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,750
the upper part of his heart was stabbed.

304
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,700
It’s the connection part
between heart and blood vessels.

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,950
When it was stabbed immediately,

306
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,150
Yan Ming would be out of breath

307
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,300
because of the huge blood loss.

308
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,260
He couldn’t scream at all.

309
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,220
Jing Yi, are you sure

310
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,300
you heard Yan Ming’s scream?

311
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
The murderer screamed?

312
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,700
If so,

313
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,850
the murderer would stop Yan Ming
from bumping into the desk.

314
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,020
Why?

315
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,900
In case he made a noise

316
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,930
and others would notice.

317
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,180
Would you like to try again with me?

318
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,980
Yes.

319
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,740
To fool others,

320
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,860
the murderer faked the crime scene.

321
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,100
Someone’s dead!

322
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,980
What are you doing?

323
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,570
You’re the murderer and Yan Ming,
aren’t you?

324
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,540
There should be a dancing girl.

325
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,420
I would pretend to be her.

326
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,810
It was what happened that night.

327
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,660
Now that you pretend
to be the dancing girl,

328
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,170
don’t you realize
something wrong with her?

329
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,900
What’s wrong with her?

330
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,570
It took her a while to find Yan Ming

331
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,780
after she came.

332
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,810
The was a short interval
between the two screams.

333
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,930
When the murderer screamed,

334
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,490
the dancing girl must have been
in the yard.

335
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,300
No matter how fast the murderer left,

336
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,570
she must have seen him.

337
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,530
But why did she stay and do so much,

338
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,160
instead of leaving immediately?

339
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,780
Yeah.

340
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,370
(Jiangshan Hall)

341
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,400
Your Majesty, I wonder
if I should say something

342
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,340
about Yan Ming’s case.

343
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,220
Go ahead.

344
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,300
Yan Ming is a vice six-rank official,

345
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,220
but he’s at least a minister.

346
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,810
His case has been suspended
for half a month.

347
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,250
After you gave a time limit,

348
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,360
Commandery Prince An
used Yan Ming’s corpse

349
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
for the Coroner Test,

350
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
instead of solving the case quickly.

351
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,920
He’s absolutely disrespecting you.

352
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
He’s so careless and arrogant!

353
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,690
No wonder other officials impeach him.

354
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,780
I shouldn’t have spoilt him.

355
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,340
If he doesn’t find out the murderer
before sunset,

356
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,450
I’ll dismiss him from office!

357
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,300
Did you search
the dancing girl’s body immediately?

358
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,180
I did.

359
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,800
But that wasn’t very necessary.

360
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,130
She wore such a thin dancing dress.

361
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,490
How could she hide
a one-meter-long weapon?

362
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,980
So, she left the weapon here.

363
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,810
It’s the weapon.

364
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,550
He can even find this?

365
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,660
I think the dancing girl learned
from some ventriloquists

366
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
in the Dancing Service.

367
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,480
It’s hard to imitate a man’s voice,

368
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,610
but it wasn’t very hard to scream only.

369
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,060
She didn’t hold the weapon
or had the blood on her.

370
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,490
She could have left directly.

371
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,170
Why did she scream twice?

372
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,810
According to her confession,

373
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,540
she wanted to steal something
in the yard

374
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,220
on her way to the latrine.

375
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,340
As checked,

376
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,010
she greeted other dancing girls
who came with her

377
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,740
before she left.

378
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,010
She also met a maid and asked the way.

379
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,480
But she couldn’t be vindicated

380
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,300
with such simple evidence.

381
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,490
She couldn’t assure her safety

382
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,540
unless she made herself the witness.

383
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,730
A girl tricked me?

384
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,530
Wait. What did she steal?

385
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,800
Go catch her in the Dancing Service

386
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,280
and ask her.

387
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,050
She must have run away
after she stole the thing.

388
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
You’d better issue a warrant.

389
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,370
What if she’s still there?

390
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,660
Why did Lord Jing leave
through the window?

391
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,250
That’s his bad habit.

392
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,690
You’re awesome, Your Highness.

393
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,610
You’re even smarter
than the Handsome Judge.

394
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,700
Your Highness,

395
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,540
may I still work for you?

396
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,020
You must answer all my questions, then.

397
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,740
All right.

398
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,860
Tell me about your pendant.

399
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,900
Pendant?

400
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,930
Are you...

401
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,740
Are you really not the Handsome Judge?

402
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,740
I’m not.

403
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,050
What does he have to do

404
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,010
with the pendant?

405
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
I can’t tell you

406
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,780
unless you’re the Handsome Judge.

407
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,180
Yan Ming’s case isn’t closed yet.

408
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,300
I need you to give evidence
in the court.

409
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,210
You can’t leave Chang’an before that.

410
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,970
And you must come
whenever you’re needed.

411
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,980
Your Highness.

412
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,690
Miss Chu,

413
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,130
is this yours?

414
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,730
I don’t even know where I lost it.

415
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,850
Where did you find it?

416
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,210
You silly girl,

417
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,060
you don’t even know
your package was stolen.

418
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,730
Stolen?

419
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,780
Who stole it?

420
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,780
Just now.

421
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,030
The waiter who asked for the bill.

422
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,330
But he doesn’t look like a thief.

423
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,130
Didn’t you realize

424
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,130
your package smelled like that waiter?

425
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,690
What smell?

426
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,370
The smell of honey locust
and atractylodes

427
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,780
that coroners have.

428
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,180
He’s a waiter in an inn.

429
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,540
He doesn’t use that.

430
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,420
You keep holding the package
in your arms.

431
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,060
It must be very important to you.

432
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,490
When you checked in,

433
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,490
you wouldn’t give it to the waiter.

434
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,880
So, it’s very likely that

435
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,580
he searched your package secretly.

436
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,460
You really know everything.

437
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,700
Wait.

438
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,580
This isn’t my purse.

439
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,090
No. I mean this is my purse.

440
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,420
But the coins are not.

441
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,700
They’re yours, too.

442
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,780
It’s your pay.

443
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,780
Keep them carefully.

444
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,970
So many coins for such a short time?

445
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,420
Isn’t it great to work for you?

446
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,580
What?

447
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,700
Your Highness, please give these coins
back to Lord Jing.

448
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:49,490
All right.

449
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,300
Send some men to follow her.

450
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,370
Check where she goes

451
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,330
and who she meets.

452
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,370
Yes.

453
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,660
Also,

454
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,580
exchange her own coins.

455
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,330
Amazing whip, Your Grace!

456
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,250
What are you scared of?

457
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,210
You don’t deserve
to be killed by my whip.

458
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,940
I don’t. I don’t!

459
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,180
What are you coming for?

460
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,730
For your information, Your Grace,

461
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,460
these are grapes,

462
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,540
from the Western Regions.

463
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,520
My master asked me to bring them...

464
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,130
Get out!

465
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,370
Your Grace,

466
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,220
my master truly cares for you.

467
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,970
Get out!

468
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,900
Go, go, go.

469
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,900
Go back and tell Qin Luan.

470
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,490
Don’t think I don’t know

471
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,460
he always complains to His Majesty.

472
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,540
How dared he slander
Commandery Prince An!

473
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,660
What does he think he is!

474
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,250
Get out with your grapes!

475
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,090
Yes. Yes, Your Grace.

476
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,060
Get out!

477
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,050
Let’s go. Go.

478
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,060
Be quick!

479
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,210
Leave us.

480
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,420
What happened?

481
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,300
Didn’t I ask you to get some intel
from Princess Xiping?

482
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,250
Look what a mess you’re in!

483
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,660
I got nothing, Master.

484
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,120
Princess Xiping has such a big temper.

485
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,160
Before I finished,

486
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,970
she lashed me!

487
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,810
Master, it doesn’t matter
when I’m aggrieved.

488
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,480
But Master, I work for you.

489
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,500
When she lashed my hips,
she was exactly slapping your face!

490
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,410
What did you say?

491
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,690
Don’t get angry, Master.
I don’t mean that.

492
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,100
What a loser!

493
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,280
Master, you asked me
to ask about the female coroner.

494
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,730
Do you suspect

495
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,770
she has something to do

496
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,290
with Prince Consort Xiao Heng?

497
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,410
Does she have something to do
with Xiao Heng

498
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,130
or does someone else want Xiao Jinyu

499
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,740
to think so?

500
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,330
Anyway,

501
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,080
someone must have seen Xiao Heng

502
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,410
and known where he is.

503
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,810
As long as we know
who the female coroner is,

504
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,620
all problem will be solved.

505
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,450
Master, you care about the pendant.

506
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,980
Does it have a special meaning?

507
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,660
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

508
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,620
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)
Your Grace, it takes trouble to blend.

509
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,690
Have some rest.

510
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,830
When did I ever do such a thing?

511
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,830
If my husband comes back someday,

512
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,640
he’ll laugh at me

513
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,190
when he sees me.

514
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,010
Your Grace.

515
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,490
You all want me to believe that

516
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,460
he’s dead.

517
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,090
But in his grave,

518
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,010
there’s nothing but a set of clothes.

519
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,210
I won’t believe he’s dead

520
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,620
until I see his body.

521
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,010
Your Grace, I also wish him
to come back.

522
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,130
But it’s been so many years.

523
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,810
If he were still alive,

524
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,530
why didn’t he come to see you,

525
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,330
considering your deep love?

526
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,900
Stop. I don’t want to listen.

527
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,450
Don’t let my children

528
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,500
know about the cenotaph.

529
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,080
Yes.

530
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,020
Especially Jinyu.

531
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,840
If he knows,

532
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,220
he’ll look for his father,
regardless of anything.

533
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,170
We mustn’t tell my children about it.

534
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,390
He’s handsome,

535
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,290
and kind.

536
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,930
He solves cases,

537
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,260
and wants to hire a female coroner.

538
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,260
The Handsome Judge

539
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,130
-is perspicacious
-Perspicacious

540
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,300
-and kind.
-and kind.

541
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,140
He has an abhorrence of sin
and a handsome appearance

542
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,900
so that people like him at first sight.

543
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,120
Isn’t he the Handsome Judge?

544
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,930
Why doesn’t he admit that?

545
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,980
(Notice)

546
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,010
How is that possible?

547
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,300
Sir.

548
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,130
Sir?

549
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,420
What happened?

550
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,330
Something surprising.

551
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,730
Three Judicial Offices
solved a criminal case

552
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,540
where a man was struck by lightning.

553
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,880
Look, here’s a notice,

554
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,460
telling us how to protect ourselves
from lightening.

555
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,820
Oh my God!

556
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,900
People can even die like that?

557
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,850
Yes. I saw that today.

558
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,460
You saw the lightning?

559
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,610
No.

560
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,180
I mean I helped to solve the case.

561
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,420
I checked the dead man
who was struck by lightning.

562
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,700
You’re a coroner?

563
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,540
What bad luck!

564
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,970
Sir, are you alright?

565
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,180
Why didn’t you watch your steps?

566
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,370
Miss, are you trying to hit me to death?

567
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,230
I’m sorry. Are you alright?

568
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,430
Let me check on you.

569
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,760
Don’t touch me.

570
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,620
Sir, I think you’re hurt.

571
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,310
Let me take you to see a doctor.

572
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,760
It’s kind of you.

573
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,590
Don’t bother, Miss.

574
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,380
I have medicine at home.

575
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,710
I live near here.

576
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,350
Let me get you back home, then.

577
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,430
All right. Thank you.

578
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,430
Come on. Stand up.

579
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,800
Be careful.

580
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,800
Your Highness.

581
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

582
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,800
She’s the dancing girl?

583
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,280
Yes.

584
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,560
She ran quickly.

585
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,620
I’ve never been so tired before
when chasing girls.

586
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,190
Take her away.

587
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,230
You’re right again.

588
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,830
She was still practicing dancing
in the Dancing Service.

589
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
I lose whenever we make a bet.

590
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,190
How boring!

591
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,230
Others give good things
to beautiful girls.

592
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,400
But everything His Majesty awards me
goes to you.

593
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,840
But you’re wrong about one thing.

594
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,750
What is it?

595
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,320
You said she had stolen something
from Yan Ming.

596
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,180
I searched her residence

597
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,520
in the Dancing Service,

598
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,240
but didn’t find anything.

599
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,150
What exactly did she steal
from Yan Ming?

600
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,020
Besides,

601
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,320
I personally searched her body
that night.

602
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,900
Even her shoes were taken off.

603
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,080
What could she have stolen?

604
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,740
(Year of Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding,
Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin...)

605
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,860
(Year of Renchen)

606
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,950
That’s what she stole.

607
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,110
What?

608
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,230
A volume of book.

609
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,350
Interrogate her and find it out.

610
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,400
She really stole something?

611
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,000
All right, then.

612
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,380
I won’t decline a job

613
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,180
to deal with a beautiful girl.

614
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,970
After interrogating her,

615
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,970
ask the three grave robbers in prison.

616
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,620
According to them,

617
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,460
they know very well

618
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,700
about all nearby grave robbers.

619
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,060
Grave robbers?

620
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,060
Why do you want to ask about them?

621
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,300
Isn’t it Miss Chu’s pendant?

622
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,210
I asked Wu Jiang to borrow it

623
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,780
from my mother.

624
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,300
It’s Princess Xiping’s pendant? Then...

625
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,040
I haven’t seen
my father’s pendant before.

626
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,800
But Chu Chu’s pendant

627
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,000
has the same pattern

628
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,520
and the same tassel.

629
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,300
You think someone robbed
Prince Consort’s grave,

630
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,780
got the pendant out,

631
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,160
and gave it

632
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,780
to a female coroner

633
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,460
so that you would be attracted

634
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,420
and more likely to hire her?

635
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,370
I asked the three grave robbers.

636
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,660
They said that

637
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,090
no one had robbed my father’s grave.

638
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,640
So, she didn’t get this pendant

639
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,180
from his grave.

640
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,540
Do you think

641
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,820
she looks like a spy?

642
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,540
She came from the Southwest.

643
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,580
Prince Consort was also killed
by rebels

644
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,090
in the Southwest.

645
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,330
He might have lost it somewhere

646
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,820
and someone picked it up

647
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,330
before giving it to her.

648
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,090
If this is the truth,

649
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,130
why doesn’t she admit?

650
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,060
Miss, it’s right ahead.

651
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,850
Be careful.

652
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,640
What do you want?

653
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,800
Miss, go with me

654
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,880
and I won’t kill you.

655
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,880
I... I don’t have money.

656
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,990
I’m... I’m ugly, too.

657
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,990
I even eat a lot.

658
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,600
Shut up!

659
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,020
I work for Commandery Prince An!

660
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,160
Stop nagging and give me the pendant!

661
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,350
Pendant?

662
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,470
Give the pendant to me!

663
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,110
Give it to me!

664
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,800
Go!

665
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,110
Miss Chu, shall we go back
to Three Judicial Offices?

666
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,040
All right.

667
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,910
This way, please.

668
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,080
Master, you’re back?

669
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,960
Madam said you wouldn’t have dinner

670
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,260
if you didn’t come back.

671
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,410
Has Jing Yi come back?

672
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,650
He can’t come back very soon.

673
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,260
The Coroner Test was over.

674
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,610
Where has he gone?

675
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,690
According to his servant,

676
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,080
he has gone to the Dancing Service

677
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,990
to catch the murderer
who killed Yan Ming.

678
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,150
He found out the murderer?

679
00:29:59,410 --> 00:29:59,920
Yeah.

680
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,460
Your Highness.

681
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,150
Your Highness.

682
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,370
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

683
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,880
Your Highness.

684
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,120
What happened?

685
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,210
Stop crying.

686
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,380
Explain to me

687
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,530
before you cry again.

688
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,980
Or...

689
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,410
Or keep crying for a minute.

690
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,220
Wu Jiang, what happened?

691
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,140
A gang of villains
tried to kidnap Miss Chu.

692
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,380
Who are they?

693
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,290
I’m sorry,

694
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,500
but I failed to catch anyone alive.

695
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,650
I only bring back a corpse.

696
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,760
Please punish me, Your Highness.

697
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,850
Don’t. Don’t punish him.

698
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,230
I didn’t know they were bad men.

699
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,310
It was all my fault.

700
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,430
And they didn’t kill those kidnappers.

701
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,880
A villain did.

702
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,080
All right.

703
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,120
I won’t punish them.

704
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,060
Are you hurt?

705
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,200
Then what are you crying for?

706
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,110
I feel like I had a nightmare.

707
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,680
I didn’t wake up until I saw you.

708
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,590
Then I couldn’t help crying.

709
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,670
What do you mean?

710
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,660
Your Highness,

711
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,310
you asked General Wu
to save me, didn’t you?

712
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,190
You helped me again.

713
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,210
You helped me several times today.

714
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,350
I…

715
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,560
Shall I...

716
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,310
Shall I kowtow to you again?

717
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,190
There’s no such rule with me.

718
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,680
Don’t bother to be so courteous.

719
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,070
You don’t be courteous, either.

720
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,480
Stop calling me Miss Chu.

721
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,640
Call me Chu Chu.

722
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,740
All right.

723
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,900
Chu Chu.

724
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,230
You took back the corpse?

725
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,230
Yes.

726
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,640
Go get us a coroner.

727
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,390
Yes.

728
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,400
Don’t bother. I’m a coroner.

729
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,530
Your Highness, you saved me.

730
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,520
I don’t know how to pay you back.

731
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,350
All I can do is to perform an autopsy.

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,630
I can do it on anyone.

733
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,830
Let me do it for you.

734
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,590
I want an autopsy on the kidnapper.

735
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,110
Are you still willing to?

736
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,040
Yes.

737
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,950
His heart was stabbed
by something sharp.

738
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
The cut is neat.

739
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,110
He died with one stab.

740
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,800
Thick calluses between his right thumb
and the index finger.

741
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,830
He’s sound in limbs.

742
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,070
Your Highness,

743
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,920
in her purse,

744
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,160
there’re 23 copper coins
with Qian Printing.

745
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,160
I checked in the Minister of Revenue.

746
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,760
19 of the coins are illegal coins.

747
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,030
They’re the same

748
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,390
as what the merchants from Qianzhou used

749
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,310
you saw in the West Market.

750
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,400
You didn’t say much, did you?

751
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
Don’t worry. I know what I should say.

752
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,040
But I think there’s something fishy
with Miss Chu.

753
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,430
She gave this to me today.

754
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,920
It’s poisonous?

755
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,040
No.

756
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,760
If she poisoned it,

757
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,280
she would be someone

758
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,350
I unintentionally offended
during a case

759
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,000
and she simply came to take revenge.

760
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,520
That would be simple.

761
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,830
But this isn’t poisonous

762
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,430
and she flatters me all the time.

763
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,310
She’s more eager to be admitted

764
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,950
than ordinary coroners.

765
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,600
If someone is behind her,

766
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,830
the pendant she holds

767
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,950
must be the bait.

768
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,760
But she prefers to give up the chance
of getting a job,

769
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,800
rather than tell me
how she got the pendant.

770
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
With all due respect, Your Highness,

771
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,040
Jing Yi found that girl.

772
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,210
Get to the point and then leave!

773
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,110
Your Highness, there’s no restriction

774
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,990
for tomorrow’s selection test,

775
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,630
is there?

776
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,650
I met a genius coroner today!

777
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,600
But she’s a bit special

778
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,750
and she can’t be admitted
to Three Judicial Offices

779
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,360
unless you help her.

780
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,360
I promise you,

781
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,190
she’ll impress you!

782
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,520
Then you come to annoy me first?

783
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,630
I’m serious, Your Highness.

784
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,670
No way.

785
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,190
You know what?

786
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,600
If you miss her,
you’ll regret all your life!

787
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,800
I mean

788
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,430
even if someone helps her,
it can’t be me.

789
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Otherwise, when people know about it,

790
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,230
there’ll be trouble.

791
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,040
I’ll help her, then.

792
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,710
I’ll be the invigilator tomorrow.

793
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,910
Jing Yi grew up with me.

794
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,150
I know him very well.

795
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,950
He won’t do this to me.

796
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,870
He doesn’t need to do so, either.

797
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,220
Wu Jiang, have you heard about
the Handsome Judge

798
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,280
she just mentioned?

799
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,760
I haven’t.

800
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,230
Now that you want to know
about her pendant

801
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,940
and obviously Miss Chu hasn’t met

802
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,760
the Handsome Judge before,

803
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,870
why don’t you pretend to be him?

804
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,080
What if she wants a code

805
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,980
or to check about some birthmark

806
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,230
or nevus?

807
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,150
You’re right.

808
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,660
Even if I can pretend to be someone,

809
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,400
I need to know

810
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,080
what this man looks like.

811
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,420
Yes. Yes.

812
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,390
You’re right, Your Highness.

813
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,110
We can’t figure out

814
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,560
if there’s such a man
in the martial world.

815
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,430
Send a letter to Leng Yue.

816
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,430
We should ask her
what she knows most.

817
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,230
Yes.

818
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,280
By the way,

819
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,630
who kidnapped her?

820
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,630
They’re martial artists.

821
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,760
But they deliberately concealed
their martial arts.

822
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,000
I can’t tell who they are.

823
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,360
As far as I see,

824
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,390
they came for Miss Chu on purpose.

825
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,670
Also, they don’t want

826
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,040
to kill her.

827
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,320
They don’t want to kill her?

828
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:09,990
Yes.

829
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,190
I heard them say...

830
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
Go with me

831
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,520
and I won’t kill you.
