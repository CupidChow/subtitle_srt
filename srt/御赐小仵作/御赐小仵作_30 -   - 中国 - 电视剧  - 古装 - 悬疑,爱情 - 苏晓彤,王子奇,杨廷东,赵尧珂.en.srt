1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,880
Wu Chen poisoned soldiers

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,470
and fabricated the strange things.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,310
He also poisoned General Leng
with cinnabar.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,820
You traitor!

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,350
Hou Bin was murdered.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,800
Wu Chen was killed and silenced.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,750
Duke Chang is ending his plot.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,070
He poisoned Leng Peishan
with noxious mugwort stick,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,000
murdered Feng Jie

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,430
and kept Leng Peishan’s condition
from His Majesty

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,680
to stall for time.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,310
I’m sure he uses such a plan

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,150
because he wants big trouble
in Leng Peishan’s army.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,390
General Leng, you think

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,070
Wu Chen was the only murderer?

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,270
What do you mean? I’m all my ears.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,070
Wu Chen is a civil official

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,160
who isn’t your enemy at all.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,390
Why did he take so much trouble

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,750
to poison you?

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,310
And why did he poison soldiers
at this moment

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,110
to make such a big trouble?

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,350
Even if he finished his plan,

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,670
you died,

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,630
your soldiers fell into chaos,

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,160
what benefits could he get

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,750
for himself?

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,560
You think someone wants
to take over my troop?

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,390
Behind Wu Chen,

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,520
there must be

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,160
a long and thorough plan.

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,600
I’m afraid

33
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,610
the plan is coming to an end.

34
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,480
So, he doesn’t need
to poison you anymore.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,630
Coming to an end?

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,680
You mean

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,360
they’ll take over my troop soon?

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,300
General Leng, have you heard of a case

39
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,940
about illegal copper coins in Qianzhou?

40
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,310
Illegal copper coins?

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,550
We seldom need copper coins
in the army

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
and there’s been much trouble lately.

43
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,760
I haven’t heard about

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,510
what happened in Qianzhou.

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,160
Before coming here,

46
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,270
we crashed a hideout
for illegal copper coins

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,670
and arrested Prefect Li Zhang.

48
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,570
Hardly had we arrested him

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,340
when some of your soldiers

50
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,700
set fire to his mansion?

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,730
What?

52
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,730
I didn’t send any soldiers.

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,980
Oh,

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,260
Hou Bin sent some soldiers to Qianzhou

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,340
for material purchase.

56
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,620
But Hou Bin died.

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,420
What exactly happened?

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,910
General Leng,

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,430
do you recognize them?

60
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,740
I do.

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,210
Hou Bin recruited them from bandits

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,220
six months ago.

63
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,220
The other day, they escaped

64
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,100
during the training outside the camp

65
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,440
because they couldn’t bear
the hardship.

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,470
You met them?

67
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,160
Prefect Li’s neighbors identified that

68
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,220
your soldiers set fire
to Prefect Li’s mansion.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,270
They’re two of the soldiers.

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,240
I guess they escaped

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,960
because they didn’t want me
to recognize them

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,270
after I came here.

73
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,360
If I guess correctly,

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
someone must have coordinated with them.

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,440
General Leng,

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,960
there’s another man hiding in your army

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
who’s about to make trouble at any time.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,190
Are you interested in catching him

79
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,830
with me?

80
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,380
=The Imperial Coroner=

81
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,460
=Episode 30=

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Turn him over.

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,350
Yes.

84
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,820
Come on, Chu Chu.

85
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,110
Newly cooked ﻿white plum cakes.

86
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,000
They’re still hot.

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,230
Perfect timing.

88
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,350
Put the cakes on him.

89
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,270
All right.

90
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,220
Done.

91
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,100
After the cakes on put on him,

92
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,250
we need to wait for a while.

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,130
I’ll guard here.

94
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
Miss Leng, go have some rest.

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
How can I rest when you don’t?

96
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,100
Besides,

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
His Highness urged me

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,550
to keep you company.

99
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,540
Your Highness. General.

100
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,390
How’s it going? Have you got anything?

101
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,320
Don’t be anxious. It’ll be done soon.

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,810
Bruises?

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,160
He didn’t have bruises
when he was taken out of the well.

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,550
He was drowned in the well.

105
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,350
The water is cold.

106
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,600
And he just died.

107
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,230
Bruises on his corpse

108
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,000
can hardly appear directly.

109
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,550
Normally,

110
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,790
they appear in one or two days.

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,070
But if we want
to see the bruises earlier,

112
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,350
we can steam the corpse

113
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,480
on the newly burned pit for a while,

114
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,830
put some paper bathed in wine vinegar

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,230
where there might be bruises,

116
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
and put the hot white plum cakes.

117
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,070
If there’re real bruises,

118
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,390
they’ll appear.

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,760
(Bruises on the back and neck)

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Your Highness, this bruise proves that

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,230
someone knocked him out

122
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,760
and drowned him in the well.

123
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,820
(Drowned in the well)

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,820
He’s the only man who could do it.

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,790
Who?

126
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,230
What an easy and effective way

127
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,950
to recognize friends and enemies
with the red ribbon!

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,510
You’re awesome, Your Highness.

129
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,950
You even predicted that

130
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,720
rebels would get changed
before the fight.

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
It’s not hard to predict.

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,550
When two groups of men fight

133
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,440
in the same clothes,

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,720
they’ll get accidentally injured

135
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,950
without some striking changes
on their clothes.

136
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,080
Go.

137
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,080
Your Highness, how did you know

138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,230
Zhao Jie was the murderer?

139
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,320
Time.

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,470
Time?

141
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,790
The time when he killed Wu Chen.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,460
Last night when we searched for Wu Chen,

143
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,660
Zhao Jie came very late.

144
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,490
General Leng, I was having a bath

145
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,410
and I’m late.

146
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,670
We thought he was late

147
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,030
because he was having a bath.

148
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,710
But after Chu Chu found something fishy
on Wu Chen’s corpse,

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
I asked Zhao Jie’s guard
outside his camp.

150
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,140
The guard told me that

151
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,870
he was having a bath for one hour.

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
During that,

153
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,610
he didn’t ask for more hot water.

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,940
Last night, I noticed his hands.

155
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,040
After being bathed in water
for one hour,

156
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,620
(Bathed in water)
(Skin on hands)

157
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,790
his hands should have looked pale
or had winkles.

158
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,260
That’s it.

159
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,410
When he said he was having a bath,

160
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,470
he was finding an excuse.

161
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,640
In fact, it was when

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
he killed Wu Chen.

163
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,510
That was the time.

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,720
Kill him!

165
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,340
End the fight.

166
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,350
If we want to catch them all,

167
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,080
we must let Zhao Jie leave first.

168
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,000
Only when they think they can win,

169
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,470
they’ll come out together.

170
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,670
Upon hearing the horn,

171
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,910
General Leng’s closest soldiers
will fight back and besiege them,

172
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,910
so that none of the rebels can escape.

173
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,280
Zhao Jie!

174
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,880
You traitor! Surrender yourself!

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,440
This room looks neat

176
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,640
and nothing seems special.

177
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,150
What are we looking for?

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
As the supreme commander

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,350
of the rebel plan,

180
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,150
(The Book of Songs)
Zhao Jie must have chances

181
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,350
to contact his superior directly.

182
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,590
We may find some clues here

183
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,390
about his superior.

184
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,140
Your Highness,

185
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,030
are you sure Duke Chang is his superior?

186
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,040
Anyway,

187
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,790
Zhao Jie isn’t the man

188
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,870
who manipulates the whole plan.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,140
He doesn’t have ability or chance

190
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,380
to make Li Zhang work for him.

191
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,730
He isn’t able to make trouble
in Chang’an, either.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
So far,

193
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
we’ve only arrested chess pieces.

194
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,020
We still don’t know

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,840
where the chess player is.

196
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,590
After Hou Bin died,

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,840
Zhao Jie is the only man

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,590
who’s experienced and powerful enough

199
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,960
to take his place.

200
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,840
Once General Leng let him

201
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,880
be the Vice Military Commissioner,

202
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,590
he will tell people
General Leng is badly sick

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,280
and then he can take over the army.

204
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,110
Taking over the army forcibly

205
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,590
is Zhao Jie’s backup plan.

206
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,350
He didn’t expect us to find out Wu Chen.

207
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,000
So, he had to kill Wu Chen hastily.

208
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,230
Before that,

209
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,640
he might have written a letter
to his master

210
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,880
about the changes.

211
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,230
He...

212
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,110
He hasn’t sent the letter yet.

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,470
Let’s look for it, then.

214
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,000
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,520
It’s the letter
Zhao Jie hasn’t sent yet?

216
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,440
Yes.

217
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,570
There’re ten patterns on it.

218
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,540
Some patterns are duplicate.

219
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,810
(4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7)
I think it’s a cipher letter

220
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,810
(4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7)
where patterns are used

221
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,980
to represent one to ten.

222
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,570
When there’re numbers,

223
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,880
there should be a decoding book.

224
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,240
It’s not as easy as the cipher letter

225
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,740
Prince Consort left us.

226
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,540
Expecting someone to decode it,

227
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,050
Prince Consort left us enough clues.

228
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,130
With it,

229
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,570
people will decode it

230
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,570
unless they’re idiots.

231
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,570
But Zhao Jie doesn’t want anyone
to decode it.

232
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,690
If he puts the decoding book
in his mind,

233
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,050
how can we decode it?

234
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,860
Even if Zhao Jie has a great memory,

235
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,930
he won’t remember
such an important thing

236
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,780
only with his mind.

237
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,780
He can only remember the patterns

238
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,180
representing ten numbers.

239
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,340
He must have a decoding book

240
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,860
to translate the numbers into words.

241
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,740
(The Book of Songs)

242
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,900
This is the decoding book.

243
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,220
The Book of Songs?

244
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,180
Other books of his

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,010
are mainly about military
or national policies.

246
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,420
They haven’t been read for a long time.

247
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,250
He often read the Book of Songs.

248
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,690
There’re over 300 poems in it,

249
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,810
concerning astronomy, geography,
phenology and folk custom.

250
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,570
(Sundial, compass)

251
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,690
(Sweet Green Rice Ball, lion dance)
The words are abundant enough

252
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,810
for basic communication.

253
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,590
Your Highness, other books on the shelf

254
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,620
also look clean.

255
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,520
How do you know

256
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,030
they haven’t been read for a long time?

257
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,710
They look clean,

258
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,790
because Zhao Jie is
a senior military officer.

259
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
Cleaners come often.

260
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,840
But cleaners

261
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,590
only dust the cover of the books,

262
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,910
instead of inside pages.

263
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,440
The weather is damp in the Southwest.

264
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,590
After a long time,

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,840
an unopened book will be musty.

266
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,030
If it’s not opened for years,

267
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,790
there’ll be mildews.

268
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,100
Three volumes of the Book of Songs
aren’t musty.

269
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,780
Their edges are worn out, too.

270
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,660
(Often read with worn-out edges)
So, he must have often read them.

271
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,510
Your Highness, you have a sharp nose.

272
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,100
It smells really musty.

273
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,250
We’ve found the decoding book.

274
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,610
But we don’t know

275
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,490
how the patterns match the numbers.

276
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,310
Ten patterns represent ten numbers.

277
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,120
There should be...

278
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,740
3.6288 million types of permutations.

279
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,860
Ye... yes.

280
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:37,500
(4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7)

281
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,250
(Wu failed, I killed him. Won’t join you
in Chang’an as scheduled.)

282
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,980
But only one permutation
can translate the numbers

283
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,250
into relevant words.

284
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,550
If we keep trying,

285
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,910
when can we find the right permutation?

286
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,580
(Wu...)

287
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,470
Your Highness, you’re awesome!

288
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,520
As long as you can
thoroughly recite the Book of Songs,

289
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,710
you’ll figure out the words, too.

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,260
(Wu failed, I killed him. Won’t join you
in Chang’an as scheduled.)

291
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,030
I’m too old to move quickly.

292
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,100
Be careful.

293
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,230
Grandfather, have some water.

294
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
All right.

295
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,640
Grandfather, are you alright?

296
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,520
It should be me.

297
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,440
What?

298
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,710
It should be me who died.

299
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,000
Grandfather,
after the problem is solved,

300
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,280
let’s go back home.

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,120
Let’s go back to Chang’an.

302
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,390
There’re the best doctors in Chang’an.

303
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,840
They’ll cure you.

304
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,830
My silly granddaughter,

305
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,680
don’t take the doctor’s words seriously.

306
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,880
Can I really live

307
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,640
as long as the doctor says?

308
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,920
Can’t you just listen to me once?

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
All right. All right.

310
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,040
Yue,

311
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,800
something in this world matters more

312
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,110
than keeping us alive.

313
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,830
Or Commandery Prince An
wouldn’t have come here.

314
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,560
You wouldn’t have come here

315
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,680
with him, either.

316
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
It’s unrelated at all.

317
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,800
What does it have anything to do
with your disease?

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,230
All right, Yue.

319
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,400
Just take care of yourself.

320
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,190
Don’t bother about me.

321
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,740
General.

322
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,060
How’s it going, Jinyu?

323
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:08,850
Have you found something?

324
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,010
It’s what Zhao Jie said

325
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,140
in the letter to his superior.

326
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,730
Wu failed. I killed him.

327
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,180
Won’t join you in Chang’an as scheduled.

328
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,900
It meant Wu Chen failed and was killed.

329
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,410
Join you in Chang’an? Join?

330
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,420
I’m afraid
there’s another group of rebels.

331
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,130
They picked a date

332
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,090
to join each other in Chang’an.

333
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,540
We’d better find the detailed list.

334
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,920
Even if we can’t,

335
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
we should estimate a number.

336
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,000
Otherwise, people in Chang’an
can hardly deal with them.

337
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,190
Our priority is

338
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
to interrogate the captured rebels.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
Jing Yi, go interrogate them.

340
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,000
He doesn’t need to go.

341
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,000
They were all executed.

342
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,830
What?

343
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,830
They were bandits.

344
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,980
General Leng didn’t kill them,

345
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,950
because he had pity on them

346
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,710
who did bad things for a living.

347
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,280
In case they hurt common people,

348
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,400
he recruited them.

349
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,520
About this,

350
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
soldiers have a lot of criticism.

351
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,520
They made trouble again.

352
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,830
If General Leng didn’t
kill them immediately,

353
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,520
he could hardly
convince his subordinates.

354
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,800
All right. I have no job now.

355
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,040
None of them is alive.

356
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,950
Your Highness, let me have a try.

357
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,880
What do you mean?

358
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,110
Let me do the autopsy.

359
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Now that they’re dead,

360
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,950
you should let me find clues

361
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,040
from their corpses.

362
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,550
They look like soldiers

363
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,200
who have received training for years,

364
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,550
but we may find traces of old lives

365
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,120
in their internal organs or skeletons.

366
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,110
If I can do the autopsy,

367
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,400
I may find some clues.

368
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,400
All right. Do the autopsy.

369
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,800
In whatever way you want.

370
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,880
Brother, take her there immediately.

371
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,920
All right.

372
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,580
(Antique Store)

373
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,000
It’s a pleasure to see you, Eunuch Qin.

374
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,040
Sorry I haven’t welcomed you.

375
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,070
I’m sorry.

376
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,950
Are you an idiot?

377
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
I told you this is...

378
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,400
My subordinates bothered you
the other day.

379
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,560
Please kindly forgive them.

380
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,100
Search the place carefully!

381
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,640
Yes!

382
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,360
You! What...?

383
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,830
-Go.
-Yes. Yes.

384
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,190
Show me all your purchasing lists

385
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,680
of this year.

386
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,900
(Account Book)

387
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,040
These things look like imperial stuff.

388
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,200
I’ll take them back for inspection.

389
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,190
If they’re not, I’ll return them to you.

390
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,230
This one looks like
an imperial thing, too.

391
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,550
It doesn’t matter, Eunuch Qin.

392
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,340
The Ruyi you gave me...

393
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,400
I had it discerned very carefully.

394
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,280
It’s quite a precious thing. Thank you.

395
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,830
It’s just a little gift.

396
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,070
It’s quite my honor

397
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,640
that you accept it.

398
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,950
The words carved on the copper Ruyi

399
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,350
look quite interesting.

400
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,310
Yeah.

401
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,560
I’m interested in that.

402
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,950
May I have a word with you?

403
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,520
Sure. Sure.

404
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,000
It’s my honor.

405
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,160
Come, please.

406
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,190
Please stay, Eunuch Sun.

407
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,830
Come this way, please.

408
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,150
I...

409
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,830
Come, please.

410
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,640
Tell me. Where’s Xu Rugui?

411
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,310
Don’t worry, Eunuch Qin.

412
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,560
When Xu Rugui first
came back to Chang’an,

413
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,560
he was dying.

414
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,350
Luckily, he struggled to live.

415
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,470
After a period of treatment,

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
he can talk now.

417
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Just get to the point.

418
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,470
I’m quite busy with palace business

419
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,190
and I don’t have time
for a useless talk!

420
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,560
You served three emperors

421
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,960
and you investigated it a few times.

422
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,150
Then you should know

423
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,000
what Duke Chang suffered
in Qianzhou, right?

424
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,310
Duke Chang?

425
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,560
It’s said that a group of bandits

426
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,560
attacked his mansion in Qianzhou.

427
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,920
His family were slaughtered.

428
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,830
Everyone in his mansion was killed.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,110
No one stayed alive.

430
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
Not bandits.

431
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,470
What did you say?

432
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,110
They weren’t bandits?

433
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,110
It wasn’t bandits
who slaughtered Duke Chang’s family,

434
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,800
but an official army from the Palace?

435
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,070
Official army?

436
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,400
How did you know that?

437
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,470
Duke Chang witnessed that.

438
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,890
His Highness exchanged clothes
with his study companion

439
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,560
and hid among corpses
so that he survived.

440
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,350
He never forgets such a miserable scene.

441
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,350
I see.

442
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,830
But what does it concern me?

443
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,040
Eunuch Qin,

444
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,000
His Highness knows that

445
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,160
you’re caring for him.

446
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,640
He also wants to talk to you
about old affairs.

447
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,640
But it’s not convenient for him
to come now.

448
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,000
So, I’m asked to entertain you

449
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,190
to resolve the misunderstanding

450
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,400
that we sold imperial objects

451
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,640
and also to reassure you.

452
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,830
When His Highness
takes care of Xu Rugui,

453
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,710
it’ll do no harm to you.

454
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,920
You’re threatening me?

455
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,400
I don’t dare to.

456
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,520
Eunuch Qin,

457
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,920
His Highness wants to cooperate with you
to kill the tyrant,

458
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,920
take back the throne belonging to him

459
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,230
and restore our nation.

460
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,160
We rely on you to do such a great thing!

461
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,800
Cheers.

462
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,000
Now that His Highness wants cooperation,

463
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,520
shouldn’t I meet him first?

464
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,710
He’s been waiting for you.

465
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,800
He’s in Chang’an?

466
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,160
Who’s that?

467
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,640
It’s me, Master. I’m Mingde.

468
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,310
Master.

469
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,330
Aren’t you on duty today?

470
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,760
Why are you coming here,

471
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,920
instead of serving His Majesty?

472
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,350
Don’t get angry, Master.

473
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,200
Last night, His Majesty had a cold.

474
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,070
When he got up this morning,
he felt sick

475
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,400
and he was angry.

476
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,760
He kicked me out
when he didn’t want to see me.

477
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,070
Master,

478
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,970
we’re going to make Duke Chang
the emperor.

479
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,460
Why don’t you do away

480
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,520
with the present emperor?

481
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,370
What do you need your head for?

482
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,080
To make you look like a human?

483
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,560
Please enlighten me, Master.

484
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,640
The present emperor

485
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,110
is quite a tough man.

486
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,920
He pretended to be insane
and fooled everyone.

487
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,000
Now, he’s trying

488
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,160
to suppress our division.

489
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,800
He sounded us out from time to time.

490
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,000
Cunning Jing Zhi is also making trouble

491
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,380
with the other officials.

492
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,680
Do you think

493
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,920
we can dethrone him so easily?

494
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,430
If we don’t act carefully

495
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,830
and make him realize something,

496
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,920
we’ll be killed first!

497
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,110
Serve His Majesty carefully.

498
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,710
Our priority is

499
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,430
to kill Xiao Jinyu and his men

500
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,760
in case he ruins the big plan

501
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,400
Duke Chang and I have.

502
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,190
Don’t worry, Master.

503
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,000
I’ll make careful arrangements.

504
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,400
I won’t let Xiao Jinyu come back alive.

505
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,470
All right. Go get it done.

506
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,350
Yes.

507
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,520
Today, I come to you,

508
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,160
for a clear answer.

509
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,800
The soldier from Qianzhou...

510
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Who’s he?

511
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,800
Don’t worry, General Leng.
He isn’t a bad man.

512
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,190
I certainly know he isn’t.

513
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,950
My granddaughter looks at him

514
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,000
in the exact way

515
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,430
her mother looked at her father.

516
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,280
Could he be Vice Minister Jing Yi,

517
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,400
the son of Senior Jing?

518
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,280
You have sharp eyes, General Leng.

519
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,160
So, he really is.

520
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,430
I hear that

521
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,800
Jing Yi is good at identifying lies.

522
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,760
Do you disguise him like that

523
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,400
and put him in my military clinic

524
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,470
so that he can get more intel?

525
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
It’s an expedient.

526
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,110
No offence, General Leng.
Please understand.

527
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,280
Your Highness.

528
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,710
Chu Chu, what have you got?

529
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,710
Your Highness, it’s so weird.

530
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,680
What have you got?

531
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,330
General Xiao, are you sure

532
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,280
they’re recruited bandits?

533
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,220
Yes. I’m quite sure.

534
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,470
No way.

535
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,920
Not all of them are bandits.

536
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,190
Not all of them?

537
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,760
What are they, then?

538
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,560
Soldiers.

539
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,190
Soldiers who had been trained for years.

540
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,160
No way!

541
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,920
I picked ten corpses

542
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,850
of different batches of recruitments.

543
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,800
Then I found that

544
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,640
four of them were trained in the army.

545
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,880
They never lived as bandits.

546
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,160
They used to be bandits

547
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
many years ago.

548
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,280
It’s normal
when you can’t find such traces.

549
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,400
It’s not.

550
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,040
His Highness said that

551
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,710
there would be traces of any action.

552
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,470
There would be traces with bodies, too.

553
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,800
No one can easily hide

554
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,760
what a life he used to live.

555
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,760
His body would record everything.

556
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,640
If they’re real bandits,

557
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,040
what traces should be recorded?

558
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,240
Bandits run about in the mountain.

559
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,450
(Leg)
So, they have strong shanks

560
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,590
(Heart)
and a strong heart.

561
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,590
Their patellae are usually worn out

562
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,920
with frequent injuries and sprains.

563
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,010
There’re traces of recovery

564
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,620
on their skeletal muscles

565
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,140
(Fractures on arms and legs)
after they have fractures.

566
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,760
But among the ten men,

567
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,150
only six have such features.

568
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,870
They were obviously bandits
for a long time.

569
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,600
The other four men

570
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,640
(Unknown)
have some features

571
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,140
like Military Commissioner’s soldiers.

572
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,090
No way!

573
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,710
They were definitely recruited

574
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,430
from the den of bandits.

575
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,830
Brother, I remember you said that

576
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,070
bandits in Qianzhou
not only caused trouble

577
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,480
to Military Commissioner’s army,

578
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,680
but also disturbed the battalion

579
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,350
of Qianzhou Army.

580
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,230
Is that so?

581
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,160
Yes.

582
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,680
Qianzhou Army isn’t like us.

583
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,390
They never fight hard with the bandits.

584
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,040
When they robbed Qianzhou Army,

585
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
they snatched money and food.

586
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,160
Did they also snatch soldiers?

587
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,430
Snatch soldiers?

588
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,200
They did, as I heard.

589
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,890
Maybe soldiers were taken away
to do labor work.

590
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,470
When failing to defeat them,

591
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,640
did Qianzhou Army keep recruiting
more soldiers?

592
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,070
I’m not sure about that.

593
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,110
Your Highness, you mean...?

594
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,680
Brother, go get the recruitment record
of Qianzhou Army

595
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,110
with my official seal.

596
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
All right. I’ll be on my way.

597
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,920
Eunuch Qin.

598
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,830
Go. Go.

599
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,280
Eunuch Qin.

600
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Minister Han.

601
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,520
Eunuch Qin.

602
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,230
Minister Han.

603
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,640
His Majesty forgot to tell you something

604
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,400
when he talked to you.

605
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,110
He asked me to wait here for you

606
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,950
so that I would bring you the message.

607
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,280
Minister Han,
may I have a word with you?

608
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,310
Eunuch Qin, just get to the point.

609
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,230
Minister Han,

610
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,680
I told on Princess Xiping to you

611
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,190
the other day.

612
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,040
Do you not remember it at all?

613
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,110
I’m still checking on that.

614
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,310
What?

615
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,680
With two witnesses,

616
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,760
you still doubt that?

617
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,310
Eunuch Qin,

618
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,130
I’ve verified

619
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,170
the two ladies.

620
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,310
They did work for Princess Xiping.

621
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,760
But you want to tell on Princess Xiping

622
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,900
with some useless words

623
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,470
from two ladies?

624
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,710
Even if you report to His Majesty,

625
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,160
Princess Xiping will defend herself
with a clever talk.

626
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,230
It’s a big crime to deceive His Majesty.

627
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,640
I can’t be too careful.

628
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,280
You mean there isn’t enough evidence

629
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,520
to close the case?

630
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,640
Well, please take care of the case

631
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,040
and make further investigation.

632
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,000
But I’m telling you.

633
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,430
What’s faked can’t be true.

634
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,070
You’ll find out something.

635
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,800
Minister Han,

636
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,470
His Majesty has drafted a decree

637
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,400
to get Commandery Prince An back
to Chang’an.

638
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,190
You must hurry up.

639
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,360
Let me remind you.

640
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,170
To do something big,
you must be daring and ruthless!

641
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,400
Don’t show petty kindness!

642
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,350
