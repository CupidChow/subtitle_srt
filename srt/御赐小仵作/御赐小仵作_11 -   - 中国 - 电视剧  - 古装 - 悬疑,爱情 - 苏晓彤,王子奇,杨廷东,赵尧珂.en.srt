1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,070
Leng Yue got hurt for saving me.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,030
General Xiao arrived at that time.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,310
His Highness found fake copper cash

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,310
in the pay of General Xiao.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,710
His Highness said
Prefect Li Zhang might play a role.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,630
Lord Jing and His Highness made a bet
and went to the county government.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,120
I took His Highness
and General Xiao home.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,000
My brother met us.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,560
He scolded me for that.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,040
He’s really ill-tempered.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,430
I can’t do anything for that.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,790
Sir, would you please do me a favor?

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,520
We’d like to. What’s it?

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,840
It’s late now.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,750
Will you allow us to

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,270
stay here for one night?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,040
Are you serious?

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,750
Stay here?

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,550
Sir.

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,880
We are a family of coroner.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,800
Even the villagers

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,990
dislike contacting us

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,030
because they think it’s unlucky.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,560
Will you really stay here?

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,920
As a coroner, you are helping

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,560
the dead and the government.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
How could it be unlucky?

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,240
Every Yamen has its mortuary.

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,840
Chu Chu saw that

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
there’re also such rooms
in my home in Chang’an.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
If you have to say so,

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,190
I’m about the same as you are.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,870
You have such a room, too?

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Yes, they really have one.

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,950
I even performed an autopsy there.

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,040
Autopsy results are
the basis for investigation.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,230
One false step
will make a great difference.

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,870
As a judge,

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,310
we have to be cautious.

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,190
Go tidy up a room

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
and prepare some dishes and wine.

42
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,550
You don’t know where the wine is.

43
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,310
I store them. I know where it is.

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,230
I will go take it.

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,080
Come with me.

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,410
Zhang Yun. Chen Feng.

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

48
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,700
Go visit Jing Yi

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,620
and tell him

50
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,700
I’m staying here tonight.

51
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,530
Ask him to do whatever he should do.

52
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,260
He doesn’t need to wait for me.

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,810
-Yes.
-Yes.

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,860
=The Imperial Coroner=

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,220
=Episode 11=

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,750
He, what’s the matter?

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,620
Tell me

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,110
who the people are.

59
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,420
You heard that.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,230
One is a judge from the imperial court.

61
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,580
The other is his elder brother,

62
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,390
a general.

63
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,110
His men once suppressed bandits
around here.

64
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,190
Every word is true.

65
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,190
You went to Chang’an alone.

66
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,830
How could you know people like that?

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,590
I met them on the exam.

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,110
You went their house on the exam?

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,420
I’ve been helping him investigate

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,860
when I was in Chang’an.

71
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,550
So he let me stay

72
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,430
so that he could ask for information.

73
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,670
You even lived in his house?

74
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,740
Jing Yi should hold Li Zhang
for half a day.

75
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,340
We will meet him in the Yamen

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,990
after we have the supper.

77
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,870
Why do you want to stay here now?

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,220
You know what?

79
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,020
Chu Chu isn’t treated

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,990
as she’s a biological daughter.

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,230
They are all good to her, aren’t they?

82
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,150
Yes, they are good to her.

83
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,830
But it’s weird.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,830
Weird?

85
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,300
As her father,

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,150
Chu Ping shows his love.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,340
But it’s in a polite way.

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,620
Polite?

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,670
I once left the capital for a case.

90
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,220
Mother was worrying all night.

91
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,950
When I went for her for some tea,

92
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,110
she said in anger

93
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,430
she wouldn’t allow me to drink.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,970
Chu Chu has left home for so long

95
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,490
without any news.

96
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,240
Now she’s back all of a sudden.

97
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,890
But Chu Ping didn’t blame her at all.

98
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,140
Maybe it’s because Chu Ping isn’t

99
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,240
as bad-tempered as Mother.

100
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,890
No.

101
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,850
And Chu He,

102
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,200
he didn’t act like an elder brother.

103
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,890
Chu He is a bit weird.

104
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,570
If you were sent back by others

105
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,050
after being away home for a long time,

106
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,450
I’d first see if you are alright.

107
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,890
As long as you are fine

108
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,490
and the visitors aren’t malicious,

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,770
I’d say thanks of course.

110
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,200
But Chu He didn’t.

111
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,960
It seems the kinder we are,

112
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,570
the more he cares about who we are

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,890
and the more malicious he is.

114
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,640
You are right.

115
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,890
As a girl with unimpeachable reputation,

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,900
how could you just live

117
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,520
in a strange man’s house at random?

118
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,290
You don’t know what intentions he had.

119
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,850
He had good intentions.

120
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,450
You know what?

121
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,330
I lost my purse then

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,770
and was wronged by others.

123
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,770
He caught the thief

124
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,450
and got my purse back.

125
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,240
When I was hijacked in the street,

126
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,610
he arranged his men to save me.

127
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,450
What’s more,

128
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,520
he has never looked down upon me.

129
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,520
He said I’m the best coroner
he has ever met.

130
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,920
I failed the last test of coroner, but

131
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,450
he is willing to give me another chance.

132
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,570
He said

133
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,130
he’d take me back to Chang’an

134
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,120
if he agreed to take me on.

135
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,850
Even if he decides not to hire me,

136
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,850
he will investigate my background

137
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,120
so as to rank me as a coroner.

138
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,680
He even wants to investigate
your background?

139
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,640
He.

140
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,200
It’s an item in the ranking test.

141
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,240
You took it in your first test, right?

142
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,610
Yes, that’s true.

143
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,850
I know

144
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,130
others

145
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,690
said I was born out of wedlock.

146
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,770
But you’ve asked me to ignore the words

147
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,020
since I was a little girl.

148
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,120
You told me that’s nonsense.

149
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,240
He’s the smartest
and fairest person I’ve ever seen.

150
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,450
He won’t trust the nonsense readily.

151
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,890
He will figure it out himself.

152
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,490
Chu, do you have to be the coroner?

153
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,480
Our family are all coroners
for generations.

154
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,570
I’m one of us.

155
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,580
Of course I will be a coroner.

156
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,170
Uh.

157
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,290
If the Handsome Judge doesn’t exist,

158
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,570
the coroner around him should

159
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,240
be the one making people jealous.

160
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,730
I thought

161
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,050
he sent me home because

162
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,200
he doesn’t want me.

163
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,450
But he is staying for one night.

164
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,520
It means I still have time.

165
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,450
That’s my last chance.

166
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,450
I will surely take the opportunity.

167
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,290
You want to leave home so much

168
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,450
to work with him?

169
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,690
Of course not.

170
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,800
After I make some achievements,

171
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,490
I will take you to Chang’an.

172
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,730
He, Chang’an is big,

173
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,640
very beautiful.

174
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,960
It has everything.

175
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,640
You will like it.

176
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,800
I don’t like it.

177
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,050
You talked to me about our father.

178
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,890
So you doubt it’s related
to the Chu family?

179
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,080
The Chu family and Father were close.

180
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,680
There must be clues about Father here.

181
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,450
The Chu family hide Chu Chu’s
background on purpose

182
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,730
and Chu Chu hides the history
of the pendant deliberately.

183
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,850
We can only

184
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,240
find out the truth here.

185
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,360
Are you sure the witch doctor
is our father?

186
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,960
That’s the only possibility.

187
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,920
The Chu family are honest people.

188
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,520
How about asking them straightly?

189
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,360
It’s not the time.

190
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,290
OK. It’s up to you.

191
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,050
Will you

192
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,290
ask some guardsmen here?

193
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,560
Or I call some soldiers?

194
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,130
Otherwise you will live with me tonight.

195
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,930
Excuse me.

196
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,450
It’s the back lands here.

197
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,970
Our family live here alone

198
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,050
without any relative visiting.

199
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,050
We don’t have many rooms for living.

200
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,930
Today we can get only one room for you.

201
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,250
It’s fine. That’s enough.

202
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,520
My brother and I haven’t
been together for long.

203
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,320
Right?

204
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,050
Thank you for understanding.

205
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,720
Thank you.

206
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,370
I have to leave now.

207
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,760
Let’s go.

208
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,180
(Antique Store)

209
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,220
(The Book of Songs)

210
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,250
Master, goods from the southwest arrive.

211
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,980
Here is the list. Please check.

212
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,780
(To Manager Chi)

213
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,380
(To Manager Chi)

214
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,730
You may leave now.

215
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,940
(Three stars are on the sky.
Which day is today?)

216
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,060
(One hundred and sixty eight)

217
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,700
(On the islet, there is a beauty.)

218
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,380
(Fish)

219
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,060
(One hundred and sixty eight)

220
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,300
(Is)

221
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,860
(Unhooked)

222
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,180
(Fish is unhooked.)

223
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,020
(Fish is unhooked and enters Qianzhou.)

224
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,420
My Lord, the mushrooms
are freshly picked.

225
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,830
Please have a try.

226
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,660
It’s specialty in the mountains here.

227
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,340
Father, here’s the liquor.

228
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,400
You silly boy.

229
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,340
Why are you standing here?

230
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,130
Serve the guests the liquor.

231
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,660
Chu made all dishes herself.

232
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,830
She said it’s for thanking you.

233
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,300
If you don’t like any of the dishes,

234
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,830
just punish her.

235
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,340
Your Highness, cheers.

236
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,220
So this is a tea party in Qianzhou?

237
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,900
Your Highness, both tea and liquor
are for a party.

238
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,630
I especially took two chefs

239
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,540
from the office.

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,980
They are no better
than chefs in Chang’an.

241
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,030
But they are good at
making Qianzhou dishes.

242
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,230
Please enjoy, Your Highness.

243
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,150
Please enjoy, Miss Leng.

244
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,160
Yes. Please enjoy.

245
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,690
Please enjoy.

246
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,540
Prefect Li, you are well prepared.

247
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,980
It’s my pleasure.

248
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,860
Your Highness.

249
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,150
Your Highness. Miss Leng. Cheers.

250
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,780
Is it…?

251
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,100
Thank you for the reward, Your Highness.

252
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,370
How could you pretend?

253
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Uh.

254
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,100
Your Highness, sorry I don’t understand.

255
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,980
Please make it clear.

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,190
Prefect Li, Magistrate Zheng,

257
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,230
can’t you see
the copper coins are illegal?

258
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,910
Uh.

259
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,620
(Qian)

260
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,500
It’s my fault.

261
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,150
As the prefect of Qianzhou,

262
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,790
I don’t know such a monstrous crime

263
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,390
was committed in my rule.

264
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,620
I cannot get away with it.

265
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,190
Please punish, Your Highness.

266
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes, I can’t avoid punishment, either.

267
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,280
Prefect Li, Magistrate Zheng.

268
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,480
Please get up.

269
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,890
Prefect Li, you can’t blame yourself.

270
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,770
The cooper coins are
good enough to pass for genuine.

271
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,490
It’s hard for ordinary people
to figure it out.

272
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,730
I found it all of a sudden in the market

273
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,440
on my way to the county Yamen.

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,160
Anyway, it’s a serious matter.

275
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,450
Please investigate thoroughly.

276
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,490
I will do it.

277
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,510
Copper cash casting needs
a great manpower and materials.

278
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,800
As the Prefect of Qianzhou,

279
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,630
you know the situation the best.

280
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,770
It’s the right thing to let you
investigate the case.

281
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,430
So just go ahead.

282
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,460
I…

283
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,420
That’s enough.
Let’s stop talking about business.

284
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,270
Let’s just enjoy the party.

285
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,590
Hey, don’t just keep eating.

286
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,630
Do you have any news?

287
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,980
I will tell you if there is.

288
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,710
But I don’t get any news.

289
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,030
Normally,

290
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,380
if Xu Rugui doesn’t have any news,

291
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,510
there should be the pony express

292
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,390
about Xiao Jinyu’s death.

293
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,030
But there is no news.

294
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,980
What should we do

295
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,270
if my master asks for it?

296
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,560
It’s not an easy thing for you.

297
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,830
Xu Rugui didn’t do it well.

298
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,510
It made you suffer the hardship.

299
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,830
Yes, how awful!

300
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,270
He’s been fond of food and drink
when nothing bad happens.

301
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,100
But we have to handle it
when something happens.

302
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,870
Will Xu Rugui take the chance to escape

303
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,010
because he thought Eunuch Qin

304
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,100
isn’t as powerful as before?

305
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
No, he won’t.

306
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,710
Where can he escape to?

307
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,420
His home is here.

308
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,950
He has his wife and concubines

309
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,510
as well as his children here.

310
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,040
He won’t be as inhumane
as Xiao Heng was.

311
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,950
Stop!

312
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,660
It’s the anniversary of
Prince Consort’s death tomorrow.

313
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,900
Aren’t you afraid he enters your dream?

314
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,180
You…

315
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,980
Stop talking nonsense.

316
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,630
It’s really unlucky.

317
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,030
Your Highness.

318
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,340
I’m not drunk.

319
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,840
Your Highness. The road is wet.

320
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,800
Mind your step! Your Highness.

321
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,860
Your Highness. I’m slow-witted.

322
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,870
I should be punished with one cup.

323
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,280
No, no, no. It should be three cups.

324
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,430
Three cups.

325
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,780
Magistrate Zheng. Rest early.

326
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,340
Let’s gather next time.

327
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,550
Yes. Yes.

328
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,210
Yes.

329
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,420
What’s wrong? Are you OK?

330
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,130
I’m OK.

331
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,120
I was drinking rashly.

332
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,710
You are too thin to bear it.

333
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,750
Take this. You will be fine soon.

334
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,540
You didn’t allow me to drink

335
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,680
and even drank that for me.

336
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,980
Why did you flaunt your superiority?

337
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,390
I didn’t.

338
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,480
You can’t drink for the injuries.

339
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,510
I’ve told you I’m fine.

340
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,590
You need to meet His Highness, right?

341
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,340
Oh, yes.

342
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,190
I will go soon.

343
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,150
I will keep watching here.

344
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,510
If anyone asks for anything,

345
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,170
I will say you are buying food for me.

346
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,290
Are you taking me as a fool?

347
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,990
I can see that

348
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,950
Zheng Youde is truly drunk

349
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,130
but Li Zhang is pretending.

350
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,060
Fine.

351
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,010
Wait for me with the night snack.

352
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,300
Just go ahead.

353
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
Your Highness, why are you
standing here?

354
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,580
I haven’t drunk for long.
It makes me a bit giddy.

355
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,820
I’m here for sobering up.

356
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,340
Great! I just made some soup for it.

357
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,510
Just take it before it cools down.

358
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,830
Thank you.

359
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,000
It’s my pleasure.

360
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,130
I prepared it when I made dishes.

361
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,570
You are suffering from indigestion.

362
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,540
You will feel uncomfortable without soup

363
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,560
for sobering up after drinking.

364
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,760
How do you know my suffering?

365
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,760
I’ve seen it on the way back.

366
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,180
You didn’t like cold food

367
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,220
nor stodge.

368
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,120
You didn’t drink cold water
no matter how thirsty you were.

369
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,050
You’ve kept your hand in the chest

370
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,970
when you were taking a nap.

371
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,610
Most people with stomach illness

372
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,970
have this habit.

373
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,810
Thank you for paying attention to me.

374
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,360
But please keep it

375
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,640
as a secret.

376
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,360
And don’t let my brother

377
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,450
and Jing Yi know that.

378
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,160
They don’t know it?

379
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,410
It’s no big deal.

380
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,990
If they know it,

381
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,230
they will accommodate themselves to me.

382
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,230
It’s troublesome.

383
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,990
Finish this.

384
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,870
Then I will keep it a secret for you.

385
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,780
Thank you.

386
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,660
It’s me who should say so.

387
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,310
My family are very hospitable.

388
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,810
But as coroners, people often avoid us

389
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,290
on walking in the street,

390
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,090
let alone coming to visit.

391
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,240
You are willing to eating

392
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,450
and living here.

393
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,970
All of us are very happy.

394
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,810
Really?

395
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,570
Sure.

396
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,930
About what happened today,

397
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,170
my family

398
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,880
can talk to others for years.

399
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,640
What I wanted to ask is,

400
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,090
are you really happy

401
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,520
for my visiting?

402
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,000
I…

403
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,280
I…

404
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,690
At first, I didn’t want you to come.

405
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,930
You said you would send me home

406
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,200
if you decided to refuse me.

407
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,370
I was afraid you would leave me home

408
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,930
and refuse me after sending me back.

409
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,450
Meanwhile, I don’t have
a good reputation here.

410
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,320
I feared that you might change your mind

411
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,300
after you knew that

412
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,650
even if you planned to hire me.

413
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,690
Reputation?

414
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,970
Chu He and I weren’t born
by the same mother.

415
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,520
His mother was my father’s wife.

416
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,640
She died of dystocia
after giving birth to Chu He.

417
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,330
I never know who my mother was.

418
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,760
People here

419
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,360
always said I was an illegitimate child.

420
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,570
Anyway, I don’t mind it now.

421
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,690
You said I only need to act well

422
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,660
and wait for your decision.

423
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,010
You haven’t told me your decision,

424
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,090
so I can’t think randomly.

425
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
I choose to work with you,

426
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,160
so I should trust you.

427
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,450
Here. Open it.

428
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,930
Your Highness, what is this?

429
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,850
Your tools were ruined

430
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,330
when you worked for me.

431
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,640
I should compensate you.

432
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,780
I got the materials

433
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,300
from the best swordsmith in Chang’an.

434
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,880
They are tough and corrosion resistant.

435
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,450
But I didn’t have too much time

436
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,730
with tough conditions on the way

437
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,480
to make it more precisely.

438
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,640
You made them yourself?

439
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,120
On our way here from Chang’an?

440
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,850
It’s impossible.

441
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,380
I’ve been with you all the time.

442
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,760
You were reading or reviewing the files.

443
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,050
I didn’t see you doing this.

444
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,160
I made them during the night.

445
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,240
Night?

446
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,730
You didn’t sleep?

447
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,520
I used to sleep little
since I was a child.

448
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,520
As long as you like it,

449
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,850
my efforts were not in vain.

450
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,330
Of course I like it, but…

451
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,520
It’s too valuable.

452
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,120
It’s valuable only if

453
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,050
you can get along with it.

454
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,050
Lord Jing.

455
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,810
Lord Jing, did you have a meal?

456
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,060
My father went out for liquor

457
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,890
and he’ll be back soon.

458
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,210
Will you have a drink?

459
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,450
No, thanks.

460
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,240
May I speak to His Highness in private?

461
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,210
OK. I will be in there.

462
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,280
Chu Chu.

463
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,420
Do you have food that I can take away?

464
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,090
Please pack some for me.

465
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,050
OK.

466
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,050
Did you get the ins and outs

467
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,080
about Li Zhang and Zheng Youde?

468
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,810
Zheng Youde didn’t act abnormally.

469
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,210
But his words are different

470
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,360
from Chu He’s.

471
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,360
It’s true he doesn’t bully people.

472
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,720
Anyway he isn’t a good officer,

473
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,930
but an honest officer at most.

474
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,580
Honest like a bungler.

475
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Even the Deputy Magistrate under him

476
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,410
has more brains than him.

477
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,900
We can see through the cases
he dealt with these years

478
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,540
that he’s slow-witted

479
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,590
but conscientious.

480
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,750
How about Li Zhang?

481
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,540
He must know something
about the copper cash casting.

482
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,580
I just gave the case to him

483
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,390
without any hesitation

484
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,820
as per your words.

485
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,220
Then he pretended to be drunk early

486
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,190
because he’s afraid I’d ask more.

487
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,550
Yes, I lost the bet.

488
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,380
But

489
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,550
I wonder if the information about

490
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,670
the Chu family are worth five gold coins.

491
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,700
Say it.

492
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,550
I asked Zheng Youde for information
about the Chu family.

493
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,860
Before Zheng Youde came
to Guanling County for the post,

494
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,830
Chu Chu has lived in the Chu family.

495
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,390
So he doesn’t know

496
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,340
who Chu Chu’s biological mother is.

497
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,260
Anyway, according to Zheng Youde,

498
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,580
every one of the Chu family is freak.

499
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,380
What do you mean?

500
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,430
The family didn’t contact people

501
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,220
at ordinary times.

502
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,270
But they offered sacrifice to the death

503
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,500
without ties of consanguinity with them.

504
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,550
They live frugally.

505
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,380
But they are generous to the dead.

506
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,260
Your Highness,
don’t you think it’s weird?

507
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,430
Weird?

508
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,830
Do you mean

509
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,950
the tomb of Chu Chu’s mother
may be there?

510
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,670
How is it?

511
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,740
Is it worth five coins?

512
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,190
Lord Jing.

513
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,680
Thank you.

514
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,380
Be slow.

515
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,050
The officer…

516
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,330
Be careful.

517
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,160
I’m leaving.

518
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,880
Mind your step.

519
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,290
He. Chu He.

520
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,610
You are drunk. Get in.

521
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,300
I am not drunk.

522
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,520
I’m very awake.

523
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,320
What’s going on?

524
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,730
I didn’t expect he can’t drink.

525
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,880
He’s fine just now.

526
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,250
I didn’t get drunk.

527
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,200
You said you’re officer from Chang’an.

528
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,640
I don’t believe it.

529
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,650
Prove it.

530
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,700
He, stop jabbering

531
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,850
Grandpa is sleeping.

532
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,640
You’d go sleep too.
It’s none of your business.

533
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,330
Do you dare?

534
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,020
What should I do to prove it?

535
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,360
There is a haunted house.

536
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,210
The one the witch doctor lived in.

537
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,780
If you can catch the ghost,

538
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,640
I will trust you.

539
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,550
The witch doctor
lived in a haunted house?

540
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,580
Chu He, stop talking nonsense.

541
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,950
Go back to your room.

542
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,810
Chu Chu.

543
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:27,970
Is it true?

544
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,640
It’s true.

545
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,930
The house has become

546
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,810
haunted

547
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,400
for years.

548
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,580
Everyone in Pingle knows it.

549
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,640
If you don’t dare,

550
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,090
don’t come for Chu Chu again.

551
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,850
OK. I will go with you tomorrow morning.

552
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,880
Now. Not tomorrow morning.

553
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,090
The ghost appears at night

554
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,570
not in the morning.

555
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,400
Are you scared?

556
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,050
You hear it?

557
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,330
The ghost is crying.

558
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,090
It’s from the house.

559
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:27,970
So what?

560
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,050
Do you dare to go?

561
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,000
Since it is so,

562
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,520
please lead us the way.

563
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,610
Your Highness.

564
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,460
Do you really dare to go?

565
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,970
I’ve never seen a ghost before.

566
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,730
So I can take the chance
to increase my knowledge.

567
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,280
Chu, please.

568
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,100
General Xiao, please stop His Highness.

569
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,930
I haven’t seen a ghost, either.

570
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,570
I will go with Jinyu.

571
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,450
Let’s go.

572
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,120
Wait for me.

573
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,240
You really went to buy the snacks?

574
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,210
Of course.

575
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,480
How do you feel?

576
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,330
Are you sobering up?

577
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,240
Yes.

578
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,280
Why are you so gentle today?

579
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,360
I’m a bit…

580
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,760
Get up.

581
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,410
Remember you are
Commandery Prince An now.

582
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,690
His Highness can’t sit like that.

583
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,480
So you are treating me
as His Highness?

584
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,480
His Highness ordered that

585
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,730
I’d cooperate with you.

586
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,210
Tell me the truth.

587
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,810
Do you lose your heart to His Highness?

588
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,520
You are not awake, right?

589
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

590
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,530
When Princess Xiping asked you
to come to Qianzhou,

591
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,570
didn’t she tell you

592
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,930
she wants you to marry His Highness?

593
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,520
You agreed to come to Qianzhou.

594
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,090
Does it mean you agree
with the marriage?

595
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,880
What are you talking about?

596
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,280
My aunt never mentioned that to me.

597
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,930
What’s more,

598
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,570
His Highness and you are my best bros.

599
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,610
Who will marry her bro?

600
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,520
You are a girl.

601
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,240
I won’t take you as my bro.

602
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,960
Shh.

603
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay. Sister and brother.

604
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,610
Sister and brother?

605
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,360
No.

606
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,400
Sisters. Will it be OK?

607
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,690
You are still drunk, aren’t you?

608
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,120
I will accept the snack. Thank you.

609
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,050
Go back to sleep quickly.

610
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,400
Sisters?

611
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,340
I don’t want to be.

612
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,140
(Jing’s Mansion)

613
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,100
(Qian)

614
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,210
Why are you sitting here alone?

615
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,120
Darling, aren’t you sleeping?

616
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,050
Do you meet any difficulties

617
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,810
or did you buy something secretly?

618
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,930
Darling, it’s no big deal.

619
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,120
Don’t bother.

620
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,480
Then forget it.

621
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,280
I also don’t want to
concern about your things.

622
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,880
I’m here

623
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,400
originally to tell you

624
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,610
how to solve the marriage

625
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,450
of Commandery Prince An and Leng Yue.

626
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,850
Anyway,

627
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,480
since you don’t want to bother,

628
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,170
I’m leaving now.

629
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,730
Hey, no, please don’t.

630
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,450
Darling.

631
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,940
Please calm your anger.

632
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,330
I’m begging you.

633
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,090
Please sit down, my darling.

634
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,530
Darling, you like the jade bracelet
with lotus on

635
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,530
from the Han palace
sold in Antique Store, right?

636
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,400
I will buy it for you tomorrow.

637
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,280
It’s been a while.

638
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,760
It must have been sold out.

639
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,730
As long as you like it,

640
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,850
it’ll be yours.

641
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,850
I will get it for you

642
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,240
no matter how.

643
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,610
That’s great.

644
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,090
Then please tell me the details.

645
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,520
You know what?

646
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,610
Nice. OK.

647
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,210
He. Chu He.

648
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,120
Forget it. Let’s go back.

649
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,690
No. We have to catch the ghost today.

650
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,360
Don’t be scared. I will protect you.

651
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,450
Is it that place?

652
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,690
That’s it.

653
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,850
Do you dare to enter?

654
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,520
Brother, please mess the pile up.

655
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,930
OK. I will take something for it.

656
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,240
Why do you do that?

657
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,640
Don’t you want me to catch the ghost?

658
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,400
Do you mean

659
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,000
the ghost is hiding here?

660
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,280
No.

661
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,970
It should be that

662
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,760
the so-called ghost is trapped in.

663
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:34,970
Chu Chu.

664
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,850
You said the house was like that

665
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,930
when the witch doctor lived here?

666
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,240
It happened when I was a child.

667
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,180
One day,

668
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,850
the house suddenly made the noise.

669
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,610
Sir Witch Doctor wasn’t scared at all.

670
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,450
I was scared at first

671
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,560
but not later after I got used to it.

672
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,880
There is no so-called ghost.

673
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,160
It’s just because it’s windy at night
in the mountainous area.

674
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,610
The wall affects the wind direction.

675
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,240
So it caused the cry.

676
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,880
Make way please.

677
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,520
He.

678
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,450
Chu He.

679
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,280
Be careful.

680
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,050
The cry disappears.

681
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,240
What’s going on?

682
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,360
Father could see it all.

683
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,610
He must have done it on purpose.

684
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,080
On purpose?

685
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,120
He, there is a interlayer.

686
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,090
Why is there something here?

687
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,850
Why is it hidden here?

688
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Did Sir Witch Doctor put it here?

689
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,070
Come on. Take it out.

690
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,330
Luckily, it’s not Sir Witch Doctor.

691
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,840
White gypsum. Charcoal. Flax.

692
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,930
Sichuan Pepper. Sawdust.

693
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,920
They are all for anticorrosion.

694
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,280
The body

695
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,850
should be preserved here
by someone deliberately.

696
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,170
Deliberately?

697
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,810
Did Sir Witch Doctor do it?

698
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,410
What for?

699
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,810
It’s iron stick for furnace lining.

700
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,170
It’ll be rainy later.

701
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,610
Let’s take the corpse in.

702
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,440
OK.

703
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,090
Chu He. Please help us.

704
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,230
Don’t move. Let Chu Chu do it.

705
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,050
I’m the coroner of Guanling County.

706
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,680
Let me do it.

707
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,050
You just drank

708
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,280
and are not awake now.

709
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,370
You even can’t control yourself
in front of your senior.

710
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,930
How can I trust you that

711
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,520
you can perform duties as a coroner?

712
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,760
He, I can do it.

713
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,330
Chu Chu. Do it.

714
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,860
(Domestic Service)

715
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,730
A tag of Palace Domestic Service.

716
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,410
Palace Domestic Service?

717
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,820
(Domestic Service)

718
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,440
Why is the belonging of the palace here?

719
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,180
The dead…

720
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,120
What’s wrong?

721
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,720
He’s neither a man nor a woman.

722
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,760
Neither a man nor a woman?

723
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,130
-Eunuch!
-Eunuch!

724
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,090
Why was here a eunuch?

725
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,920
The corpse was carefully kept.

726
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,810
It looks plump,

727
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,240
making it as it hasn’t
been dead for long.

728
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,650
Actually he died years ago.

729
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,010
This kind of corpse

730
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,170
is called wet body in out sector.

731
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,920
My grandpa said that before.

732
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,720
This is the first time I see it.

733
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,520
Can you check out the cause?

734
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,850
There are several sharp injuries.

735
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,200
The wounds are narrow.

736
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,570
The fatal injury

737
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,220
is ripping into its left chest obliquely

738
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,440
upward from the 5th rib,

739
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,330
and out of its upper left back

740
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,090
after through the heart.

741
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,680
The weapon

742
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,890
is almost a sharp, cylindric,

743
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,420
hard thing with a tine, like a…

744
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,280
Like this.

745
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,960
