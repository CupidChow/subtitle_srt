1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,640
The Prefect’s Mansion is on fire.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,760
Take me there.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,150
Once Li Zhang was into trouble,

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,310
then the people who dressed like
soldiers of the Military Commissioner

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,800
set the Prefect’s Mansion on fire.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,150
Jing Yi got poisoned and went crazy
the night he entered the military camp.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,440
I assume Duke Chang is related to it.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,630
Your Highness, it’s datura flower.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,790
Is there something hiding
about General Leng’s illness?

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,370
Chu Chu, do you still remember

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,160
the two people who tried to
kill Xu Rugui?

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,240
Yes.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,270
I remember you said after the autopsy

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,720
that they were both soldiers.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,470
Your Highness, why do you mention this?

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,790
These people are also soldiers.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Jinli found out

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,880
that before we went into
the mountain with Li Zhang,

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,910
more than 20 soldiers left the camp
to buy supplies

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,040
under Wu Chen’s order.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,120
This is exactly the number of soldiers
who showed up in the Prefect’s Mansion.

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,630
But Wu Chen doesn’t have
the power to dispatch troops.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,870
Therefore, it must be someone

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,270
very powerful behind this.

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,240
What’s more,

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,990
from the traces of the scene
in the wood house that day,

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,110
except for the Shence Army who
came to kill Xu Rugui,

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,880
there was another group of people
who wanted to capture Xu Rugui alive.

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,220
Your Highness, why do you think

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,350
it’s General Leng who sent people
to arrest Xu Rugui?

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,630
It’s just my speculation.

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,110
At this point,

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,280
if they want Xu Rugui,

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,880
it must be for his value
as a bargaining chip

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,600
instead of his identity,

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,260
I shouldn’t say
these things to bore you.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,380
It’s late. Go to bed.

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,210
I want to stay with you.

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,940
=The Imperial Coroner=

40
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,020
=Episode 29=

41
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,430
Jinyu, I’ve found out

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
that it was Hou Bin
who sent those people out

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,760
to buy herbs.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,070
They used to be bandits and they were
incorporated into the army.

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,120
Take me to him.

46
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,050
This one.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,270
My child... my child...!

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,000
Hou Bin!

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,040
Hou Bin!

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,110
Hou Bin! Hou Bin!

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,270
Get a doctor now!

52
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,800
Yes!

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,460
-Hou Bin. Hou Bin!
-My child...

54
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,350
Hang in there.

55
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,520
My child...

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,270
Hou Bin! Hou Bin!

57
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,710
Hou Bin!

58
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,020
What happened?

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,370
I’m late.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,160
He stabbed himself.

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,040
If I had come earlier,

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I could have stopped him.

63
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,990
Chu Chu.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,310
Can you find out what he just ate?

65
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,990
There is no food residue in his mouth.

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,520
I can’t tell now.

67
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,960
Have you two been guarding here?

68
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,710
Yes, Your Highness.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,600
Has anyone been here
after General Hou came back?

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,550
No.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,990
After General Hou came back
from the infirmary,

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,160
he has been staying

73
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,650
in the barracks by himself.

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,180
The two of us are keeping watch outside.

75
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,400
We never left.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,880
What’s going on here?

77
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,240
General Hou got poisoned.

78
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,270
Poisoned?

79
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,940
Chu Chu.

80
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,300
Examine his body carefully

81
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,150
and find the source of his toxins
as soon as possible.

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,560
Your Highness.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,350
General Hou’s belly

84
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,750
has been cut open by himself.

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,840
The evidence

86
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,440
may disappear in a while.

87
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,750
Can I perform an autopsy on him now?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
Autopsy?

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,350
How can you cut him

90
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,440
while his remains are scarcely cold yet?

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,630
What are you yelling about?

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,560
What are you yelling about?

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,910
Don’t you know the military rules?

94
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,350
How dare you obstruct
Commandery Prince An’s investigation?

95
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,000
Get out and take fifty floggings!

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes.

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,590
Hold on.

98
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,750
General Leng, they are not
obstructing the investigation.

99
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,030
No relatives or friends of the deceased

100
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,720
are willing to let anyone perform
an autopsy on the deceased.

101
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
But General Hou was murdered.

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
I promise I will restore his body

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,350
after the autopsy.

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,750
We’ve known our mistakes.
We are willing to be punished.

105
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,350
Take General Hou to the mortuary first,

106
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,460
then take your punishment.

107
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes.

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,680
Miss Chu, please.

109
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,540
Hou, how is your injury now?

110
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,480
When did you get injured again?

111
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,520
Just a flesh wound.

112
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,720
It doesn’t matter.

113
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,560
How does it not matter?

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,330
Isn’t it your flesh?

115
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,680
It doesn’t matter?

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,000
I heard from Wu Chen
that your injury hasn’t healed yet.

117
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,020
You are even having malignant sores.

118
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,870
You don’t even apply the ointment
Doctor Qi gave you on time.

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you trying to show how tough you are
or are you just stupid?

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,150
All right.

121
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,000
You two big men are even

122
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,370
more nagging than my wife.

123
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,750
It doesn’t look like an arrow
made by the Tang armies.

124
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,630
No, this is used by the bandits.

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,400
I was young and aggressive

126
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,310
when I just joined the army.

127
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,030
I followed Hou Bin
to suppress the bandits once.

128
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,800
I was eager to make achievements
and I fell for their trick.

129
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,560
Hou Bin got shot by many arrows
on saving me.

130
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,720
This arrow was so close to his heart

131
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,800
that he missed death by an inch.

132
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,190
I wanted to keep this arrow

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,070
to remind myself.

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,720
But he insisted on keeping it.

135
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,840
He said if I get impulsive again,

136
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,960
he will remind me with it.

137
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,560
Now I get impulsive again,

138
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,400
but he is gone.

139
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,120
General Leng valued him a lot

140
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,120
during the past year.

141
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,240
Last year, the Vice Military Commissioner
stepped down due to illness.

142
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,000
Zhao Jie should have been
promoted by seniority.

143
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,280
But Hou Bin got promoted in the end.

144
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
And I found out

145
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,800
it was him who sent those people out

146
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,070
to buy herbs.

147
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,890
Also it was him who took the bandits in.

148
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,870
So I started to suspect him.

149
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Before General Hou died...

150
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,910
My child... my child...!

151
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,750
He seemed to be saying
something about his child.

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
Do you know what that is about?

153
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,630
He should be talking about
his wife and son.

154
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,350
About three or four years ago,

155
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,310
his wife died in childbirth.

156
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
He lost his wife and his son.

157
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,680
He and his wife
loved each other very much.

158
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,030
It hit him quite hard.

159
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,950
Does it have anything
to do with his death?

160
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,460
Maybe it does.

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,560
Jinli.

162
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,800
Does General Hou also play dung beetles?

163
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,470
It’s a folk prescription
in the southwest.

164
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,680
Dung beetles in honey

165
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,590
with some vinegar.

166
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
It’s for treating malignant sores.

167
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,910
We use it a lot in the army.

168
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,510
Is there anything wrong with it?

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,830
General Zhao.

170
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,950
There is blood on your hand.

171
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,660
It’s fine.

172
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,510
I guess I got it from General Zhao

173
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,780
when we were standing together.

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,320
Prepare some water. I’ll take a bath.

175
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,560
Yes.

176
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,400
Your Highness.

177
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,030
The new wound on
General Hou’s abdomen was the one

178
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,350
(Autopsy Report)
that he cut from left to right

179
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,430
with his right hand holding a knife.

180
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,150
But that wound

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
is different from a normal one.

182
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,510
What’s the difference?

183
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
Whether it’s cut by others
or by oneself,

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,320
that person will feel pain

185
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,910
when his flesh is cut.

186
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,150
And he will dodge

187
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,680
when he feels pain.

188
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,900
The wound will vary in depth.

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,900
Especially when you cut yourself.

190
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,230
No matter how tough you are,

191
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,910
you will use less strength
because of the pain.

192
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,030
The wound is deep when you insert the
sword but shallow when you draw it out.

193
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,070
Bur General Hou’s wound is different.

194
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,280
There is almost no change
in the depth of his wound.

195
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,800
As if he couldn’t feel pain.

196
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,760
Yes.

197
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,880
Did he do something else

198
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,470
after he cut open his abdomen,

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,560
as if he was looking for

200
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,840
something in his abdomen

201
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,680
and trying to take it out?

202
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,500
Your Highness, how do you know that?

203
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I couldn’t believe it at first.

204
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,760
But I checked it many times.

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,510
His viscera are in a mess.

206
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,640
He reached in and pulled them around.

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,510
Chu Chu, does General Hou

208
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,390
have malignant sores?

209
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,590
Yes.

210
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,980
There are many marks
of old wounds on his body.

211
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,320
Especially the one
that runs through his chest.

212
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,510
It hasn’t fully healed.

213
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,200
Looks like he relapsed many times.

214
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,250
There are two malignant sores
at his back

215
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,340
around the perforating wound.

216
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,910
It was treated sloppily.

217
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,760
There was a sour smell on the surface

218
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,520
with some fine powder.

219
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,190
I guess he used a folk prescription

220
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,570
in Qianzhou.

221
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,970
The prescription of
dung beetles in honey?

222
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,570
You even know the folk prescription
in the southwest?

223
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,320
You are so good.

224
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,640
It’s just my speculation.

225
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,680
Chu Chu, did the three dead soldiers

226
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
also have malignant sores on them?

227
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,250
I can’t tell from the man

228
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,690
who burned himself.

229
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,340
But there are malignant sores on the men

230
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,180
who were drowned and strangled to death.

231
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,050
Did they also use this prescription?

232
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
The drowned soldier was submerged.

233
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,610
I can’t tell if he used it.

234
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,420
But the strangled soldier’s wound

235
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,490
is broken.

236
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,980
Obviously he used it.

237
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,690
Your Highness, what’s wrong?

238
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,860
Is there any problem?

239
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,190
No, that’s right.

240
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,200
I know how they were poisoned.

241
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,490
You’d better stay quiet.

242
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,100
Something happened tonight.

243
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,780
No one has time to take care of you.

244
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,010
You are not like

245
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,100
Xiao Jinyu’s people at all.

246
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,300
I did it for your own good.

247
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,230
After everything is over,

248
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,530
I will release you.

249
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,840
You are a rebel!

250
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,310
You know nothing about it.

251
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,370
Did you see that?

252
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,630
My life is coming to an end.

253
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,150
What I went through these troubles for?

254
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I did it all for you,

255
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,450
for the Leng clan!

256
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:51,950
Bah!

257
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,010
The Leng clan has been guarding
the Southwest for Tang

258
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,900
for generations and we are
brave and loyal.

259
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,490
If it wasn’t for your greed for power,

260
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,130
how would the Emperor grant
a marriage to me and Xiao Jinli?

261
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,570
All these years I’ve been

262
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,660
trying to escape from such a fate.

263
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,320
Now you are saying you did it for me

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,270
and for the Leng clan.

265
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
I will never believe you.

266
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
The Leng clan will never believe you!

267
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
You can kill me now,

268
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,270
or after I untie the ropes,

269
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,910
I will kill you by myself

270
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,350
even to be blamed as
the black sheep of our family!

271
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,030
Fine.

272
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,560
I’ll give you what you want!

273
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,350
General Leng!

274
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,510
What are you doing?

275
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,860
Your Highness.

276
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,810
Chu Chu.

277
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,710
Get up.

278
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,700
This is my family affair.

279
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,170
It’s none of your concern.

280
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,440
There is no family affair between us.

281
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,270
Commandery Prince An,
do you need anything?

282
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,880
I didn’t see Leng Yue

283
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,490
and I was a little worried.

284
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,030
I was going to see Wu Chen,
the secretary

285
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,640
in charge of military supplies,
and ask him a few questions.

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
I passed by

287
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,170
and vaguely heard Leng Yue’s voice.

288
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,390
So I came here to have a look.

289
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,350
Your Highness.

290
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,470
I asked him why he concealed
his illness from the court.

291
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,940
He knocked me out with his hand

292
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,980
and tied me up.

293
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,350
He said he will release me

294
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,320
after everything is over.

295
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,350
Your Highness.

296
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,560
General Leng, it’s your family affair

297
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,710
and it’s about your military business,

298
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,680
I shouldn’t ask too much.

299
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,200
But considering what happened tonight,

300
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,240
to avoid misunderstanding,

301
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
I want to ask you one question.

302
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,880
Did you really not

303
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,510
report your illness to the court?

304
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,350
What do you mean?

305
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,270
You may not know

306
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,240
that the Minister of War,
Feng Jie, was murdered

307
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
when he arrived in Chang’an.

308
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,280
There was a special volume

309
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,830
of inspection notes missing.

310
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,710
What?

311
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,110
After I learned about your condition,

312
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,260
I asked Jinli about it

313
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,470
and he remembered

314
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,270
that you once talked
to Minister Feng alone

315
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,830
for half a day during his inspection.

316
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,470
That’s right.

317
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,030
I did tell my condition

318
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,590
to Feng Jie on that day.

319
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,760
It concerns

320
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,470
the military power in the Southwest

321
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,350
and the future of the Leng family
after my death.

322
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,560
It also concerns the safety

323
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,950
of the Southwest border in Tang.

324
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,320
I know how important it is.

325
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,470
I’ve discussed with Feng Jie

326
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,760
that I would keep my condition a secret

327
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,350
so as to stabilize the military spirit

328
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,880
and prevent the bandits from
creating a disturbance in the Southwest.

329
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,400
Feng Jie would write down my condition

330
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,970
and present it to His Majesty in person

331
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,240
to come up with a good solution.

332
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,870
I didn’t know Feng Jie died so suddenly

333
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,440
as he arrived in Chang’an.

334
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,390
I didn’t receive any imperial edict.

335
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,510
I thought His Majesty

336
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,600
would appoint a new Minister of War

337
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,480
and that’s why Xue Rucheng

338
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,600
came to Qianzhou.

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,440
But he didn’t set foot in my camp.

340
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,230
He just returned to Chang’an like that.

341
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,430
So there were several
mysterious deaths in the camp

342
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,290
when I asked Leng Yue to send you
a letter and greet you.

343
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,560
It was such a coincidence.

344
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,580
No wonder you got suspicious.

345
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,200
Then you sent me a letter
and invite me to investigate the case

346
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,990
to find out if I’m up to other things

347
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,990
and to make sure
Leng Yue is safe, right?

348
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,870
You want me to find out the fact,

349
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,890
but you don’t trust me that much.

350
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,910
So you are not going to
tell me the truth.

351
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,390
But Leng Yue acted impulsively

352
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,910
and had a fight with you.

353
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,910
You had no choice

354
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,360
but to keep her in your barracks

355
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,270
to keep her safe
after everything becomes clear.

356
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,630
Am I right?

357
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,320
You are smart indeed.

358
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,320
General Leng, is the moxa stick yours?

359
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,260
Yes.

360
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,320
I had rheumatism once.

361
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Nothing worked.

362
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
The doctor asked me to burn moxa stick

363
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,620
and keep using it.

364
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,140
Although the rheumatism
can’t be totally cured,

365
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,010
at least it can alleviate the pain.

366
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,740
Your Highness,
there is something wrong with the moxie.

367
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,320
What’s wrong?

368
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,630
This moxa is a little darker
than the normal moxa.

369
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,580
And there is a strange smell.

370
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,650
Let me take a look.

371
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,800
There is cinnabar in it.

372
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,200
Cinnabar?

373
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
This moxa is mixed with cinnabar.

374
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
The burning cinnabar is poisonous.

375
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,630
It’s hard to be noticed

376
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,030
while being mixed in the moxa.

377
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,360
Grandpa, there is a reason
that you became ill.

378
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,960
It’s because of the moxa.

379
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,960
Where did you get the moxa?

380
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,840
Wu Chen.

381
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,350
It’s still warm. He just left.

382
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,480
Soldiers.

383
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,230
Yes.

384
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,270
Pass down my order.

385
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,630
Guard all the entrances and the exits.

386
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
Search every corner of the camp.

387
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,720
You must find Wu Chen out.

388
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,360
Yes.

389
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,800
General Leng.

390
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,270
Are you sure that Wu Chen

391
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,440
gave the moxa to you?

392
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,270
Yes.

393
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,130
Are you looking for the evidence

394
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
that he tried to kill me?

395
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,270
I’m here to find the evidence
that he poisoned the soldiers.

396
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,780
He poisoned the soldiers?

397
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,700
Did he kill Hou Bin?

398
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,230
I’m afraid he is responsible for

399
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,030
the recent events in the army.

400
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
What a bold bastard!

401
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,880
If I get him,

402
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,100
I will skin him alive.

403
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,780
Jinyu.

404
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
I’ve found it out.

405
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,270
Feng Li who strangled himself

406
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,990
has someone in his family
who also hanged himself.

407
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,680
Wang Chi, who drowned himself,

408
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,200
has some relatives drowned

409
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,130
in a flood in his hometown.

410
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,920
And General Xu who rushed into the fire,

411
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,750
his old house caught fire

412
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,440
and his mother died in flames.

413
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,390
The three of them
are just like General Hou.

414
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,390
They were away from home when something
happened to their loved ones.

415
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,800
They had been feeling guilty.

416
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,030
Your Highness, this was found
in the ashes of the incense burner.

417
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,390
Show it to me.

418
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,630
Your Highness, this is the powder
made from the seeds of datura flower.

419
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,800
General Leng.

420
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,870
This is what makes
the soldiers in the camp

421
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,560
go crazy for no reason.

422
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,870
Wu Chen used it as a drug enhancer

423
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,210
which can make the victims
see illusions.

424
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,180
These illusions are associated with

425
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,560
the long suppressed painful
experiences of the victims.

426
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,480
As long as the murderer knows enough
about these people’s experiences,

427
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,800
he can guess what kind of illusions

428
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,030
they will see when the poison
starts to work.

429
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
Then he can design
the way they kill themselves.

430
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,560
How did he do it?

431
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
I thought about it at first

432
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,270
that maybe someone used poison.

433
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
We used a lot of methods

434
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,870
to ensure the safety of food
and drinking water in the army.

435
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,110
Where else could he put the poison in?

436
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,230
He mixed the datura flower powder

437
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,980
in the medicine for
treating malignant sores.

438
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,660
(Sterculia lychnophora)

439
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,840
Those who have malignant sores

440
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,510
will be poisoned when they apply it.

441
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,910
Commandery Prince An
and I have checked it.

442
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,630
All the soldiers who have gone crazy

443
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,640
all had malignant sores

444
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,720
and they all used the same prescription

445
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,800
to treat the malignant sore.

446
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,870
But Jing...

447
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,160
But Dog doesn’t have
any malignant sores.

448
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,680
How did he get poisoned?

449
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,270
He doesn’t have malignant sores.

450
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,520
But he touched

451
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,990
the most critical ingredient
for treating malignant sores.

452
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,620
What?

453
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,700
The living dung beetles
raised in the infirmary.

454
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,740
Dung beetles?

455
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,000
Chu Chu and I have
checked the infirmary.

456
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,420
I think Wu Chen

457
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,650
mixed the datura powder

458
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,620
into the baked dung beetle powder

459
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,740
when he counted the crude drugs.

460
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,700
Because the jar of dung beetle powder

461
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,100
was next to the jar of
living dung beetles,

462
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,380
some powder floated into
the jar of the living dung beetles.

463
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,520
Dog accidentally got
some powder on his hand

464
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,580
during the dung beetle race
with the wounded soldiers

465
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,430
without knowing it.

466
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,860
I guess he got excited and then

467
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,610
he just took the water and drank it.

468
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,770
That’s how he got poisoned.

469
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,340
The seeds of datura flower
are hard to get.

470
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,530
There are tight restrictions on
entering and leaving the camp.

471
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,890
I asked Jinli to check the records.

472
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,770
The only person who touched
the jar of dung beetle powder

473
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,890
and is able to

474
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,050
bring the datura flower powder
back to the camp

475
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,140
is Wu Chen in charge of
military supplies.

476
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
Your Highness, please check this out.

477
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,520
Your Highness, this is the kind of
moxa used by my grandpa.

478
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,600
The moxa should be

479
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,980
brought here in a whole box.

480
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,380
The moxa sticks
in General Leng’s barracks

481
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,260
can only cover three or four days.

482
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes.

483
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,170
These moxa sticks

484
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,320
are not enough to replenish a whole box.

485
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,700
According to Jinli,

486
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,540
those who left to buy supplies

487
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,650
won’t be back in ten days,

488
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,060
which means

489
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,600
Wu Chen didn’t plan to
keep poisoning you.

490
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,220
Did he stop because he knew

491
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,500
we were coming here?

492
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,460
No.

493
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,260
General Leng, I was taking
a bath in my barracks.

494
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,220
Sorry I’m late.

495
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,530
Take your men to search for Wu Chen.

496
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,700
You must find him out

497
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,650
before dawn.

498
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,170
Search for Wu Chen? What’s wrong?

499
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,890
Hurry up!

500
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,520
Yes.

501
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,170
Hold on.

502
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,900
General Zhao, please remind the soldiers

503
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,210
that he might dress up as a soldier

504
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
and blend in the search team.

505
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,650
Got it.

506
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,580
All these soldiers

507
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,980
even can’t find a civil official.

508
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,380
Can he fly or go under the ground?

509
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,930
General Leng, one night has been passed.

510
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,810
I think they have searched
all the places in the camp

511
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,460
where he can hide himself.

512
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,260
General Leng,

513
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,220
please order your men

514
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,260
to pay attention to the places

515
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,100
where only the dead can stay.

516
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,740
You mean

517
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,380
Wu Chen is dead?

518
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,530
If he hasn’t escaped from the army,

519
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,530
and he isn’t among the soldiers,

520
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,620
then there is only one possibility left.

521
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,130
General Leng, Commandery Prince An.

522
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,340
We have found Wu Chen.

523
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,740
General Leng, Commandery Prince An.

524
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,550
These two cooks found
Wu Chen’s body in the well

525
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,580
when they went to
draw water this morning.

526
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,810
Has anyone been here before?

527
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,930
I have asked them.

528
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,170
They were searching all night.

529
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,980
Countless people

530
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,170
passed here.

531
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,340
The footprints are messy.

532
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,410
The bottoms of their shoes are the same.

533
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,500
We can’t tell anything.

534
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,220
The deceased male is over 30.

535
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,410
His mouth and eyes are slightly open.
There is a swelling on his abdomen.

536
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,770
There are bruises caused by struggling.

537
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,650
There is foam in his nose and mouth.

538
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,120
(Nasal cavity Oral cavity)
He was drowned.

539
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,460
But his body has been soaked in water,

540
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,500
it’s hard to determine
the exact time of his death.

541
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,260
I assume

542
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,340
he died between one to five a.m.

543
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,700
Between one and five?

544
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,740
That’s when Hou Bin died

545
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,100
and we were searching for him.

546
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,470
Could he jump into the well
in desperation

547
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,170
when we were looking for him?

548
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,580
He might be holding this rope

549
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,260
and hiding in the well.

550
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,500
He didn’t expect that we would
search for him all night.

551
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,660
He lost his strength gradually.

552
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,860
So he fell into the well
and got drowned.

553
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,980
This place is not close to the three
entrances and exits of the camp.

554
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,860
And it’s not on the way

555
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,290
from his barracks to the exit.

556
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,740
Even when he was fleeing from us,

557
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,650
he shouldn’t hide here.

558
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,890
Are you suspecting

559
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,530
that Wu Chen was murdered?

560
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,410
Chu Chu.

561
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,100
Perform a thorough autopsy on him.

562
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,010
Go ahead and do what you need to do.

563
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,340
I’ll sign the approval paper for you.

564
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,260
Okay.

565
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,260
But, Your Highness.

566
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,720
I need something first.

567
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,720
Miss Chu, just tell us what you need.

568
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,380
As long as we have it,

569
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,980
we will give it to you.

570
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,580
Thank you, General Leng.

571
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,020
I need green onion, pepper, salt,

572
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,480
white plum, lees, vinegar.

573
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,220
one garlic mortar and two mats.

574
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,500
Please find an open space
in the camp for me.

575
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,770
I need to dig a two-meter pit

576
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,830
and burn some firewood in the pit.

577
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,860
Are you going to cook?

578
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,380
I want to braise him.

579
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,170
Chu Chu, are you going to eat him?

580
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,260
No, no.

581
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,340
I’m not going to eat him.

582
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,030
Braising him

583
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,140
with my method

584
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:30,980
can let us know

585
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,250
if he jumped into the well by himself.

586
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,290
General Leng, Chu Chu
is from a family of coroners.

587
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,130
She often uses some unusual

588
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,290
but really useful methods.

589
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,170
I think you should let her try it.

590
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,740
Cooks.

591
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,580
Yes!

592
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,220
Bring the stuff Miss Chu needs.

593
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,020
Yes.

594
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,270
Thank you. General Leng.

595
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,190
Zhao Jie. Jinli.

596
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,060
Yes.

597
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,050
Do whatever Miss Chu says.

598
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:01,810
Yes.

599
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,260
Leng Yue, stay here and help Chu Chu.

600
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,030
Okay.

601
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,460
Commandery Prince An.

602
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,860
Can we talk in your room?

603
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,890
General Leng, please.

604
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,580
Please.

605
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,140
(Jiangshan Hall)

606
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,910
You’ve read the memorial of
Commandery Prince An.

607
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,250
The Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang,
has been brought to justice.

608
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,090
But Commandery Prince An thinks

609
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,130
Li Zhang is not the main culprit

610
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,180
behind the illegal minting of coins.

611
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,210
What do you think?

612
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,260
(Memorial)

613
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,050
I think what Commandery Prince An
said is reasonable.

614
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,980
Minister Wang.

615
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,770
What Commandery Prince An
wrote in the memorial,

616
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,000
except for the arrest of Li Zhang,

617
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,810
the evidence of the rest of the events

618
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,810
has all been destroyed.

619
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,410
It can just be his side of story.

620
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,220
How is it reasonable?

621
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,390
Your Majesty, I think

622
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,630
Commandery Prince An
is putting himself off

623
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,580
and fooling you.

624
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,760
Now he went to the camp of
the Military Commissioner of Qianzhou

625
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,960
in the name of investigating the case.

626
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,160
He is meddling in military affairs

627
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,600
and acting beyond his authority.

628
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,980
Minister Han.

629
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,560
When I went to the Southwest,

630
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,670
Commandery Prince An
mentioned this case to me.

631
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,770
The case of illegal minting
of coins is really complicated.

632
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,980
It’s understandable
that Commandery Prince An

633
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,580
couldn’t make it clear for the moment.

634
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,980
Minister Xue, you two
are really interesting.

635
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,860
You are his teacher

636
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,700
and the head of the Ministry of War.

637
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,700
You were ordered to go to the Southwest
to inspect military affairs.

638
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,700
You found out nothing
about the military affairs.

639
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,900
But now you are meddling in the affairs
of the Three Judicial Offices.

640
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,330
Commandery Prince An is the head
of the Three Judicial Offices.

641
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,850
There is no end of his investigation
of the illegal minting of coins.

642
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,720
Now he is meddling in
the military affairs of the Southwest.

643
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,900
The both of you acted beyond
your authority.

644
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Does Commandery Prince An

645
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,780
have a bad influence on
his noble teacher

646
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,980
or do you mislead your clever student?

647
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,660
Commandery Prince An only mentioned

648
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,300
a few words about the illegal minting
when we were chatting.

649
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,580
As for why he went to
General Leng’s army,

650
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,890
I believe he will give us
an explanation.

651
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,190
General Leng has always
ruled his army rigorously.

652
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,480
He won’t let others lay a hand on
the military affairs that easily.

653
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,780
You are so interested in the affairs
of the Three Judicial Offices,

654
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,970
then you should bring back
the survived rebels.

655
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,420
But you didn’t bring back

656
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,580
the person you should bring back,

657
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,660
you even lost the person
you shouldn’t bring back.

658
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,850
Commandery Prince An was ordered to
investigate the illegal minting case.

659
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,370
Now it turns out like this.

660
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,970
Shouldn’t he thank his teacher for that?

661
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,790
The illegal minting of coins
has always been a major case.

662
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,740
Commandery Prince An has
the right to act at his discretion,

663
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,580
but he went to the Southwest this time
to look for his father.

664
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,860
He didn’t take much luggage
and many attendants.

665
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,050
Maybe he just needs some help.

666
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,700
Ask the Military Commissioner for help?

667
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
What does he want to do?

668
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,560
The Commandery Prince entered the camp
of the Military Commissioner in private.

669
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,030
Minister Xue, you’ve taught

670
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,940
a wonderful student.

671
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,160
Minister Xue is the teacher
of Commandery Prince An.

672
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,220
It’s normal that they

673
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,510
mentioned a few words
about official business

674
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,560
when they were chatting.

675
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,620
But what Minister Han said

676
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,960
is true.

677
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,050
There is no solid evidence
in the memorial.

678
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,130
No matter what,

679
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,410
Li Zhang is still a prefect of a state.

680
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,570
Even he wants to arrest him,

681
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,740
he should have irrefutable proof.

682
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,980
Right now,

683
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,150
Commandery Prince An
couldn’t find out the truth.

684
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,690
So he claimed that there is
someone else behind Li Zhang.

685
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,980
He is smart indeed.

686
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,810
Minister Xue, am I right?

687
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,170
Your Majesty.

688
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,400
Commandery Prince An failed in his task,
made decisions without authorization,

689
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,990
deceived his superior and subordinates,
intervened in military affairs

690
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,320
and acted beyond his authority.

691
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,800
He should be taken back
to Chang’an and be punished.

692
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,870
Minister Jing.

693
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,720
What do you think?

694
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,360
I think

695
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,320
there is another possibility that why

696
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,440
Commandery Prince An only
mentioned his speculation

697
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,990
but not any solid evidence.

698
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,080
It’s not because
there is no real evidence.

699
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,330
Commandery Prince An worries
that some treacherous men

700
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,060
might take the letter away
and it will cause unnecessary troubles.

701
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,390
Commandery Prince An has always been
thoughtful and cautious.

702
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,110
Your Majesty, I think you can
order him to come back first.

703
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,140
After Commandery Prince An
returns to Chang’an,

704
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,060
if there is no real evidence

705
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,320
to prove his speculation
in this memorial,

706
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,400
you can punish him at that time.

707
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,870
Yes, Senior Jing has a point.

708
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,560
Your Majesty, I think
what Senior Jing said is reasonable.

709
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,590
If you are going to punish
Commandery Prince An,

710
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,160
you should punish him
after he returns to Chang’an.

711
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,320
Your Majesty, I also agree with
what Senior Jing said.

712
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,320
All right, let me think about it.

713
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,750
You can leave now.

714
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,920
Yes, Your Majesty.
