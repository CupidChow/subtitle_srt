1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,270
Jing Yi pretended to be a wounded
soldier and entered the infirmary.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,230
With his secret inquiry
and our public investigation,

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,710
we will find out the truth.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,000
I don’t believe

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,520
these people committed suicide
because they were

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,120
(Neck)

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,470
(Strangulation marks)
possessed by evil spirits.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,620
(Broken hyoid bone)

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,790
Nonsense!

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,200
I think probably he is
behind the whole thing.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,680
What is he up to

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,310
(List)

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,470
to get Commandery Prince An here?

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Does he want to kill him?

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,590
Although he is in charge of
buying supplies,

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,200
he has no power to deploy troops.

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,240
He reports these things to General Leng.

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,630
General Leng will use his discretion
and assign the task to next person.

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,850
He can’t decide

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,950
who will be sent out.

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,950
What about the other thing?

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,950
I’ve asked about it.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
While I was away,

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,880
some soldiers left the base.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,840
Did they go back home?

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,880
They are deserters.

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,630
In fact, those people
are not really soldiers.

28
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,710
They were bandits
incorporated into the army.

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,600
When we send troops
to suppress the bandits,

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,480
normally we won’t kill them

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,840
unless they commit any felony

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,350
or resist desperately.

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,070
As long as they surrender,

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,600
they will be incorporated into the army

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,560
and be trained to replenish troops.

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,840
Most of the bandits
know some skills to fight.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,960
It’s much easier to train them

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,880
than to train those farmers.

39
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,390
Those who escaped

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,240
were taken in in this way.

41
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,030
Do you still remember their looks?

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,310
I don’t have much impression of them.

43
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,880
Hou Bin led the troops

44
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,350
during the battle
when they were taken in.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,030
After they were captured,

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,880
they were trained by Hou Bin.

47
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,200
How long have they been
trained in the base

48
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,310
before they escaped?

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,630
Less than four months.

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,070
Less than four months?

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,880
They were only trained for
less than four months

52
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,710
and they just escaped?

53
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,670
Yes.

54
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,390
The first six months is the easiest time

55
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,390
for them to escape.

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,480
After all, being a soldier is not
as unrestrained as being a bandit.

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,320
Well, is there any problem?

58
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,820
=Episode 28=

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,640
Yue.

61
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,630
Why are you here?

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,670
Did you get hurt?

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,000
Kid.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,110
I won’t be disabled.
And I won’t bother you anyway.

65
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,320
You... You...

66
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,440
You... You...

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,070
How can you talk to
your grandpa in this way?

68
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,760
Can you grow up?

69
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,070
Your Highness, Miss Leng
presents herself.

70
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,140
Let her in.

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Yes.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,270
Your Highness.

73
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,920
I found something
in that man’s barracks.

74
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,800
You went to General Leng’s barracks?

75
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,830
How did you get in?

76
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,940
(Has the chivalry of the Leng clan...)

77
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,040
Jinli.

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,400
I need you to check one thing for me.

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
(Jing’s Mansion)

80
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,440
Master, our man monitoring
Princess Xiping’s Mansion

81
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,720
came back and reported

82
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,030
that Banxia stopped
Zhou Han’s carriage at the gate.

83
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,840
It looked like she was looking for
someone but didn’t find them.

84
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,190
What’s the news in the Palace?

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,960
Our men reported earlier

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
that they have found out

87
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,870
who are looking for the former servants

88
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,030
of Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Qin Luan made the order.

90
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,310
They not only investigated the former
servants of Princess Xiping’s Mansion,

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,840
but also nosed into the rumors

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,000
after Princess Xiping gave birth

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,030
to twins.

94
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,070
Rumors?

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Why would Qin Luan

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
look into these things?

97
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,880
Keep a close eye on Qin Luan these days.

98
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,590
Let me know if you have any news.

99
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,870
Yes, Master.

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,550
The good news
that you will be promoted to

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,830
the general director
in charge of palace affairs

102
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,320
spread far and wide.

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,640
Everyone is sending
their congratulations.

104
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,600
Take a look.

105
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,040
There are too many gifts to be counted.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,070
These people respect you a lot.

107
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,520
Look at this.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
This is from the Antique Store.

109
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,800
The Antique Store also sent a gift?

110
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,590
You went to their place in person

111
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,520
a few days ago.

112
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,050
They must think
you are their protector now.

113
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,650
Then they nerved themselves
to send you a gift.

114
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,020
It must be a big gift.

115
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,300
(Birthday)
It’s this one.

116
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,860
A bronze Ruyi?

117
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,420
What?

118
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,900
Master, he sent you a bronze Ruyi.

119
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,420
What does this mean?

120
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,860
Bronze Ruyi...

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
(Birthday)

122
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,180
(Swan geese fly by, the red sun rising
above the water. Waiting for...)

123
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,310
Didn’t you see what’s engraved on it?

124
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,570
There are two words missing.

125
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,340
Take a look.

126
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,800
Swan geese fly by, the red sun
rising above the water.

127
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,210
Waiting for Rukui...

128
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,930
I don’t understand.

129
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,370
What Rukui?

130
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,340
It’s Rugui.

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,710
(Waiting for...)
Don’t you see two words are missing?

132
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,090
The Antique Store sent this to me

133
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,180
to let me know

134
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,370
that they have Xu Rugui.

135
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,530
If I want Xu Rugui,

136
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,930
I need to see him soon.

137
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,900
Xu Rugui is in the Antique Store?

138
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,300
Doesn’t that mean they...?

139
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
A bronze Ruyi.

140
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,770
What an implication.

141
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,230
It’s time to meet these little brats.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,740
What’s the situation in the infirmary?

143
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,900
Those wounded soldiers are just pawns.

144
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,490
They guessed more than
what they really know.

145
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,580
Fortunately, when I

146
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,250
played beetles rolling balls with them,

147
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,620
I got some news.

148
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,620
The first person went crazy in the army

149
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,210
is a wounded soldier in the infirmary.

150
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,800
Wounded soldier...

151
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,290
How is that wounded soldier doing now?

152
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,210
He is basically recovered now.

153
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,100
I also sounded him out.

154
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,100
He really doesn’t remember anything.

155
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,020
He insisted that he met something evil.

156
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,140
Is there anything else?

157
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,660
The rumors about evil spirits

158
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,160
were spread out from the infirmary.

159
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,780
These wounded soldiers
have nothing to do.

160
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,610
This bunch of dudes

161
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,100
are really garrulous.

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,610
After you go back this time,

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,810
remember to inquire about
another person.

164
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,020
Who?

165
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,870
Wu Chen.

166
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,170
Wu Chen? The officer
in charge of military supplies?

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,630
Yes.

168
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,220
Why do you want to investigate him?

169
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,060
Your Highness, there is
an urgent letter from Chang’an.

170
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,660
(Qin Luan caught two maids dismissed
from Princess Xiping’s Mansion long ago)

171
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,020
What’s wrong? Is there
any trouble in Chang’an?

172
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,490
There must be some trouble.

173
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,370
But I don’t know
what kind of trouble it is.

174
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,450
What do you mean?

175
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,460
Qin Luan somehow

176
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,780
caught two maids dismissed from

177
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,300
Princess Xiping’s Mansion
in the early years.

178
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,300
Wu Jiang worried something bad would
happen in Princess Xiping’s Mansion,

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,540
so he observed for a few days

180
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,290
and found out Senior Jing
is secretly investigating

181
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,100
the things happening
during Princess Xiping’s pregnancy.

182
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,170
During Princess Xiping’s pregnancy?

183
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,980
Why would he investigate that?

184
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,730
Chu Chu, have you found anything special

185
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,370
after the autopsies
of these three bodies?

186
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,420
I don’t know if it’s special.

187
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,180
After the autopsies,

188
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,370
I found out the drowned
breathed in more water

189
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,420
and the burnt dead inhaled in more ash

190
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,860
than an average dead person would do,

191
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,810
but not as much as a living person.

192
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,900
You mean...

193
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,780
They were neither dead

194
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,300
or alive before they died.

195
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,100
Yes. That’s what I want to say.

196
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,740
Neither dead nor alive...

197
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,050
I think they can be
called living corpses.

198
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,280
A living corpse like me?

199
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,610
No.

200
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,900
Let me put it in this way.

201
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,490
If a person is thrown into

202
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,810
the water or fire after he is dead,

203
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,780
he isn’t breathing

204
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,010
and he can’t inhale in anything.

205
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,470
But a living person is different.

206
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,340
He needs to breathe.

207
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,810
He struggles when he tries to breathe,

208
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,810
which will make him breathe in more.

209
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,100
But these two people are different.

210
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,420
Although they breathed in
things before they died,

211
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,420
the amount they breathed in

212
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,130
is much less than a normal person.

213
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,130
If you want me to describe
what kind of state they were in,

214
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,660
they should be breathing normally

215
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,220
until they died.

216
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,930
Is there anything suspicious

217
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,810
about the man who strangled himself?

218
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,860
Feng Li is the strangest one.

219
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,210
Generally speaking,

220
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,200
it’s hard to strangle yourself,

221
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,640
especially in the way he did.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,910
He wrapped a belt around his neck

223
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,880
and his hands took

224
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,350
each of the ends.

225
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,200
It’s even harder to
strangle himself in this way.

226
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,760
Because once a person is strangled
to a certain degree,

227
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,670
he won’t be able to
breathe because of the pain.

228
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,550
Then he won’t have that much strength.

229
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,440
He can only strangle himself to death

230
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,000
if he pulls it really hard at first.

231
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,030
But that’s not Feng Li’s situation.

232
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,880
From the strangulation marks
on his neck and palm,

233
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,710
and the fragmentation of his throat,

234
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,590
he didn’t strangle himself
to death at once.

235
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,680
He used the same strength

236
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
until he strangled himself to death.

237
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,590
You are saying

238
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,150
these three people

239
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,830
were in a state of extreme pain

240
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,880
without knowing it?

241
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, exactly.

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,150
What did they eat before they died?

243
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,390
Just normal meals.

244
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,440
Nothing special.

245
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,440
Your Highness.

246
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,080
I don’t believe there is any
evil spirit in this world.

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,620
But I’ve never seen or heard

248
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,890
anyone who died

249
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,830
like the way they did.

250
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,110
Were they really possessed by
some evil spirits?

251
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,690
Well? Are you scared?

252
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,670
Who is scared? I’m not scared.

253
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,270
Even if they were possessed,

254
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,780
you can handle the living part,
I’ll handle the dead part.

255
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,000
As for those who are neither dead
nor alive, we will handle it together.

256
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,030
I don’t believe

257
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,230
there is anything in the world
that we can’t handle.

258
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,800
If you are scared,

259
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,140
you can sleep at my place tonight.

260
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,020
I think I’m going to read

261
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,580
the statements sent by
Hou Bin till dawn.

262
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,020
Rest assured to sleep at my place.

263
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,020
I won’t bother you.

264
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,960
I’ll read it with you.

265
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,780
Your Highness, something happened
to Vice Minister Jing.

266
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,700
What?

267
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,340
Take me to him now.

268
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,020
Yes.

269
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,800
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

270
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,420
Go!

271
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,660
I’ll kill you!

272
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,610
I’ll kill you!

273
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,410
Kill!

274
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,900
Put the sword down.

275
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,610
I’ll kill you!

276
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,950
What’s happening here?

277
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,930
Go away!

278
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,850
Are you crazy?

279
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,700
What happened?

280
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,690
What’s the situation?

281
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,220
General, this Qianzhou’s soldier
also went crazy.

282
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
He is just like
the previous mad soldiers.

283
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,640
His pulse is fine.

284
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,640
Good.

285
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,460
Leng Yue, do you have any method

286
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,730
to wake him up as soon as possible?

287
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,580
Yes, acupuncture will do.

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,900
Take him to my place.

289
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,220
I have something to ask him.

290
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,540
Someone, take him away!

291
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,560
Come on.

292
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,610
Come on.

293
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,220
If you don’t mind,

294
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,370
can I go with you?

295
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,370
General Leng, please.

296
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,540
Please.

297
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,020
Why are you still standing here?

298
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
It’s not the first time
you saw something like this.

299
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,930
We got Commandery Prince An here.

300
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
He will find out the truth soon.

301
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,730
Act like brave men!

302
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
If other people know it,

303
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,370
they will mock us for

304
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,980
being afraid of a little mad soldier

305
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,660
of Qianzhou.

306
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,290
Well...

307
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,270
Don’t you hear it?

308
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,510
Go back to your place!

309
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,140
Just leave!

310
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

311
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,140
Doctor Qi.

312
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,240
Clean this up.

313
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,780
What’s more,

314
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,410
hurry up and

315
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,710
make a list for me.

316
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,900
Yes.

317
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,780
If you need any drug,

318
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,340
I will order them to buy it.

319
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,140
Yes.

320
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,020
I’ll go to work.

321
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,380
Okay. Take care.

322
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,460
Master.

323
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,100
(Vice Minister Jing entered the base
with Commandery Prince An)

324
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,750
Jing Yi went to
Leng Peishan’s army with them.

325
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,900
It’s said

326
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,220
that weird things happened
in the base of Military Commissioner.

327
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,050
There were soldiers and generals

328
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,850
committing suicide in public
one after another.

329
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,860
Leng Peishan wrote a letter
and invited Young Master Jing

330
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,250
and Commandery Prince An there
to investigate it.

331
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,380
Looks like Xue Rucheng’s trip
to the Southwest

332
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,980
disturbed Leng Peishan.

333
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,340
He took a step ahead.

334
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,130
Well, Young Master Jing and they...

335
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,010
Commandery Prince An never acted rashly.

336
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,410
Since he dared to go there

337
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,220
with Jing Yi and his people,

338
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,460
he must have his own reason.

339
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,340
We need to trust them.

340
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,380
Tell our people in the Southwest

341
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,100
that if Jing Yi has any order,

342
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,580
they don’t need to
report it back to Chang’an,

343
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,130
just do what he says.

344
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,010
Yes, Master.

345
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,980
I need to think about it carefully.

346
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,890
It won’t take long before

347
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,890
the court knows
Commandery Prince An’s visit

348
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,770
to Leng Peishan’s army.

349
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,410
This is the real trouble.

350
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,220
-It hurts! It hurts!
-Don’t move.

351
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,130
Dog, you are finally awake.

352
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,700
Dog?

353
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,860
Where am I? Shouldn’t I be
in the infirmary?

354
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,500
This is my room.

355
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,810
Do you still remember

356
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,810
what happened just now?

357
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,860
I remember it was dark.

358
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,380
They were sleeping
and I was also sleeping.

359
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,810
Then I’m here after I woke up.

360
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,170
Do you have any
strange feelings about your body?

361
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,290
My body...

362
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,300
The boards on your arms and legs

363
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,460
were broken by you.

364
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,500
The wounds must hurt a lot, right?

365
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,130
Of course it hurts.

366
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,460
It feels like

367
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,890
my arms and my legs are broken.

368
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,410
And my neck hurts too.

369
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,380
What’s wrong?

370
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,600
You went crazy

371
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,260
just like those soldiers

372
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,500
in the army.

373
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,380
Crazy?

374
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,500
Did I go crazy?

375
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,700
I can’t remember it at all.

376
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,100
What did I do?

377
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,740
You did nothing.

378
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,170
You just almost cut the wooden man

379
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,460
in the infirmary into pieces.

380
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,740
Do you not remember it at all?

381
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,050
I, Jing...

382
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,130
I, Dog, swear with my life

383
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,290
that I really don’t remember anything.

384
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,460
General Leng, he just woke up.

385
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,480
He is still a little confused.

386
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,460
There are too many people
in the infirmary.

387
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,530
I’m afraid it will make him nervous

388
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,260
and it won’t help him
recall the details.

389
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,810
It’s better to let him calm down
a little bit at my place.

390
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
I’ll let you know

391
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,220
if I find out anything later.

392
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,720
Okay, thank you, Your Highness.

393
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,290
Keep guard at the door.

394
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,740
Don’t let anyone come near us.

395
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

396
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,410
Jinli, you just saw it.

397
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,990
Those soldiers all went crazy
in that way.

398
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,990
It’s exactly how weird it is.

399
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah.

400
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,170
To be frank,

401
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,460
we can’t blame the soldiers

402
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,170
for being scared.

403
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,260
They just somehow went crazy.

404
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,650
It’s really creepy.

405
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,390
Jinli.

406
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,150
Tell us the truth.

407
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,910
Who is that man

408
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,960
who went crazy today?

409
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,150
What do you mean?

410
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,800
I told you

411
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,560
he is a Qianzhou’s soldier
we saved on the way here.

412
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,750
Jinli, we’ve talked about it
for a while.

413
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,840
The way that little soldier

414
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,150
talked and behaved
is nothing like a real soldier.

415
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,110
Even the Qianzhou soldiers
are slack in their training,

416
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,750
they should at least
receive the basic training.

417
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,800
Yeah.

418
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,840
Who is he?

419
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,510
Could he be a spy from somewhere?

420
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,110
Stop your wild guess.

421
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,150
He is just a Qianzhou soldier I saved.

422
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
He is a raw recruit.

423
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,390
He used to be a poor scholar

424
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,360
with some literary skills.

425
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,960
How else could he be
bullied by the bandits like that?

426
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,700
What’s more,

427
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,100
even if he is a spy,

428
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,650
will Commandery Prince An
not recognize it?

429
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,890
That’s true.

430
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,810
Of course.

431
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,860
All right. Well,

432
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
we are a little incredulous because of
what happened these days.

433
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,220
This is just a casual chat

434
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
between us.

435
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,090
We are definitely not doubting

436
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,940
your precious brother’s insight.

437
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,250
Yeah.

438
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,610
Hou, how is your injury now?

439
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,340
When did you get hurt again?

440
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,530
Just a flesh wound.

441
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,800
It doesn’t matter.

442
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,480
How does it not matter?

443
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,870
Isn’t it your flesh?

444
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,770
It doesn’t matter?

445
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,430
I heard from Wu Chen

446
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
that your injury hasn’t healed yet.

447
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,770
You are even having malignant sores.

448
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,830
You don’t even apply the ointment
Doctor Qi gave you on time.

449
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,260
Are you trying to show how tough you are
or are you just stupid?

450
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,160
All right.

451
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,960
I mean you two big men are even

452
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
more nagging that my wife.

453
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,230
Think about it.

454
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,510
Did anyone approach you on purpose?

455
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,750
Or did you do anything

456
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,030
that might have revealed your identity?

457
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,910
No.

458
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,150
I got it.
The Vice Military Commissioner,

459
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,750
General Hou, came to the infirmary

460
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,800
before the meal. He didn’t say anything,

461
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,870
but he kept looking at me.

462
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,200
I think he is doubting my identity.

463
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,910
What about Wu Chen?

464
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,510
There is nothing strange about Wu Chen.

465
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,870
After we stopped gambling,

466
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,960
he checked the crude drug

467
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,840
with the old man Qi.

468
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,390
He didn’t take me seriously.

469
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,960
I asked about him.

470
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,030
Usually he takes care of

471
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,390
military supplies.

472
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,320
Sometimes he drafts
documents for the army.

473
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,030
He has no power to
dispatch the soldiers.

474
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,840
The generals and soldiers
rarely work with him directly.

475
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,230
They don’t have much impression of him.

476
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,630
After Hou Bin left,

477
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,510
did you eat or drink anything?

478
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,770
Do you think I’m that careless
about my life?

479
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,930
I was really careful.

480
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,050
I’m afraid they would put anything

481
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,930
in my food,

482
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,700
I didn’t take the medicine at all.

483
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,610
While we were eating,

484
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,660
I pretended that I preferred
the food of the person next to me

485
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,700
and I changed it.

486
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,980
I had some water before going to bed.

487
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,580
But that was the water of someone else.

488
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,130
I drank it after they all fell asleep.

489
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,050
Your Highness, could it be

490
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,620
that their target is someone else?

491
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,290
I was so cautious that I overdid it
and got myself poisoned?

492
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,980
According to our previous speculation,

493
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,220
someone led us to the army on purpose.

494
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,930
I think that person wants to

495
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,260
kill us in one fell swoop.

496
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,220
But we are in the army now,

497
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,500
why would he complicate it

498
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,810
and make a move against
someone irrelevant?

499
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,530
We’ve been here for a while.

500
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,170
We are still alive and kicking.

501
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
Except me.

502
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,010
But there is no point

503
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,050
to just make a move against me.

504
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,290
You also said

505
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,050
I didn’t do anything after I went crazy.

506
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,460
I was only cutting wood there.

507
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,220
Did he want to run me down?

508
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,080
Leng Yue.

509
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,190
You also saw the symptoms of Jing Yi.

510
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,650
Is there any obscure

511
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,050
poison or skill

512
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,720
that can make people go crazy like that?

513
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:45,930
Poison...

514
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,620
Skill...

515
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,460
They won’t feel tired

516
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,700
or painful

517
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,810
when they go crazy.

518
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,220
Just like the way
Vice Minister Jing was.

519
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,800
Normally,

520
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,580
Vice Minster Jing would have
cried out loud

521
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,500
if his hands got hurt like this.

522
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,340
I don’t think you are complimenting me

523
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,760
or comforting me.

524
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,380
Don’t feel painful.

525
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,300
and can’t remember anything afterwards.

526
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,410
Apply it to him.

527
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,040
This is...

528
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,770
What’s wrong?

529
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,650
I brought this medicine from Chang’an.

530
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,650
It won’t be any problem.

531
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,930
Jing Yi, did you feel dizzy and thirsty

532
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,620
when you just woke up?

533
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,010
A little bit.

534
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,340
That’s it.

535
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,340
Your Highness, it’s datura flower.

536
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,620
Datura flower?

537
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,010
Datura flower is a good remedy
for the pain.

538
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,130
What’s wrong with it?

539
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,220
Datura flower is a good remedy
for the pain.

540
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,280
But it’s really expensive.

541
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,400
There are few people who can afford it

542
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,680
and know how to use it.

543
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,740
Normally the flower is used as medicine,

544
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,980
But every part of datura flower

545
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,130
is poisonous.

546
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,230
The seed is the most poisonous part.

547
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,870
It tastes sweet.

548
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,440
Normally people will have hallucinations
after taking a few seeds.

549
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,270
If the toxicity is not serious,

550
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,240
the person will act normally
after the hallucination.

551
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,910
You can’t feel it through the pulse.

552
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,870
I saw it once in Lingnan Mountain.

553
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,150
Someone was selling

554
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,630
something like Five Minerals Powder

555
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,360
made with datura flower

556
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,110
and other medicines.

557
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,040
Hallucinations?

558
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,200
In other words,

559
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,480
those who were poisoned went crazy

560
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,230
because they had hallucinations.

561
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,310
Yes.

562
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
If the hallucination

563
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,930
varies from person to person,

564
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,170
that can explain

565
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
why they went crazy in different ways.

566
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,330
The datura flower is precious and rare.

567
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,010
I’m afraid it was provided by Li Zhang.

568
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,130
Miss Leng.

569
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,490
If people take such a poison,

570
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,580
will they show symptoms right away

571
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
or after a while?

572
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,250
It depends on the usage and the dosage.

573
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,820
If they take the seed,

574
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,260
they will show symptoms

575
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,030
after ten minutes at most.

576
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,820
In this case,

577
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,180
the poison wasn’t in the food.

578
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,610
There wasn’t much food left

579
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,440
in the stomachs of
the three dead soldiers.

580
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,490
They must have finished
their meals for a while.

581
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,250
It was definitely not just ten minutes.

582
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,420
Then is it water?

583
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,420
Probably not.

584
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,890
In the infirmary,

585
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,220
the water for the wounded soldiers

586
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,530
is heated in a pot.

587
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,980
If the poison was in the water,

588
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,580
those who drank the water
should all have gone crazy.

589
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,860
How could you go crazy alone?

590
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,340
Then is it the bowl?

591
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,340
We won’t know the fact

592
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,890
if we keep guessing here.

593
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,050
I’d better go back to the infirmary
and keep looking into it.

594
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,860
No way.

595
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,080
Someone wants to kill you
and you still want to go back.

596
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,860
Your Highness, I think Jing Yi has

597
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,770
gotten the information
we need in the infirmary.

598
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,150
It’s time to get him back.

599
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,720
Are you worried about me?

600
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,560
Yes, I’m worried about you.

601
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,270
All right, don’t worry.

602
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,600
I’ve gone crazy once.

603
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,440
Get sober

604
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,870
where you go crazy.

605
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,320
I’m afraid of pain and death.

606
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,720
No matter what hallucinations I have,

607
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,270
I won’t kill myself.

608
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,750
Besides, Your Highness.

609
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,840
I think it’s not over tonight.

610
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,920
You have to be more careful.

611
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,680
We all need to be more careful.

612
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,610
How dare you sneak into my barracks.

613
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,470
Who do you think you are?

614
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
You are way out of my league.

615
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,390
You know I moved this?

616
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,290
Of course.

617
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,630
If I can’t see through

618
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,960
your little trick,

619
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,560
how could I command

620
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,600
the vast army in Qianzhongdao?

621
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,630
My base would be

622
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,200
penetrated by spies.

623
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,150
These letters...

624
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Did I put those letters here on purpose

625
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,870
for you to find them?

626
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,150
Well,

627
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,150
didn’t you show these letters
to Commandery Prince An?

628
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,840
If Commandery Prince An
can’t even tell this,

629
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,750
then he doesn’t have the ability
to rule the Three Judicial Offices.

630
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,170
Why?

631
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,910
Why?

632
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,760
Why not tell you

633
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,200
the reason I couldn’t go back
when your parents died tragically

634
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,910
in the Ganlu Incident?

635
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,870
That’s because if the frontier general

636
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,840
leads the troops into the capital
without permission,

637
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,890
it will be seen as a rebellion.

638
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,750
If I did that,

639
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,990
the whole Leng clan would be executed.

640
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,720
At that time, the patriarch
put me on a leash

641
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,560
and locked me in the dungeon
of the ancestral hall.

642
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,990
How could I tell you that?

643
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,600
I wrote letters to your father

644
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,560
on the anniversary of
his death every year.

645
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,300
And I put the letters in a box

646
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,080
like a woman.

647
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,180
Well, does it sound glorious?

648
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,800
Will it do any good to you?

649
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,110
Why didn’t you tell me

650
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,440
that the doctor said you have...?

651
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,990
Kid, you can’t trust a doctor’s words.

652
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,870
If you don’t trust the doctor,

653
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,910
why did you write in the letter

654
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,230
that you will reunite with him

655
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,480
less than half a year later?

656
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,750
I was fooling him.

657
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,370
Let me feel you pulse.

658
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,670
How did you fool the court?

659
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,220
General Leng is seriously ill?

660
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,310
No way.

661
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,550
General Leng looks so strong.

662
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,520
I heard that he even had a fight
with Miss Leng

663
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,070
in the training yard this afternoon.

664
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,120
What kind of serious disease
does he have?

665
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,830
A bone disease.

666
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,540
Maybe it’s an old ailment
he got when he fought wars.

667
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,000
During these years,

668
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,430
he wrote letters to Leng Yue’s father

669
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,600
on the anniversary of his death
to send condolences.

670
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,120
He wrote in the letter

671
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,950
that he hid his condition from everyone

672
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,280
because he worries that it will
cause a disturbance in the army.

673
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,640
He is quietly

674
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,400
preparing for his death.

675
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,160
Does Miss Leng know it?

676
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,600
She found these letters

677
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,950
in General Leng’s barracks.

678
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,160
I was going to let her check if there is

679
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,790
any clue about
General Leng contacting Li Zhang

680
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,550
or about illegal minting of coins.

681
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,480
But she found a box of letters

682
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,190
that General Leng wrote to
her father over the years.

683
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,760
If General Leng is seriously ill,

684
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,990
he shouldn’t be
the mastermind behind this.

685
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,190
Chu Chu, do you still remember

686
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,550
the two people who tried to
kill Xu Rugui?

687
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes.

688
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,190
I remember you said after the autopsy

689
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,790
that they were both soldiers.

690
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,180
Your Highness, why do you mention this?

691
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,790
These people are also soldiers.

692
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,880
Jinli found out

693
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,910
that before we went into
the mountain with Li Zhang,

694
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,760
more than 20 soldiers left the base
to buy supplies

695
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,000
under Wu Chen’s order.

696
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,110
This is exactly the number of soldiers
who showed up in the Prefect’s Mansion.

697
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,520
But Wu Chen doesn’t have
the power to dispatch troops.

698
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,030
Therefore, it must be someone

699
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,160
very powerful behind this.

700
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,490
What’s more,

701
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,330
from the traces of the scene
in the wood house that day,

702
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,480
except for the Shence Army who
came to kill Xu Rugui,

703
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,800
there was another group of people
who wanted to capture Xu Rugui alive.

704
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,220
Your Highness, why do you think

705
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,410
it’s General Leng who sent people
to arrest Xu Rugui?
