1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,030
Chu Chu, I want to spend
every day with you

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,640
and take care of you
for the rest of my life.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,600
Will you marry me?

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,200
I can do whatever he asks me to do.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,550
But...

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,260
But I can’t marry him.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,000
Obviously, she also likes me.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,470
But why won’t she marry me?

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,420
(Guanling County Office)

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,000
I can’t intervene in the affairs
of the Three Judicial Offices.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,360
You can decide it by yourself.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,200
But it’s the Emperor’s order

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,880
to bring Chu Chu back to Chang’an.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,360
Either I take her back,

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,230
or I take back the truth of

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,040
Commandery Prince An Consort’s case.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,040
I don’t mean to offend you.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,320
But neither Chu Chu nor the evidence
about my father’s case

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,950
can be taken away by you.

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,640
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,550
I just can’t trust those guards
around you

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,750
from the Shence Army.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,880
It concerns the Division of Eunuchs.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,110
It’s too important.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
I have to be careful enough.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,750
However,

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,200
if you only want to
report on your mission,

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,310
I can let you take Xu Rugui back.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,070
Xu Rugui?

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,840
Xu Rugui is Chu Chu’s uncle.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,110
Chu Chu’s biological mother
turned to him for help,

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,920
but he killed her to keep himself safe.

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,800
Then he threw himself

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,520
in the lap of Qin Luan
and became his minion.

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,240
He was ordered by Qin Luan
to arrest Chu Chu in Qianzhou

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,880
to take one step ahead

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,310
and find my father.

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,710
Now he failed

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,750
and Qin Luan abandoned him

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,630
and wanted to kill him.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,750
Wu Jiang saved his family
secretly in Chang’an.

42
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,840
If you bring him back to Chang’an

43
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,800
and promise him to
give his family a way out,

44
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,030
Xu Rugui will tell the truth

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,390
in front of the Emperor.

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,030
Then the Emperor will know

47
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,880
that Chu Chu is in danger now.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
I will draw up another memorial

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
to explain the cause in detail

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
and implore him to allow me
to finish the affairs in Qianzhou first.

51
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,880
Then I’ll bring Chu Chu back to Chang’an
to apologize for our offense.

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
You can report on
your mission this way.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Yes, I can.

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,350
But if anything goes wrong,

55
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,600
you will be blamed and punished.

56
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,880
I’m willing to bear

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,630
all the consequences.

58
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,350
It’s just that

59
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,270
Qin Luan won’t give up easily.

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,830
If you are going to bring Xu Rugui
back to Chang’an,

61
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,830
you must take strict precautions
along the way.

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
Your Highness,
there is an imperial edict.

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,680
Here is the imperial edict.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,880
The illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,170
disturbed the people and broke the law,

66
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,290
damaged the people’s livelihood
and the national fortune.

67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,340
Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,530
is known for his ability in court

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,090
to solved difficult and strange cases,

70
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,570
and is the right person
to investigate and handle

71
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,260
the case of illegal minting of
copper coins in Qianzhou.

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,650
From today on,

73
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,060
Commandery Prince An is given

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,060
the power to act at his discretion.

75
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,420
All the officials in Qianzhou
are at his disposal.

76
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,290
Respect this.

77
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,900
Minister Xiao Jinyu receives
the edict and thanks Your Majesty.

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,170
Commandery Prince An.

79
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,500
I need to rush back to Chang’an
and report on my mission.

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,650
I should leave.

81
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,700
By the way,

82
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,530
before I left Chang’an,

83
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,090
Senior Jing asked me

84
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,370
to bring you a message.

85
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,900
Qianzhou is dangerous.

86
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,620
You must be careful.

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,320
Thanks a lot.

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,830
I should leave.

89
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,160
Sir.

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,320
Now I’m ordered by
the Emperor to investigate

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,630
the case of illegal minting of coins.

92
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,090
I can’t return to Chang’an

93
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,370
before I solve this case.

94
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,700
I hope you can agree on

95
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,490
what I just said.

96
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,210
All right.

97
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,190
Since you have the power
to act at your discretion,

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,720
you can keep Chu Chu here in the name of

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,120
investigating the case

100
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,720
and this can be an explanation
to the Emperor.

101
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,420
Without delay,

102
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,460
I’ll set off immediately

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,020
and bring Xu Rugui back to Chang’an

104
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,650
lest the treacherous man gets the news.

105
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,460
Thank you, sir.

106
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:30,020
=The Imperial Coroner=

107
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,860
=Episode 24=

108
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,140
Chu Chu.

109
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,050
Your Highness.

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,960
Is there anything you need me to do?

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,090
No.

112
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,580
I was

113
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,060
abrupt last night.

114
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,660
It was busy just now

115
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,130
and I didn’t have time to talk to you.

116
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,250
I’m here to apologize to you.

117
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,540
Here are some rouge and powder.

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,060
It took me a long time to picked it.

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,500
I still feel that it’s not
good enough for you.

120
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,340
But it’s the best I can find.

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
If you take it,

122
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,780
it means you forgive me.

123
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,550
Your Highness, I’m not blaming you.

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,390
I can’t take this.

125
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,770
I’m a coroner

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,050
and I spend a lot of time with corpses.

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,100
I...

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,650
I might not smell good.

129
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,020
But distinguishing the smell

130
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,540
is very important for autopsy.

131
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,820
If I use powder,

132
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,930
the result will be inaccurate.

133
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,230
If it bothers you,

134
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
I will stay away from you.

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,270
That’s not what I meant.

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,900
Then I will take this back.

137
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,570
I have one more thing for you.

138
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,410
I saw it on my way here.

139
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,940
You popped up in my mind

140
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,220
when I saw it.

141
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,780
So I picked it for you.

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

143
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,570
Your Highness, is there anything else?

144
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,300
Nothing.

145
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,610
I forgot that a coroner

146
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,420
doesn’t use powder.

147
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
But why did she throw your flowers

148
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,810
into the swill bucket?

149
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,690
Did you say exactly

150
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,900
what I told you?

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,890
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
It was my first time

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,790
to say such wild words.

154
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,470
How could I remember it wrong?

155
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
That’s weird.

156
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
That doesn’t sound like something
Chu Chu would do.

157
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,550
What flowers did you give her?

158
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
As you said,

159
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,550
inconspicuous at first glance,

160
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,910
but exquisitely beautiful
when you look carefully.

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,280
This is good.

162
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,150
What’s the matter?

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,200
You came just right.

164
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,030
You are close to Chu Chu.

165
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,790
Help us analyze it.

166
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,590
Commandery Prince An
sent flowers to Chu Chu.

167
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,200
Chu Chu said thanks

168
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,150
and threw the flowers
into the swill bucket.

169
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,640
Flowers?

170
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,550
This one?

171
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,400
Yeah.

172
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,080
This is Lespedeza.
It can be used as medicine.

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,400
But normally people use it
to feed pigs.

174
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,000
No wonder she threw it
into the swill bucket.

175
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,790
To feed pigs?

176
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,780
(Lespedeza)

177
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,380
(Used to feed pigs)

178
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,030
You told her

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,150
she popped up in your mind
when you saw it?

180
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,790
You two, get out.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
You came up with the bad idea of

182
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,150
sending flowers and rouge to her, right?

183
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,960
What do you mean the bad idea?

184
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,550
Isn’t this a necessary step
to please a girl?

185
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,440
Who knows that Chu Chu is
such an otherworldly person?

186
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,280
Jinyu, is what Jing Yi said true?

187
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,880
A necessary step to please a girl.

188
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,710
You are so experienced.

189
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
What girls did you please before?

190
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,150
It was all for show.

191
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,110
It was all for show.

192
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,550
Is there no one you really like?

193
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,590
There is one.

194
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,550
Who?

195
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,960
Never mind.

196
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,080
Perhaps she doesn’t like me at all

197
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,150
and it’s just my wishful thinking.

198
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,710
You can tell me.

199
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,400
I...

200
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,080
I can give you some advice

201
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,440
and make sure you will get her.

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,470
Really?

203
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,280
Then you need to teach me step by step.

204
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,100
I mean,

205
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,490
how could you listen to Jing Yi
about such kind of thing?

206
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,490
Do you have any good idea?

207
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,860
What good idea can I have?

208
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,050
You are really being desperate.

209
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,570
Let I ask you,

210
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,900
has Miss Chu ever adored Jing Yi?

211
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,880
It means Jing Yi’s method

212
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,590
doesn’t work on Miss Chu at all.

213
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,520
No wonder it didn’t work out. Right?

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
You have a point.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,080
But I don’t know
whom Chu Chu adored before.

216
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
Who do you want her to adore?

217
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,320
You know it.

218
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,470
That’s it.

219
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,670
Now it’s you who want her love.

220
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,760
So you should do it in your own way

221
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,550
and follow your heart.

222
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,880
You do have a point.

223
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,550
I didn’t think it through.

224
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,400
You’ve suffered a lot to search
the mountains during the past few days.

225
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,440
When I used to go into the mountains
to suppress the bandits,

226
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,080
I would stay there about half a month.

227
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
This is a piece of cake for me.

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,710
Your Highness.

229
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:53,840
Come in.

230
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,000
Your Highness, the Prefect of Qianzhou,
Li Zhang, presents himself.

231
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,790
Greetings to Commandery Prince An,
Vice Minister Jing.

232
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,910
Did you come here

233
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,150
so late for Chu Chu?

234
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,440
No, no.

235
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,440
I was in a hurry before
and I acted recklessly.

236
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,790
I still owe you an apology
for my offense.

237
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,320
Then why are you here?

238
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,590
Commandery Prince An.

239
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,120
Vice Minister Jing and I talked about

240
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,390
the illegal minting of coins
in Qianzhou on that day.

241
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,320
I know that this matter
is of great importance.

242
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,320
It took me some efforts

243
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
and I found out

244
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,840
some clues about the case.

245
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Today I received the imperial edict

246
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,670
that all the officials in Qianzhou

247
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,520
should fully assist Commandery Prince An
to investigate this case.

248
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,000
I’m here to report it to you.

249
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,440
During these days,

250
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,230
I’ve checked the production

251
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,180
of all mines under my control.

252
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,590
I asked my people to take the fake coins

253
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,280
and consult the local
experienced miners one by one.

254
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
(Investigation of Illegal Minting
of Coins in Qianzhou)

255
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,030
After comparisons,

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I came to the conclusion

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,640
that the coins should be made from

258
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,440
copper and tin ore
in the Guanling Mountain area.

259
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,590
I’ve written the detailed
process of investigation

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,200
and the results in the case file.

261
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,660
Thank you for your efforts.

262
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,800
This is what I should do.

263
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,960
Prefect Li, I spend a lot of money,

264
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,080
but I don’t know much about

265
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
making money.

266
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,820
Please favor me with your instruction.

267
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,590
I dare not.

268
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,590
Please favor me with your instruction.

269
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,590
In your opinion,

270
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,760
why would these people
mint coins illegally?

271
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,440
Why...?

272
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,290
They mint coins for profits.

273
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
Where do the profits come from?

274
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,170
I’m slow-witted.

275
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,500
Please enlighten me.

276
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,230
Let me put it this way.

277
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
The coins don’t come out of nowhere.

278
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,200
It requires a lot of manpower
and material resources to mint coins.

279
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,320
Normally the coins they made for profits

280
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,960
are in poor quality

281
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,280
and light.

282
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,080
The cost of minting a coin

283
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,590
is much lower than
the face value of a coin.

284
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,350
Then their efforts are not wasted.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,110
Am I right?

286
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,760
You are right, Vice Minister Jing.

287
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,680
That’s weird.

288
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,470
The current batch of fake coins
minted in Qianzhou

289
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,800
looks just like the genuine coins

290
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,910
in terms of the fineness, the texture,

291
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,150
and the weight.

292
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,000
It can be seen that they used some good
materials and a lot of labor.

293
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
The cost can be imagined.

294
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,350
If it’s just for this little profit,

295
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,740
why don’t they do something else

296
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,000
but such a dangerous thing?

297
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,180
Vice Minister Jing is scrupulous indeed.

298
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,570
I never thought about this.

299
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,130
Your Highness, what do you think?

300
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,660
Why bother with this now?

301
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,300
We can ask the supervisors

302
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,980
after we find the mint.

303
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,370
You are right, Your Highness.

304
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,930
Your Highness, I think

305
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,220
the mint is very likely

306
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,540
in the Phoenix Mountain
in Guanling County.

307
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,250
Prefect Li, that’s also what we think.

308
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,610
You also think so?

309
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,420
If you don’t mind us
usurping your authority,

310
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,420
we want to go to the mountain
with you tomorrow.

311
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,450
Okay, I’m much relieved

312
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,930
if you two come with me.

313
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,370
Are we all

314
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,570
going to the mountain tomorrow?

315
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,980
Tomorrow, you lead the troop

316
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,100
and follow me and Li Zhang
into the mountain to find the mint.

317
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,900
Jing Yi, Leng Yue and Zheng Youde

318
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,820
will take some runners to the tree hole

319
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,940
and round off the case of Xu Rugui.

320
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,460
What about Miss Chu?

321
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,940
If I don’t let her come,

322
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,940
she will come after she knows it.

323
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,460
I will be misunderstood

324
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,420
and I’m afraid I can’t explain it
for the rest of my life.

325
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,010
It’s perilous in the mountains,

326
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,460
instead of letting her run around alone,

327
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,210
it will be safer to keep her
close to me.

328
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,130
You are right.

329
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,610
There is one more thing.

330
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,940
Did Mr. Xue mention the marriage
of me and Leng Yue

331
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,820
before he left?

332
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,490
He said

333
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,300
it’s a blessing in disguise.

334
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,330
It’s good for you to marry Leng Yue.

335
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,210
What?

336
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,420
I mean, what is Mr. Xue thinking about?

337
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,730
Leng Yue is not that bad, right?

338
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,730
Why are you also making it worse?

339
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,370
No.

340
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,780
Is it about whether she is good or bad?

341
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,970
It will get people killed.

342
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,180
What will get people killed

343
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,700
is the power struggle
behind this marriage,

344
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,090
not Leng Yue.

345
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,200
Don’t you think

346
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,320
Leng Yue is a good girl?

347
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,910
You are my real brother indeed.

348
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,910
How can you ask me at this point?

349
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,230
I’m just asking you

350
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,150
if Leng Yue is a good girl.

351
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,210
Yes, Leng Yue is a good girl.

352
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,610
But I’m just like you.

353
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,940
I always see her as a good friend.

354
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,580
I never thought of marrying her.

355
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
So I’m saying

356
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,180
you and Leng Yue are both victims.

357
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:32,940
But you are still

358
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,580
hurting each other.

359
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,580
Hold on,

360
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,720
Mr. Xue didn’t say anything about

361
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,860
a blessing in disguise, right?

362
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,300
Well done. You got the nerve

363
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,540
to make fun of your big brother.

364
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,820
I’m not in the mood to make fun of you.

365
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,540
It’s just that the things are getting
more complicated in Qianzhou.

366
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,660
I don’t want you two to be at odds

367
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,700
in the face of our enemies.

368
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
You are a general.

369
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,820
You should know better than I do

370
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,010
that trust can be a matter of
life and death sometimes.

371
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,970
Yes, you are right.

372
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,200
I’m going to fight...

373
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,300
To have a good chat with her.

374
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,610
My Lord.

375
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,610
Everything is prepared

376
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,010
as you ordered.

377
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,280
Get more people

378
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,050
to follow them
into the mountain tomorrow.

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,120
I want to see how lucky

380
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,380
Xiao Jinyu is.

381
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,060
Xiao Jinli will also bring soldiers

382
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,060
to protect him tomorrow.

383
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,540
Well...

384
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,130
What?

385
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,580
Don’t worry, My Lord.

386
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,180
You are resourceful and you can
capture your enemy easily.

387
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,130
Xiao Jinyu won’t come back
alive this time.

388
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,370
You can leave.

389
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,780
Are you sure about it?

390
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,780
Don’t worry.

391
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,580
I’ve made a thorough plan.

392
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,060
Xiao Jinyu will take the bait.

393
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,330
If it’s done,

394
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,660
the irrefutable proof that we mint coins

395
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,090
will be gone forever.

396
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,180
Then go ahead and do it.

397
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,210
I won’t fail you.

398
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,980
You mustn’t take it lightly.

399
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,290
Xiao Jinyu is on guard against you.

400
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,980
So what if he is on guard against me?

401
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,700
Xiao Jinyu is ordered to
investigate the case.

402
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,340
He will take the bait if he sees one.

403
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,130
This place is rarely visited indeed.

404
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,060
We’ve been walking for a while

405
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,180
and there are no people at all.

406
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,970
Of course.

407
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,300
This is nothing here.

408
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,110
It has been rainy recently.

409
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,560
There are even fewer people
going into the mountain.

410
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,230
General Xiao.

411
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
What place are we looking for
in the mountains?

412
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Ask Commandery Prince An.

413
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,950
A place to mint coins.

414
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,040
Mint coins?

415
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,110
Shouldn’t the government mint coins?

416
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,190
Why would we come to
the Phoenix Mountain?

417
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,710
Some people are illegally
minting coins in Qianzhou.

418
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,520
Prefect Li found out

419
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,230
that the ore used for minting coins

420
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,520
is from the mountains
in Guanling County.

421
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,110
He suspects that the mint
is in the Phoenix Mountain.

422
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,640
Here?

423
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,880
Magistrate Zheng.

424
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
I heard from Chu Chu

425
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,710
that a lot of people
have fallen in here.

426
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,520
If Commandery Prince An didn’t
say it in front of your face today,

427
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,070
I think you will only fill the hole

428
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,710
when you fall in there yourself.

429
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,110
Yeah, yeah. No, No.

430
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,710
No, no.

431
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,350
I’m shameful.

432
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,830
I’m guilty.

433
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,350
Fill the hole carefully.

434
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,430
Don’t damage the roots of the tree.

435
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,760
Yes.

436
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,560
It’s a felony to illegally mint coins.

437
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,790
This group of people are so bold.

438
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,760
They must be well prepared.

439
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,550
The mint they chose

440
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,160
must be a hidden and convenient place.

441
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,550
Do you have any idea?

442
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,600
I’m not capable enough,
but I took a guess.

443
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,960
Feel free to say it.

444
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,110
Minting coins not only
requires manpower,

445
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
but also copper ore, tin ore,

446
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,910
water and firewood.

447
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,150
The ore can be transported
from elsewhere,

448
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,510
but water and firewood
must be sufficient here.

449
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,270
Otherwise it would be inconvenient

450
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,620
and greatly increase the cost.

451
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,350
The cost will outweigh the gain.

452
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,310
Therefore, the mint

453
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,070
must be in lush forest
with abundant water,

454
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,350
and it’s convenient to
get in and out.

455
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
After all, the large amount of coins

456
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,080
need to be sent out of the mountain.

457
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,230
They won’t take a road like this.

458
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,510
You’ve said a lot.

459
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,800
Where is this place?

460
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,520
I need to ask Miss Chu about this.

461
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,430
Me?

462
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,350
There are many places here
with plenty of trees,

463
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,710
sufficient water and a convenient road.

464
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,900
I don’t know, either.

465
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,340
Are you making a wish?

466
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,240
I’m not.

467
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,480
Childish.

468
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,900
I saw

469
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,820
you and Xiao Jinli

470
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,730
drinking and laughing on the roof

471
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,130
of the county office last night.

472
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,010
What were you talking about?

473
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,540
None of your business.

474
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,460
Did you agree to marry him?

475
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,300
Actually, if I think about it,

476
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,460
Xiao Jinli is pretty good.

477
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,730
If I marry him,

478
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,490
I’ll be Commandery Prince An’s
sister-in-law.

479
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,460
Then no one would dare to
talk nonsense to me.

480
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,660
You really think so?

481
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,460
You can’t think this way.

482
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,490
Xiao Jinli...

483
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,150
There is nothing good
about Xiao Jinli.

484
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,370
He is stubborn and bad-tempered.

485
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,700
He wears the same cloths all day long.

486
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,130
He also has stinky socks on him.

487
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,180
You can’t marry him.

488
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,850
You won’t be happy if you marry him.

489
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,850
Then who should I marry
that will make me happy?

490
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,090
Me... Me.

491
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,210
You must be sick.

492
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,460
What’s wrong with me? Consider about me.

493
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,300
No.

494
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,660
Chu Chu.

495
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,580
Is there any place in the mountain

496
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,250
with running water
that does not flow into the villages,

497
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,680
dense bamboo forests,

498
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,040
and a road leading to

499
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,550
the busiest place down the mountain?

500
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,010
Running water that does not
flow into the villages,

501
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,320
dense bamboo forests

502
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,200
and a road leading to the busiest place?

503
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,090
Minting coins requires
a lot of sustained water.

504
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,060
So it must be running water.

505
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,090
If the sewage generated by minting coins

506
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,940
flows into the water source
where people live,

507
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,460
it would be easy to be noticed.

508
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,010
So the running water

509
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,130
must flow to a place where no one lives,

510
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,540
like in this valley,

511
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,900
to stay hidden for a long time.

512
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,610
Minting coins needs to burn wood.

513
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
Although bamboo is not the best fuel,

514
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,210
it’s easy to cut down and it grows fast.

515
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,660
It’s convenient

516
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,090
and not easy to be noticed.

517
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,010
As for the road leading to
the busiest place,

518
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,010
because this place is
sparsely populated,

519
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,090
no matter the coins are sent out
in a small amount with more times

520
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,090
or in a large amount with less times,

521
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,700
it’s still very easy to be noticed.

522
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,920
But if they blend in
the crowd in disguise,

523
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,420
it would be much safer for them.

524
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,090
It makes sense.

525
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,820
When you put it like this,

526
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,820
I think there is such a place.

527
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,730
But that place is not a mint.

528
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,940
It’s a kiln.

529
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,940
A kiln?

530
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,330
A place to produce porcelain.

531
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,600
That place is exactly the same

532
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,940
as you described.

533
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,610
A kiln? Yeah.

534
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,180
It must be that kiln.

535
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,210
It’s not an official kiln, right?

536
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,210
No.

537
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,130
I can swear with my head.

538
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,490
This is no registered official kiln
in Phoenix Mountain.

539
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,210
I know where that kiln is.

540
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,490
I’ll take you there.

541
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,610
Thank you, Miss Chu.

542
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,370
Your Highness, please.

543
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,200
It’s here.

544
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,370
Go. Hurry up!

545
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,300
Commandery Prince An.

546
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,490
It looks like

547
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,490
no one has been here for a long time.

548
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,610
How did it become like this?

549
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,230
I remember there was smoke coming up

550
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,270
when I went into the mountain
in November last year.

551
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,150
There are no ruts on the ground

552
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,510
and no footprints.

553
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,990
The yellow leaves of
last winter are still here.

554
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,110
This place should have been
abandoned for several months.

555
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,130
Even though this kiln is empty now,

556
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,330
I think there must be

557
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,730
some clues here.

558
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,420
I remember

559
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,820
you mentioned in a case file

560
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,420
you sent back to me

561
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,820
that every move of
a person will leave a trace.

562
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,660
Those who destroy the remains

563
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,820
will also leave traces
of the destruction.

564
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,370
There are always clues.

565
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,330
Jinyu.

566
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,490
Your Highness, please.

567
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,820
Watch your steps after you go inside.

568
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
Everything here is evidence.

569
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,480
Don’t touch them.

570
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,080
Yes, I got it.

571
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,420
It seems to be just a kiln.

572
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,730
Are the tools for minting coins
and making porcelains

573
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,900
the same?

574
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,130
It requires a furnace to melt the metal.

575
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,610
A kiln

576
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,580
can’t be used as a furnace.

577
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,210
In such a small place,

578
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,700
people can’t move at all

579
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,010
if they put a furnace here.

580
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,060
Besides, you can see
what’s here at a glance.

581
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,330
If they place the equipment
for minting coins here,

582
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
it’s easy to be spotted by the villagers
when they come here.

583
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,460
Your Highness!

584
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,580
It’s empty here!

585
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,610
There is something wrong
with this wall.

586
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,370
There are traces on the ground.

587
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,820
We should be able to move this wall.

588
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,330
It’s opened.

589
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,870
Commandery Prince An
is perceptive indeed.

590
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,440
There is something wrong with this kiln.

591
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,150
Jinli.

592
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,110
Please take some people
and bring some torches here.

593
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,440
Let’s go inside and take a look.

594
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,460
Okay.

595
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,060
Your Highness, are you okay?

596
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,060
I heard that it’s a disease.

597
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,580
You will get sick when you
go into a place

598
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,610
without windows.

599
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,370
Are you...?

600
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,060
Don’t worry.

601
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,370
No matter what’s inside,

602
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,420
I’ll be by your side.

603
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,850
What’s wrong, Jinyu?

604
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,300
Commandery Prince An, Miss Chu.

605
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,330
Did you find anything?

606
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:26,960
Your Highness.

607
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,250
Why do you look so bad?

608
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,420
It doesn’t matter.

609
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,770
I’m just tired.

610
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,850
I’ll be fine after some rest.

611
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,180
Take a break if you are tired.

612
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,210
We have plenty of time.

613
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,660
It’s okay. Let’s go.

614
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,750
Be careful, Your Highness.

615
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,330
Your Highness!

616
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,060
Your Highness.

617
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,700
Your Highness, look.

618
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,780
Give it to me.

619
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,060
Your Highness.

620
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,300
This is the place
where they minted coins.

621
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,300
There is a mint in the kiln.

622
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,090
Prefect Li.

623
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,540
Do you remember

624
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,540
that Jing Yi asked

625
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,780
a puzzling question yesterday?

626
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,210
Forgive me for being slow-witted.

627
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,940
You are saying...

628
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,250
He asked you

629
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,250
why this group of bandits

630
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,250
risked their lives

631
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,740
to mint coins for such little profit.

632
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,770
Yes, I remembered it.

633
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,540
You also said we would know it

634
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,730
after we find the mint

635
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,700
and ask the supervisor.

636
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,370
Your Highness,
these bandits are all gone.

637
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,610
I’m afraid we can’t catch anyone.

638
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,090
Then there is no way to know it.

639
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,770
Not necessarily.

640
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,700
The profit they made

641
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,660
is not that little as Jing Yi estimated.

642
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,810
Jing Yi misestimated the profit

643
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,020
because he calculated it

644
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,740
according to the cost
in a normal situation.

645
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,050
But if it’s a local official

646
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,260
who is in charge of
the minting of coins,

647
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,330
it would be a
totally different situation.

648
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,080
Every county office has labor expenses.

649
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,810
If the official slightly changes
the account book,

650
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,130
the labor cost of minting coins

651
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,740
can be paid by the county office.

652
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,810
By the same logic,

653
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,290
the copper and tin used to mint coins

654
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,900
can also be paid by the county office

655
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,050
by changing the account book.

656
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,090
This way,

657
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,600
the biggest costs

658
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,920
were paid by the county office
with the public money.

659
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,030
The rest doesn’t cost much.

660
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,360
It’s such a profitable business.

661
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,810
This is...

662
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,480
Well,

663
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,840
is there anything wrong

664
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,880
with my analysis?

665
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,030
No, no.

666
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,300
I understand it all of a sudden

667
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,150
and I’m enlightened

668
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,520
after hearing what you just said.

669
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,710
I just can’t think of

670
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,760
any official

671
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
in Qianzhou

672
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,280
who can be this bold.

673
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,760
This place is under the jurisdiction
of Guanling County.

674
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,470
Could it be Magistrate Zheng Youde?

675
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,190
You forgot a little thing.

676
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,910
Guanling County

677
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,760
is just a poor county.

678
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,520
They even have no money

679
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,710
to hire more people.

680
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,910
Even if Zheng Youde wants to do it,

681
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,760
what excuses can he use

682
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,630
for such a large expenditure?

683
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,950
I’m slow-witted.

684
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,040
I was in a hurry
and I didn’t think it through.

685
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,850
Please forgive me.

686
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,040
It’s not that you didn’t
think it through.

687
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,760
Guanling County
is a hidden place indeed.

688
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,320
But its only disadvantage

689
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,040
is the inconvenience
to get in and out

690
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,040
caused by its concealment.

691
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,560
In order to send the fake coins

692
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,390
out of Guanling County
as soon as possible,

693
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,670
five years ago,

694
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
you allocated some money

695
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,670
to build a bridge in Guanling County.

696
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,120
It was to provide convenience

697
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,150
for the criminals,

698
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,250
but now everyone is

699
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,530
praising it as a good deed.

700
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,550
That’s ironic.

701
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,200
Well...

702
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,950
Your Highness, please don’t wrong me.

703
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,470
I built the bridge for
the good of the people here.

704
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,470
There is no other intention.

705
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,470
Your Highness, take a look.

706
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,870
The wounds on Prefect Li’s hands

707
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,760
fit these tools perfectly
in terms of shape and size.

708
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,860
