1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,270
Li Zhang illegally made coin moulds
and minted coins.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,680
He used the mint as a bait,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,070
trying to kill us.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,120
Fortunately, Chu Chu’s
astuteness saved me.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,200
Chu Chu, I will never give you up.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,950
Please don’t give me up.

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,950
Go.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,840
We got Xu Rugui! Withdraw!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,470
Withdraw!

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,980
=The Imperial Coroner=

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,060
=Episode 26=

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,220
(Guanling County Office)

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
It’s not easy to investigate
the illegal minting of coins,

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,270
but now you have the right

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,840
to act at your discretion in Qianzhou,

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,750
it’s much more convenient now.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,870
My father got you
the authority without any trace.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,590
I almost didn’t realize it.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,630
But, Your Highness,

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,440
my father put a lot of thought
to protect us,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
this is not a good sign.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,680
That’s right.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,000
Even Senior Jing is
so careful about this,

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,800
it can be seen that the picture
doesn’t look good in Chang’an.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
I’m afraid it’s gonna be harder

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,910
than we estimated to go back to Chang’an

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,870
and redress the case.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,000
Now Xu Rugui is on the way
back to Chang’an with Mr. Xue.

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,870
If Senior Jing can make good use of him,

30
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,590
maybe he can suppress
Qin Luan for a while.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,590
Rest assured.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
The first person to know about this

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,550
must be my father.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
I’ve sent a message to him
as you told me.

35
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,760
With him being in Chang’an,

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,760
I think they can’t make any waves.

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,310
Leng Yue.

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
Did you get any reply
to the previous letter?

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,870
Your Highness, I’m gonna leave first.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Not yet.

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,440
Then stay in the mansion today.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,390
It should be about the right time.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Greetings to Your Highness!

44
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,080
Get up.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Your Highness,

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,270
the Prefect’s Mansion is on fire.

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,320
What?

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,030
Your Highness.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,830
After you and Prefect Li Zhang

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,470
left the County Office for
Phoenix Mountain yesterday,

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,550
I took some people to raid
the Prefect’s Mansion quietly

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,110
as you ordered.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,550
When we arrived at the Prefect’s Mansion
in the afternoon,

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,240
it had been burned into ruins.

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,390
When did the fire start?
Did anyone get hurt?

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
According to the people nearby,

57
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,320
around noon yesterday,

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
a group of soldiers suddenly surrounded
the Prefect’s Mansion

59
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,390
and took away everyone there.

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,030
They set the Prefect’s Mansion on fire.

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,110
Fortunately, it was during the day.

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
There was a lot of noise.

63
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,910
The people nearby

64
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,270
had been evacuated
before the fire got bigger.

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,750
No one got hurt.

66
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,720
A few houses nearby
were destroyed by the fire.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,550
Soldiers? What soldiers?

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,160
I... I didn’t really see them.

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,390
I dare not speculate.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,360
Feel free to tell us.

71
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,110
Well...

72
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,880
You took General Xiao’s

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,630
four soldiers with you.

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,030
There were soldiers going into

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,390
the Prefect’s Mansion before the fire

76
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,030
and the people nearby saw them.

77
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,720
Did they wear the same clothes

78
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,800
as General Xiao’s men?

79
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,440
Yes.

80
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
How did the four soldiers

81
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
coming with you say?

82
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,360
They had a big reaction.

83
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,910
They said someone wanted to frame them.

84
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,470
Your Highness, I didn’t
dare to speculate

85
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,030
because I think this matter
is very strange.

86
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,320
Strange how?

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,160
General Xiao brought
a limited number of soldiers.

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,030
Except those who followed you
to the mountain,

89
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,080
and those who followed me
to the Prefect’s Mansion,

90
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,550
there are no more than
four or five people left.

91
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,360
According to the people at the scene,

92
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
there were at least twenty soldiers

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,110
when they set the fire.

94
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,520
How could General Xiao

95
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,830
gather so many people
in such a short time?

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,240
General Xiao’s soldiers are all from
Military Commissioner’s army.

97
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,080
But there are tens of thousands of soldiers
in Military Commissioner’s army.

98
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,630
These soldiers in Qianzhou

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
are not necessarily
General Xiao’s subordinates.

100
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
You mean General Leng?

101
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,440
What?

102
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,080
Your Highness.

103
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,960
General Xiao is back.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,550
Magistrate Zheng.

105
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,440
Commandery Prince An.

106
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,880
Well...

107
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,600
Prefect Li is unconscious now.

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
General Xiao won’t allow me
to get a doctor here

109
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,950
or visit him.

110
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,830
Well...

111
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,830
If anything happens to

112
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,760
Prefect Li at my office,

113
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,270
what should I do?

114
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,670
Go to the side hall

115
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,040
and ask Miss Leng to come here.

116
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,200
Miss Leng?

117
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,880
Yes, yes. I’ll go get her.

118
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,880
How is he doing?

119
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,720
I mean,

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,510
I moved the stones for the whole night.

121
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
I’ve been so busy that I haven’t
had time to drink any water.

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,230
I got dust everywhere.

123
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,550
But you only worry about him.

124
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,510
Why don’t you worry about me?

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,830
Aren’t you standing here

126
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,230
and denouncing me loudly?

127
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,070
Should I need to worry about you?

128
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,160
Fine.

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,720
See? He wakes up.

130
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
He is fine.

131
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,000
Li Zhang.

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,230
Your Highness.

133
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Your highness is here.
Your highness is here.

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,550
Your highness is here.

135
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,320
Your highness is here.
Your highness is here.

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,950
Your Highness! Your Highness!

137
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Highness, mercy!

138
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness, mercy!

139
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,320
Does he freak out?

140
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,640
Who is he greeting?

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,640
Your Highness, mercy!

142
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,320
Your Highness, mercy!

143
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,790
Hurry and order someone you can trust

144
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,550
to cordon off this courtyard.

145
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,070
Don’t let anyone come near here
without permission

146
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,350
except for Leng Yue and Jing Yi!

147
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

148
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,600
Hurry.

149
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,200
Be careful.

150
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,720
Your Highness, mercy!

151
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,760
Your Highness, mercy!

152
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,540
(Self-discipline and Virtue)

153
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,790
You guys

154
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,390
get everyone out of here

155
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,230
and lock down the courtyard!

156
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,340
-Yes!
-Yes!

157
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,640
You. Go.

158
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Go.

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,230
Miss Leng.

160
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,880
Hurry.

161
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,760
Miss Leng, please.

162
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,760
What’s going on here?

163
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,040
Commandery Prince An has
urgent affairs to deal with.

164
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,830
No one is allowed to
approach without permission.

165
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,320
Magistrate Zheng, please go back.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,830
Urgent affairs?

167
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,880
Do you need me to send more people here

168
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,830
to guard the yard?

169
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,000
General Xiao, feel free to order me
if you need anything.

170
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,950
I will...

171
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,640
Go far away.

172
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,950
Do you hear me?

173
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,640
Well...

174
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,720
Yes, I hear you.

175
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,550
What’s the fuss about?

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,350
Just for Li Zhang?

177
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,160
Can he fly away?

178
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
It’s Commandery Prince An’s order.

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
You and Leng Yue go inside.

180
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,480
Your Highness, mercy.
Your Highness, mercy.

181
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
Your Highness, mercy!

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,640
Your Highness, is Li Zhang awake?

183
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,110
I’m here.

184
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,110
What do you want to say?

185
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,880
Your Highness! Your Highness!

186
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,550
Your Highness, mercy!

187
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,760
Your Highness, mercy.

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,000
Your Highness, I blew it up.

189
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,550
They all know it.

190
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,320
They are still alive.

191
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Your Highness, run away!

192
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Your Highness, you can’t run.

193
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
You can’t run.

194
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,070
I will kill Xiao Jinyu!

195
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,480
I will kill Xiao Jinyu!

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,350
Kill Xiao Jinyu... Kill Xiao Jinyu...

197
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,160
Where do you want me to go?

198
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,920
Your Highness. Your Highness.

199
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,950
You run...

200
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,040
Your Highness, you can’t run.

201
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,200
You are the rightful emperor of Tang.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,390
The country is yours.

203
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,110
You can’t run away. You can’t run away!

204
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,110
Nonsense! What are you talking about?

205
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,720
What the hell is he talking about?

206
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,110
Duke Chang has arrived!

207
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,040
Long live Your Majesty!

208
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
What’s going on here?

209
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
Tell me about it.

210
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,040
Looks like the mastermind
behind Li Zhang

211
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,110
is really Duke Chang.

212
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,070
Li Zhang went crazy.
Are you two also crazy?

213
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,070
Li Zhang suffered a brain injury.

214
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,480
He was crushed by rocks
and buried for too long.

215
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,340
He had difficulty in breathing

216
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,290
and the injury worsened
because of suffocation.

217
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,470
That’s why he becomes delirious.

218
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Can he be cured?

219
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,200
This kind of brain injury
is the same as a spine injury.

220
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,350
It’s incurable.

221
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,680
He will only get worse.

222
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,440
If he wakes up later,

223
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,120
he will only become more delirious.

224
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,910
Do you hear that, Jinyu?

225
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,270
Li Zhang went crazy.

226
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,640
He is talking crazy.

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
No, just because he is crazy,

228
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,150
what he said just now is the truth.

229
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,120
Come on.

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,270
Emperor Wuzong’s son is dead.

231
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,590
Everyone in court knows it.

232
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,950
Even a roughneck like me knows it.

233
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,910
When Emperor Wuzong was alive,

234
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
he saw his uncle as a thorn in the eye.

235
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,390
Emperor Wuzong’s son

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
is a forbidden subject
for the His Majesty.

237
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
How dare you take such a guess.

238
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,860
Don’t you want your head
to stay on your neck?

239
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
Hold on, let me sort this out.

240
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,800
The current Emperor is the uncle of
the late Emperor Wuzong,

241
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,560
which means

242
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,710
if Duke Chang,
the son of Emperor Wuzong,

243
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,000
is still alive,

244
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,230
it should be Duke Chang
who’d ascend the throne.

245
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,670
The rightful emperor

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,080
Li Zhang kept mentioning about

247
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,390
is Duke Chang.

248
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,910
Yes.

249
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,710
What?

250
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,880
You are the most perceptive and cautious
one when it comes to these matters.

251
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,200
Why are you also nodding along?

252
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,320
I was being just like you

253
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,470
when Commandery Prince An
said that to me earlier.

254
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,230
But I have to believe it now.

255
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,150
Didn’t you hear a saying

256
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,530
that nothing is more true
than what a madman says?

257
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,490
Earlier?

258
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,470
I mean, Jinyu.

259
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,000
When did you start

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,030
thinking about Duke Chang?

261
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,910
Before I came to Qianzhou.

262
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,030
What?

263
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,910
It was just my speculation.

264
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,800
Now it looks like

265
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,440
I’m right about it.

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,510
There is no solid evidence to prove

267
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,760
Duke Chang is still alive,

268
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,030
but those who cut off the message
between Chang’an and Qianzhou

269
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,630
and instructed Li Zhang to
mint copper coins

270
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,310
should be this group of people
under the banner of Duke Chang.

271
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,320
They are up to something.

272
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,320
Up to something?

273
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,510
What?

274
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,680
To recruit soldiers

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
and usurp the throne.

276
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,560
Do you know what you are talking about?

277
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,270
Jing Yi, you also think so?

278
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,760
I don’t want to think in this way.

279
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,280
But it makes sense.

280
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
As the Prefect of Qianzhou,

281
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
it’s the most secretive way to let him

282
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,030
be in charge of recruiting soldiers.

283
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,240
Besides, he used illegally minted coins.

284
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,350
He doesn’t need to touch
the public money.

285
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,640
All he needs to do
is to change the account book.

286
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
There is no time for the prologue.

287
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,470
I just want to know

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
what we should do now.

289
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,880
Go back to Chang’an now?

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,590
We can’t.

291
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,440
The Emperor just issued
an imperial edict

292
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,470
and ordered Commandery Prince An

293
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,560
to investigate the illegal minting
of coins in Qianzhou.

294
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,680
I guess the eunuch
who announced the imperial edict

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
hasn’t left Qianzhou yet.

296
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,590
We only have a cave that was blown up,

297
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,560
a Li Zhang who can’t even

298
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,120
explain his own identity,

299
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,710
and a suspect who has been dead

300
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,510
for years in the Emperor’s mind.

301
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
If we go back to Chang’an now,

302
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,350
we have no witness
nor physical evidence.

303
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,200
It’s not believable at all.

304
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,270
What should we do then?

305
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,680
How about writing a memorial

306
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,840
to report these things to the Emperor?

307
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,030
You can ask the Emperor
to issue an imperial edict

308
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,810
and allow you to go back.

309
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,050
We can’t, either.

310
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,980
The Emperor might not believe

311
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,310
even when we tell him face-to-face.

312
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,780
It will be harder for him to believe it

313
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,900
if we write it on paper.

314
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,780
If someone treacherous

315
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
accuses us of making it up,

316
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,570
we will only receive
the edict of punishment.

317
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,010
Nothing will work.

318
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,340
Can you say something useful?

319
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,370
Take it easy.

320
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,370
Jing Yi is right.

321
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,930
We can’t report it to the court rashly.

322
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,230
This group of people

323
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,000
intercepted the messages
between Chang’an and Qianzhou,

324
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,860
illegally minted
a large amount of coins,

325
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,420
and just killed the Minister of War,
Feng Jie, who just finished

326
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,220
his inspection of the military affairs
in the Southwest

327
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,130
and rushed back to Chang’an.

328
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,250
I think

329
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,050
Feng Jie got killed

330
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,020
because he found something

331
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,220
during the military inspections.

332
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,460
It’s very likely that the rebels
are in the Southwest.

333
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,780
If that’s the case,

334
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,020
once they know

335
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
that Li Zhang failed to kill us,

336
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,810
then it will be the rebels

337
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,410
who want to kill us next.

338
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,460
Our safety is a small matter.

339
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,340
But if we act rashly and alert them,

340
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,610
making them take a desperate action

341
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,440
and go to war with the government,

342
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,370
plunging the people
into the flames of war,

343
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,140
then it will really be a dilemma.

344
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,320
We have to find out where they are

345
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
and wipe them out in one fell swoop

346
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,230
before they take any action.

347
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,840
I didn’t bring many soldiers this time.

348
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,670
We can defend against
some ordinary bandits,

349
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,150
but not an army.

350
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,640
Why don’t you go back to the base of
the Military Commissioner with me?

351
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,520
No matter how wild

352
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,670
this group of bandits are,

353
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
I don’t believe they dare to break into
the base of the Military Commissioner.

354
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,080
No, we can’t.

355
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,200
Your Highness.

356
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,000
I’m afraid the base of the Military
Commissioner is also not safe now.

357
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,910
What?

358
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,880
I thought it was nonsense.

359
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
I wanted to tell you later.

360
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,840
This is the letter

361
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
that guy sent to me just now.

362
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,030
Your Highness, take a look first.

363
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,580
(To Commandery Prince An)

364
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,000
(Leng Peishan)
To Commandery Prince An,

365
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,320
I heard that Commandery Prince An

366
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,230
was ordered to investigate the case of
illegally minting of coins in Qianzhou.

367
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,970
I shouldn’t have bothered you.

368
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,500
However, weird things happened frequently
in the army and people got killed.

369
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,470
There might be evil spirits
involved in this.

370
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,960
I’m afraid the soldiers will rise in
revolt if we do nothing about it.

371
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,230
I wonder if you can come here
in person and check it.

372
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,180
(Jing’s Mansion)

373
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,080
Master.

374
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,880
Where is the news from?

375
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,550
Master, it’s from Qianzhou.

376
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,200
It’s about the Military Commissioner.

377
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,240
Strange things happened frequently
in the base of Military Commissioner.

378
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,300
No one knows what’s going on.

379
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,420
About seven or eight people
have gone mad.

380
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,130
Three people have committed suicide.

381
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,300
It’s spreading panic in the army now.

382
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,500
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

383
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,180
Why did you lie to me?

384
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,110
How could you lie to me?

385
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,150
Your Grace.

386
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,960
What’s the fuss about?

387
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,690
Your Grace, I just got the news

388
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,710
that there are people looking for

389
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,760
the servants dismissed by us
in the early years.

390
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,000
Who?

391
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,030
These people act in secret.

392
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,880
I just got wind of it

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,390
and I think this matter is
of great importance,

394
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,150
so I came to report it to you.

395
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,390
Your Grace.

396
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,440
Your Grace, don’t worry.

397
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,420
General Wu just left.

398
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,680
He shouldn’t have gone far.

399
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Do we need to send someone
to get him back

400
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,750
and ask him to find out who they are?

401
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,910
No.

402
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,710
We can’t let anyone know it,

403
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,270
not even the people
from the Three Judicial Offices.

404
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
Otherwise, Jinli and Jinyu

405
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,820
will be in great danger.

406
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,280
Go to the mansion

407
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,590
and find some guards you can trust.

408
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,830
Ask them to investigate it secretly.

409
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,880
Remember to keep quiet about it.

410
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes.

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,760
Hurry.

412
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,440
Yes.

413
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,440
Go to the base of the Military
Commissioner of Qianzhongdao?

414
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Don’t worry.

415
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,160
It’s my father’s last wish

416
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,000
to overturn the case of your father
and the soldiers of

417
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

418
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,030
I won’t forget about it.

419
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,350
It’s just that it implicates
too many people.

420
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
I still need to elaborate
the plan carefully.

421
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Otherwise, even with the evidence
left by my father,

422
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,640
it’s hard for us to solve it for good.

423
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,150
What’s more,

424
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,830
if we don’t find out what’s happening

425
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,320
in the base of
the Military Commissioner,

426
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,330
I’m afraid we can hardly
go back to Chang’an safely.

427
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,390
I understand.

428
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,970
I’ll listen to you.

429
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,870
But the Military Commissioner’s base

430
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,270
is heavily guarded.

431
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
I heard that even a bird
can’t get anywhere near it.

432
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,680
Who would dare to make troubles there?

433
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,080
General Leng wrote a letter to Leng Yue.

434
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,150
He said that there have been

435
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,200
several soldiers going crazy
for no reason.

436
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,590
Some soldiers even committed suicide.

437
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,020
Within a few days,

438
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,860
the rumors are spreading in the army
and causing panic.

439
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,640
What rumors?

440
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,490
The rumors of

441
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,320
evil spirits.

442
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,610
Evil spirits?

443
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,150
The Military Commissioner, Leng Peishan,

444
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,880
who is Leng Yue’s grandfather,

445
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,790
hopes I can leave for the base now

446
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,620
to expel the evil spirits.

447
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,580
There is no evil spirit in the world.

448
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,140
Just take the ghost house
built by Sir Witch Doctor,

449
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,470
everyone was talking about it
like it was real,

450
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,560
but it turned out to be the wind.

451
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,580
If there is evil spirit in this world,

452
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,970
the coroners don’t need to
do any autopsy at all.

453
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,060
Your Highness, do you really believe

454
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,200
there are dangerous evil spirits
in the world?

455
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,830
Master didn’t talk about
spiritual beings.

456
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,190
The so-called evil spirits

457
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,710
are just the embodiment of evil minds.

458
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,830
However,

459
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,640
the army of the Military Commissioner
is a strong guard in the Southwest.

460
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,930
If anything happens to them,

461
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,200
those who will suffer are the people
living in the Southwest.

462
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,150
This happened strangely.

463
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,270
Whether a ghost or a human being did it,

464
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
we have to find out the truth first

465
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,160
before we return to Chang’an
to redress the case.

466
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,230
General Xiao, the people near
the Prefect’s Mansion said

467
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,430
that it was the soldiers of
the Military Commissioner who did it.

468
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,280
I dare not tell any lie.

469
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,520
I got it.

470
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,310
General Xiao.

471
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,040
Is it really General Leng
who ordered those people to do it?

472
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,310
We all know what kind of person
General Leng is.

473
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,280
How would he

474
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,920
join hands with someone like Li Zhang?

475
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,350
I know my brother.

476
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,710
He will never wrong a good person.

477
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,460
Nothing is clear yet.

478
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,710
We can only know the truth

479
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,670
after we go back to the base
and investigate it.

480
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,560
Go back and rest.

481
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,650
We will leave early tomorrow morning.

482
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,320
Yes.

483
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,950
You are thoughtful indeed.

484
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,430
What should we do about Prefect Li?

485
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,080
It’s an established fact

486
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,770
that Li Zhang illegally minted coins,

487
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,050
but the mastermind behind him
hasn’t been captured yet.

488
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,100
I don’t know how many
more people are involved.

489
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,630
So we can’t convict

490
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,540
and punish him for now.

491
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,470
He is delirious

492
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,110
and talking crazy now.

493
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,160
It’s inconvenient to detain him
the County Office.

494
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,160
I’ve asked Jinli to find some people

495
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,880
to imprison him secretly.

496
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,800
We will deal with him
after we find out the truth.

497
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,830
I guess he got what he deserved.

498
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,880
When will we leave?

499
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,620
Your Highness, don’t worry.

500
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,560
With my family staying here,

501
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
my dad will take good care of

502
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,900
the body of Sir Witch Doctor.

503
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,100
To make sure your family
won’t be implicated,

504
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,860
I will ask my men

505
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,260
to send your family

506
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,770
to a safe place.

507
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
And I can rest assured to entrust

508
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,290
my father’s body to your family.

509
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,930
It’s just I’m afraid

510
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,050
I can’t keep my promise this time.

511
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,170
Promise? What promise?

512
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,100
I promised you

513
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,150
I will keep you safe forever.

514
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,250
You regret it?

515
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,220
No. Of course not.

516
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,310
Then you mean...

517
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,410
Chu Chu, I should have

518
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,700
sent you to a safe place

519
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,740
to hide for a while,

520
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,010
or sent you back to Chang’an first.

521
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,170
But this time,

522
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,890
your father’s case
has not been redressed.

523
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,100
If anyone becomes
aware of your identity,

524
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,700
I’m afraid you will be in great danger.

525
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,840
What happened in the army
is very strange.

526
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,800
I’m afraid it will also be dangerous.

527
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,340
After some thought,

528
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,860
I think I have to take you with me
and put you at risk.

529
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,310
Your Highness, are you going to
take me with you to the base?

530
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,580
This will be a dangerous trip.

531
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,220
If you don’t...

532
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,020
♪The moment♪

533
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,740
♪You smile♪

534
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,350
♪Let me cherish it for good♪

♪Because of you♪

♪I’m not old yet♪

538
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,900
♪I still love you♪

♪I can rely on you all my life♪

541
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,170
Your Highness, I thought

542
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,680
you regret being with me.

543
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,060
I’m not afraid of any danger.

544
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,250
Besides, we promised each other
in the cave

545
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,820
that no matter what happens,

546
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,990
we will face it together.

547
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,600
As dignified county king,

548
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,720
you can’t break your promise.

549
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,560
Chu Chu, what I said and did

550
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,640
in the cave that day were not honorable.

551
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,840
I think I took advantage
of the situation.

552
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,530
I should have asked you again
in a serious way.

553
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,080
But I’m afraid

554
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,250
you will reject me

555
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,870
if I ask you again.

556
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,760
I always keep my words.

557
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
I said yes and I won’t regret it.

558
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,190
Chu Chu, I know I’m not

559
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,150
a likable man.

560
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
For a woman, I am not good enough
to be a husband.

561
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
I always think

562
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,830
you don’t know many men now.

563
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,310
After your father’s case is redressed,

564
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,710
you will become a true lady

565
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,950
from a family

566
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,560
of loyal subjects.

567
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,960
After you meet

568
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
all those handsome young masters
in Chang’an,

569
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,750
you will get tired of me.

570
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,080
How will you still cherish me
at that time?

571
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,320
I don’t want you to fall for other men.

572
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,560
So I hurried to show you my love

573
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,200
and wanted to make you
do the same thing.

574
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,030
Now I’ve confessed

575
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,960
my nasty thoughts to you.

576
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600

I only like you.

584
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,840
Your Highness, don’t worry.

585
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,030
No matter how many times you ask me,

586
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,990
the answer will always be

587
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,270

and made a wish.

591
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,270
They said the tree can make
my dream come true.

592
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,440
But I still can’t believe these things.

593

Father, I’m coming.

605
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,600
What are you doing here?

606
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,330
Mellow wine.

607
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,610
That’s the wine for
a heroine to get drunk.

608
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,330
Here, take the roast chicken.

609
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,700
A sip of wine and a bite of meat.

610
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,060
Then beat me up.

611
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,730
Beat you up? Why?

612
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,540
I don’t know.

613
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,730
Don’t knights like you have to fight

614
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,330
after drinking to feel comfortable?

615
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,300
That’s what the storyteller
in Guangtai House said.

616
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,970
Give me some wine.

617
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,490
Just this little bit?

618
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,060
With your little tolerance,

619
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,210
if you get drunk,

620
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,370
I’ll have to carry you down.

621
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,090
I don’t ask for trouble.

622
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,580
I’m glad that you don’t ask for trouble.

623
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,010
If you really don’t want to
go to the base,

624
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,580
just talk to Commandery Prince An.

625
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,970
Or you can just leave.

626
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,490
Commandery Prince An
won’t make you go there.

627
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,850
Why are you drinking alone
on the roof of the County Office?

628
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,730
I have to go this time.

629
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:40,900
Chu.

630
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,970
Do you really like Chu Chu

631
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,060
or are you just used to boss her around?

632
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,130
I never wanted to boss her around.

633
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,370
She is the best coroner in the world.

634
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,730
She is bold but cautious.

635
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
I respect her

636
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,540
just as I respect all talented
and upright people.

637
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,180
She works for me as a coroner.

638
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,580
I’m not bossing her around.

639
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,010
She is helping me.

640
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,250
I’m not talking about coroner.

641
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,700
I’m asking

642
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,370
if you really like her.

643
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,420
She is the best girl in the world.

644
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,580
How can I not like her?

645
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Do you think she is
the best girl in the world?

646
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,330
Don’t you think so?

647
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
She is my sister.

648
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,660
Of course my sister is
the best girl in the world.

649
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,780
But you just...

650
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,010
I saw it.

651
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,060
Are you going to take her with you?

652
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,210
Yes.

653
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,210
The Three Judicial Offices, Chongrenfang,
North Street, Chang’an.

654
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,490
What’s that?

655
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,660
It’s my residence in Chang’an.

656
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,780
You can come to

657
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,250
visit Chu Chu

658
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,090
anytime you want.

659
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,180
(Three Judicial Offices)

660
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,210
Take this token

661
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,090
and come to my residence in Chang’an.

662
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,210
No one will stop you when they see it.

663
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,660
(Three Judicial Offices)

664
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,610
Remember what you just said.

665
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,780
No matter

666
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,900
how high your rank is,

667
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,540
no matter how far you are,

668
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,580
if you dare hurt Chu Chu,

669
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,850
I will never let you go.

670
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,130
You don’t have to hide it from me.

671
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,490
I don’t know much about politics,

672
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,700
but I also grew up

673
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,060
with you and Commandery Prince An.

674
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,700
I know what you two meant
when you winked at each other.

675
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,700
I understand

676
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,300
that man’s letter

677
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,820
came at a perfect time, didn’t it?

678
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,300
We just caught Li Zhang.

679
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,370
His soldiers

680
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,970
set the Prefect’s Mansion on fire.

681
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,210
Then his man sent such a letter.

682
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,730
Evil spirits.

683
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,210
I think he is the biggest evil.

684
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,900
What if it’s just a coincidence?

685
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,250
Coincidence?

686
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,010
I don’t think you know it.

687
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,540
Commandery Prince An has been
suspecting him for some time.

688
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,180
He asked me to write

689
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,660
a letter of no importance

690
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,700
to throw a stone to clear the road.

691
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,250
As a result,

692
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,780
something is wrong about him.

693
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,500
Your Highness.

694
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,700
Since you think Miss Leng’s grandpa

695
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,890
inviting us to his base is a trap,

696
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,400
why are you still going?

697
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,600
You have to play with fire to stay warm.

698
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,380
Chu Chu, remember,

699
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,340
after we arrive at the base,

700
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,460
except for my brother

701
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,980
and the people coming with us
from Chang’an,

702
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,860
any other people’s words
can’t be trusted.

703
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,130
I got it.

704
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,800
Your Highness, you are
preparing for the worst again, right?

705
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,700
Miss Leng must feel bad now.

706
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,180
I know that feeling.

707
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,180
The feeling that you can’t stop worrying

708
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,330
if your family is a bad person.

709
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,850
She will think it through.

710
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,460
Even if she can’t
think it through for now,

711
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,610
someone will help her think it through.

712
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,970
Leng Yue, he is still your grandpa.

713
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,010
You know what kind of person he is.

714
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,180
You know him too, don’t you?

715
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,660
Considering how cowardly you are,

716
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,730
even you volunteer to go to the base
and fish for information

717
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,250
with Commandery Prince An’s guards.

718
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,300
What does that mean?

719
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,970
Obviously, you think
he is up to something

720
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,300
and you want to find it out.

721
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,970
Duke Chang

722
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,850
and the son of Emperor Wuzong

723
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,770
are just excuses

724
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,740
and disguises.

725
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,010
I think

726
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,610
probably he is the mastermind.

727
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,640
Hush.

728
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,180
You can’t say that.

729
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,820
Why not?

730
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,900
Even you care about my feelings.

731
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,700
What about him?

732
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,850
When did he ever care about me?

733
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,540
He doesn’t care about me now.

734
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
He was the same
when my father and mother died.

735
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,490
He only sent a letter

736
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,540
that Military Commissioner
of Jiannan rebelled.

737
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,460
He was stationed in the Southwest
and couldn’t return to Chang’an.

738
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,460
Then my parents

739
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,380
died in the insurgency in Chang’an.

740
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,410
Now I know it.

741
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,930
It was not a rebellion, it was...!

742
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,390
Hush.

743
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,540
You can’t say that, either.

744
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,060
I used to think he was just ruthless,

745
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,250
but at least he was loyal
to his country.

746
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,540
Now I know

747
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,580
he isn’t even loyal.

748
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,060
What kind of person is he?

749
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,420
He is a bastard!

750
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,730
Give it to me.

751
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,490
Give it back to me! I bought it!

752
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,970
I also bought the roast chicken.

753
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,180
It didn’t cost me lesser.

754
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,580
Let’s change it.

755
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,180
Leng Yue, do you know why

756
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,850
Commandery Prince An
can solve every case?

757
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,210
Normally,

758
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,940
when there are several

759
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,210
totally different possibilities,

760
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,060
people will subconsciously choose

761
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,900
the one they want to believe.

762
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,900
If they can’t disprove

763
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,820
the other possibilities,

764
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,580
they will start to feel
irritable and depressed.

765
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,250
Just like the way you are.

766
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,970
You are even venting your feelings
on the roast chicken.

767
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,130
But Commandery Prince An is different.

768
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,090
When he is in such a situation,

769
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,010
he will choose not to believe any of it

770
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,700
and then deduce the truth step by step
through the evidence he collects.

771
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,900
And the truth

772
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,780
might be completely different

773
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,660
from the previous possibilities.

774
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,940
Just like Li Zhang and Xu Rugui.

775
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,970
Even the storyteller in Guangtai House,

776
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,900
can’t make up
such a strange story, right?

777
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,420
But when Commandery Prince An
shows you the evidence,

778
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,700
you have to believe

779
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,010
that’s the truth.

780
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,250
What do you want to say?

781
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,130
I just want to say

782
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,180
we are all mortals.

783
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,420
We have feelings.

784
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,940
It’s normal to feel
agitated and depressed

785
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,330
because you can’t prove
your speculation for now.

786
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,010
But you also need to know

787
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,490
the truth in the end

788
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,610
might be completely different
from what you think now.

789
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,410
No matter what the final truth is,

790
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,010
we will face it together with you.

791
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,190
As for me sneaking into the base,

792
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,010
don’t worry about it.

793
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,650
I’m an expert in putting on an act

794
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,480
and asking around.

795
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,730
Besides, I can still run away
if it doesn’t work out.

796
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,660
You know me.

797
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,090
If I want to escape,

798
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,730
even the guards
in the Palace can’t get me.

799
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,300
Right.

800
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,940
I remember how timid you are.

801
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,010
You must run faster than a rabbit
if anything goes wrong.

802
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,970
I’m not worried about you.

803
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,370
Are you still coming with us?

804
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,180
Of course.

805
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,540
But don’t worry,

806
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,060
I won’t do anything stupid.

807
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,780
I just want to know the truth.

808
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,180
Fine.

809
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,540
Go back to your room
after you finish the roast chicken.

810
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,850
I’ve prepared the bath water for you.

811
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Go back to my room after
I finish the roast chicken?

812
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,580
You took my wine.

813
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,580
According to the storyteller,

814
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,010
I should beat you up first.

815
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,850
Don’t run!

816
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,860
(Ready to pick up the goods)

817
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,210
Manager.

818
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,850
I’ve tidied the things up.

819
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,730
Go to the pharmacy now

820
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,900
and get this prescription filled.

821
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,130
Remember.

822
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,970
(Prescription)
Don’t just go to one pharmacy.

823
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Get it filled in several pharmacies.

824
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,960
Who is so bold

825
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,080
to intercept and kill a minister

826
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,680
and rescue the criminal under my watch!

827
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,290
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

828
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,720
Calm my anger?

829
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,370
How can I calm my anger?

830
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,130
Xue Rucheng took the criminal Xu Rugui
back to Chang’an.

831
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,210
But Xu Rugui was taken away
in the suburbs of Chang’an.

832
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,770
As the Minister of War,

833
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,290
he was nearly killed

834
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,370
under the protection
of the Imperial Guards

835
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,810
in broad daylight!

836
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,130
We even don’t know who did it.

837
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,130
Well,

838
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,900
Commandery Prince An
is not in Chang’an now.

839
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,130
Is there no judge
who can arrest criminals?

840
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,130
Your Majesty, these officials
are incompetent.

841
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,570
You can denounce them

842
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,540
and punish them as you want.

843
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,560
You don’t have to save face for them

844
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,930
and make yourself feel bad.

845
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,500
Your Majesty, getting angry
can hurt your health.

846
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,610
You must take care of yourself.

847
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,940
Your Majesty, you have been busy with
the national affairs recently.

848
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,460
Have a cup of soothing tea first.

849
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,010
Master.

850
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,590
When it comes to making
the Emperor happy,

851
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,800
you are the number one in the world.

852
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,750
No one can do it better than you do.

853
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,430
Listen,

854
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,190
only when I am happy,

855
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,760
I’ll have the mood to make him happy

856
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,360
Well, Master.

857
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,130
What are you happy about?

858
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,200
Tell me

859
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,950
and let me share your happiness.

860
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,880
What else could it be?

861
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,890
Zhou Han finally

862
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,290
did a good job.

863
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,430
Shouldn’t I be happy about it?

864
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,160
Is there any news from Zhou Han?

865
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,120
Where did he take Xu Rugui to?

866
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,070
Xu Rugui was taken...

867
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,150
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

868
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,710
Wait, Master.

869
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,470
Hold on.

870
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,190
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

871
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,800
Yeah.

872
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,560
Zhou Han only said

873
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,770
he planted his men
among the soldiers of Shence Army

874
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,770
who escorted Xu Rugui.

875
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,520
But he didn’t mention
that he got Xu Rugui out.
