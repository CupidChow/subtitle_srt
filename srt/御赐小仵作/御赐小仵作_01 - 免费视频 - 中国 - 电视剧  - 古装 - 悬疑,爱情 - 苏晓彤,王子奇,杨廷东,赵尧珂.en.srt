00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

2
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,900
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,550
In the middle and late Tang Dynasty,

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,190
eunuchs set Emperor Xuanzong
on the throne.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,400
To please them,

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,680
Emperor Xuanzong let them
take charge of Imperial Armies

7
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,160
to keep the Imperial Palace safe.

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
Meanwhile,

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,400
he established Three Judicial Offices,

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
making Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu

11
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,550
managing all criminal cases.

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Three Judicial Offices value coroners.

13
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,550
The Coroner Qualification Test is held

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,400
in the capital city ever year,

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,870
without any restriction.

16
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,590
Talented people will be recruited.

17
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,310
(Jinguang Gate)
During the test season,

18
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,950
coroners from different towns
come to the capital.

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Here you are.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,680
See you. See you.

21
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,600
Welcome again.

22
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,440
Have a look at the hairpins.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,080
Miss, have a look.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,110
What’s this?

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,980
It’s food.

26
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,110
(Chu Chu)

27
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,160
I’m in Chang’an at last.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,390
I will pass the test for a coroner.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Handsome Judge,

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
wait for me.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,470
Stop.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,390
Show me your pass.

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,140
(Pass)

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,020
(Approved)

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,320
You can go.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,670
Come and have a look.

37
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,470
Make way, please.

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,670
Come and have a look!

39
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,160
Come and have a look!

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,550
(Jing Yi, Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review)

41
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,110
Sir,

42
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,000
what happened to you?

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,270
The old man was hit.

44
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,910
Are you alright?

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,520
I’m terribly sorry.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,960
Shall I take you to see a doctor?

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
I don’t want to waste your time.

48
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,670
It doesn’t matter.

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,470
I’m old already.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,190
The bruise looks weird.

51
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,960
But now that I’m hurt,

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
I can’t work in the fields for months.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,030
Why is it red, but not swollen?

54
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,320
I don’t have money to see a doctor.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,750
If you don’t mind,

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,800
could you give me a bit money
for medical expenses?

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,910
All right.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,750
I should do that.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,110
He certainly should.

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,320
The old man was hit so badly.

61
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,030
Wait!

62
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,880
Thank you.

63
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,440
Here you are.

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,190
-Sir, here you are.
-Thank you.

65
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,270
You lied! The bruise is fake!

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,030
What’s she talking about?

68
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,110
Lied?

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,550
You faked the bruise to deceive people.

70
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,600
It feels a bit hot,

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,440
but it’s not swollen at all.

72
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,360
Everyone, take a look,

73
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,160
the bruise has one color.

74
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,830
The edge is clear, too.

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,910
Obviously,

76
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,110
it’s made of burned beech.

77
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,390
Also,

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,520
he isn’t an old man.

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,240
He’s got the white of the eye.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Now that it’s the white of the eye,

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,270
it must be white. Or can it be black?

82
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,720
It can’t be black.
But it should be yellow.

83
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,390
When people get old,
the white of the eye turns yellow.

84
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,110
The older they are,

85
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,780
(No turbidity. Over 35 years old.)
the more turbid it turns.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,160
That’s how we describe old men.

87
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,600
But look at him.

88
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,600
The white of his eyes
doesn’t change at all.

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,920
People can fake their appearance
and even voice.

90
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,670
But they can’t

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,950
fake the white of the eye!

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,720
Look at his eyes.

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Go to hell!

94
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,950
Fraud, don’t run!

95
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,880
The Court of Judicial Review!

96
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,900
Fraud!

97
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,790
Take him back.

98
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,000
All right. Don’t crowd here.

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,600
Don’t block the traffic!

100
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,320
Go, go, go.

101
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,110
What a fraud!

102
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,390
He even gave the fraud some money.

103
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,000
Chu Chu?

104
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,040
Yes. You’re an official
of the Court of Judicial Review?

105
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,600
I’m Jing Yi, Vice Minister

106
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,390
of the Court of Judicial Review.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Greetings, Lord Jing.

108
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,760
Stand up, please.

109
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,000
This isn’t what ordinary people use.

110
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,790
Tell me. Why did you come to Chang’an?

111
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,920
I’m not a businesswoman.

112
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,440
I got a lift with travelling merchants.

113
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,110
I’m a coroner.

114
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,230
These are my working tools.

115
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,230
Go away! Go away!

116
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,390
Commandery Prince An?

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,070
Who dared to kick me off!

118
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,020
(Wu Jiang, Chief Guardsman)

119
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,620
(Sun Mingde, Palace Eunuch)
Wu Jiang,

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,030
were you blind?

121
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,440
Let me show you who’s blind?

122
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,320
You!

123
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,040
Greetings, Your Highness!

124
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,320
I’m so sorry.

125
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
I didn’t know you were here,
Your Highness.

126
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,200
According to Tang laws,

127
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,720
who rides a horse in the downtown
will be flogged 50 times.

128
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,480
Wu Jiang.

129
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,000
Here.

130
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,600
Your Highness,

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
I came out to check the accounts
of Shence Army,

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,830
under the command of Eunuch Qin!

133
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
He’s waiting for me...!

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,950
Why are you so nagging?

135
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,640
Lord Wu, Lord Wu,

136
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,880
it’s for the toilet thing.

137
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
That’s what I want.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,230
It’s for the toilet thing.

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,830
He does strict enforcement
with no fear for nobilities.

140
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,350
Legal and illegal people all obey him.

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,670
You said you came here to be a coroner.

142
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,760
Do you mean
taking the Coroner Qualification Test?

143
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,110
Yes.

144
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,550
After I pass the test,

145
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,040
I’ll be an official coroner.

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
Is there really no restriction

147
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,600
for the Coroner Qualification Test

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,000
and any can take part in it?

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,480
Yes.

150
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
(Court of Judicial Review)
Go to the test with this

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
and no one will stop you.

152
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,270
Really?

153
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,510
Thank you, Lord Jing.

154
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,140
(Court of Judicial Review)

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,780
(Three Judicial Offices)

156
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,780
(Two Merits Hall)

157
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,000
Excuse me,

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,350
didn’t we pass the test yesterday?

159
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,550
Why is there a test again?

160
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,440
Did anyone help you to come?

161
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,270
Why don’t you even know this?

162
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,640
It was the Qualification Test yesterday.

163
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,510
Now it’s the selection test
Commandery Prince An holds.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If anyone passes it,

165
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
he can be admitted
to Three Judicial Offices

166
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,230
and work for Xiao Jinyu.

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,880
Small Goldfish?

168
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,550
The name sounds so odd.

169
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,670
What Small Goldfish?

170
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,640
You don’t even know
Commandery Prince An?

171
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,480
Everyone in Three Judicial Offices

172
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,760
fears him.

173
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
Small Goldfish?

174
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,230
(Two Merits Hall)

175
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,110
Commandery Prince An?

176
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,160
What Small Goldfish?

177
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,880
Don’t talk nonsense.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,110
When you hear your name,

179
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,350
come in with me.

180
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,320
Chu Chu from Qianzhou.

181
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,880
I am.

182
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,270
I’m Chu Chu.

183
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Hold it steadily. Watch your steps!

184
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,110
Be quick!

185
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,920
Senior Jing,

186
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,110
-why don’t we see your son today?
-Be smart.

187
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,320
(Jing Zhi, Grand Preceptor)
Commandery Prince An summoned him.

188
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,880
His Majesty asked them
to solve Assistant Wu’s case

189
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,910
(Wang Jun, Minister of Revenue)
within a time limit.

190
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,030
As estimated,

191
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,960
it’s the deadline.

192
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,710
(Han Ji, Minister of Justice)
But His Highness still works on the test.

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,150
He’s so calm.

194
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,350
How arrogant he is!

195
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,150
Watch your language, Lord Han.

196
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,710
His Highness is your superior.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,080
You mustn’t disrespect him.

198
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,080
What superior!

199
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,880
Since Tang Dynasty was founded,

200
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,550
the Ministry of Justice, the Court
of Judicial Review and the Censorate

201
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,670
do their duties separately

202
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,350
and solve criminal cases together.

203
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
I wonder what His Majesty thinks of.

204
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,670
He established Three Judicial Offices
for Commandery Prince An,

205
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
overriding these three ministries.

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,640
Officials like us must take orders

207
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,960
from such a young man.

208
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,640
He’s too young and ignorant!

209
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,220
(Xiao Jinyu, Commandery Prince An)

210
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,910
I’m Chu Chu.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,670
What’s your family name?

212
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,000
Chu.

213
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,350
Chu Chu is my name.

214
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,790
It means a lovely girl.

215
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,080
It’s simple and easy to be remembered.

216
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,590
Candidate Chu Chu,

217
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,280
there’re two parts for the autopsy test.

218
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,230
Give correct inspections
and you’ll pass it.

219
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,030
You’ll have a high score
for offering extra clues.

220
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,400
The final paper

221
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,470
subjects to my record.

222
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Do you understand?

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,550
Yes.

224
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,350
Then get started, please.

225
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,110
Wait. What are these?

226
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,230
(Yin-yang Pestle)
These are autopsy tools I made.

227
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,640
This is Yin-yang Pestle.

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,790
It’s made of hardwood.

229
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,960
It has a cone-shape with one thick end
and one thin end.

230
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
Two ends are wrapped with cotton.

231
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
The thin end is for checking the nose

232
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,710
while the thick end is for the throat.

233
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,760
Yin-yang Pestle?

234
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,520
He was burned

235
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,110
and also soaked in water.

236
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,280
On his arms and neck are

237
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,880
lightly bronzing dendritic patterns.

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Finger bones of his right hand
have pale osseous pearls.

239
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,880
The yellow grease on the dead body

240
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,470
isn’t all solidified grease.

241
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,550
It’s...

242
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,710
The smell of sesame oil.

243
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,710
Man,

244
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
over 35 years old.

245
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,400
Around 1.7 meters tall.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,280
His corpse is burned

247
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,320
and curled up.

248
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,280
He died nearly half a month ago.

249
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,640
What’s the cause of his death?

250
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,440
It’s in his mouth and nose, I guess.

251
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,400
I knew it!

252
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,790
There’s soot in his mouth and nose.

253
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,110
So, he was burned to death.

254
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,440
What a useful tool!

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,440
What’s the nature of this case?

256
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,670
Nature?

257
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,110
Was he suicided

258
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,550
or was he killed?

259
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,230
He wasn’t suicided or killed.

260
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,910
He died of accident.

261
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,520
Accident?

262
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,550
His skull was fractured with a crack.

263
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,110
He was burned badly.

264
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,230
After cleaning his neck,

265
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,960
I saw some dendritic patterns.

266
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,590
He was struck by lightning.

267
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,710
Also, he was soaked in water

268
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,000
after he was burned.

269
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,080
So, he was struck by lightning

270
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,150
before it rained.

271
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,880
It was midsummer half a month ago,

272
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,470
when there were the most thunderstorms.

273
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,910
How could he be burned like this
if he was simply struck by lightning?

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,710
I think this is how he was dead.

275
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,670
He was possibly walking in the rain

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
with a lantern in his hand.

277
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,200
By the way,

278
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,280
he was carrying some sesame oil, too.

279
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,350
When the lightning hit the tree,

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,030
he was putting his right hand
against the tree.

281
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,840
What are you doing?

282
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,960
Stand up and talk normally!

283
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,910
I’m imitating how he died.

284
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,110
Interesting.

285
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,110
Unluckily, he was struck by lightning

286
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,710
and passed out immediately.

287
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,320
He got the tinder

288
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,640
and flammable sesame oil.

289
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,670
The tinder burned the oil

290
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,670
and burned him to death

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,080
when he was in a coma.

292
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,910
He was badly burned,

293
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,280
but I could feel that

294
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,840
he had fractures

295
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
in his ribs, arms and shanks

296
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,470
more than once or twice.

297
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,150
He wounded

298
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,550
such vulnerable parts

299
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,550
when he risked his life fighting.

300
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,520
If he weren’t so badly burned,

301
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,550
we could have seen his scars.

302
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,030
No matter what a bad temper he had,

303
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
he wouldn’t fight people desperately

304
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,000
almost every day,

305
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,440
unless that was his job!

306
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,790
What else do you know?

307
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,760
That’s all.

308
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,230
My Lord, may I check the next body?

309
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,320
Check her background carefully.

310
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,860
(Test sheet, Chu Chu, female)

311
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,280
Senior Jing, you have no idea.

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,550
The two corpses Commandery Prince An use

313
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,710
for the test are from unsolved cases

314
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,880
in the capital.

315
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,470
One of the corpses is

316
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,640
Assistant Yan Ming
in the Palace Library.

317
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,520
Yan Ming?

318
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Man,

319
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
over 40 years old.

320
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,150
His corpse has the bruises all over.

321
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,670
Some flesh of his mouth, nose,
chest and ribs became putrid.

322
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,670
He died half a month ago, I guess.

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,790
His heart was stabbed through
by a sharp thing.

324
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,880
It was the only wound

325
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
and mortal wound.

326
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,150
The sharp thing

327
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,280
has a spike,

328
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,150
is as thin as wheat straw,

329
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,080
and as long as one meter.

330
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,960
What exactly is the thing

331
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,350
as thin as wheat straw,
as long as one meter

332
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,790
and with a spike?

333
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,550
I don’t know.

334
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,880
You even managed to guess the shape.

335
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
Can’t you know what it is?

336
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,520
I didn’t guess.

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,030
I figured it out.

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,590
I was taught.

339
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,840
A coroner’s duty is to honestly record

340
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,960
what he sees,

341
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,230
smells,

342
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,200
hears of,

343
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,000
and touches.

344
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,790
He knows when he sees, smells,
hears of and touches.

345
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
Otherwise, he doesn’t know.

346
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,440
Deducing or judging
isn’t a coroner’s duty.

347
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,670
We can’t talk without evidence.

348
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,320
How does she know that?

349
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,000
What?

350
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,550
I mean I told you what I figured out.

351
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,880
I can only tell you what I know.

352
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,110
Without enough evidence,

353
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,030
I can’t talk nonsense.

354
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,710
I... I also know one thing.

355
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,030
I know he was murdered

356
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,150
and he knew the murderer.

357
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,280
You don’t say!

358
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,470
What?

359
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,320
You want to wake him up and ask him?

360
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,790
I don’t mean that.

361
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,080
I mean he knows the murderer

362
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,000
and the murderer knows him, too.

363
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,030
All right.

364
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,960
Go to the wing hall
for injury inspection.

365
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Thank you, My Lord.

366
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,230
She even knows rules for coroners,

367
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,200
deodorizing the smell
by vinegar steaming.

368
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,880
Your Highness.

369
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,080
She’s the female coroner

370
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,710
Vice Minister Jing asked you
to take care of?

371
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,110
Yes.

372
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
Please understand, Your Highness.

373
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,230
If it weren’t for his sake,

374
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,150
we wouldn’t have let a girl
do the autopsy.

375
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,910
(Jiangshan Hall)
You’re not qualified to get in.

376
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,230
(Jiangshan Hall)
Please wait here.

377
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,400
(Emperor Xuanzong)
Your Majesty, Academician Xue is here.

378
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,960
(Xue Rucheng, Academician)
Greetings, Your Majesty.

379
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,670
Many officials have been complaining

380
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,230
about Commandery Prince An.

381
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,110
You’re his teacher.

382
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Don’t you defend him?

383
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,070
Your Majesty, you think highly of him

384
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,230
and let him take charge
of Three Judicial Offices.

385
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,190
(Qin Luan, Acting Chief Eunuch)
You have your own decision.

386
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,430
I don’t need to defend him.

387
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,830
I let him take charge
of Three Judicial Office,

388
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,640
for the sake that

389
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,560
he’s as upright

390
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,310
as his father Xiao Heng.

391
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,350
But being an official and solving cases
are different things.

392
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,920
Qin Luan.

393
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,830
Yes.

394
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,000
I remember

395
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,070
when Xiao Heng checked the rebel case
in the Southwest,

396
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,950
you went there to help him, right?

397
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,310
Yes. You have a good memory,
Your Majesty.

398
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,680
At the behest of His Majesty,

399
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,560
Military Commissioner Chen Ying
of Jiannan

400
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,760
and Prince Consort Xiao Heng rebelled.

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,520
They’ll be executed right here!

402
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,160
Your Grace!

403
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,040
Chen Ying!

404
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,760
Your Grace, go!

405
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,520
You’ll have to

406
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
vindicate our soldiers!

407
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,710
Unfortunately, I was too weak

408
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,560
to live up to Emperor Wenzong’s trust.

409
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,110
I failed to bring him back alive.

410
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,640
I’m guilty, Your Majesty!

411
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,190
I forgot the manner.
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

412
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,310
I noticed you were limping.

413
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,640
Were you flogged?

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Who flogged you?

415
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
For your information, Your Majesty,

416
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,470
when I was going out of town
under your command,

417
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
I disturbed Commandery Prince An.

418
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,680
His Highness then punished me

419
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,560
and had me flogged!

420
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,000
You may both rise.

421
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,640
Xue,

422
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,040
didn’t you teach Xiao Jinyu

423
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,040
to be loyal and considerate?

424
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,160
I neglected my duty to instruct him.

425
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,350
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

426
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
As for Sun Mingde...

427
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,470
The Palace Domestic Service decides

428
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,190
how he should be punished.

429
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,430
Today, Xiao Jinyu didn’t tell me
before he flogged my eunuch.

430
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,160
Will he dare to kill people
without telling me?

431
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,470
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

432
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,950
His Highness was simply so young

433
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,470
that he lost his temper.

434
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,950
Now that he has a temper,

435
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,640
you should instruct him.

436
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,880
He even uses the corpse of an official

437
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,350
for the coroner test.

438
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,760
If he can’t solve the case,

439
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,430
other officials will impeach him!

440
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,830
By then, I’ll punish you, too!

441
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,400
Yes.

442
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,110
Your Highness,

443
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,880
Jing Yi is so useless.

444
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,350
He’s checking Yan Ming’s case
for half a month,

445
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,280
but he has figured out nothing.

446
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,070
As soon as you take care of the case,
you’ve found new clues.

447
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
This case is difficult for him.

448
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,310
Your Highness, you think highly
of the female coroner?

449
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,190
No.

450
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,920
Jing Yi wants me to notice her.

451
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,800
Vice Minister Jing,

452
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,190
the next candidate is waiting out there.

453
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,710
How’s the testing body? Has he come?

454
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,710
No.

455
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,710
He’s in the latrine,

456
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,640
because of diarrhea.

457
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,430
Diarrhea might be a big problem.

458
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,880
Have someone check on him.

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Ask the next candidate to wait
for a moment.

460
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,880
Yes.

461
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,950
Stay here and wait.

462
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,040
Don’t run about,

463
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,040
make a noise

464
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,230
or look around.

465
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
When the testing body comes,
you can start.

466
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,710
Yes.

467
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,760
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

468
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,230
Is that a girl taking the test?

469
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,070
Yes, Your Highness.

470
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,190
She has been in for a while.

471
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,310
He’s got a bruise on his forehead.

472
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,190
He must be the testing body for me.

473
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,590
You’re the testing body, right?

474
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,350
What took you so long?

475
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,400
I’ve been waiting for a while.

476
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,760
My Lord, he has come.

477
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,070
May I start now?

478
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:27,920
How dare you!

479
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,710
You can.

480
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,310
Vice Minister Jing.

481
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,160
Lord Jing.

482
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,350
The candidate and the testing body
have come.

483
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,470
Testing body?

484
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,350
All right, then.

485
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,430
Now that you’re both here,

486
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,190
let’s get started.

487
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,880
Man,

488
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,400
around 1.8 meters tall.

489
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,680
There’s a bruise on his forehead.

490
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,880
Get down.

491
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,920
Get down, or I can’t see clearly.

492
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,920
Just do it.

493
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,350
Now that you agree
to be the testing body,

494
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,710
you should cooperate.

495
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
It was hit by something hard.

496
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,190
No medicine has been applied yet.

497
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,830
He was possibly hurt last night.

498
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,680
Besides blood stasis,

499
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,830
there’re slight scratches.

500
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,000
I think he was hit

501
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,760
by a flat and roughly polished weapon,

502
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
made of hardwood.

503
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,190
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

504
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,430
There’s a bruise as wide as palm
on the back of your left hand.

505
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,350
It was pressed by something heavy.

506
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,590
I guess

507
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,760
someone stepped on your hand.

508
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
A man.

509
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,040
You wounded the end of your palms

510
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,680
by putting them
against a smooth hard thing.

511
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,640
You nearly got the wounds
at the same time.

512
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,040
Go away.

513
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,190
All right. Take off your clothes.

514
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,800
Go on.

515
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,430
No.

516
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,000
You were right.

517
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,160
You guessed right, too.

518
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,640
I’ve got a bruise on my tailbone.

519
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,160
But you don’t need to check that.

520
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,880
You can stop now.

521
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,830
No way!

522
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,950
This isn’t over yet.

523
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,110
I can’t even fill half of the sheet.

524
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,400
If I stop now,

525
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
I won’t get a good score.

526
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,520
You’re the testing body.

527
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,230
You can’t decide if I continue.

528
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
If you don’t want
to take off your clothes,

529
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,040
let me help you.

530
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,680
What does she want to do?

531
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,800
What does he want to do?

532
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,800
What does she want to do?

533
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,110
What does she want to do?

534
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,280
When did I say I was the testing body?

535
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,640
You said that

536
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,520
outside the room.

537
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,760
I did?

538
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,470
No. No.

539
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,830
You said that!

540
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,070
I only said you could start the test.

541
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,680
Jing Yi.

542
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,070
Yes, Your Highness. What do you want?

543
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,040
Sorry for the offense.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

544
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,920
Your...

545
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,400
Your Highness?

546
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,560
You... you’re Commandery Prince An,
Small Goldfish?

547
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,640
Shut up! Don’t take nonsense!

548
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,830
Salute to His Highness and say sorry!

549
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,590
Are you superior to a prefect?

550
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,640
What do you think you’re doing?

551
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,640
I never met
such an important official before.

552
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,400
But I met a prefect.

553
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,920
When the Prefect of Qianzhou

554
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,350
visited our town,

555
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,470
our magistrate taught us.

556
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,470
When we met the Prefect,

557
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,000
we should knee and kowtow.

558
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,680
I kowtowed once to him.

559
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,070
Now that you’re superior,

560
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,590
I kowtowed a few more times.

561
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,640
Is that enough?

562
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Master, it was so wise of you!

563
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,590
His Majesty appreciates Xiao Jinyu
for his justness.

564
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,070
How were you sure that

565
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,400
he would defend me today?

566
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,830
Han Ji is the Minister of Personnel,

567
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,280
but he has to take orders
from Xiao Jinyu.

568
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,230
He can’t be feeling good.

569
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,230
When he knows

570
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Xiao Jinyu used Yan Ming’s corpse
for the test,

571
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,310
he would certainly impeach him.

572
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,280
Those who Xiao Jinyu has offended

573
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,280
are happy to help, too.

574
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,070
Xiao Jinyu was punished to repent.

575
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,430
Today, it was also possible

576
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,280
even if I wanted him

577
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,110
to be flogged 50 times too.

578
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,920
Xiao Jinyu is known to be smart.

579
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,950
As far as I see,

580
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,590
you’re much smarter.

581
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,110
Not to mention Xiao Jinyu,

582
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,070
even if his father were still alive...

583
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
I’m sorry.

584
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,950
Don’t get angry, Master.

585
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,640
His Majesty mentioned it today.

586
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,230
Xiao Heng ran away! After him!

587
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,830
Be quick!

588
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,950
If Xiao Heng were still alive,

589
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,000
we would be dead!

590
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,110
Yes.

591
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,160
Think more and talk less.

592
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
Or you can’t survive!

593
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,070
Yes.

594
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,350
Greetings, Eunuch Qin.

595
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,470
General Zhou,

596
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,160
may I have a word with you?

597
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,500
(Zhou Han, Commandant of Shence Army)

598
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,280
Find an excuse and check

599
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,800
what happened in Three Judicial Offices.

600
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,350
Yes.

601
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,640
Your Highness,
the previous tests are over.

602
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
Check carefully

603
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,070
if there’s anything wrong information
on the sheet.

604
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,190
(Test sheet, Chu Chu, female)

605
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,520
I filled it myself.

606
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,680
Nothing is wrong.

607
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,520
You came from Pingle Town,
Guanling County, Qianzhou?

608
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,680
You’re from an official family,

609
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,110
and a literary family.

610
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,040
And all your families are loyal?

611
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,680
Yes.

612
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Nonsense!

613
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,400
You’re obviously from a coroner family.

614
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Your grandfather is still alive.

615
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,520
Your father doesn’t have any brother,

616
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,880
but you have one.

617
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,520
Your brother even has a dog.

618
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,280
How do you even know that?

619
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,040
You wear big clothes

620
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,190
and they’re nearly new.

621
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,190
They are altered, but not tailored.

622
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,000
It means you borrowed them.

623
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,830
On your wristbands and hems,

624
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,950
there’re old and new dog scratches.

625
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
Considering your age,

626
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
they can’t be your father’s.

627
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
They’re very likely
to be your brother’s.

628
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,470
He can even see that?

629
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,710
There’s the smell of honey locust
and atractylodes on your clothes.

630
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,230
Now that you wash clothes with them,

631
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
it means the clothes belong to someone

632
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,230
who is a coroner, too.

633
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,560
He’s awesome!

634
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,280
Coroner is usually a family job.

635
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
As far as I see your autopsy,

636
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,590
you’re quite proficient

637
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,590
in some unpopular skills.

638
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,950
Such skills have a conflict
with Tang Laws.

639
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,880
They weren’t invented in recent years.

640
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,640
You know such skills.

641
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,110
It means your ancestors were coroners

642
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,560
before the reign of Emperor Taizong.

643
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,310
You’re right about everything!

644
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
You look handsome,

645
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,920
sound perspicacious
and take care of criminal cases.

646
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,520
You... you’re Handsome Judge?

647
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,640
Handsome Judge?

648
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,520
The chief of Six Gates!

649
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,310
Chief of Six Gates?

650
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,880
He’s untraceable.

651
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,230
It’s always hard to trace him down.

652
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,280
Nine Constables all take his orders.

653
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,520
He’s the chief of Six Gates,
taking care of all criminal cases,

654
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,430
known as Handsome Judge.

655
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,280
A constable with great martial arts

656
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,470
follows him,

657
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,040
named ﻿Soul-chasing Sword.

658
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,640
I’ve never heard of him.

659
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,310
I’m not Handsome Judge, either.

660
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,680
You get the wrong man.

661
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,190
But...

662
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,230
You’re as awesome as him.

663
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,430
Stop talking nonsense.

664
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,310
Now that I’m right about everything,

665
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,760
you admit that

666
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,680
you filled fake information
on the test sheet

667
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,070
and lied about your family condition?

668
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,680
But I told the truth.

669
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,040
My families are coroners for generations

670
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,350
and work in Yamen.

671
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,280
Aren’t we an official family?

672
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,430
My families can also read.

673
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
We have a lot of books.

674
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,430
Aren’t we a literary family?

675
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,350
Also, we’re good people

676
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,640
who have done nothing bad.

677
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,000
Aren’t we loyal?

678
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,160
Kind of.

679
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,590
I heard what you said

680
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,680
during the autopsy.

681
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,950
I want you to explain more

682
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,110
about something.

683
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,560
When you checked the dead man

684
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,800
who was stabbed by a sharp thing,

685
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,830
you said he knew the murderer

686
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,430
and the murderer knew him, too.

687
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,070
Do you mean

688
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,590
they’re acquainted?

689
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,350
Yes, you’re right.

690
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,470
How did you know that?

691
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,470
I...

692
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,230
I’m afraid I can’t explain clearly.

693
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,800
Can I gesture?

694
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,590
Yes.

695
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,310
Judged from his wound,

696
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,070
when he was killed,

697
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,830
he was facing the murderer.

698
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,590
Just like...

699
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,560
this.

700
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,590
What are you doing?

701
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,710
I’m trying to show you.

702
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,520
Wu Jiang.

703
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,280
He was offensive.

704
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
I apologize on his behalf.

705
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,070
It doesn’t matter.

706
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,710
I...

707
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,400
I was offensive, too.

708
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,520
Even if this was how he died,

709
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,590
why did it mean

710
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,520
he knew the murderer?

711
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,070
If he didn’t know the murderer,

712
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,590
he would have reacted

713
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,280
just like he did.

714
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,400
As long as he had struggled,

715
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,400
he wouldn’t have had
such a smooth wound.

716
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,160
The brush is simply 20cm long.

717
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,000
But the weapon was a meter long.

718
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,350
He had much more time

719
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,470
to respond.

720
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,950
However strong the murderer was,

721
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,040
he could have time to seize the weapon

722
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,830
when he was stabbed in his face.

723
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,470
But within such a long time,

724
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,950
he didn’t struggle at all.

725
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,470
It means he never expected that man

726
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,560
to kill him.

727
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,000
He didn’t want to believe that
even when he was dying.

728
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,310
You know clearly what a dead man thinks.

729
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Sure.

730
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,680
Dead men are different
from living people.

731
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,350
You can learn from their corpse

732
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
about they thought and did before death.

733
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,880
It’s much easier to understand them
than living people.

734
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,070
What else can you see from his corpse?

735
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,000
One more thing.

736
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,350
But I haven’t seen

737
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,310
where he was killed.

738
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,040
I can’t talk without evidence.

739
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,230
I can show you that place.

740
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,470
Do you want to do this for me?

741
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,640
Yes. Of course!

742
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,000
(Two Merits Hall)

743
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,350
Your Highness.

744
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,640
You really don’t know Six Gates?

745
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,040
It’s a wonderful place.

746
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,350
There’re even female constables.

747
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,280
I thought

748
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,560
Six Gates was the only place

749
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
where women could work.

750
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,800
You’re sure she wasn’t lying?

751
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
Why do I think
she keeps talking nonsense?

752
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,800
I work for His Highness

753
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,880
by judging if someone’s lying.

754
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,880
Even if you don’t trust me,

755
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,800
you should trust my ancestral skill.

756
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,230
I hear you got her back from the street.

757
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Yes.

758
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,520
What do you mean got her back?

759
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,070
I did that for the sake of her fate
with His Highness.

760
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
See? His Highness noticed her.

761
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,880
I’m serious.

762
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,350
(Three Judicial Offices)

763
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,230
Greetings, Your Highness.

764
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,880
Who are you?

765
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,190
You may rise.

766
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,880
I’m a waiter at Fusheng Inn.

767
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,470
The girl...

768
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,710
It’s already bad luck

769
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,470
when a female coroner like her
lives in our inn.

770
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,310
She eve ran away
without paying for the bill!

771
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,600
She left a stone pendant,

772
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,470
saying she would take the test here

773
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,430
-Why does she have the pendant?
-and buy the pendant back afterwards.

774
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,710
-Who exactly is she?
-I think

775
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,320
she simply wants to repudiate the bill!

776
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,520
No, no.

777
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,000
I don’t mean that!

778
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,150
When I woke up this morning,
I found my purse missing.

779
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,150
I was in a hurry for the test.

780
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,390
Then I left the pendant as a pledge

781
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,120
and left a note on the table.

782
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,320
I even put my thumb print on it.

783
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,840
As soon as I make money,
I’ll go pay the bill

784
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,040
and buy back my pendant.

785
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,150
Buy back such a useless stone.

786
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,390
Who are you trying to fool?

787
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,630
It’s not a useless stone!

788
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,360
You’re obviously trying
to repudiate the bill!

789
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,630
I’m not!

790
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,670
How much does she owe you?

791
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,600
Please understand, Your Highness.

792
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,950
Taking accommodation, lamp-oil
and candle

793
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,520
into consideration,

794
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,280
the bill is 37 copper coins.

795
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,910
I’m telling the truth!

796
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,040
Jing Yi.

797
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,120
Thank you. Thank you.

798
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,470
Your Highness, there’s another bill.

799
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,670
She’s a coroner...

800
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,230
How dare you push it!

801
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,910
Sir...

802
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,430
What sir? Vice Minister!

803
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,520
Vice Minister, think about it.

804
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,190
If it were you,

805
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,470
would you like to sleep on a bed
a coroner once slept on

806
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,150
or use the tableware she used?

807
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,320
I would.

808
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,190
Wu Jiang, go back with him

809
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,560
and tell the manager of inn that

810
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,320
I’ll rent the room Miss Chu lived in

811
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,670
for a long term.

812
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
No one shall change anything

813
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,630
in that room.

814
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
I’ll go live there whenever I’m free.

815
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes.

816
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,360
I’ll see

817
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,360
what an inn it is

818
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
that even a waiter can bully a customer

819
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,670
in my place.

820
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,430
Don’t get angry, Your Highness!

821
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,870
I don’t mean that.

822
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,470
I won’t ask for the money. I won’t!

823
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,390
I’m leaving, Your Highness.

824
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,910
Come back.

825
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,150
Her pendant!

826
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,190
And the note she wrote.

827
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,800
Go!

828
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,230
Spare me, Sir!

829
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
I won’t do that again, Sir!

830
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

831
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,760
I paid.

832
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,470
Thank you, too, Lord Jing.

833
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,840
When I make money,

834
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,470
I’ll pay you back.

835
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,470
