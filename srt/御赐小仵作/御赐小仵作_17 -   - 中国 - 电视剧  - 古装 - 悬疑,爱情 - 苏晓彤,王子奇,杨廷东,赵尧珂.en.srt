1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,310
Xu Rugui used Lady Xu’s hairpin

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,560
to lead me to discover the identities
of Chu Chu’s biological parents,

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,440
trying to damage the trust
between Chu Chu and I.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Whatever happens,

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,390
I will find out the truth.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,040
My mother was killed by
the housekeeper of the Xu family

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,600
and Xu Rugui is my uncle.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Your Majesty,

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,750
I’ve found out

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,080
that the rumor about
Duke Chang these days

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,790
came from a brat doing chores

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,270
in the Imperial Garden.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,040
He was new in the Palace

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,240
and hasn’t changed his vulgar habit
he developed when he was out there.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,590
Somehow he got the nerve

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,430
and made up some shadowy stories

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,230
about the late Duke Chang.

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,870
I’ve severely reprimanded his supervisor

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,000
who teaches him about the rules.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,190
Is it really a new minion
who spread the rumors about

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,870
the son of the Emperor Wuzong
in the capital?

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,680
Yes.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,720
He is bold indeed.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,590
He had a few drinks

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,870
and dared to talk nonsense in the Palace

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,400
which was heard by the boring servants

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,680
and spread outside the Palace.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,510
And everyone is talking about it.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,120
But he is also

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,230
timid indeed.

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,590
He was so scared
that he had a heart attack and died

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,480
before I bring him to you.

33
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,910
He died of fear?

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,720
Yes.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,550
Rumors...

36
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,080
Are these just rumors?

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,440
Your Majesty, you know

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,600
that the offspring of Emperor Wuzong

39
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,920
has been dead for a long time.

40
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,750
These words are just rumors.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,190
If you want to stop these rumors
as soon as possible,

42
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,550
I have a solution.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,800
Bur I’m afraid you need to
sacrifice a little bit.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,320
I don’t know whether I should say it.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Just go ahead.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,630
I think

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,350
these people can be incited
by the rumors

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,400
because they have forgotten the fact

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
that the Emperor Wuzong’s sons

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,990
died a long time ago.

51
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,400
You only need to remind them

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,710
and the rumors will naturally disappear.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,160
Tell me

54
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,120
how I should remind them.

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,830
Your Majesty, you can choose
an auspicious day

56
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,040
and give posthumous names to
the sons of the Emperor Wuzong.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Posthumous names?

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Good.

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,270
Only the dead will be
given posthumous names.

60
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,390
You are showing your benevolence.

61
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,110
I believe no minister will object it.

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Those who are discussing Duke Chang
in the court and the commonalty

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,030
will also deeply admire your generosity

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,470
and become more loyal to serve you.

65
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,470
Good.

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,110
Order the academician
to draft an edict now and ask

67
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,440
the Ministry of Rites and the Imperial
Astronomer to get on it immediately.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,660
Order Wu Jiang to
enter the Palace tomorrow.

70
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,830
I have something to ask him.

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,440
It has been a while since
Commandery Prince An left Chang’an.

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,360
Why is there no news from him at all?

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,360
If Xiao Heng is really in the Southwest,

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
there is no way he would

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
avoid his biological son.

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,100
=The Imperial Coroner=

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,140
=Episode 17=

79
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,790
Why did you ask about Duke Chang?

80
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,670
Do you still remember Yan Ming?

81
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,830
Yan Ming?

82
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,270
You found a scroll at Yan Ming’s place.

83
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,350
I told you that Yan Ming was
looking for someone.

84
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,790
Was he looking for Duke Chang?

85
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,480
It’s possible.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
When Yan Ming was repairing a book,

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,070
he had a habit
that an official would have.

88
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,200
When he met a deceased person

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,230
whose year of death
or whereabouts are unknown,

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,550
he would try to

91
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,550
find it out through

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
the clues from the old scrolls.

93
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,920
The ink on his scroll is still new.

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,040
It can be seen that he got interested in

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
the late emperor’s young son

96
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,390
whose year of death is unknown.

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,920
Did he suspect
that Duke Chang is still alive?

98
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,230
Before I left Chang’an, I ask Wu Jiang

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,320
to secretly verity
what’s written in his manuscript.

100
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,110
Hold on.

101
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,350
A nerd scribbled a few words

102
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,600
and you took it seriously?
You even verified it?

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,440
Yan Ming’s deduction
is not rigorous enough,

104
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,350
but it’s not all unreasonable.

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
The three people Xu Rugui
was ordered to kill in Chang’an

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,550
are Lu Chuansheng, the Capital Liaison
Representative in Qianzhou

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,380
responsible for the communication
between Chang’an and Qianzhou,

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
Liu Yue, the head of
the Ministry of Revenue

109
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
in charge coins minting
in the Southwest,

110
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
and Feng Jie, the Minister of War

111
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,850
who just finished the inspection

112
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,550
of the military affairs
in the Southwest before he was killed.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,070
He hadn’t had time to

114
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,040
report on the military inspection.

115
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,070
All of them are related to Qianzhou.

116
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,480
And Qianzhou was also granted to
Duke Chang at that time.

117
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,480
At such a point,

118
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,270
Yan Ming was murdered
because of a scroll about

119
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,350
looking into the whereabouts
of Duke Chang.

120
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,480
So you are suspecting

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,440
that Duke Chang is behind
these things related to Qianzhou?

122
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,320
He killed Yan Ming
because he is afraid

123
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,070
that someone would know he is alive.

124
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,600
It doesn’t make sense.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
If he is behind it,

126
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,830
the dancing girl should
destroy the scroll

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,820
when she killed Yan Ming.

128
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,040
Why would she hide it?

129
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,200
There is another possibility.

130
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,000
What possibility?

131
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
He killed Yan Ming

132
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,510
no because he is afraid
that people will know he is alive,

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,270
but because he wants people
to know that he is alive.

134
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,110
Master.

135
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,270
There is one thing I can’t figure out.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
Why are you protecting

137
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,160
that brat who took poison
and committed suicide?

138
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,230
You think I’m protecting him?

139
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,600
Of course.

140
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,550
He must have committed suicide
by taking poison

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,160
and there is someone behind it.

142
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,110
This Antique Store might be the clue.

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,270
But you didn’t mention
a word about it to the Emperor.

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,110
Aren’t you protecting him?

145
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,110
You are short-sighted.

146
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,880
I’m not protecting him.

147
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,790
I’m protecting us.

148
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,320
I’m foolish, please enlighten me.

149
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,480
The Emperor asked us to look into this,

150
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,480
do you think he really
wants to know the truth?

151
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,790
He was just testing us.

152
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,600
When the son of
the late emperor was dying,

153
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,070
we were by his side.

154
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,670
He suspects that we are behind it.

155
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,320
I have to solve it in this way

156
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,920
to finish our job.

157
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,510
Master, you are wise indeed.

158
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,040
Mingde, let me

159
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,040
tell you something from my heart.

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,720
Stop being that glib.

161
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,600
Try to be cleverer.

162
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,480
The channels of communication between
Qianzhou and Chang’an court was cut off.

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
A large amount of
copper coins were minted.

164
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
The news about military affairs
in the Southwest

165
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,880
was strictly prevented from
being reported to the court.

166
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
If there is one person

167
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,790
behind all these things,

168
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,670
what do you think this person is up to?

169
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,720
What?

170
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,550
To plot a rebellion!

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,350
That’s right.

172
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,440
Rebels of all dynasties

173
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,480
want to be the ruler in the end.

174
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
But a dead person
can’t ascend the throne.

175
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,920
No one will support a dead man
to be an emperor.

176
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,910
Therefore, if he wants to

177
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,910
ascend to the throne
in the name of Duke Chang,

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,280
he must bring Duke Chang
back to life first.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,840
You mean he killed Yan Ming

180
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,030
because he wanted you to
discover the scroll

181
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
and find out Yan Ming was killed

182
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,030
because of his conclusion
that Duke Chang is still alive,

183
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,910
so as to whip up public opinion

184
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,520
and then he can rebel
in the name of Duke Chang.

185
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,590
That’s why I’ve been
trying to contain the news.

186
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,790
But I got news from Wu Jiang

187
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,230
that there are rumors

188
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,590
in Chang’an about

189
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,000
Duke Chang being alive.

190
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,280
I guess he realized
that I’m not used by him,

191
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,200
that’s why he has to use the dumbest way

192
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,550
to spread rumors.

193
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,440
There is no evidence but rumors.

194
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,320
He can’t make any waves.

195
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,880
I’m not worried about that he can

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
make any waves with the rumors.

197
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,350
But I’m afraid he is so eager
to spread the rumors

198
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,840
because everything is ready

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
and he only needs a chance to do it.

200
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,400
If that’s the case,

201
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,840
we have to find him out quickly.

202
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,150
He caused so many messes

203
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,470
in Qianzhou.

204
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,470
Maybe he is hiding in Qianzhou.

205
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,550
This is too important to rush into.

206
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,520
Right now, Qianzhou is in such a mess.

207
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
A lot of things happened.

208
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,590
But these things

209
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,230
are connected

210
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
and interlocked.

211
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,280
If we can pull a thread from it,

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,030
everything will be clear then.

213
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,470
Duke Chang is the trueborn son
of the late emperor.

214
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,440
The Emperor now is the uncle
of the late emperor.

215
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,440
If Duke Chang is still alive

216
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,840
and you find him out,

217
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,590
it’s fine if he is behind these things.

218
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,520
But if he is innocent,

219
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,550
how should the Emperor deal with it?

220
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,710
That’s exactly why

221
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,710
I didn’t tell you about it.

222
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,910
Weren’t you blaming me for

223
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,520
not taking you to handle
those dangerous affairs?

224
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,400
I do have a selfish motive.

225
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,470
What?

226
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
If anything happens to me,

227
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
you are the only one I can entrust
with the posthumous affairs.

228
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,350
And only you

229
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
can coax my mother and my brother.

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,030
Your Highness.

231
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,000
My original intention of coming to
the Three Judicial Offices

232
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,910
is to be a rakish young master

233
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
with my father and my brother’s

234
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,110
official authority.

235
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,440
How does it turn out like this?

236
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,030
You worked for it.

237
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
Fine, I deserve it.

238
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,840
What should we do to Xu Rugui?

239
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,760
Bring him back to the county office
or send him to Prefect’s Mansion?

240
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,470
Keep him here for now.

241
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,590
Keep him here?

242
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
He just killed the father of
the Deputy Magistrate, Tan Gui.

243
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
Keeping him in the county office
may cause trouble.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
But if we skip the magistrate
and send him to Li Zhang,

245
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,350
it will also bring troubles

246
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
if Li Zhang looks into it.

247
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Your Highness, you are afraid
that Xu Rugui

248
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,110
will tell others about
Chu Chu’s background, right?

249
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,470
It has been our speculation

250
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,110
and Xu Rugui’s side of story so far.

251
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,320
Before we have any conclusive evidence,

252
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,000
don’t bring this up to anyone.

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
Your Highness, you are going to suffer.

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
What?

255
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,880
You have someone inside of you.

256
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
All the prisoners who have not
been arrested in Tang

257
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,110
are all here.

258
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,150
Of course I have people inside.

259
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,590
Cut it out.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Your enemies in the court

261
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,620
include the discontented officials
of the Three Judicial Offices,

262
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,910
the incompetent magistrates,

263
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,710
and those eunuchs like Qin Luan.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,840
Do they ever stop
picking on you together?

265
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,350
Have you ever been
so pissed off by them?

266
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,710
It’s not the time
that I brought trouble to you,

267
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,170
when have you been so angry with me?

268
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,880
It’s such an important clue.

269
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,280
You must consider it carefully.

270
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
By the way,

271
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,150
I brought this for you.

272
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,910
If you won’t use it as evidence,

273
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
then give it to Chu Chu as a keepsake.

274
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,840
Father, I want to ask you something.

275
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,470
What are you panic about?

276
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,440
When Chu Chu’s mother died,

277
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,030
did she die at the place
of Chu Chu’s uncle?

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,470
Yes.

279
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,110
Her brother

280
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,910
is Chu Chu’s uncle.

281
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,150
Have you met Chu Chu’s uncle?

282
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,110
Yes.

283
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,230
Can you recognize he now?

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,150
Now? Where?

285
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,910
Maybe...

286
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,520
Did he come back to Guanling County?

287
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,150
Father.

288
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,440
Maybe he is locked inside our woodshed.

289
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,960
What?

290
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,440
The man locked inside the woodshed

291
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,670
is Chu Chu’s uncle?

292
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,550
When they brought him here,

293
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,150
his head was covered.

294
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,640
I was worried about Chu Chu

295
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,910
and didn’t pay much attention
to that man.

296
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,760
Yeah. They also said
that there is one thing

297
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
concerning Chu Chu’s life.

298
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,550
Concerning her life?

299
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,200
What is it?

300
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,030
They spoke vaguely

301
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,320
and I didn’t hear clearly.

302
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,670
Father, what should we do?

303
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,960
Do what?

304
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,790
You are not sure about anything yet.
Don’t be in such a hurry.

305
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,880
I mean, Father.

306
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,030
Are you going to
let her die just because

307
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,590
she is not your biological daughter?

308
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

309
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,710
I’m telling the truth.

310
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,880
Xu Zongfang?

311
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,550
Thank you.

312
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,760
Mr. Chu, why are you still up so late?

313
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,960
I worked late.

314
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,590
I saw the light here

315
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
and I’m here to bring you a pot of tea.

316
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,110
Give me the tea.

317
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Thank you, Mr. Chu

318
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,280
The dew is heavy in the late night.

319
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,670
Please go back and rest earlier.

320
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,910
I want to go inside and get something.

321
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,200
Mr. Chu, please.

322
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,760
Thanks.

323
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Is he the bandit who kidnapped Chu Chu?

324
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,110
Yes, Mr. Chu.

325
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,230
He is very dangerous.

326
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,590
You’d better go back to your room.

327
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,550
Okay.

328
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,760
Father, how is it?

329
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,670
They covered his face
and gagged his mouth.

330
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
I can’t tell.

331
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,710
All right, let’s leave it to tomorrow.

332
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,350
Father...

333
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:20,960
That’s it.

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,670
Everyone in this world

335
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,350
will be unable to speak or move one day.

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,230
Our Chu family

337
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,550
is to say out loud

338
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,790
what they want to say but cannot say.

339
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,670
Grandpa, can you hear the dead?

340
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,520
I don’t hear them

341
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,710
I see them.

342
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,110
Why can’t I see them?

343
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,110
Do you also want to see them?

344
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,790
Yes.

345
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,470
Good.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,640
Grandpa.

347
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,150
I’m here to see
if you are getting better.

348
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,790
What are you busy with

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,350
early in the morning?

350
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,200
The room is too messy.
I’m tidying it up.

351
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,200
Father always said

352
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
the room is too messy

353
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,280
to be a girl’s room.

354
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,590
How does it not look like a girl’s room?

355
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,550
If it’s neat and clean,

356
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,400
it won’t be my Chu Chu’s style.

357
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,790
Grandpa, have a seat.

358
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,150
Grandpa, it was my fault yesterday.

359
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,150
I made you worry about me.

360
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,000
You are like a coroner
working for a high official now.

361
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
You speak like a grown up

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
and you know the etiquette now.

363
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,710
When you were at home before,

364
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,670
I always saw you as a kid.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,320
I thought a girl

366
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,200
won’t get into the county office.

367
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,670
So I didn’t give you
any serious lessons.

368
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,220
Now it turns out

369
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,890
that I was short-sighted.

370
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,000
Grandpa, why are you
saying this suddenly?

371
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,390
You will always be a member of
the Chu family.

372
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,190
I promise you.

373
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,710
Tell me the truth.

374
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,350
Don’t you trust me anymore?

375
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,680
Of course I trust you.

376
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,190
Even you trust me,

377
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,920
you still can’t feel at ease.

378
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,590
I understand.

379
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,760
A verbal promise doesn’t count.

380
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,760
A coroner needs to
write a report for the autopsy.

381
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,350
An official needs the case file
to settle a lawsuit.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,350
And it also needs evidence

383
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,280
to prove that you are
the daughter of the Chu family.

384
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,230
This is the genealogy of the Chu family.

385
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,160
By the ordinary rules,

386
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
women can’t be written on it.

387
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,640
But I’ll make the decision this time.

388
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,520
If you are willing to be the child
of the Chu family,

389
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,310
I’ll write you in the genealogy.

390
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,400
In the future,

391
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,590
no one can say that you are not
a child of the Chu family.

392
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,190
Grandpa.

393
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,710
What are you doing? Get up.

394
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,830
Grandpa, I’m ungrateful.

395
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
I have a favor to ask you.

396
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,950
Promise me you will say yes.

397
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,760
Get up first before you tell me.

398
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,640
Grandpa, just let me finish it.

399
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,880
Otherwise you will think

400
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
I’m being childish even I say it.

401
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,190
Fine.

402
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,950
I promise you. You can tell me now.

403
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,590
I don’t expect my name
to be written in the genealogy.

404
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
I only need you to promise me

405
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,070
that no matter who my father is,

406
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,520
you must bury me beside my mother

407
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,760
if I die one day.

408
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,110
When you have time,

409
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,710
remember to visit me
with my father and my brother.

410
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,640
What silly words are you talking about?

411
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,600
Grandpa, I’m serious.

412
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,200
Jinyu, do you hear that?

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,270
Please don’t despise me
because of my background at that time.

414
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,120
If it’s inconvenient for you,

415
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,510
I don’t need any offering or joss stick.

416
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,120
Just come and visit me.

417
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,390
I want to know if you are doing well.

418
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,200
I’m afraid...

419
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,760
I’m afraid I won’t be able to
see you again.

420
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,630
Why do I feel like

421
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,230
Miss Chu is preparing for her death?

422
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,160
Are you still thinking about Father?

423
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,680
Did you tell Jing Yi about

424
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,710
what happened in your father’s mansion?

425
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,640
No.

426
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,000
But he is clever enough.

427
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,880
I think he probably knows what happened.

428
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,110
I’m not worried
whether he knows it or not.

429
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,130
I’m just worried

430
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,700
he will tell the people
in the Palace about Chu Chu.

431
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,680
About Miss Chu?

432
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,540
Chu Chu.

433
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,460
Your Highness?

434
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,330
Have a seat.

435
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,970
Why did you get up so early?

436
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,210
You should sleep more.

437
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,230
I...

438
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,160
I can’t sleep.

439
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,070
Your Highness, is there
anything you want to say

440
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,750
but you can’t say?

441
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,560
Yes.

442
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,880
Is it about the case?

443
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,800
Kind of.

444
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,350
How about you?

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,680
Me, too.

446
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,190
That’s why

447
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,000
you are here washing the stones?

448
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,980
No, I’m going to grill the mushrooms.

449
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,580
When there was something
I wanted to say but couldn’t say,

450
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,230
I would put it in the vegetables

451
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,520
and eat the dish after I cook it.

452
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,760
Then I don’t need to think about it.

453
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,160
I don’t know if it will work this time.

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,070
Well, I’ll eat with you

455
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,310
after you cook it.

456
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,760
It’s better than eating alone.

457
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,920
Your Highness, it’s nice
to be your coroner.

458
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,230
I...

459
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,760
What’s this?

460
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,190
Your Highness, what’s wrong?

461
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,040
These stones seem to be glowing.

462
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,310
These are just ordinary stones.

463
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,680
There are a lot of stones like this

464
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,520
right here.

465
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,520
I remember the witch doctor said

466
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,110
that there is something like spar

467
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,400
inside these stones.

468
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,430
I don’t quite understand.

469
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,950
Anyway, these stones seem to glow

470
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,430
when being illuminated
by the light. It’s very beautiful.

471
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,660
Light?

472
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,420
Lord!

473
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,060
Damn! You scared me.

474
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Can’t you keep your voice down?

475
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,940
I almost ruined the koi sculpture.

476
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,540
What’s the fuss about?

477
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,300
There is a letter from Guanling County

478
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,130
that they found the traces of
a fugitive wanted by the court,

479
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,330
Xu Rugui.

480
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,850
Give the order immediately

481
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,420
and catch the wanted the criminal now!

482
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,640
Yes!

483
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,760
Hold on.

484
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,350
Is Commandery Prince An
still in Pingle Town?

485
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,350
Yes.

486
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,310
I also heard that he dug
a woman’s grave.

487
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,110
Dug...?

488
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,950
Didn’t he come to find his father?

489
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,350
Why did he dig a woman’s grave?

490
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
Does he want to get a dead stepmother

491
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,470
for his dead father?

492
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,310
That’s funny, My Lord.

493
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,950
By the way, My Lord.

494
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,040
You don’t need to worry about

495
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,280
the investigation into
minting coins privately.

496
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,760
Why is that?

497
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,000
The man drinking with you

498
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,800
and Magistrate Zheng in the County
Office of Guanling on that day

499
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,350
is not Commandery Prince An.

500
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,040
Who is that person then?

501
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,470
That’s the Vice Minister of
the Court of Judicial Review, Jing Yi.

502
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,560
Jing Yi?

503
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,430
Vice Minister Jing is just an idle

504
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,520
young master.

505
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,880
He rarely does anything serious.

506
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,470
When you had drinks on that day,

507
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,160
I guess he was just making fun of
you and Magistrate Zheng.

508
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,760
What do you know?

509
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,350
There must be a plan.

510
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,110
The Jing family is a family of foxes.

511
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,160
They are best at

512
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,230
finding out the truth through
expressions and voices.

513
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,370
I dealt with Jing Yi in the way

514
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,520
I should deal with Commandery Prince An.

515
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,760
It’s wrong.

516
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,830
It’s all wrong.

517
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,230
It’s all wrong!

518
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,710
They messed with me

519
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,560
must because they want to
step in the coin minting thing.

520
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,070
Keep an eye on Guanling County.

521
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,350
Let me know if you have any news!

522
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,430
Yes!

523
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,740
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

524
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,280
Greetings to Your Grace.

525
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,470
You may rise.

526
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,350
Thank you, Your Grace.

527
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,430
You came early this morning.

528
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,000
Did anything happen to Jinyu?

529
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,920
Your Grace, rest assured.

530
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,110
Commandery Prince An
and General Xiao are doing well.

531
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,430
There is something

532
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,680
His Highness asked me to show you.

533
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,310
He is in a hurry

534
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,430
so I came in early in the morning.

535
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,070
Please forgive me for

536
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,590
disturbing your rest.

537
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,830
What is it? Bring it to me.

538
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,680
Yes.

539
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,060
(To Mother)

540
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,950
His Highness is investigating a case.

541
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,000
This hairpin belongs to
a person involved in the case.

542
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,070
His Highness hopes that he can find out

543
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,710
who this person involved is
through this hairpin.

544
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,470
He said

545
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,430
the owner of this hairpin

546
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,230
should be a person of high status.

547
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,760
Maybe you can recognize it.

548
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,110
It looks familiar.

549
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,280
I got it.

550
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,000
This was a gift from my mother
to Madam Jing.

551
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,350
You mean the wife of Senior Jing?

552
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,230
Yes, it’s her.

553
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,560
Master.

554
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,280
Come in.

555
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
There is an urgent letter from Qianzhou.

556
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,820
(To Father)

557
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,470
Well...

558
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,430
Is it a hairpin?

559
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,760
It looks so familiar.

560
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
I have an exact same hairpin.

561
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,760
Really?

562
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,470
Yes.

563
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,400
I remember it.

564
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,430
When we got married,

565
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,040
Princess Xiping’s mother

566
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,640
gave me a pair of hairpins.

567
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,000
I kept one by myself

568
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,640
and gave the other one to someone else.

569
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,430
Wait

570
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,710
Look, does them look the same?

571
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,880
This is the style of young people.

572
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,590
I haven’t worn it for years.

573
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,310
Do you remember
whom you gave this hairpin to?

574
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,880
It’s been a long time.

575
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,310
I can’t remember it.

576
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,280
But,

577
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,160
I have a record of the things
I gave away.

578
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,830
I’ll tell you after I check it.

579
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,230
Go to find the housekeeper

580
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,310
and tell him

581
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,310
that I got slightly sick last night

582
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,640
and I’ll ask for leave
for the morning court.

583
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,350
You are not going to the court today?

584
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,110
Where are you going?

585
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,710
We have something to do.

586
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,640
We will be back soon.

587
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,590
No, you can go anywhere as you want.

588
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,710
But Chu Chu must stay.

589
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,880
Missy, you haven’t recovered yet.

590
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,160
Take the medicine
and take a good rest at home.

591
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,160
Brother, I’m recovered. I’m fine.

592
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,560
No, I said no.

593
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,280
Stay at home.

594
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,920
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

595
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
We have a very important thing to do.

596
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,070
I don’t care how important it is.

597
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,000
Go back with me.

598
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,280
Let her off!

599
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,070
She is my sister...!

600
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,310
She is a coroner of
the Three Judicial Offices!

601
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,230
I’m going to take her out
to handle a case.

602
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,070
You are also a public servant.

603
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,470
You should know what the crime is

604
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,640
to obstruct your superior’s work.

605
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,190
It’s very cloudy now.

606
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,280
What if it rains?

607
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,950
Well,

608
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,070
does the coroner In Guanling County

609
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,590
only go out to work

610
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,520
in sunny days?

611
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:28,950
You...!

612
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,160
Brother, I said I’m fine.

613
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,230
Just let me go.

614
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,560
I’m just like you.

615
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,230
We are both coroners
working for the government.

616
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,640
When you were working,

617
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,110
no matter what happened,

618
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,710
as long as Magistrate Zheng
asked you to go to the county office,

619
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,920
you never hesitated.

620
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,470
Why are you stopping me now?

621
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
I am also a coroner just like you.

622
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,590
Commandery Prince An asked me to work,

623
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,920
I will go no matter what happens.

624
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,080
Rest assured.

625
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,910
Since she is leaving with me,

626
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,230
I will take good care of her.

627
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,360
What happened yesterday
won’t happen again.

628
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,080
I can’t rest assured.

629
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,080
It will be too late if
what happened yesterday

630
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,110
happens again!

631
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,520
Let me ask you.

632
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,310
Where exactly are you taking Chu Chu to?

633
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,830
Why didn’t I hear

634
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,430
that there is a homicide in the county?

635
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,590
The homicide in the county
should be handled by the county office.

636
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
My work

637
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,430
is beyond the control

638
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,520
of the county office.

639
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,950
Don’t follow us secretly.

640
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,520
Otherwise I will handle it according to
the official principles.

641
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,430
You can try it if you are not afraid of

642
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,590
losing the qualification as a coroner.

643
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,310
Let’s go.

644
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
Brother, I’ll be back in a while.

645
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,950
Your Highness, don’t be angry.

646
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,230
Don’t harm your health because of it.

647
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,350
I’m not angry.

648
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,710
My brother isn’t usually like that.

649
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,160
I don’t know what’s wrong
with him today.

650
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,160
I guess he was scared by
what happened yesterday.

651
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,760
Don’t worry.

652
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,400
I’m not angry.

653
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
I said those words

654
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,280
because I don’t want him to follow up.

655
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,470
Didn’t you promise my father

656
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,920
that you will keep the secret for him?

657
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,470
If he follows us,

658
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,110
it will be inconvenient for us to talk.

659
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,000
He is not angry...

660
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,160
General Xiao, is he really not angry?

661
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,070
Since he said it, just take it.

662
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,950
All right.

663
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,590
What a stubborn man.

664
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,350
Grandpa, are you going to
send food to Xu...

665
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,230
Send food to that bandit?

666
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,830
Your father went to
the county office to work.

667
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,590
It’s time for a meal.

668
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,270
I’ll send the food to him.

669
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,710
Although he is a bad person
and he hurt Chu,

670
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
we still can’t starve him.

671
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,000
He committed a crime

672
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,190
and he will be punished
according to the law.

673
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,280
Grandpa, let me do it.

674
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,710
He is dangerous.

675
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,470
I can handle such a small thing.

676
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Go to do what you should do.

677
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,350
Grandpa.

678
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
I also need to go there
and pick up a few things.

679
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,280
Let me do it.

680
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,830
Tell the two guards

681
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,640
that their meal is on the table.

682
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,040
Ask them to eat it when they have time.

683
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,920
Don’t let the food get cold.

684
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Got it, go back to your room.

685
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,230
Sirs, it has been hard for you.

686
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,000
I’m here to bring him some food.

687
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,040
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

688
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,190
Your meal is also ready.

689
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,660
It’s in the kitchen.

690
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,230
Hurry up and have a bite.

691
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,040
We can’t.

692
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,230
This person is really dangerous.

693
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,590
We can take turns to eat.

694
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

695
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,040
I won’t untie him.

696
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,880
He can’t run away.

697
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,710
What’s more,

698
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,950
this kitchen is so close to here.

699
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,280
I’ll call you if he runs away.

700
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,520
Commandery Prince An
just left with Chu Chu

701
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,470
and that general

702
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,430
to investigate some case.

703
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,230
I’m afraid they will send someone back

704
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,880
and ask you to go with them.

705
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,800
It’s hard to do your job well
when you are starving.

706
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,040
I can’t afford the punishment

707
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
if they blame me.

708
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,430
I’m a little hungry.

709
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,640
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

710
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
We will be back soon.

711
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Okay.

712
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,190
Mr. Chu, be careful.

713
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,520
Got it, go ahead.

714
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,800
Please.

715
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,590
I want to ask you something.

716
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
I’ll take out the cloth from your mouth.

717
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,800
Don’t shout.

718
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,280
Let me ask you.

719
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,830
Are you Xu Zongfang?

720
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,230
You must be Chu He.

721
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,680
How do you know that?

722
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,160
Don’t worry about how I know that.

723
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,560
Hurry, untie the rope for me.

724
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,920
Chu Chu will be dead later.

725
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,800
What are you saying?

726
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,520
You just said

727
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,640
that Xiao Jinyu and his brother
took Chu Chu away.

728
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,190
They are going to kill Chu Chu.

729
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,160
But you are the one
who almost killed Chu Chu yesterday!

730
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,950
You are killing me.

731
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Since you came here to ask me
if I am Xu Zongfang,

732
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,760
it means you know
that I am Chu Chu’s uncle,

733
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,950
right?

734
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,680
I was trying to take her away
to save her.

735
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,640
Don’t talk nonsense.

736
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
No one would...

737
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,230
No one would save a person in that way.

738
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,950
Didn’t Chu Chu tell you

739
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,760
that her biological father, Yun Yi,

740
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,350
is a criminal who rebelled with
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

741
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,040
and killed the father of
Xiao Jinyu and Xiao Jinli?

742
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,760
Yesterday they opened the coffin of
Chu Chu’s biological mother,

743
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,950
which is my sister.

744
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,310
They must have known

745
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,800
the identity of Chu Chu’s
biological father.

746
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,040
I think they are going to
retaliate against Chu Chu

747
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,430
and kill her!

748
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,040
Well, I’ll go to find them.

749
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,040
Don’t!

750
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,400
Chu He, these two brothers are
highly powerful

751
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,470
and they have soldiers in hand.

752
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,950
If you go now,

753
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,110
you are taking down
the whole Chu family!

754
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,350
I’ll do it. Let me go now.

755
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,430
I’m Chu Chu’s uncle.

756
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,350
I failed Chu Chu
and her mother at that time.

757
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,680
But right now,

758
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,520
I will protect her with my life.

759
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,280
What are you waiting for?

760
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,830
It will be too late
if you don’t untie me now.

761
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,470
Let’s take the food back and eat

762
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,520
lest anything should happen.

763
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,470
I’ll go back, too.

764
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,110
Are you sure you can save Chu Chu?

765
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,800
Of course.

766
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,190
Hurry up.

767
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,800
Well...

768
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,280
You two finished your meal so fast.

769
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,830
I think we should eat here.

770
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,800
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

771
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,520
You can leave him to us now.

772
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,520
Okay, I’ll leave.

773
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,110
Call me if you need anything.

774
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,630
Okay, thank you.

775
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,390
General! Your Highness!

776
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,120
Has anyone been here?

777
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,280
No one has been here.

778
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,150
Brother, give it to me.

779
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,320
Keep watch at the door.

780
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,470
Don’t let anyone approach.

781
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,600
Rest assured.

782
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,320
Chu Chu, close the door.

783
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,950
Okay.

784
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,230
Your Highness.

785
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,150
Why do you only place
these four chess pieces?

786
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,280
I played twice with my elder brother

787
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,910
and I played once with Jing Yi.

788
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,670
Every time at the end of the game,

789
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,190
there would always be
these four chess pieces

790
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,670
in these four positions.

791
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,840
Is there anything special about
these four positions?

792
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,360
I haven’t figured it out yet.

793
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,870
But when I saw those illuminated stones,

794
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,630
these chess pieces,

795
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,600
and the layout of this room,

796
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,390
I still feel that something is missing,

797
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,840
The layout of this room?

798
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,040
These are painted by the witch doctor.

799
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,630
Does he like painting a lot?

800
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,390
He didn’t like painting
that much before.

801
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,150
But during the time before he left,

802
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,950
he just somehow
started to like painting.

803
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,670
He didn’t paint anything else

804
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,390
but mountains and trees.

805
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,630
These paintings are all scenes
of Guanling County

806
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,320
The mountain is Phoenix Mountain.

807
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,190
The water is Yong’an River.

808
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,470
Light...

809
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
