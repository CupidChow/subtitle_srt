1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,030
The superior of Li Zhang

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,480
should be the so-called Duke Chang.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,720
Your Highness, mercy!

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,310
You mean General Leng?

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,430
What?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,550
Is General Leng involved in this?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,950
I was just ordered to investigate
the case of illegal minting,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,470
then the evil spirits thing happened.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,010
It’s too strange

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,540
(Leng Peishan)
and the timing is coincidental.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,150
Is there any news from Zhou Han?

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,950
Where did he take Xu Rugui to?

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,950
Xu Rugui was taken...

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait, Master. Hold on.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,680
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,360
Yeah.

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,390
Zhou Han only said

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,290
he planted his men
among the soldiers of Shence Army

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,330
who escorted Xu Rugui.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,060
But he didn’t mention
that he got Xu Rugui out.

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,180
What?

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,700
Master, that’s a test.

24
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,970
You are testing me, right?

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,610
You think Zhou Han is incompetent,

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,570
so you secretly sent a professional
to take Xu Rugui away,

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,930
right?

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,990
Idiot!

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,010
Master, what should we do now?

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,120
It has been Xiao Jinyu

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,720
who is vying with me

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,910
for Xu Rugui.

33
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,590
Xiao Jinyu let

34
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,270
Xue Rucheng take Xu Rugui away.

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,190
Now those who got Xu Rugui
hurt Xue Rucheng.

36
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,630
It’s definitely not
Xiao Jinyu who did it.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,910
I’m afraid

38
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,760
they are coming after us.

39
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,810
But, who is so bold

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,810
to go against us?

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,300
Except for Xiao Jinyu and his people,

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,490
who else dares to

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,620
go against me like this

44
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,010
in Chang’an?

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
You mean it’s the group of people
under the banner of Duke Chang?

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,430
But why would they

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,760
go against you?

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,800
What are they up to?

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,350
They are under the banner
of Duke Chang now.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,710
What do you think they are up to?

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,670
The vast lands of Tang?

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,150
Master, since the An Shi Rebellion,

53
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,350
the Emperors come and go, but
the Division of Eunuchs is always here.

54
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,760
No matter who ascends the throne,

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,960
we are still the one in charge.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,480
I think you have lived a life
of ease for too long.

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,990
You don’t even know what death means.

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,620
No Xu Rugui is missing.

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,140
Our heads

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,100
might fall off our necks anytime.

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,260
Do you understand?

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,730
Listen.

63
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,060
Get your act together.

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,020
Someone will come to us soon.

65
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,700
Yes.

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,890
That’s all you can say.

67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,530
Idiot! Idiot!

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,610
Master, watch your hands.

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,660
=The Imperial Coroner=

70
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,620
=Episode 27=

71
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,120
Don’t cry out. Be quiet.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,190
I’m afraid she is clumsy

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
and she will singe my skin.

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,760
Your skin is thick enough.
It won’t hurt to singe it a little bit.

75
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,030
There are burn marks.

76
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,070
This is the bark of beech willow.

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Put it on the skin
and bake it over a fire,

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,310
there will be marks like bruises.

79
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,520
And you can’t wash it off

80
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,800
or wipe it off by hands.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,470
It can only be wiped off with wine.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,540
On the day I arrived in Chang’an,

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
I saw a fraud using this method
to cheat people out of their money.

84
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,560
This is amazing.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,070
Let me see it.

86
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,380
The mark looks like a real one.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,010
But after he gets in the army,

88
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,100
the army doctor will check his wound

89
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,100
and it’s hardly not to be touched.

90
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,450
It’s still different from a real one.

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,010
Please hold on, I haven’t finished yet.

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,980
Chu Chu, here is
the fresh croton you want.

93
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,870
You came back just in time.
Give it to me.

94
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,560
Why do you need this?

95
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,750
What’s wrong?

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,130
It feels

97
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,660
warm and tingling.

98
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,690
Not bad.

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,500
It’s exactly the same as the real one.

100
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,740
Miss Chu, it’s my first time to know

101
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,620
that coroners can fake wounds.

102
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,740
Actually, coroners don’t do this.

103
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,050
Those who want to frame others

104
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,090
came up with such a trick.

105
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,140
Some people try to
cast aspersions on others

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,300
and try to rob them of their money,

107
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,490
they would use the beech willow bark
and croton juice to fake a wound

108
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,420
and go to the office to file a suit.

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,770
There have been several cases
of such false accusations

110
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,860
in the office of Magistrate Zheng.

111
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,090
There are some talents among the folks.

112
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,170
Your Highness.

113
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,330
With the swelling, it looks like
a real burn mark.

114
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,400
Not bad.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
It can fool the ordinary doctors.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,890
I’ll take a walk.

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,210
Vice Minister Jing, hold on.

118
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,460
If you want to pretend to be
a wounded soldier with a broken leg,

119
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,970
only one injury is not enough.

120
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,700
Your Highness, how do you want

121
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,560
Vice Minister Jing to break his leg?

122
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,420
It’s just a broken leg.

123
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,460
Is there any difference?

124
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,370
Of course there is.

125
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,640
If you land on your face,

126
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,730
there should be injuries on your face.

127
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
If you land on your side,

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,450
there will be injuries on your arms.

129
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,860
But the injuries on your face

130
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,740
should be mixed with some real scratches

131
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,420
to make it real.

132
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,140
Arm.

133
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,340
Those who are in the base of

134
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,230
the Military Commissioner
don’t know what I look like.

135
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,860
General Leng never saw me before.

136
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,860
I’m safe.

137
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,300
What’s more,

138
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,490
how can I get married
if I spoil my appearance?

139
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,800
Jinli, I need you not to tell
anyone in the army

140
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,360
about Jing Yi pretending to be a wounded
soldier and entering the infirmary.

141
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,420
Only the few of us can know it

142
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,740
before we find out the truth.

143
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,620
Otherwise, Jing Yi
will be in great danger.

144
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,060
Okay, I’ll listen to you.

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,170
But why

146
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,040
does Jing Yi have to
pretend to be a wounded soldier?

147
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,920
Didn’t you say that the army
is strictly governed

148
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,300
and they don’t slack off

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,450
even when they are resting?

150
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,290
Yes. After such things happened,

151
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,420
I guess it’s stricter now.

152
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,790
Therefore, among all the soldiers,

153
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,350
those who are most relaxed

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,600
and have time to gossip and chat

155
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,020
are the wounded soldiers
in the infirmary.

156
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,030
This matter happened very strangely.

157
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,350
We have to take information
from all sides

158
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,780
so as to find out the truth
as quickly as we can.

159
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,770
But even he pretends to be
a wounded soldier,

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,860
can Jing Yi make it?

161
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
Why can’t I make it?

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,110
If I have trouble,

163
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,300
I’ll ask you for help.

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,060
Don’t even think about it.

165
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,570
There is one more thing.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,090
Leng Yue, Miss Chu.

167
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,320
There are regulations in the army

168
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,440
that normally women are not allowed
to enter the barrack.

169
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,220
This time General Leng wrote a letter
to invite Commandery Prince An to come,

170
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,200
it should be fine
that you two follow him.

171
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,230
But you still need to be careful.

172
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,490
Eunuch!

173
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,770
Eunuch Qin.

174
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,190
Eunuch Qin, I’ve been to
the Antique Store

175
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,390
and checked the accounts

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,970
and the access records.

177
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,900
They are just some ministers

178
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,730
who like those stuff.

179
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,100
There is nothing wrong.

180
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,420
Are you a Cow in the horoscope?

181
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,610
I am not a Cow. I am a Pig.

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,010
Then why do you need me to whip you up

183
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,880
to take a step forward?

184
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,450
If you can’t find out
anything from the list,

185
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,370
can’t you

186
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,590
figure out another way to do it?

187
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
There are so many people going there.

188
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,250
Some go there more often
and some go there less often.

189
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,130
As least you should

190
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,420
know who go there more often
and who go there less often.

191
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,810
Yes.

192
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,690
General Zhou, get some people to keep
a good eye on the Antique Store.

193
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,230
There can be no let up.

194
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,150
If you make any mistake

195
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,540
and ruin my business,

196
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,930
don’t blame me for
being ruthless to you.

197
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,570
Yes.

198
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,250
By the way, Eunuch Qin.

199
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,780
I found something about
what you ordered to do a few days ago.

200
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,130
After some investigations,

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,010
among those who left Chang’an,

202
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,140
some are dead and some are missing now.

203
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,300
I only found two people
who are still alive.

204
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,220
One is a former maid
from Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

205
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,100
The other is a former nanny.

206
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,450
I’ve made some arrangements

207
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,220
and the two of them are
on their way back to Chang’an.

208
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,450
They will arrive in Chang’an soon.

209
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,450
Good.

210
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,450
Remember.

211
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,900
I want them to be alive.

212
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,220
Alive.

213
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,760
Alive.

214
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,450
Eunuch Qin, take care.

215
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,490
Who are the bandits so bold

216
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,470
as to attack a minister in the capital?

217
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,300
The wound is superficial.

218
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,930
I’m grateful for His Majesty’s concern.

219
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,970
Sorry to get you here.

220
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,810
Don’t neglect your wound.

221
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,180
Now it’s easy to get smallpox.

222
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,570
You haven’t gotten smallpox before.

223
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,780
If you are infected at this age,

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,810
that will really put you

225
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,450
in a dangerous place.

226
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,690
I’ll give you some medicine
for preventing it.

227
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,250
If there is nothing important
for you to do,

228
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,660
you’d better rest in your room.

229
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,130
See Doctor Zhang off.

230
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,300
Yes.

231
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,160
Doctor Zhang, please.

232
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,420
Manager.

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,590
How’s he doing?

234
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,590
He was seriously injured.

235
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,200
After a long laborious trip,

236
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,680
his condition is not optimistic.

237
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,880
Decoct the wild ginseng

238
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
and feed it to him.

239
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,910
Manager.

240
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,930
That’s the best wild ginseng.

241
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,900
He is so lucky.

242
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,130
Well,

243
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,900
do you want to change
your life with him?

244
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,450
No, no.

245
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,010
I’ll decoct the wild ginseng for him.

246
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,860
Don’t worry, Manager Chi.

247
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,300
I will save Xu Rugui’s life

248
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,420
for His Highness.

249
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,930
This person is very important.

250
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,540
You mustn’t let anything happen to him.

251
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,300
After we achieve the great cause,

252
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,930
I’ll ask His Highness to reward you.

253
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,260
Eunuch Qin! Eunuch Qin!

254
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,300
You can’t go in there!

255
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,610
Eunuch Qin! You can’t go in!

256
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,370
Eunuch Qin!

257
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,810
-I don’t know you would come. Sorry.
-Our master is not feeling well.

258
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,300
Your place is a little shabby.

259
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,220
Well, well. Look.

260
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,470
There is a sour smell

261
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,690
of a useless scholar everywhere.

262
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,900
What brought you here?

263
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,220
I heard that you were injured.

264
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,010
By the will of His Majesty,

265
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,490
I’m here to check your condition.

266
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,320
I’m grateful for His Majesty’s concern.

267
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,650
The wound is superficial.

268
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,380
I’m doing good.

269
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,730
Where did you get hurt?

270
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,130
It’s this arm.

271
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,860
Where?

272
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,130
The Emperor wants to know
your condition.

273
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,350
I need to examine your wound,

274
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,700
so I can report to His Majesty.

275
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,780
Am I right?

276
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,930
Yes.

277
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,810
His Majesty said

278
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,160
Minister Xue accomplished nothing

279
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,300
during your trip to the Southwest.

280
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,130
You are an unusual talent in Tang.

281
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,570
His Majesty really doesn’t know

282
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,130
whether you went to
the Southwest to work

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,690
or to make a sightseeing tour

284
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,930
with the money of the government.

285
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,740
I failed His Majesty’s grace.

286
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,810
I deserve death.

287
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,740
Why are you still alive?

288
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,340
I have no complaints.

289
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,370
What a pity.

290
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,540
His Majesty is lenient.

291
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,180
He doesn’t want your life.

292
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,930
You won’t die.

293
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,810
But you will be fined
the salary of six months.

294
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,370
Do you feel wronged?

295
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,900
I’m grateful for His Majesty’s grace.

296
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,050
Yeah, I forgot.

297
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,740
You don’t need to worry about
your livelihood.

298
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,100
As long as Commandery Prince An
is still breathing,

299
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,490
he will reward you something to eat.

300
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,810
You are so lucky to have

301
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,810
such a good long-living student.

302
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,450
Thank you, Eunuch Qin.

303
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,810
Look what a coward you are.

304
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,420
I really should invite Princess Xiping

305
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,660
to take a look at you.

306
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,990
Minister Xue, have a good rest.

307
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,160
I’ll leave.

308
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,370
Take care, Eunuch Qin.

309
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,900
Bastard.

310
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,100
I won’t keep you alive after I make it.

311
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,740
Manager.

312
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,060
As you ordered,

313
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,660
the birthday gift for Eunuch Qin
is prepared.

314
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,140
(Birthday)

315
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,490
Please have a look.

316
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,340
Good.

317
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,340
Very good.

318
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,250
Manager.

319
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,010
Qin Luan is an old eunuch
who has been through three dynasties.

320
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,370
Can we make him believe

321
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,210
that we have Xu Rugui

322
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,060
just with one Ruyi?

323
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,270
Even if he believes it,

324
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
he may not be willing to
cooperate with us.

325
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,910
Eunuchs are slaves of the royal family.

326
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,680
They are just assuming
the majesty of the Emperor.

327
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,840
They don’t care whoever the Emperor is.

328
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,470
We only need to let Qin Luan know

329
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,200
that the world is still ruled by
the current Emperor.

330
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,350
Xu Rugui is an important witness
who will threat his power

331
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,490
in the Division of Eunuchs,
even his life.

332
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,880
But if Duke Chang ascends the throne,

333
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,650
Xu Rugui will become an important link

334
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,940
between the Division of Eunuchs and him.

335
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,780
After we make this clear to him,

336
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,900
Qin Luan will weigh the pros and cons

337
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,810
and choose to cooperate with us.

338
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,860
(Qianzhou Army)

339
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,750
Greetings to General Leng.

340
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,660
You may rise.

341
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,210
Jinli, you are finally back.

342
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,540
You become stronger now.

343
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,580
General Leng.

344
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,560
Thank you for the efforts.

345
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,540
Commandery Prince An.

346
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,820
This matter happened so suddenly.
Sorry to trouble you to come here.

347
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,420
I didn’t expect you to be here so soon.

348
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,010
I’m truly grateful.

349
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,250
Please don’t say that.

350
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,300
I’m General Zhao Jie.

351
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,060
I’m General Hou Bin.

352
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,460
Greetings to Commandery Prince An.

353
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,580
You may rise.

354
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
This is...

355
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,180
This is my coroner.

356
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,370
Greetings to General Leng.

357
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,420
To my surprise, your coroner

358
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,130
is a girl.

359
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,540
This girl is...

360
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,930
A charwoman.

361
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,530
Leng Yue.

362
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,410
This is the granddaughter
of General Leng.

363
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,980
Sorry for being disrespectful.

364
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,550
What’s respectable about
the granddaughter of General Leng?

365
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,260
General Leng.

366
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,100
This little soldier

367
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,860
wears our uniform,

368
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,570
but he doesn’t look like our men.

369
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,960
General Leng.

370
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,270
This is a Qianzhou’s soldier

371
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,320
rescued by us from a group of
bandits on our way here.

372
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,720
He was severely injured

373
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,910
and we were in a hurry to come here.

374
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,560
So we changed his clothes

375
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,230
and took him here for treatment.

376
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,110
I saved him.

377
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Sorry for bringing you troubles.

378
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
Take this Qianzhou’s soldier

379
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,280
to the infirmary for treatment.

380
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,540
Yes.

381
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,740
Come with me.

382
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,710
Commandery Prince An, please.

383
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,830
General Leng, please.

384
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,760
Please.

385
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,510
There are more people
having malignant sores recently.

386
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
We need to get more crude drugs

387
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,560
for malignant sores

388
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,560
lest we rush around to get drugs

389
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,110
when we run out of them.

390
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,440
Okay.

391
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,990
Make a list for me.

392
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,560
Okay.

393
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,600
I’ll go to check the storeroom.

394
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
If there are not enough crude drugs,

395
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,480
I’ll ask someone to buy more.

396
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,080
-General.
-General.

397
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,270
Guys.

398
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,800
General Xiao, when did you come back?

399
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,480
I’ve Just arrived.

400
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,680
Listen,

401
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,440
this is a Qianzhou’s soldier

402
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,840
I saved on my way here.

403
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,230
He is severely injured
and has quite a scare.

404
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,470
General Leng asked me to
bring him here for treatment.

405
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,360
I’ll send him back after he gets better.

406
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,680
It’s scary to be a soldier.

407
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,340
I heard that the Qianzhou’s soldier
is as weak as a chicken

408
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,310
and as timid as a mouse.

409
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Today I finally see one alive.

410
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,650
I think he is half dead.

411
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,500
All right.

412
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,170
Watch your words.
Don’t you feel shameful?

413
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,820
You two, stop standing there.

414
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,440
Help him to bed.

415
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,700
It hurts. It hurts.

416
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,820
(Assembly Hall)
Your Highness, please don’t mind

417
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,280
the poor conditions here.

418
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,280
No need to say that.

419
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,990
In your letter, you summarized

420
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,480
what happened here in a few words.

421
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,910
Can you elaborate

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,270
the whole situation for me?

423
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,080
Hou Bin.

424
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,110
Yes.

425
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,630
You tell him.

426
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,600
Yes.

427
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,320
Your Highness.

428
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,220
About half a month ago,

429
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,230
something very strange
happened in the army in a sudden.

430
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,840
Some soldiers go crazy

431
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,150
for no reason once for a while.

432
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,110
Some of them are less ill.

433
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,630
They just went crazy

434
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,910
and talked nonsense
that no one can understand.

435
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,390
After they woke up,

436
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,630
they became normal again.

437
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,080
But they forgot everything

438
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,390
they said and did

439
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,870
when they went crazy.

440
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,720
Some soldiers are more seriously ill.

441
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,910
They killed themselves

442
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,560
in the madness for no reason.

443
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,110
That’s why

444
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,010
General Leng presumes
that there are evil spirits behind it?

445
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,360
Your Highness.

446
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,990
As for the evil spirits,

447
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,390
it was an idea of me and General Hou.

448
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,910
I really don’t know how to deal with it.

449
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,630
A few days ago, General Yunhui, Xu Ping,

450
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,170
jumped into the fire in public

451
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,470
and was burned alive in front of us.

452
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,080
Everyone was startled by the scene.

453
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,390
If we don’t find out
what’s happening here,

454
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,570
I’m afraid there will be a big mess.

455
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,340
Besides, he did look like

456
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,620
he was possessed by an evil spirit.

457
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,360
All right.

458
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,410
I wrote the letter.

459
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,140
It’s my presumption.

460
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Since Commandery Prince An
is here now,

461
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
I think you also want to
find out the truth.

462
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,860
General Hou.

463
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,680
Yes.

464
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,790
How many people went crazy?

465
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,670
How many people committed suicide?

466
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,840
About seventeen or
eighteen people went crazy.

467
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,050
Three people committed suicide.

468
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,310
Do you have a list or any statement?

469
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes.

470
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,120
General Leng ordered me

471
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,540
to take statements of all the witnesses

472
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,880
and survivors.

473
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,840
I will present you the papers later.

474
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,820
Where are the bodies of the deceased?

475
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,860
They are placed in a camp.

476
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,000
Chu Chu, go to
take a look with Leng Yue.

477
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes.

478
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,680
Hold on.

479
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,200
Your Highness, Miss Chu is your coroner.

480
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,800
She needs to do autopsies.

481
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,190
But Leng Yue

482
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,110
is just a girl goofing around.

483
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,920
I don’t think it’s proper to
let her get involved in this case.

484
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,640
What’s improper?

485
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,820
Are you afraid even a girl

486
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,850
goofing around like me

487
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,330
can see through your lie?

488
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,580
Nonsense!

489
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,490
Leng Yue.

490
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,940
Don’t be rude in the army.

491
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,990
General Leng, since we agreed

492
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,130
that the priority is to
let me find out the truth.

493
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,060
Then please let my people
do their work.

494
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,330
General, please rest assured.

495
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,060
Even it’s witchcraft,

496
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,780
the evil can never beat the good.

497
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,850
Zhao Jie.

498
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,610
Yes.

499
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,660
Take them to the mortuary.

500
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,490
Yes.

501
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,930
Miss Chu, Miss Leng.

502
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,710
Please.

503
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,060
(Assembly Hall)

504
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,210
Your Majesty, please enjoy
the Zisun Tea from Huzhou.

505
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,420
Qin Luan.

506
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,480
Your birthday is
in a few days, right?

507
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,420
Yes.

508
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,620
I’m truly grateful

509
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
that Your Majesty
still remember my birthday.

510
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,300
You have been serving me

511
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,780
for a long time.

512
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,850
How can I not even remember that?

513
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,470
Since your birthday is around,

514
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,310
you will need to buy
some auspicious stuff.

515
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,350
I will reward you with
a hundred taels of gold

516
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,050
and allow you to celebrate
your birthday outside the Palace.

517
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,970
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

518
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,730
What’s more,

519
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,090
you have been the head of
the Division of Eunuchs

520
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,330
for some time.

521
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,490
I’ll ask someone to draft an edict

522
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,430
and promote on your birthday.

523
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

524
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,240
I will do repay your grace

525
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,540
with my earnest efforts.

526
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,080
Jinbao, keep a close eye on him.

527
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,520
Let me know immediately
if you have any news.

528
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,200
Yes.

529
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:24,920
Your Highness.

530
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,780
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

531
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,180
You may rise.

532
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,060
Chu Chu, how did it go?

533
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,580
It can be basically determined
that the three deceased men

534
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,090
were drowned, strangled, and burned.

535
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,250
The first man had strangulation marks

536
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,820
(Neck Strangulation marks)
above his pomum adami.

537
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,850
His hyoid was broken.

538
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,540
He died of strangulation.

539
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,730
The second man had a bulging belly.

540
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,540
There was a small amount of blood foam
deep in his nose and mouth.

541
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,540
He was drowned.

542
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,700
The third man’s

543
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,970
limbs were scorched black and curled.

544
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
There was soot in his mouth and nose.
He was burned to death.

545
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,250
There is no trace of struggling
and fighting

546
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,970
before they died.

547
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,180
General Zhao said there are

548
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,300
witnesses who saw them
killing themselves.

549
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,300
But I can’t tell it from their bodies.

550
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,610
I don’t know

551
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,060
if they really committed suicide.

552
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,910
Your Highness, the generals and soldiers

553
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,750
all saw them committing suicide.

554
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,110
Does Miss Chu not trust my words?

555
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,510
I can swear with my life

556
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,750
that every word I said is true.

557
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,750
It’s not that Miss Chu
doesn’t trust you.

558
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,560
As a coroner,

559
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,590
she can’t draw a conclusion

560
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,160
from the things she doesn’t find
in the bodies.

561
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,870
Please try to understand.

562
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,750
I was in a hurry to defend myself.

563
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,320
Sorry for my rudeness.

564
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,640
Your Highness.

565
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,040
Even there are witnesses

566
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,040
who saw them committing
suicide in public,

567
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,880
there is something strange with this.

568
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,800
Why do you say that?

569
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,540
Among these three men,

570
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,470
the lowest officer is still
a sixth-rank military officer.

571
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,250
The three of them

572
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,920
must all be good fighters.

573
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,400
If they want to kill themselves,

574
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,110
there are many quick ways to do it.

575
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,190
Why would one of them strangle himself,

576
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,520
the other drown himself in the tub,

577
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,560
and the last one of them
jump into the fire

578
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,310
and burn himself alive?

579
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,230
These ways are painful and troublesome.

580
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,470
Why didn’t they just

581
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,470
use their swords?

582
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,400
I think even they killed themselves,

583
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,950
they didn’t do it voluntarily.

584
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,230
I think General Leng also
has doubts about it.

585
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,590
That’s why he asked
Commandery Prince An to come.

586
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,880
He has doubts?

587
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,040
He has doubts that they didn’t
commit suicide voluntarily?

588
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,310
Of course he would say that.

589
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,070
Didn’t he say

590
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,470
there are evil spirits?

591
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,560
They didn’t commit suicide
if they were possessed by evil spirits.

592
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,640
Chu Chu, what’s wrong?

593
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,190
Nothing.

594
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,160
When Miss Leng said the ways they died

595
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
are painful,

596
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,070
I feel that something is wrong.

597
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,680
But I don’t know what it is.

598
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,880
Your Highness, can I
carry out an autopsy?

599
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,020
Autopsy?

600
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,370
To cut them apart?

601
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Your Highness, well...

602
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,230
General Zhao, everything concerning
the investigation

603
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,880
will be decided by me.

604
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,190
Thank you for bringing them
to the mortuary.

605
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,150
If you have other official duties,

606
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,360
you can leave now.

607
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,900
In that case,

608
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,700
I’ll leave.

609
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,410
Go ahead and do it.

610
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,130
I’ll have someone send you
the approval letter later.

611
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,970
Thank you, Your Highness.

612
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,420
It should be them to thank you.

613
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,360
Be careful.

614
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,780
Don’t worry.

615
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,500
Leave us.

616
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,670
Yes.

617
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,250
How’s it going?

618
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:38,900
Your Grace.

619
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,940
It has been verified

620
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,940
that they found two people.

621
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,970
One is a maid who once
served you in the mansion.

622
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,540
The other is a wet nurse
from the Palace.

623
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,350
The two of them
have left where they live

624
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,840
and are on their way to Chang’an

625
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,240
with them.

626
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,370
Who is looking for them?

627
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,540
Not clear yet.

628
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,970
I heard from the guards
who investigated it

629
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,780
that they left from the Palace.

630
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,090
Could it be...?

631
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,580
Qin Luan?

632
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,130
Anyway,

633
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,030
we can’t let two of them enter Chang’an.

634
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,210
Yes.

635
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,000
Take a look.

636
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,930
Take a look.

637
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,490
Good stuff, take a look.

638
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,140
Hurry!

639
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,730
Do you want to die?

640
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,080
Someone stole treasure from
Princess Xiping’s Mansion and fled.

641
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
We are here to search
all the suspicious vehicles.

642
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,410
It’s Princess Xiping’s order.

643
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,070
I dare not disobey.

644
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,470
Please, Madam.

645
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,760
They are from Pingkang Residence.

646
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,520
I took them out last night for a party.

647
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,350
Madam, please don’t mind.

648
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,400
Madam, take care!

649
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,160
How is it going?

650
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,190
We stopped the carriage.

651
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,130
Our people had been following them

652
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,330
all the way.

653
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,060
But somehow they changed

654
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,940
the people in the carriage.

655
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,420
There were only two prostitutes inside.

656
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,490
What?

657
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,460
Guard them well.

658
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,940
Master.

659
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,010
The procuress took them down
and got them settled.

660
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,060
What a surprise.

661
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,540
Master, the rumors

662
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,060
turn out to be true.

663
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,070
Xiao Jinli and Xiao Jinyu,

664
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,190
one of them was adopted,

665
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,590
the other is her biological son.

666
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,400
It’s pity that the former servants
in Princess Xiping’s Mansion

667
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,680
don’t know

668
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,760
which one was adopted.

669
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,090
I don’t care which of them was adopted.

670
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,230
What I care about

671
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
is where the adopted son came from.

672
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,190
Send people to find out

673
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,830
all the newborn babies in that year

674
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,680
that might be adopted by

675
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,310
Princess Xiping.

676
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,920
It’s a little too hard for me.

677
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,720
How many babies were born
in Chang’an City in that year?

678
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,310
How to find them out?

679
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,400
Do whatever you can.

680
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,070
Think about it.

681
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,310
If Princess Xiping
wants to adopt a child,

682
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,190
she can do it above board.

683
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,710
Why would she take so many efforts

684
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,280
and do it secretly?

685
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,710
There must be
something strange about it.

686
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
The child adopted by Princess Xiping

687
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,800
must not be from an ordinary family.

688
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,310
Either it’s Princess Xiping’s
close friend or relative,

689
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,760
or it has some relationship

690
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,350
with Xiao Heng.

691
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,520
Maybe he is another survivor
of the rebellious party.

692
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
I remember

693
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,680
the wife of the rebellious
party’s leader, Chen Ying,

694
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,920
was close with Princess Xiping.

695
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,040
She died of dystocia back then.

696
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,280
But

697
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,710
wasn’t the child never born?

698
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,590
Wasn’t that female coroner

699
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,110
pulled out from

700
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,640
a dead woman?

701
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,640
Go to check the Chen family first.

702
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,520
Find out the truth.

703
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,350
Then we can convict them of
deceiving the Emperor.

704
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,400
This is a good idea.

705
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,190
Master, you are impressive.

706
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,190
You are wise indeed.

707
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,590
How are you doing, Jinyu?

708
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,870
Are you used to living here?

709
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,000
We got everything in the barracks.

710
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,610
But it’s just cold at night.

711
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,020
I got you extra bedding.

712
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,510
Just tell me

713
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,640
if you need anything else.

714
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,190
Don’t make yourself uncomfortable.

715
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,120
Every time you wrote a letter to us,

716
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
you said you were living well
in the army

717
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,670
and it was no difference from home.

718
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,380
Why would I feel uncomfortable here?

719
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,040
Did you lie to Mother and me?

720
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,190
I give up.

721
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,950
You can live here as you want.

722
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,750
I’ve checked the things you asked me.

723
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,080
During the days before
we went to the mountains with Li Zhang,

724
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,400
they did send a team of soldiers

725
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,600
to Qianzhou to buy supplies.

726
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,580
What supplies?

727
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,930
Some commonly used crude drugs.

728
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,510
I confirmed with Wu Chen, the secretary
in charge of military supplies.

729
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,670
He said there was such a thing.

730
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,010
There is a shortage of crude drugs
in the changeover period.

731
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,380
The nearby county
doesn’t have many drugs.

732
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,300
They are afraid buying too many drugs
will affect the life of the people.

733
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,780
So they went to Qianzhou to buy them.

734
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,340
Has this team of soldiers come back?

735
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,030
Not yet.

736
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,060
This is the list of soldiers sent out.

737
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,260
(List)

738
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,980
(List)

739
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,120
Secretary in charge of
the military supplies.

740
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,390
He should be the one who can contact

741
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,950
the people of the local office
most frequently, right?

742
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,040
Yes. Are you suspecting him?

743
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,870
It’s impossible.

744
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,150
Although he is in charge of
buying supplies,

745
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,360
he has no power to deploy troops.

746
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,000
He reports these things to General Leng.

747
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
General Leng will use his discretion
and assign the task to next person.

748
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,670
He can’t decide

749
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,120
who will be sent out.
