1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,880
I shouldn’t have trusted Jing Yi.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,350
Now Chu Chu must misunderstand

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,680
that I see her as...

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,230
To feed pigs?

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,660
(Lespedeza)

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,740
(Used to feed pigs)

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,310
The wounds on Prefect Li’s hands

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,040
fit these tools perfectly
in terms of shape and size.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,400
It’s you who made the mould of coin!

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,680
The mould is consumable.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,940
It needs to be replaced
every once in a while.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,130
You are afraid to be found out

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,290
if you make it in your mansion.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,260
So you came here to
make the mould every once in a while.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,850
As a prefect, you’ve put

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,650
a lot of efforts into this.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,060
Commandery Prince An,
now that you know it,

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,820
you can die without regret.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,740
=The Imperial Coroner=

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,740

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,110
Get him!

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,350
Chu Chu!

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,880
Jinyu!

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,630
Jinyu!

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,230
Jinyu!

26
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,080
Let’s go!

27
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,400
Hurry up!

28
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,750
Your Highness, are you okay?

29
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,520
Are you okay?

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,030
I’m fine. Did you get hurt?

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,720
General, I’m afraid it will
take a few hours

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,190
to clear a way out.

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,800
It’s humid inside the cave.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
The gunpowder wouldn’t work
due to dampness

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,800
if it was installed a long time ago.

36
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,360
It must have been installed recently.

37
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
There is no trace of movement
in front of the kiln.

38
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,420
There must be another entrance.

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,290
You guys clean up the stones.

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,030
The rest of you come with me.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,760
Yes!

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,650
This way!

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,140
Hurry up!

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,700
Commandery Prince An.

45
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,730
I respect you as a noble official
extolled by people.

46
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,290
I wanted to get you

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,620
decently buried under the rocks

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,010
and give you a quick death.

49
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,700
But you don’t appreciate it.

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,980
All right, I’ll finish your life
in person.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,620
Don’t come over!

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,340
Go away!

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:32,980
Are you all right?

54
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,730
Go away!

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:50,860
Go!

56
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,650
Your Highness, what’s wrong with you?

57
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,370
Go away!

58
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,620
Your Highness!

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,060
Your Highness, wake up.

60
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,690
Your Highness, wake up.

61
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,660
Your Highness, wake up.

62

Wake up.

63

Your Highness.

64
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,440
Get up.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,790
Are you feeling better?

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Don’t be afraid, I’ll find the way out.

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I will take you out.

68
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Are you bleeding?

69
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,480
Don’t move. Let me take a look.

70
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,160
It’s okay, it’s just a graze.

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,350
Your bones are fine.

72
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,230
Let me help you up.

73
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,270
Come on.

74
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,480
Be careful.

75
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,320
You really scared me.

76
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,110
Do you have a headache?

77
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,830
Are you dizzy?

78
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,640
I’m fine.

79
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,350
It’s my fault.

80
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,830
I didn’t grab Li Zhang and got you hurt.

81
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,790
Chu Chu, I know you have
feelings for me.

82
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,230
Why wouldn’t you...?

83
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Highness, I’m a coroner.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,160
So what?

85
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,670
You don’t understand it.

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
I don’t understand it.

87
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,790
Please tell me.

88
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,950
I don’t want to die here

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,640
without knowing the reason.

90
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,910
I grew up being despised.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,200
They said

92
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,790
coroners fiddle with dead people

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,920
and they are dirty, smelly and unlucky.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
No one wanted to be my friend.

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,350
Even the shop that sells things

96
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,720
wouldn’t allow me in
when there were many customers.

97
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,510
Everything I touched

98
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,760
was called dirty by them.

99
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,000
Now that I’ve decided to be a coroner,

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,670

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
Neither of them knows how to fight.

190
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,760
I don’t know how long
they can hang in there.

191
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,440
I just saw some ruts on the ground.

192
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,550
This should be the way
they used to send things in and out.

193
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,900
We should be able to find them soon

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,150
following these traces.

195
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,590
Qianzhou’s cave is complicated.

196
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,550
Adjacent caves are often
connected to each other.

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,470
This should be the other entrance.

198
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,590
Let’s go inside.

199
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,030
All right. I’m finished.

200
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,470
The way you tied him

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,710
is different from

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,880
how the prisoners are tied.

203
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,440
I seem to have seen it before.

204
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,230
Your Highness, have you seen people
selling live pigs at the market?

205
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,440
Selling pigs?

206
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,230
Yeah.

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,960
This is how pigs are tied.

208
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
This is called trotter knot.

209
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,880
He can’t break loose
no matter how hard he unties.

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,550
The knot will only get tighter.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,440
It’s also easy to get him out of here

212
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,230
after we find the exit.

213
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,790
We only need a shoulder pole

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,230
and get two people to
carry him down the mountain.

215
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,910
You are thoughtful indeed.

216
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,960
Let’s go to find the exit.

217
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,230
Your Highness, can we find the exit?

218
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,540
Yes.

219
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,900
I have never seen a cave like this,

220
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,130
but I have seen
a lot of people like Li Zhang.

221
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,100
He came here at the last minute

222
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,340
must because there is a way out.

223
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,940
I acted on impulse
and beat him too hard.

224
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,620
I’m afraid he won’t wake up for a while.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Otherwise we can ask him.

226
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,760
He can’t be trusted even he tells us.

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
It’s more convenient for us
to find the exit on our own

228
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,470
than asking him to lead the way.

229
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,880
If he can take you out,

230
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,590
I can also take you out.

231
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,520
There is a cart!

232
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,880
It’s gunpowder.

233
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Looks like they used this

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,590
to transport the gunpowder
to the cave over there.

235
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,000
Then they would

236
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,440
hide and wait for us to come.

237
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,760
So they can attack us.

238
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,540
Damn Li Zhang.

239
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,300
His used his little brain

240
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,860
to do these utterly
conscienceless things.

241
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,340
This is easy now.

242
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,980
If he used this cart

243
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,450
to transport the gunpowder,

244
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,140
we only need to follow the ruts,

245
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,780
and then we can find them, right?

246
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Do you think they are stupid?

247
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,380
The ruts at the entrance
have been cleared.

248
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,500
What if they faked

249
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,060
the ruts on purpose

250
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,210
to lead us to a dangerous place?

251
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,300
We have to find them
even it’s dangerous!

252
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,620
Those who are afraid
should get out of here now.

253
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,350
Don’t be garrulous and disturb us.

254
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,590
Xiao Jinli, who are you talking about?

255
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
Who do you think I’m talking about?

256
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,710
You...!

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,590
Xiao Jinli.

258
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,640
Leng Yue is just
analyzing the situation.

259
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,200
She is not wrong. What are you doing?

260
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,760
And you.

261
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,150
You can only talk
and make troubles for us.

262
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Xiao Jinli, are you a dog?

263
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,710
Don’t bite everyone you see.

264
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,590
I’ll just bite you. So what?

265
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
Go ahead and bite me!

266
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
All right, stop fighting.

267
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,400
We are all here for
Commandery Prince An and Chu Chu.

268
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,360
Confucius said...

269
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,980
Let’s go.

270
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,550
What did I tell you?

271
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,550
He’s bad-tempered.

272
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,200
He would become like a nut
when it’s about his brother.

273
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,190
All right.

274
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,280
Don’t let him get to you.

275
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,580
Confucius is right about this.

276
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,630
He said...

277
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,230
Saint Confucius is the best weapon
to deal with fighters.

278
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,280
Wait for me!

279
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,590
You are not afraid of dead people,
but you are afraid of mice.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,880
Dead people won’t
come out of nowhere suddenly.

281
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,200
It’s showing us the way.

282
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,840
You just yelled out

283
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,760
and scared it into the hole.

284
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,960
Yeah, I remember it.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
Snakes, insects, rats and ants know

286
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,200
where the exit is.

287
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,520
Let’s go.

288
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,120
General Xiao!

289
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,270
There are wagon tracks.

290
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,240
It should be in this way.

291
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,590
This way.

292
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,650
Let’s go.

293
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,350
Leng Yue, why should we go this way?

294
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,030
There are no ruts here,

295
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,110
but there are traces this way
that has been swept by branches.

296
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
On one would come here

297
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,230
to sweep the road unless
they have other intentions.

298
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,790
Your Highness, hold on.

299
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,790
What’s wrong?

300
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,350
There seems to be wind here.

301
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,470
Wind?

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,150
Yes, usually the place with the wind

303
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,590
is the place with the exit.

304
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,890
What’s wrong?

305
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,040
Are you not asking me to hug you?

306
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,160
I’m trying to tell the wind direction.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,710
What are you doing behind me?

308
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,000
I just want to know what you are doing.

309
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,520
I’m trying to tell the wind direction.

310
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,040
Wind direction?

311
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,190
Heat your hands and spread your arms.

312
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,830
The hand that cools quickly
shows the wind direction.

313
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,680
The entrance is blocked,

314
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,710
but it’s still ventilated.

315
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,520
There must be a way to the entrance.

316
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,950
This way.

317
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,560
This way.

318
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,230
This way.

319
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,560
There is the sound of
running water here.

320
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,460
What’s wrong?

321
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,430
Normally, the closer we are to the exit,

322
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,400
it should be windier

323
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,920
and less humid.

324
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,110
The stone wall should be drier.

325
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,710
But on the way here,

326
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,190
the stone wall is still very humid.

327
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
It doesn’t seem to change.

328
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,110
Maybe it’s because of
the rainy days recently.

329
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,920
Your Highness, look.

330
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,950
There is water on the ground.

331
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,110
Chu Chu.

332
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,710
Does the Yong’an River run under here?

333
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,830
Yes.

334
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,310
No wonder the stone wall is always damp.

335
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
The explosion just now

336
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,800
should have shattered the rocks.

337
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,920
This river is about to seep in.

338
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,280
It’s gunpowder.

339
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,470
This should be the way Li Zhang took

340
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,560
to bring gunpowder in.

341
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,070
We are in the right direction.

342
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,420
There must be an exit in front.

343
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,560
Chu Chu, we should hurry up.

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,920
Your Highness, it’s Miss Leng.
They came to find us.

345
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,950
Jinyu!

346
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Your Highness! Chu Chu!

347
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,040
Your Highness, are you okay?

348
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,800
Jinli!

349
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,950
We need to save them now.

350
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,590
This bridge should be broken
by the falling rocks.

351
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,400
We need to get them here now.

352
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Jing Yi, can you fly over there?

353
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,000
I can fly over there by myself.

354
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,520
But I’m afraid I can’t bring them back.

355
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,640
I’ll ask them to build a bridge
with boards now!

356
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,560
That would be too late.

357
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,400
The water is rising under the rocks.

358
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,190
This place will collapse soon.

359
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,000
It’s too late.

360
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,110
What should we do then?

361
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,710
Jinli, do you have any rope?

362
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,560
Rope?

363
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,430
Yes!

364
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,030
Use the rope as a bridge!

365
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,070
Bridge?

366
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,760
Do you forget the bridge of rope
in Guanling County?

367
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,040
Yeah, you are right.

368
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,280
Hurry up and get the rope!

369
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,020
-Hurry up!
-Yes!

370
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,880
Your Highness, take this.

371
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,760
Your Highness, let’s go.

372
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,950
Chu Chu, hold me tight.

373
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,880
Chu Chu!

374
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,110
-Jinyu!
-Chu Chu!

375
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,190
Chu Chu...

376
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,350
How should we do?

377
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,040
Chu Chu.

378
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,000
-Are you okay?
-I’m fine.

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,590
Are you okay, Jinyu?

380
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,110
I’m fine.

381
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,640
-Are you all right?
-Jinyu, are you all right?

382
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,880
It’s collapsing here. Let’s go now.

383
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,160
Come on.

384
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,190
Hurry.

385
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,000
Are you okay?

386
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,590
I’m fine.

387
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,830
Chu Chu.

388
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,900
(Dislocated arm)

389
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,160
I’m fine.

390
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,280
That bastard Li Zhang, I’m going to...

391
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
By the way, where’s Li Zhang?

392
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,470
We tied him up. He is in the cave
on the other side of the kiln.

393
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,110
I don’t know how he is doing now.

394
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,950
Jinli, please get some people

395
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,520
to clean the entrance of the kiln

396
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,710
and get Li Zhang out.

397
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,880
What? Get him out?

398
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,640
I can’t wait to skin him alive!

399
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
Even you want to skin him alive,

400
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,830
you still need to get him out first.

401
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,190
Li Zhang is an important witness.

402
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,560
And he is a small potato.

403
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Considering what happened today,

404
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,430
he failed it

405
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,420
and the person behind him
won’t let us go easily.

406
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,660
If we don’t find out
the person behind Li Zhang,

407
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,780
we will have more dangerous situations.

408
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,090
All right, I’ll listen to you.

409
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,940
You guys escort

410
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,500
Commandery Prince An and them back.

411
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,490
The rest of you come with me!

412
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,300
-Yes!
-Yes!

413
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,380
Let’s go.

414
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,900
Didn’t you go to the mountain?

415
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,610
Grandpa, it was my fault. I slipped

416
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,820
and dragged Commandery
Prince An into a cave.

417
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,610
Are you all right?

418
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,660
I’m fine, Grandpa.

419
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,380
Wait, what’s wrong with your arm?

420
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,490
It’s nothing. I just strained it.

421
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,120
Strained it?

422
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,610
Let me see.

423
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,620
It doesn’t matter.

424
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,780
You can’t even move your arm.

425
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,580
Don’t you know how serious it is?

426
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,940
If you don’t get treatment in time

427
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,420
and let the wind into your bones,

428
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,260
you will lose your arm.

429
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,980
Chu Chu, go and make some hot water.

430
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,940
I’ll take care of it.

431
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,060
Okay, I’m going.

432
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,300
Come on.

433
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,300
Okay.

434
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,080
Our families are coroners.

435
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,180
We often pull our muscles
and hurt our bones

436
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,710
when we carry stuffs.

437
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,580
No one can treat this injury

438
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,420
better than I do in Guanling County.

439
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
Bear with it later.

440
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,160
You can shout out if it hurts.

441
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,700
You can even cry.

442
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
No one will laugh at you.

443
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,530
Yes.

444
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,380
But don’t move.

445
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,700
Chu Chu, hold him up.

446
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,500
Don’t let him move.

447
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,260
Grandpa, do it gently.

448
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,620
How is it?

449
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,930
It doesn’t seem to hurt anymore.

450
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,980
You look gentle and weak.

451
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,380
But you can endure some pain.

452
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,740
Thanks to your excellent medical skills.

453
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,260
It doesn’t hurt anymore.

454
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,700
All right, take some rest here
for a few days.

455
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,170
Don’t use your arm.

456
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,090
You need to apply ointment
for some days.

457
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,130
Have some rest.

458
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,380
I’ll go to get the medicine for you.

459
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,580
Thank you, sir.

460
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,460
What’s wrong?

461
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,770
It really doesn’t hurt.

462
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,260
Don’t lie to me.

463
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,890
I’m a coroner.

464
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,010
What kind of injury you got,

465
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,810
how you got hurt,

466
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,220
I knew it at a glance.

467
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,500
I know how painful this is.

468
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,500
You got hurt because of me.

469
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,770
If I make you feel guilty
for saving you,

470
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,930
I would regret saving you.

471
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,390
Your Highness, your life is precious.

472
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,220
It’s not worth it to get hurt for me...

473
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,410
There is only one you in the world.

474
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,250
If you die,

475
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,500
I might be able to find another

476
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,190
good coroner like you.

477
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,530
But I can’t find another you.

478
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,090
It’s worth it anyway.

479
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,290
Your Highness.

480
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,250
All right, it’s okay.

481
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,060
-Father, what are you doing here?
-Hush.

482
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,660
You know what,

483
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,980
Commandery Prince An
is sincere to Chu Chu.

484
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,570
Of course he is.

485
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,740
How can you eavesdrop on
them at your age?

486
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,050
You little bastard.

487
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,140
Vice Minister Jing, you are back.

488
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,570
Where’s Commandery Prince An?

489
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,210
He is busy now. He will come back later.

490
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,970
How is it going with the tree hole?

491
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,730
Vice Minister Jing.

492
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,700
I took care of the tree hole

493
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,490
as you ordered.

494
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,460
Then I came back to the County Office.

495
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,970
Vice Minister Jing, forgive me
for asking this.

496
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,820
What did you do with Miss Leng?

497
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,420
I don’t mean anything else.

498
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,940
I’m just worried about you.

499
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,090
I heard a loud bang from the mountain.

500
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,940
Should I send some people
to take a look there

501
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,970
lest any villagers get hurt?

502
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,610
That’s what you are
talking about. It’s fine.

503
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,970
A cave collapsed.

504
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,370
No villager got hurt.

505
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,490
But Prefect Li got trapped
inside accidentally.

506
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,660
Prefect Li is trapped in the cave?

507
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Magistrate Zheng, don’t worry.

508
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,460
General Xiao went to save him.

509
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,300
You don’t need to
send anyone over there.

510
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,820
Just stay in the County Office

511
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,780
and take care of the affairs here.

512
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,870
Yes. Yes.

513
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,910
I see.

514
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
He asked for the trouble himself.

515
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,360
He won’t blame you.

516
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,480
By the way, where is
Deputy Magistrate Tan?

517
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
Vice Minister Jing.

518
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,080
Deputy Magistrate Tan asked for a leave
for funeral service these days.

519
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
He didn’t come to the County Office.

520
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,270
Do you have any instructions?

521
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,990
Nothing. I’m just asking it.

522
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,720
You’ve worked hard these days.

523
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,030
Go to rest early.

524
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,800
Don’t say that.

525
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,320
It’s my job.

526
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,600
How can you not tell me

527
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,870
that you got hurt?

528
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,320
I’ll tell General Xiao about it later

529
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
and let him discipline you.

530
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,080
Chu Chu.

531
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
Never let my brother know this.

532
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,510
Then you need to promise me

533
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,590
that you will let me apply ointment
for you on time,

534
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,490
and you will take medicine on time
and rest on time.

535
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,680
You can’t use any excuses
to refuse it to delay it.

536
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,230
Okay, I promise you.

537
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,800
You must recover
before you return to Chang’an.

538
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,190
Otherwise, when you get back to Chang’an
and let your mother know it,

539
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,360
she will be really worried.

540
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,680
I’ll go to get more ointment

541
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,990
from Grandpa later.

542
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,720
It’s a long way to Chang’an.
I should bring enough ointment.

543
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,080
Chu Chu.

544
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,360
I’m afraid we can’t go back
to Chang’an for now.

545
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,510
Not going back to Chang’an?

546
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,390
But we have found out

547
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,270
that Prefect Li is the one
who was minting coins illegally.

548
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,840
Is there anyone else we need to arrest?

549
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,560
This group of people

550
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,560
had a comprehensive plan to mint coins.

551
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,440
They hid it from
the government for five years.

552
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,800
It can be seen that how

553
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,740
cautious and composed the mastermind is.

554
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,360
But today, Li Zhang led us to the mint

555
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,560
and tried to bury us alive in the cave.

556
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,150
This is a hasty plan.

557
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,070
He acted so hastily.

558
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,800
It can be seen that we are very close

559
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,030
to the truth.

560
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,030
Close to the truth?

561
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,390
Isn’t Prefect Li

562
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,960
the mastermind of this case?

563
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,080
Li Zhang is just a pawn.

564
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,560
For the real mastermind,

565
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,600
it’s good if his cave plan

566
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,150
works out.

567
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,510
If not,

568
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,480
he would be the scapegoat
for closing the case.

569
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,820
Your Highness, you used to

570
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,540
say these things to Vice Minister Jing.

571
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,420
Why are you telling me this today?

572
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,490
I used to think

573
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,580
these disputes
and conspiracies in court

574
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,490
have nothing to do with you.

575
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,660
I don’t want to disturb

576
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,420
your simple and happy mind.

577
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,330
But now you are already in this.

578
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,020
I have to tell you.

579
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,020
I will learn well.

580
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,400
I’m not asking you to learn it.

581
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,180
I tell you this now

582
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,490
because I want you to be more cautious

583
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,130
and you will be safer.

584
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,090
This person who is
causing waves in Qianzhou

585
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,010
won’t stay put for too long.

586
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,130
Prefect Li is a high-ranking official.

587
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,330
But he is still not the mastermind.

588
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,210
Who can be the mastermind?

589
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,020
(Leng Peishan,
Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao)

590
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,010
Say it.

591
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,060
(Hou Bin, Deputy Military Commissioner
Zhao Jie, Military Ambassador)

592
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,650
General Leng.

593
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,950
Since you received a letter from
Miss Leng the day before yesterday,

594
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,250
you’ve got so much on your mind.

595
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,540
What happened?

596
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,330
Let us share the worries for you.

597
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,210
Yes, just make an order
if you need us to do anything.

598
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,730
We will shrink from no sacrifice.

599
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,850
Yeah, shrink from no sacrifice!

600
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,370
This is the first letter

601
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,130
she ever wrote to me.

602
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,420
Is Miss Leng in trouble

603
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,210
or in danger?

604
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:30,330
She wrote that she is doing well

605
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,610
and asked me

606
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,700
if I am doing well.

607
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,730
With her temperament,

608
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,180
it’s very uncommon for her

609
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
to write

610
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,540
such a common letter.

611
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,580
General Leng, could it be

612
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,780
that Commandery Prince An
knows our plan?

613
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,300
No way.

614
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,660
When Xiao Jinli was in the army,

615
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,940
he praised his little brother
countless times.

616
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,010
He is basically a legend.

617
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,610
Not to mention he is in Qianzhou now,

618
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,330
even he is thousands of miles away,

619
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,010
it’s not impossible for him
to sense our affairs.

620
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,060
That’s true.

621
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,940
Where’s Xiao Jinli? Is he not back yet?

622
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,130
He took a group of people

623
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,580
to move away the stones all night.

624
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,580
Li Zhang is troublesome indeed.

625
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,130
I hope Jinli can arrest him soon.

626
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,180
Then we can leave
this poor place earlier.

627
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,370
There are the same few dishes

628
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,940
every day and night.

629
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,850
I miss the food in Rugui House.

630
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,230
No matter how bad Li Zhang is,

631
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,760
he still did us a favor.

632
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,310
Did us a favor?

633
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,350
Didn’t you find out

634
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,040
that Chu Chu and Commandery Prince An
are totally different

635
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
after they came out of the cave?

636
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,470
It means

637
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,920
they must have solved

638
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,800
all the problems that need be solved.

639
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,190
We will be free if they are okay.

640
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,110
We should thank Li Zhang for that.

641
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,350
You have a point.

642
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,880
How about this,

643
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,190
if Li Zhang gets out alive,

644
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,120
I’ll treat him to his first meal.

645
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,320
Count me in.

646
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,470
It’s the same.

647
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,470
What’s our relationship?
My treat is your treat.

648
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,950
What’s our relationship?

649
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,950
We are...

650
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,710
We are sisters.

651
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,120
Your Highness.

652
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,150
Your Highness.

653
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,040
Have you had breakfast?

654
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,470
Should I get you a bowl and chopsticks?

655
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,360
No need.

656
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,670
His Highness

657
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,870
must have been fed by Chu Chu
before he came out.

658
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,910
Your Highness.

659
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,520
Is Jinli back?

660
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,120
We were just talking about that.

661
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,420
If he doesn’t come back later,

662
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,670
I’m going to go to the mountain
to check him.

663
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,950
This case is at a dead end now.

664
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,190
It’s all right if Li Zhang is alive,

665
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,800
but if he is dead,

666
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,320
when can we finish
the investigation in Qianzhou

667
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,470
and go back to Chang’an
to redress the old case?

668
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,970
Protect Lord!

669
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,560
