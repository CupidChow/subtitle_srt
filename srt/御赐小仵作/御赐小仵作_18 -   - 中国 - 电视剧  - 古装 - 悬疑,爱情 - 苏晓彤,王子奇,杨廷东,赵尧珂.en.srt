1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,960
Xu Rugui follows Qin Luan’s orders.

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,350
For all these years, he’s been
secretly investigating my father.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,710
Xiao Heng escaped.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,840
Catch him.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,360
There must be more secrets behind

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,550
Military Commissioner
of Jiannan’s usurp.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,870
Qin Luan must have held something
back from the imperial court.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,630
Maybe we can only find the answer

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,520
when we decipher the mysteries
my father left behind.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,840
Sir Witch Doctor drew these.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,720
He likes to draw?

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
He didn’t like it so much.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,150
But right before he left,

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,910
he somehow started to like it.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,470
He drew nothing else.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,360
He just drew mountains and trees.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,430
These are the views of Guanling County.

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,270
The mountain is Phoenix Mountain.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,950
The river is Yong’an River.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
The light.

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,160
Your Highness, what’s on your mind?

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,870
Does he always have
such thick window paper?

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,230
No.

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,000
It might start when
he began to like drawing.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,910
At that time,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,120
he bought many drawing papers.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Some were used to draw.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,800
Others were used as window paper.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He said it was windy at night.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
Air wouldn’t come through
if window paper was thick.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,880
Chu Chu, pull down the curtains.

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:59,060
=The Imperial Coroner=

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,900
=Episode 18=

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,960
Your Highness, it’s done.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,520
See if the other side’s wall
is different.

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,760
The wall?

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,320
Your Highness, come take a look.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,470
There’s a small bright spot in the wall.

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,520
I found it.

41
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,760
There’s a small hole that
has penetrated the wall.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
It was covered by both sides’
drawing paper.

43
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,470
When the room is dim,

44
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,550
if we light candles in
the other side’s cabinet.

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,710
The candle light will

46
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,190
cast this bright spot
on this side’s drawing paper.

47
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,720
Did Sir Witch Doctor do this?

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,880
In the previous Sui Dynasty,
construction was often performed.

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,800
Once, 300,000 taels of construction fee

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,400
(Rapid constructions)
got lost abruptly during transport.

51
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,430
They found no trace of it

52
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,550
(Transporting construction fund)

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,710
until Judge found out
how they hid the money.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,880
Then, the world knew the truth.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,520
(Judge)

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,470
(Notice)
The ministers involved in the case

57
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,370
(Truth came to light)
used the principle of Borrowed Light.

58
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,660
They used the tavern wall
and the paintings to

59
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,780
design a map to mark the location

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,370
(Borrowed Light)
where they hid the money.

61
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,970
So they can split booty afterwards.

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,020
(Treasure)

63
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,220
This case was adapted into novels

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,970
and was spread widely across the nation.

65
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,970
I think my father learned this trick
from it.

66
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,240
Your Highness,

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,110
something went wrong
with the Chu Family.

68
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,820
Let’s go.

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,210
Your Highness.

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,470
It’s my fault. Please punish me.

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,910
Grandfather, are you all right?

72
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,360
I’m fine. But your brother is missing.

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,800
Grandfather, don’t worry.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,350
His Highness is here.
My brother will be fine.

75
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,000
What happened? Who did this?

76
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,950
Where is Xu Rugui?

77
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,670
Your Highness,

78
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,000
we don’t know what happened earlier.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,350
Xu Rugui suddenly broke free
from the ropes,

80
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,640
attacked us and tried to run away.

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,000
When we were fighting,

82
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,830
these people who dressed like bandits
broke in.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
Xu Rugui was obviously their target.

84
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,440
We were outnumbered.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,790
Xu Rugui escaped amid the chaos.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
The bandits went to pursue Xu Rugui.

87
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,350
Zhang Yun is after them.

88
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,600
I stayed here

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,790
to ensure the Chu Family’s safety.

90
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,060
(Rope File)

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,380
(Cut)

92
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,350
Where is Chu He?

93
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,620
We didn’t notice that.

94
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,450
We also didn’t hear another fight.

95
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,900
We only found Chu He missing,

96
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,620
when the Chu Family’s seniors asked us.

97
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,450
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

98
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,250
I’ve already asked people
from County Office to pursue them.

99
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,850
How many bandits ran away?

100
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,540
Two.

101
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,660
Chu He spent time alone with Xu Rugui?

102
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,540
Yes, Your Highness.

103
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,170
Chu He brought food to Xu Rugui.

104
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,100
He spent around 30 minutes

105
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,690
alone with Xu Rugui.

106
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,850
Chu He?

107
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,170
This is a tool for carpenter work.

108
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,170
Xu Rugui must have used this

109
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,130
to cut the rope.

110
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,820
Why would Chu He help Xu Rugui escape?

111
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,900
Why did you allow

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,380
Chu He and Xu Rugui to spend time alone?

113
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,780
You...

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,820
It’s my fault.

115
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,730
Your Highness, please punish us.

116
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,060
Your Highness.

117
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,660
Chu Chu, inspect the bodies first.

118
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,760
Okay.

119
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,920
The dead is well built.

120
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,600
There are thick calluses on his palms
which were formed because of training.

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,230
The wound on his chest is fatal.

122
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,760
This man has the same calluses.

123
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,920
These people were soldiers.

124
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,790
Soldiers?

125
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,950
I can tell from the calluses
on their palms.

126
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,510
These were formed from
years of training as soldiers.

127
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
The training for soldiers

128
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,390
is different from the training
of martial art learners.

129
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,880
So the callus is different, too.

130
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,640
Soldiers?

131
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,110
Are they Shence soldiers
sent by Qin Luan

132
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,200
to silence Xu Rugui?

133
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,040
The group of people who broke in first

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
have Shence Army’s fighting skills.

135
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,040
But those who broke in later are weird.

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,510
Xu Rugui broke free from the rope

137
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,510
and fought with us.

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,390
At that moment,
the first group broke in.

139
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,950
They were determined to kill Xu Rugui.

140
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,830
Then the next group broke in.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
They didn’t try to kill Xu Rugui.

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,480
On the contrary,
they tried to protect him.

143
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,420
These two groups of people also
engaged in fights themselves.

144
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,920
Those who tried to kill Xu Rugui

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,000
were from Shence Army.

146
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,000
The other group was here to catch him.

147
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Catch him?

148
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,600
That’s weird.

149
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,870
No, it isn’t.

150
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,870
This is the fight between
the snipe and the mussel.

151
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,150
The snipe and the mussel?

152
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,040
Qin Luan’s Rugui House is the seller.

153
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,480
Those who committed the crimes
at Qianzhou is the buyer.

154
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,760
This originally should be a trade
that benefited both parties.

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,790
Now, Rugui House’s case
has been solved.

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,550
They’re now the snipe and the mussel.

157
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,230
Now, the mussel

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,830
knows everything about Rugui House.

159
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,790
They want to control Xu Rugui

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,070
and use him as leverage

161
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,920
to become the seller.

162
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,830
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
I’m so confused.

164
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
How can you be confused?

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,880
Let me explain it.

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
His Highness means that

167
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,000
there are two parties of bad people.

168
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,110
Two parties?

169
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,910
Yes.

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,790
One side wanted to kill people.

171
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
But they were unwilling
to do it themselves.

172
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,710
So they paid for hitmen.

173
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,840
The other group of people

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
commit murders for money.

175
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,080
Think about it. Killing for money

176
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,710
is supposed to be a secret.

177
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
So, the buyer just know

178
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,030
whether the target
has been killed or not.

179
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,790
They won’t know who does it.

180
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,030
But now

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
His Highness has shut down Rugui House.

182
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
The buyers now know

183
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,760
Xu Rugui is the one
who collected the money.

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
So,

185
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,470
the buyer discovered that

186
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,910
Qin Luan is behind Xu Rugui

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,710
and tried to use Xu Rugui
to threaten Qin Luan.

188
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,840
I get it.

189
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Then this is a double-cross.

190
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,350
That’s right.

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,520
Clear the floor first.

192
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,130
Jinli, your men are

193
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,300
more familiar with this neighborhood.

194
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,810
Please send more men to
search for Chu He.

195
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,100
Oh. Take Chu He’s dog with you.

196
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,780
It’s familiar with Chu He’s scent.

197
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,540
It can somehow help.

198
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,980
Xu Rugui is badly wounded

199
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,370
after this fight.

200
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,820
He can’t go far.

201
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,420
Pay attention
to the hiding spots nearby.

202
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,050
Okay.

203
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,570
Jing Yi. Leng Yue.

204
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,450
Go to County Office
and bring more people.

205
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,690
Clear this area.

206
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,690
Just tell them the bandits attacked.

207
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,780
Nothing more.

208
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,810
-Yes.
-Okay.

209
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,690
Chu Chu, come with me.

210
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,130
What?

211
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,540
Didn’t you hear it?
There is a breathing sound.

212
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,250
Someone has been following us.

213
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,300
No.

214
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,780
You must have made a mistake.

215
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,440
It’s our own breathing sound.

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,150
Xu Rugui is just ahead of us. Hurry.

217
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,150
Xu Rugui is very cunning.

218
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,670
Beware of his traps.

219
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,880
So annoying.

220
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,280
The forest is rainy. The road is muddy.

221
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,080
The passersby will leave foot tracks.

222
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,400
Observe the road.

223
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes.

224
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,200
Your Highness, actually I...

225
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,280
You already know, do you?

226
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
What should I know?

227
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,550
About my father and mother.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,200
You’ve interrogated Xu Rugui.

229
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,000
So, you must know everything.

230
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,790
He did say something about
your father and mother.

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,470
But those haven’t been verified.

232
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,880
After I verify it,

233
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,440
I’ll tell you everything honestly.

234
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
Did he tell you that

235
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,550
my father is

236
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,320
the rebel, Yun Yi?

237
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,790
Yes.

238
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
But it’s just his one-sided accusations.

239
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,280
We can’t come to a conclusion for now.

240
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,760
Can you tell me the things

241
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,790
you have verified

242
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,080
about my father and mother?

243
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,550
Xu Rugui is lying, right?

244
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,030
Bad people all lie, right?

245
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,910
I went to Xu’s Mansion to look for you

246
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,400
because Xu Rugui

247
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,470
left this clasp behind.

248
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,400
You’re saying
that Xu Rugui intentionally

249
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,110
left this at the scene for you?

250
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,710
Why would he do that?

251
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,050
At first, I didn’t understand either.

252
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,490
So I rushed back to County Office

253
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,930
and looked through
your mother’s bequest.

254
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,370
And I found out
that your father might be

255
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,860
an officer who worked for
Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

256
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,370
Then I understood his intention.

257
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
What is it?

258
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,860
He led me on the investigation
of your father,

259
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,690
hoping it can destroy
our trust for each other

260
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,100
and force you to leave

261
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,690
and become part of his team.

262
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,250
So,

263
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,570
what Xu Rugui said is real?

264
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,690
I told you.

265
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,810
It hasn’t been verified.

266
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,130
So we can’t reach a conclusion.

267
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,100
But you’ve already deduced that

268
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,370
he might be an officer for
Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

269
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,420
Then...

270
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,420
Is he the rebel, Yun Yi,

271
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,180
that Xu Rugui talked about?

272
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,450
That’s exactly why Xu Rugui is cunning.

273
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,370
He wanted me to discover this

274
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,610
when I was looking for you.

275
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,860
I would easily forget

276
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,370
that my original intention was

277
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,010
to search for your whereabouts.

278
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,340
Instead, I would go on an investigation

279
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,130
to see
whether your father was the rebel.

280
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,010
In that case, he would have more time

281
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,220
to get out of the pursuit.

282
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,610
But, Your Highness.

283
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,740
Chu Chu, finding your whereabouts

284
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,610
is different from the investigation
of your father’s identity.

285
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,250
The only connection

286
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,930
is the fact
that Xu Rugui wants to use it

287
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,300
to distract me.

288
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,720
What about now?

289
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,860
If my father is really the rebel,
Yun Yi,

290
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,690
will I get you in trouble?

291
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,660
Jinli.

292
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,130
General Xiao, why are you here?

293
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,370
This road leads to the mountain.

294
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,980
Are you going in the mountain area
to look for my brother?

295
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,780
What happened?

296
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,130
Chu He might have fallen into the river
by accident.

297
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,540
A clear mark at upper stream’s riverside
indicated that someone fell into the water.

298
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,810
The mark is roughly the same size
with Chu He’s footprint.

299
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,050
When we reached the spot,

300
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,010
we also heard a scream from Chu He.

301
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,430
And this dog’s reaction

302
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,590
also confirmed that

303
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,180
Chu He was once there.

304
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,130
But after that,

305
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,660
we found no trace of him.

306
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,440
My brother is a good swimmer.

307
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,880
He can get back to shore soon.

308
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,760
Chu Chu, don’t worry.

309
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,910
Chu He might have swum
to the opposite riverside.

310
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,960
I was talking to Chu Chu back then.

311
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,320
We didn’t pay attention to the river.

312
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,880
He might have swum to the other side.

313
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,350
Jinli, please take some men

314
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,760
and search the opposite riverside.

315
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,230
This row. Go search the other side.

316
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes.

317
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,230
Jinyu, come over here.

318
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,400
What?

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,640
I haven’t had time

320
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,150
to talk about this with you.

321
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,760
Chu He made such a scene.

322
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,280
I think it’s about that case.

323
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,550
We don’t have time to waste.

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,790
Just say it.

325
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,320
I accidentally heard

326
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Chu He and his father’s conversation
in the kitchen.

327
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
If I marry Chu Chu,

328
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,000
she will be my wife then.

329
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,290
Whether she accepts the family or not,

330
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,640
she is part of the Chu Family.

331
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,710
Even if you want to,

332
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
you have to get the approval
of Chu Chu.

333
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Ridiculous! He is...

334
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
What?

335
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,960
They’re not related by blood.

336
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,590
And over the past days,

337
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,230
by my observation, I think

338
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
he truly has feelings for Chu Chu.

339
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,710
And today’s incident.

340
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,670
Today’s incident?

341
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,230
What are your concerns?

342
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,520
You found a filing blade

343
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,640
in the coffin workshop, right?

344
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,960
The guards also said that

345
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,000
Chu He spent some time alone
with Xu Rugui.

346
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,200
Maybe,

347
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,590
Chu He found out that

348
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,200
Xu Rugui is Miss Chu’s uncle.

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,880
He’s worried that Xu Rugui
may take her away,

350
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,110
or get Miss Chu in trouble

351
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,440
because of his crimes.

352
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,790
So, he let Xu Rugui escape.

353
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
He thought if Xu Rugui escaped

354
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,760
or got killed,

355
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,040
Miss Chu could stay.

356
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,280
So you suspect that Xu Rugui
escaped to avoid the punishment?

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,000
Chu He’s tracks

358
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,910
follow the same route as Xu Rugui’s.

359
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,710
Don’t tell anyone this for now,

360
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,400
especially Chu Chu.

361
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,520
But, do you really think

362
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,760
Miss Chu is completely

363
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,350
unaware of Chu He’s feelings?

364
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,230
Miss Chu!

365
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,950
Jinyu!

366
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,200
Your Highness.

367
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,110
General.

368
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,590
General.

369
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,310
His Highness. Hurry.
Where is His Highness?

370
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,070
I have something I want to give you.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
With this Qiankun Mirror,

372
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,020
if you’re at a place without windows,

373
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,190
you don’t have to go inside.

374
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,160
You can use this to see the views inside

375
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,830
at the door.

376
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,400
Do you like it?

377
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,310
You’re Handsome Judge?

378
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,310
You don’t have to be so distant as well.

379
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Don’t call me Miss Chu.

380
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,760
Just call me Chu Chu.

381
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,560
What’s the embroidery
on your handkerchief?

382
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,800
It’s a bone.

383
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,400
The fifth rib bone on the left chest.

384
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,520
When you put your hand
on the bone’s position,

385
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,760
you can feel your heart pounding.

386
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,430
Hurry. Come on.

387
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,040
Jinyu, wake up.

388
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,310
Jinyu, are you all right?

389
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,040
Jinyu, wake up. Jinyu.

390
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,400
-Chu Chu.
-Wake up.

391
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,590
Jinyu.

392
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,400
Where’s Chu Chu?

393
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Chu Chu.

394
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,590
-Where’s Chu Chu?
-I...

395
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,350
-Hurry. Here’s one more.
-I don’t know.

396
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,100
Jinyu.

397
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,470
Chu Chu.

398
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,280
Are you crazy?

399
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Why did you dive in?

400
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,800
I...

401
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,110
I saw my brother’s clothes in the water.

402
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,800
I knew that

403
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,350
he was trapped in the river.

404
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,760
He took off his clothes to ask for help.

405
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,040
Those who grow up next to rivers
all know this.

406
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,590
But you shouldn’t jump in!

407
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,680
But, I...

408
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,560
He woke up.

409
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,470
He’s alive.

410
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,660
(Guanling Yamen)

411
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,470
Brother.

412
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,940
Miss Leng, how’s my brother?

413
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,700
He’s fine.

414
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,610
He was just startled
because he almost drowned.

415
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,630
I’ll write him a prescription.

416
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,210
Later, you can boil it
and make him drink.

417
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,460
Chu Chu.

418
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,420
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

419
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,070
Vice Minister Jing.

420
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,490
Why are you here?

421
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,180
I heard that things
went wrong at County Office.

422
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,370
So I came here in a hurry

423
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,330
to see if my service is needed.

424
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,320
Why are you in the wild

425
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,610
at the middle of the night?

426
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,060
(Foot Length: 10 inches
Foot Width: 4 inches)

427
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,420
Foot length is 10 inches.
Foot width is 4 inches

428
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,820
Stride is 1.9 inches.
Slightly crooked.

429
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,540
He’s the man from that night.

430
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,970
Please do us the favor,
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

431
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,180
Go get some medicine.

432
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,850
No need.

433
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,420
I know where the pharmacy is.

434
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,610
I can buy it myself.

435
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,900
Deputy Magistrate Tan, please

436
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,310
bring some clean clothes for Chu Chu.

437
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,010
Yes.

438
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,070
I’ll do it right now.

439
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,090
Jinyu, open the door.

440
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,900
I’m fine.

441
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,780
Open the door.

442
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,580
I’m changing my clothes.

443
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,610
Open it! Or I’ll break in.

444
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,520
I’ll break in!

445
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,130
Jinli, I’m fine.

446
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,420
How can you be fine?

447
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,610
You drowned once when you were a kid.

448
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,730
You were so sick that you almost died.

449
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,820
I’m not a kid anymore.

450
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,610
That won’t change anything.

451
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,820
Let Leng Yue check on you later.

452
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,210
The water is freezing.

453
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,660
How can you bear it?

454
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,940
If you’re sick,

455
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,420
what should I do in
a desolate place like this?

456
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,580
Who taught you how to swim?

457
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,490
You’re not a good swimmer.

458
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,060
How dare you dive in the flooding water?

459
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,090
No one taught me. I learned it myself.

460
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,090
What?

461
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,540
You said Chu Chu was mad.

462
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,610
I think you’re.

463
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,330
There were many people on the shore.

464
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,540
Who isn’t healthier than you,
or a better swimmer?

465
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,820
What were you thinking?

466
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,370
She dived in the water
without any notice.

467
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,940
What could I think of?

468
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,850
She lives next to Yong’an River.

469
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,210
The kids in the town

470
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,300
grow up playing in the river.

471
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,180
You don’t know how to swim.
And you’re unfamiliar with the river.

472
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,820
She might be the one who saves you.

473
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,860
If I say I don’t even know

474
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,170
why I jumped.

475
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,890
I was already in the river
when I realized it.

476
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,650
Jinli, would you believe it?

477
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,090
You!

478
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,900
I think you’re under a spell.

479
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,380
On the contrary, I was indeed

480
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,620
under a spell before.

481
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,810
I thought I could
see through everything.

482
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
But, in the end, I didn’t
even understand myself.

483
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,470
What?

484
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,050
Nothing.

485
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,010
Listen up.

486
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,690
No matter what happens,

487
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,370
you must stay away from water.
Do you hear me?

488
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,460
If you dare to jump
into the water again,

489
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,700
I’ll immediately escort you
back to Chang’an.

490
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,250
I got it.

491
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,460
Have the men you sent to

492
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,650
search for Xu Rugui returned yet?

493
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,700
No.

494
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,850
I left a team there.

495
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,970
They’ll keep on searching.

496
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,180
They’ll report to me

497
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,420
once they find anything.

498
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,900
Xu Rugui betrayed his master
to save his own life.

499
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,700
They now want him dead.

500
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,580
He dares not to go back to Chang’an.

501
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,250
If you’re right,

502
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,130
Guanling County is his hometown.

503
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,700
He knows every bit of this place.

504
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,010
It’s possible that

505
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,730
he’s hiding in the nearby mountains.

506
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,730
The Southwest Mountain
has a complex environment.

507
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,370
It might take a while to capture

508
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,900
a person who’s familiar with it.

509
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,700
How about I ask Magistrate Zheng
to assemble the villagers

510
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,770
and search the mountain together?

511
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,500
No.

512
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,290
If you startle Xu Rugui,

513
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,700
the innocent people might get hurt.

514
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,410
Let me think about it.

515
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,140
(Guanling Yamen)

516
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,290
Commandery Prince An.

517
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,810
This is the map of Guanling County.

518
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,260
Are you responsible
for guarding this area?

519
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,860
Yes.

520
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,860
Guanling County has
a complicated terrain.

521
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,170
The mountains and waters are
perplexingly intertwined.

522
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,260
(County Office Pingle Town Phoenix Mountain)
When I first came to the office,

523
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,050
there wasn’t any road connecting
the county to the outside world.

524
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,290
(Rocky mountain River Strop)
Villagers can only use strop.

525
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,520
(Villager)
Around five years ago,

526
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,830
Prefecture Yamen allocated special fund

527
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,950
to build official roads.

528
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
(Allocated fund to build road)
Then, people are able to

529
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,550
communicate more with the outside world.

530
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,830
(More communication with the world)

531
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,240
But since then,

532
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,190
there have been more bandits.

533
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,720
Commandery Prince An,

534
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,230
I have reported many times
to prefecture Yamen,

535
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,270
asking them to send us more men.

536
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,030
But there hasn’t been any follow-up.

537
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,600
About this, I...

538
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,080
You’re feeling wrong?

539
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,600
No, I dare not.

540
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,870
Since this case happened
in your administration,

541
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,560
no matter what the reasons are,

542
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,390
you’re the one responsible for it.

543
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,960
If I hear another excuse from you,

544
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,080
I’ll report you to the Imperial Court

545
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,960
to decide whether you’re wronged or not.

546
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,600
Commandery Prince An, don’t be mad.

547
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,600
I failed my obligations.

548
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,990
I must be punished.

549
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,390
Stand up.

550
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

551
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,390
Point out every possible way

552
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,720
that leads in or out of Guanling County,

553
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
whether it’s a road in the mountain

554
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,990
or one on the water.

555
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,430
Yes.

556
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,910
Commandery Prince An, this is
where Country Office is at.

557
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,200
There are six rivers
leading to the county.

558
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,150
Failed to catch him. Still pursing.

559
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,030
A bunch of fools.

560
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,080
I still need to do it myself.

561
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,540
(Jing’s Mansion)

562
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,870
Master.

563
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,360
Minister Xue has arrived?

564
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,480
No.

565
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,200
Someone from Xue’s Mansion said that

566
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
Minister Xue went to the palace

567
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,230
this morning and will return later

568
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,360
to visit you, Master.

569
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,960
The palace?

570
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,540
(The Book of Xiangjing)

571
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,810
Your Majesty.

572
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,460
One of the records made by Minister Feng

573
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,170
during his inspection at the Southwest
was missing.

574
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,890
Missing?

575
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,530
Which scroll? Where?

576
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,290
It was lost before
it was brought to the capital.

577
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,340
I’ve read the inspection records.

578
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,340
The time and routes recorded

579
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,650
in the three scrolls are consistent.

580
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,050
There’s nothing missing from them.

581
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,920
Your Majesty.

582
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,010
I only knew this

583
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
when Minister Feng’s
accompanying officers

584
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,500
handed over the work to me.

585
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,890
Besides the three scrolls of records
already submitted to Your Majesty,

586
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,010
Minister Feng compiled
information of other affairs

587
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,700
separately in another scroll.

588
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,410
What affairs?

589
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,500
I asked his accompanying officers.

590
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,890
They said they don’t know.

591
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,580
I did some investigation
at Feng’s Mansion.

592
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,130
No one at Feng’s Mansion
has ever seen it.

593
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,130
Minister Feng died the night
before his return to the capital.

594
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,010
Did this scroll get lost on
its trip back to the capital,

595
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,900
or...?

596
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,620
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

597
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,620
Your Majesty, don’t be mad.

598
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,240
This is a serious matter.

599
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,690
I dare not make a big scene.

600
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,380
I’m afraid I might be mistaken.

601
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,620
It might be left somewhere I missed.

602
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,530
Over these days,

603
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,090
because I searched everywhere
and found nothing,

604
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,260
then I dare to report to Your Majesty.

605
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,480
It would be fine if it’s just lost,

606
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,890
but if someone deliberately

607
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,290
prevented me from seeing the records,

608
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,810
it means that Feng Jie has really

609
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,530
found something on his trip.

610
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,740
(Qianzhou)

611
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,220
Your Majesty, ministers all know
that I was an Academician.

612
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,420
I’m not an expert in
military and political affairs.

613
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,230
Your Majesty, please allow me to

614
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,040
investigate Qianzhou’s prefecture-level

615
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,350
military and political affairs.

616
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,680
I’ll allow you to

617
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,920
investigate Qianzhou’s prefecture-level

618
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,920
military and political affairs.

619
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,680
Li Zhang, the Prefect of Qianzhou,
has been in office for years.

620
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
He’s been good at managing
military and political affairs.

621
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,510
You can take the opportunity
to learn from him.

622
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

623
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:08,990
Oh.

624
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,630
Who else knows about

625
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,110
the missing of Feng Jie’s
investigation record?

626
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,960
Only the few accompanying
officers know this.

627
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,750
I didn’t even tell the people
at Feng’s Mansion.

628
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,360
Don’t tell anyone about this

629
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,030
before you return to the capital.

630
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,840
Yes.

631
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,680
Eunuch Qin,

632
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,080
you asked me to keep an eye on

633
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,990
Shen Yu, the new Capital Liaison
Representative of Qianzhou.

634
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,390
It’s been a while.

635
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,510
Since Shen Yu came to the capital,

636
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
he’s been giving gifts

637
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
to every minister.

638
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,560
Even I have received from him

639
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,960
the specialties of the Southwest.

640
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,320
It’s normal to give presents and

641
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,870
make friends for a new minister.

642
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,200
Is there anything odd with the gifts?

643
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,650
No. Nothing.

644
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,420
Just some snacks or daily necessities.

645
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,470
Nothing valuable.

646
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,660
They’re roughly the same things
the other Qianzhou officers

647
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,330
gave to capital ministers.

648
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,440
Roughly the same?

649
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,560
What’s the difference then?

650
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,350
Are they entirely the same
or a bit different?

651
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,360
This... I...

652
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,440
I’m still looking into it.

653
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,360
Oh!

654
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,080
In the past, the ministers
were always talking about

655
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,600
the previous officers of Duke Chang.

656
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,030
I did some digging to see

657
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,130
if they have any connections with

658
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,230
Shen Yu.

659
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,480
I think

660
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,360
the story about Duke Chang
is just a rumor.

661
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,360
It’s not that simple.

662
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,150
Listen up!

663
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,440
Keep an eye on
what’s going on outside the palace.

664
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,560
Report to me immediately
when you get any news.

665
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,420
Yes.

666
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,260
And there’s more.

667
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,600
Not long ago, Wu Jiang
went to Jing’s Mansion

668
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,480
and gave Senior Jing a copper coin.

669
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,720
It’s from Qian Printing.

670
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,270
A copper coin?

671
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,660
Yes. Nothing more.

672
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,440
I tried my best

673
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,930
and found some information

674
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,030
from Ministry of Revenue.

675
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,480
But I just don’t know
the reason behind it.

676
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,120
A copper coin from Qian Printing.

677
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,360
Eunuch Qin.

678
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,570
Eunuch Qin,
His Majesty just gave an order.

679
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,680
What is it?

680
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,800
Xue Rucheng will visit Qianzhou.

681
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,480
The Southwest will get chaotic.

682
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,270
Xiao Jinyu went to
looking for Xiao Heng.

683
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,030
But all he found was a copper coin
from Qian Printing.

684
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,440
Xue Rucheng is also on his way there.

685
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,080
His Majesty

686
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,090
is contemplating
ordering a marriage.

687
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,320
And there’s Leng Peishan.

688
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,200
How interesting.

689
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,510
I’m free today.

690
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,590
So I want to play chess with you.

691
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,380
However, you went to the palace
early in the morning.

692
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,130
I heard that you had a long conversation

693
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,070
with His Majesty at Jiangshan Hall?

694
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,320
Seems that nothing can escape

695
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,740
Senior Jing’s observation.

696
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,200
I have begged His Majesty

697
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,930
to allow me to visit the Southwest soon.

698
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,820
Commandery Prince An left the capital.

699
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,390
Her Grace is worried for him.

700
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,150
Her Grace came to visit me
many times because of that.

701
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,200
Senior Jing, have you heard any news?

702
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,040
The situation at the Southwest
is complicated.

703
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,750
I’m worried that His Highness
might be in an adverse situation.

704
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,360
Yes.

705
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,480
Commandery Prince An is discreet.

706
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,670
But they had no experience

707
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,880
working with local officers.

708
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,630
This indeed makes us worried.

709
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,080
Senior Jing, you’re right.

710
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,320
Illegal copper coin case
involves many parties.

711
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,510
Commandery Prince An hasn’t reported

712
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,680
to the Imperial Court yet.

713
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,230
I don’t know

714
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,390
if he’s found out anything yet.

715
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,150
I’m worried that

716
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,720
if Leng Family from the Southwest
is involved in it...

717
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,840
Commandery Prince An
has always been prudent.

718
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,980
He won’t put himself in danger.

719
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,600
That’s right.

720
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,400
Their trip to the Southwest is
for Prince Consort.

721
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,190
If they can find Prince Consort,

722
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,750
who has been missing for years,

723
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,800
then the thousand-mile trip
isn’t made in vain.

724
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,190
I’m afraid it won’t be that easy.

725
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,640
Senior Jing, what are you worried about?

726
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,160
Nothing.

727
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,020
I was just thinking

728
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,750
if it’s that easy,

729
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,950
we should have heard the news
about Prince Consort sooner.

730
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,980
(Guanling Yamen)

731
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,840
Your Highness.

732
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,920
How’s Chu He doing?

733
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,470
Leng Yue said he’s fine.

734
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,430
She went to buy medicine for him.

735
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Chu Chu, go home first.

736
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
But, my brother...

737
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,420
Chu Chu.

738
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,500
Don’t worry. We’re here.

739
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
He’s said to be fine, right?

740
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
You should go home

741
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,290
and tell your family that he’s safe.

742
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,130
Miss Chu, let me take you home.

743
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,130
I’m not going.

744
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,980
I have to wait for my brother
to wake up.

745
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,500
If I go home and tell them
my brother is still in a coma,

746
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,130
they will be worried.

747
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,600
You must go home when I ask you to.

748
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,800
If you really see yourself as
the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

749
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,600
you must follow my orders.

750
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,750
If you think of my words
as unworthy of your attention,

751
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,670
you shouldn’t keep working for me.

752
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,400
Three Judicial Offices will be fine
with one less coroner.
