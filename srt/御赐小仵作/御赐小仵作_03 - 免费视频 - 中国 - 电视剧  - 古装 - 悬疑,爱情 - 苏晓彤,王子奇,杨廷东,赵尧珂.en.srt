1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,270
The Prince sent people to save me

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,880
and found my baggage for me.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,590
I’ve never seen
such a good official like him.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,200
It would be great
if I can work with him.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,560
The Prince should be the Handsome Judge.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,200
Otherwise, how would he know

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,070
so much about the Handsome Judge?

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,400
Miss.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,400
I think you’d better confess.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,790
You have tasted the food in the jail.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,440
Don’t you want a quick death?

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,200
A life for a life.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,150
I have nothing to say.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,560
I can’t report to Commandery Prince An

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,200
just with your life.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,310
Let’s talk about this.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,630
I heard from Commandery Prince An

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,720
that you killed Yan Ming
to steal something.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,460
You are a weak woman.

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,440
It’s not easy for you to use
great effort to steal something.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,910
I’m not asking you

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,720
to return it.

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,710
Just tell me

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,110
what kind of stuff it is.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,790
I’ll give Commandery Prince An

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,960
a similar one to finish my task.

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,000
It’s a win-win solution.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,750
Vice Minister Jing
has a glib tongue indeed.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,920
Since Prince An doesn’t know
what I stole,

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,880
you can put him off

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,680
with anything you want.

32
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,750
Why bother?

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,110
You really stole
something from Yan Ming?

34
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,440
I didn’t believe Commandery Prince An

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,470
when he told me about it.

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,560
Yan Ming is a nerd.

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,150
There are a few valuable paintings
and calligraphy works in his mansion.

38
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,230
But they are not worth enough

39
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,070
to get him killed.

40
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,360
And you had no chance to
take the thing out of

41
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,830
Yan’s Mansion on the night
when it happened.

42
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,360
I thought Commandery Prince An
made a mistake.

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,120
Now it seems that I really
have to give him something

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,470
to finish my task.

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,470
To be frank,

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,790
I really want to put him off

47
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,150
with something.

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,920
But who is Commandery Prince An?

49
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,280
He is Erlang.

50
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,750
Somehow

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,200
he got one more
truth-seeing eye than others.

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,750
It’s not as easy as you think

53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,030
to put him off.

54
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,390
Let’s take you as an example.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,110
You used great effort

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,080
to cover the blood and hide the weapon.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,870
But he still found you out.

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,230
I know you hid the thing
you stole in Yan’s mansion.

59
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
I need to

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,830
send the interrogation record

61
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,440
to Commandery Prince An tonight.

62
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,920
You are a smart woman.

63
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,800
Think about it.

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,270
If I hand in the record

65
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,820
and Commandery Prince An
closes the case,

66
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,910
the thing you hid
in Yan’s mansion will be safe.

67
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
Then you can give it to anyone you want.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,830
Just tell me

69
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,030
what kind of stuff it is.

70
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,520
Can I trust you?

71
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,870
You really hid the thing
in Yan’s mansion?

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
You...!

73
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,940
=The Imperial Coroner=

74
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,660
=Episode 3=

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,030
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,750
There are all kinds of people
in Chang’an.

77
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,380
This girl is so credulous.

78
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,950
It’s dangerous for her
to stay in Chang’an.

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,870
Should I warn her a little bit?

80
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
After all, the safety awareness
is necessary.

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,000
Her parents can say that.

82
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
Her relatives and friends can say that.

83
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,180
Ordinary people can also say that.

84
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,990
But officials like us
can never say that.

85
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,320
If the official asks people to

86
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,470
be on defensive day and night

87
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,470
and be cautious all the time,

88
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,600
why would the court keep us?

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,080
Please calm down. I was wrong.

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,880
Your Majesty.

91
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,920
Miss Chu has finished the autopsy.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,640
How do you know that?

93
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,430
What?

94
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,440
The words you just said.

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,110
The officials can’t say that

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,790
and why would the court keep you...

97
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,100
That’s what the Handsome Judge said.

98
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,160
How do you know that?

99
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,560
Has the Handsome Judge
you’ve been talking about

100
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,230
also said that?

101
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,590
Yes, that’s what he said.

102
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,630
You have never seen

103
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
that Handsome Judge,

104
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,360
how do you know what he said?

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,830
I heard a lot about him.

106
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,880
He said those words

107
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,670
when he was admonishing
the corrupt officials.

108
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,110
Where did you

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,950
hear about his deeds?

110
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,280
I just know it.

111
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,510
You haven’t told me

112
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,950
how you know these words.

113
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,310
I also heard it from someone else.

114
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,310
How is the autopsy?

115
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,840
I’ve finished it.

116
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,430
But there is something strange.

117
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,240
Your Majesty, can you
come with me and check it?

118
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,840
Okay.

119
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,030
The dead was male.

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,590
He was more than 30 years old.

121
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,990
The cause of death is being shot
by a short arrow in the heart.

122
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,070
His legs or feet were fine.

123
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,400
He pretended to be lame.

124
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,380
I should have found it out at the time.

125
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,470
But I panicked.

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,550
It’s not your fault.

127
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,100
He wanted to hurt you,

128
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,240
he would attack you
no matter you found it out or not.

129
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,360
Although he pretended to be lame,

130
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,310
he did have many scars on his body.

131
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,680
The oldest one is five or six years old.

132
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,680
The newest one is about one month old.

133
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,920
They are all sharp injuries.

134
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,640
He should be someone

135
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
who used swords and spears a lot.

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
There is a thick callus
on his right hand’s purlicue.

137
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,750
Based on the position
and the shape of the callus,

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,640
he should use knives a lot.

139
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,430
But there is one strange thing.

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,520
This man used his right hand a lot,

141
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,080
but he was left-handed.

142
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,030
What do you mean by that?

143
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,710
(Swordsman)
The callus on his right hand means he

144
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,080
(Swordsman)
often held a knife with his right hand.

145
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,270
When he hijacked me,

146
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,590
he also held the knife
with his right hand.

147
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,030
(Scholar)
But the callus caused by writing

148
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,310
is on his left hand,

149
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,840
which means

150
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,920
he wrote with his left hand
and held a knife with his right hand.

151
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,960
(Swordsman Scholar)
A left-handed scholar

152
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,710
and right-handed swordsman.
This person was too weird.

153
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,150
What’s the difference between me
and the man in charge?

154
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,840
A beard.

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,640
Isn’t it just a beard?

156
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,550
Zhou Han greets Eunuch Qin.

157
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,470
Have you finished it?

158
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,360
It was one step away.

159
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,870
Xiao Jinyu’s Chief Guardsman, Wu Jiang

160
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,710
suddenly showed up with his men

161
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,840
and took that female coroner away.

162
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,800
Did you men

163
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,150
fight with Xiao Jinyu’s people?

164
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,800
Yes.

165
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,640
But we’ve been very careful

166
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,960
to conceal our moves.

167
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,750
The captive was silenced in time.

168
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,710
What about the body?

169
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,960
Zhou!

170
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,060
Can’t you

171
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,080
clean up your own mess now?

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
Please rest assured.

173
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,440
That person never met anyone

174
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
from the Judicial Service.

175
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,200
Xiao Jinyu won’t know him.

176
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,390
What a fool.

177
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,360
Please calm down, I’m slow witted.

178
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,240
You are not slow witted.

179
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,920
You are retarded.

180
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,030
Let me ask you.

181
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,870
Did your men

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,750
see the pendant again?

183
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,360
Yeah.

184
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,520
But

185
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,120
they didn’t get it.

186
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,200
Find some clever men

187
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,780
and keep a close eye on Xiao Jinyu

188
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,310
and Princess Xiping.

189
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
Let me know immediately

190
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,470
if anything happens,

191
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,430
especially when it’s about the pendant.

192
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,030
What’s more,

193
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,640
go back and shave the hair
around your mouth.

194
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,470
I’ll kill everyone in your family

195
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,950
if I see one more hair again.

196
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,680
I know.

197
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,590
Get out!

198
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Master.

199
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,150
Would Zhou Han this idiot

200
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,840
implicate us?

201
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,120
Keep an eye on the outside.

202
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,080
Yes.

203
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,990
It wouldn’t be strange if he
was originally in the army.

204
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,430
In the army?

205
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,640
A martial artist

206
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,230
would hold the weapon with his hand

207
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,840
that he is comfortable with.

208
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,640
But it’s different in the army.

209
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,350
The soldier must hold the weapon
with the right without exception.

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,480
Therefore, the left-handed

211
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,550
will become ambidextrous

212
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,790
after they join the army.

213
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,110
I just arrived in Chang’an.

214
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,220
I haven’t offended anyone
who served as a soldier.

215
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,640
You didn’t offend him.

216
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,990
It’s him who was on to you.

217
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
On to me?

218
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,750
I have no money.

219
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,830
I see.

220
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,510
What?

221
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,550
When he hijacked me,

222
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,540
he told me

223
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,710
that he won’t kill me

224
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,840
if I go with him.

225
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,400
I think he fell in love with me.

226
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,310
He wanted to take me back
and made me his wife.

227
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
It’s getting late.

228
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,990
Miss Chu.

229
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,870
You...

230
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,080
Chu Chu.

231
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,200
Have you found a place
to stay in Chang’an?

232
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,720
Not yet.

233
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,910
I’m worried that the inn owner
doesn’t want to take in a coroner.

234
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,400
I wanted to find a deserted temple.

235
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,670
But there seems to be
no deserted temple here.

236
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,390
The stores will be closed

237
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,750
half an hour later.

238
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,110
I’ve taken too much of your time today.

239
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,080
You can stay in

240
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,550
the Three Judicial Offices if you want.

241
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,600
It is also convenient for me
to discuss these unfinished cases

242
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,990
with you at any time.

243
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,520
Live in the Three Judicial Offices?

244
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,200
I also live in

245
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,310
the Three Judicial Offices.

246
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,350
Well,

247
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,520
do you have other plans for the night?

248
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
No.

249
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,230
I’m willing to.

250
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,950
I can work for you

251
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,310
if you don’t mind.

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,430
I can do anything.

253
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,200
I won’t stay there
and eat your food for free.

254
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,860
(Three Judicial Offices)

255
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,990
Miss Chu, please have some tea.

256
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,430
You are...

257
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,350
I’m a maidservant here, Lian Qiao.

258
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,070
You can order me

259
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,030
if you need anything.

260
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
No.

261
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,520
Have you been working here
for many years?

262
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,350
Yes.

263
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,270
You must know a lot

264
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,430
about the Prince, right?

265
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,400
What do you want to know?

266
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,350
Is the Prince married?

267
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
The Prince isn’t married.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
No way.

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,640
How is he not married

270
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
at this age?

271
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,700
In our Pingle Town,

272
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,870
a man at his age

273
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,160
should become a father long ago.

274
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,350
The Prince is still young.

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
How is Miss Chu doing?

276
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,150
Miss Chu has settled down.

277
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,040
Our guards live in Liutao Office.

278
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
They will report immediately

279
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,280
if anything happens.

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,750
Did she ask you anything
about the mansion?

281
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,480
Never.

282
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,660
But

283
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,430
Miss Chu asked me about a place.

284
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,440
What place?

285
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,580
Do you know where the Six Gates is?

286
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,640
The Six Gates is the Judicial Service.

287
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,430
Here?

288
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,790
Not really.

289
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,040
The Six Gates

290
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,310
is what the people working in the office

291
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,480
call it.

292
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,430
It’s a nickname.

293
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,280
No.

294
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
I’m not talking about this Six Gates,

295
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,600
but the Six Gates

296
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,990
with constables and the Handsome Judge.

297
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,840
Let her do whatever she wants
in the mansion

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,340
and give her what she wants.

299
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,230
I’d like to see

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,220
what she’s up to.

301
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,670
Does he have someone he likes?

302
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,400
Why are you so interested in
the Prince’s love life?

303
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,160
I just don’t get it.

304
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,110
What kind of woman

305
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,470
can match such a handsome man

306
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,870
like the Prince?

307
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,640
It would be the best if she is

308
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,550
a lady with double-fold eyelids
and a high nose.

309
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,990
With the appearance of the Prince,

310
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,960
their child will be really good-looking.

311
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,480
I dare not discuss
the Prince’s personal life.

312
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,720
But what you just said,

313
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,080
that’s how the girls in Chang’an

314
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,190
talk about Vice Minister Jing.

315
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,430
It’s rare that a girl would praise
the Prince like you do.

316
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,870
The girls in Chang’an

317
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,480
do have a strange taste.

318
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,910
How handsome the Prince is.

319
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,400
By the way,

320
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,910
I also want to know

321
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,390
if there is any work
I can do for the Prince.

322
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,310
Anything can do.

323
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,280
Work?

324
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,350
Miss Chu asked me

325
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,200
to bring you a hot

326
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,030
boiled egg.

327
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,670
I’m not hungry.

328
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,510
She asked me to peel the egg

329
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,550
and roll it on the wound
on your forehead.

330
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,550
It can promote blood circulation
and disperse blood stasis.

331
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,400
Go ahead.

332
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,960
Your Majesty.

333
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,990
You’ve been suspecting

334
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,230
Miss Chu’s background,

335
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
but why did you still ask her
to do autopsies again and again?

336
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,520
Although she is suspicious,

337
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,640
she is a talented coroner

338
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,750
indeed.

339
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
She is more gifted

340
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,870
than other coroners.

341
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,540
It’s not something

342
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,430
you can have through learning.

343
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,310
I’ve heard that those who play zithers

344
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,600
or draw need to be gifted.

345
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,400
A coroner’s work

346
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
is to find out how a person dies.

347
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,080
Does it make any difference
being gifted or not?

348
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,750
For ordinary coroners,

349
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,960
a corpse is just a corpse.

350
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,430
But for her,

351
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,230
these corpses seem to be alive.

352
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,200
Alive?

353
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,230
She can feel what they feel,

354
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,480
and think what they think.

355
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,540
I have never seen

356
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,200
such a peculiar coroner like her.

357
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,600
It would be the best

358
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,080
if my suspicion of her

359
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,430
is just misunderstanding.

360
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
If not,

361
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
I would like to give her a chance

362
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
to get back on the right track.

363
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
I believe that.

364
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,550
Jing Yi was going down
the wrong path at that time,

365
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,790
but you still pulled him back
to the right tract.

366
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,080
What?

367
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,640
What do you mean?

368
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,910
Are you asking me to roll away?

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,870
Well, I’ve worked my butt off.

370
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,750
It’s under curfew now
and I can’t go home.

371
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,280
I just got here, and you did that to me.

372
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,000
Just go.

373
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
There are snacks
from Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

374
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
It’s the top grade.

375
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,830
What about the confession?

376
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,600
It’s kind of troublesome now.

377
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
The scroll you talked about

378
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,080
is really hidden in Yan’s mansion.

379
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,550
I have found it.

380
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,750
But when I took the scroll back
to the Court of Judicial Review

381
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,230
and wanted to
question that dancing girl,

382
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,790
she died of poison.

383
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,630
I have found someone to check her body.

384
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,870
It’s aconitine.

385
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,910
Aconitine?

386
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,390
She is a dancing girl.

387
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,140
How did she get
this highly poisonous herb?

388
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,840
She might get it
while dancing at some place.

389
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,430
This is the scroll.

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,510
This is a book

391
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,910
about anecdotes of the Wuzong Dynasty.

392
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,870
Yan Ming wrote a bunch of

393
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,640
(Duke Chang)
messy comments next to it.

394
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,320
(The Imperial Family)

395
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,100
(Mystery)
He seemed to be interested in

396
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,990
the Emperor Wuzong’s
young son, Duke Chang.

397
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,600
I mean Yan Ming was a scholar.

398
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,790
He didn’t study poems and songs,

399
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,790
but study dead people like coroners.

400
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,310
Yan Ming...

401
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,670
Might be looking for someone.

402
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,550
Looking for someone?

403
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,160
Who was Yan Ming looking for?

404
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,550
A dead person.

405
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,960
A person that no one can find.

406
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,070
What are you talking about?

407
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,400
I think Yan Ming
had nothing better to do.

408
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,870
Anyway,

409
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,790
the murderer who killed Yan Ming
is already dead.

410
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,040
We can offer an explanation
to the Emperor now.

411
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,230
Watch your attitude when you
go to court tomorrow.

412
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,780
My father and Mr. Xue

413
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,510
told you many times

414
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,350
to make more friends and less enemies.

415
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,540
I have no intention of making enemies.

416
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,200
That’s good.

417
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,040
But those who are against
truth and justice

418
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,960
are my enemies.

419
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,040
Wash your hands
that just touched the poison.

420
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,870
I asked the kitchen
to save some food for you.

421
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,080
You rest here tonight.

422
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,310
Tomorrow morning,

423
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,870
go to the Shence Army and ask about

424
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,870
if there is a junior officer
in his thirties missing

425
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,040
who has been in the army

426
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,990
for about five years.

427
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,750
Shence Army?

428
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,040
Did those eunuchs cause
any trouble again?

429
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,430
When we left Yan’s Mansion today,

430
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,990
there were soldiers in disguise

431
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,310
who tried to hijack Miss Chu.

432
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,840
They failed

433
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,870
and used this to kill the captive.

434
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,220
This arrowhead

435
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,310
is not something
that an ordinary blacksmith can make.

436
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,640
This is made by the Crossbow Agency
of the Weapon Bureau

437
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
exclusively for the army in the capital.

438
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,280
I asked someone

439
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,160
to get it from the Crossbow Agency.

440
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,880
Are you suspecting

441
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,560
that someone from the Shence Army
tried to hijack Chu Chu?

442
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,700
If you verify it

443
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,030
and there is such a person missing
in the Shence Army,

444
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,630
then it’s not a suspicion anymore.

445
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,430
Qian Printing made
copper coins illicitly.

446
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,790
The dancing girl.

447
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,430
(Qian)
The aconitine.

448
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,200
They are all related to the Southwest.

449
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,480
Why does Prince An care so much about

450
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,480
the witch doctor’s pendant?

451
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,550
Yan Ming was killed for looking into
the son of the late emperor.

452
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,960
The dancer who killed him took poison
when she was found out.

453
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,670
Prince An said he is not
the Handsome Judge.

454
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,760
But why does he know so much

455
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
about the Handsome Judge?

456
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,430
The case of Yan Ming is not that simple.

457
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,720
Help!

458
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,720
Help!

459
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,120
Help!

460
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,960
My Lady.

461
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,300
My Lady, are you okay?

462
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,310
What happened?

463
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,630
Master...

464
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,960
Master...

465
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,510
Master died.

466
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,630
My Lady.

467
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,760
It’s okay, My Lady.

468
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,390
It’s not me, it’s not me.

469
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,720
-It’s not me.
-My Lady, don’t be afraid.

470
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,670
Go to get Madam!

471
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,180
(Pull out the net and guard the back)
(The Book of Songs)

472
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,070
Master.

473
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,300
Master, wake up!

474
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,630
Anybody, get in here.

475
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,360
Your Highness.

476
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,600
What happened?

477
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,910
Have all the chickens of Chang’an
flown here to file a complaint?

478
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,340
The chickens didn’t fly here.

479
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,880
Miss Chu bought them.

480
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,960
Why would she buy chickens?

481
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,990
Your Highness.

482
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,550
Go ahead.

483
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,630
There is the obituary
from Minister Feng’s Mansion.

484
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,550
Obituary?

485
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,100
(Feng’s Mansion Liu)

486
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,200
Feng Jie passed away last night.

487
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,300
Didn’t Minister Feng go to the Southwest
to inspect military affairs?

488
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,360
How did he die?

489
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,240
Tell the housekeeper

490
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,390
that I’ll go to the Palace first.

491
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,840
I’ll go to Feng’s Mansion to
express condolences after I come back.

492
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,630
Yes.

493
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,460
(Three Judicial Offices)

494
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,270
You are back, Your Highness.

495
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,120
Your Highness.

496
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,880
You may rise.

497
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,160
You are...

498
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Raise chickens.

499
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,150
I made a coop last night.

500
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,670
I asked Lian Qiao to buy
these chickens this morning.

501
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,240
I bought them with the wages
you gave me.

502
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,670
The chicken in Chang’an
is too expensive.

503
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,310
If it’s in our Pingle Town,

504
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,430
I can at least buy dozens of
chickens with this money.

505
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,670
Didn’t Wu Jiang tell you

506
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,790
that you don’t need to
worry about the food here?

507
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,960
General Wu did.

508
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,100
But

509
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,840
I can’t live here for free.

510
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,390
Lian Qiao said

511
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,760
that there are people

512
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,670
who wash clothes and cook for you.

513
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,630
You don’t need me to do it.

514
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,510
I asked them.

515
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,720
You didn’t raise chickens

516
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,030
or grow food here.

517
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,840
There happens to be
a vacant plot of land here.

518
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,430
So I made use of it for you.

519
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,420
After these chickens grow up,

520
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,150
they can lay eggs when it gets warmer.

521
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,720
Chicken lay eggs,
and there will be more chickens.

522
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,390
Considering the price
of commodity in Chang’an,

523
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,360
I can make a lot of money for you.

524
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,790
Thank you for all the trouble.

525
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,870
Not at all.

526
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,910
After the winter is over,

527
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,710
I will clean up
the ground in the backyard

528
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,080
and grow vegetables and grains.

529
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,790
Are you going to grow vegetables here?

530
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,820
It’s a waste to only

531
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,790
raise chickens in such a big area.

532
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,720
But I don’t know

533
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,760
what should be grown here.

534
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,030
If it’s in our Pingle Town,

535
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,790
the rice in the backyard

536
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,390
is enough to feed
the big family for a year.

537
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,000
Lian Qiao.

538
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,200
Go to prepare a set of maid’s dress.

539
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,880
Yes.

540
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,240
Miss Chu, let’s talk about

541
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,030
these stuffs later.

542
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,630
I don’t know

543
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,670
if you can do one favor for me.

544
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,120
Autopsies?

545
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,720
Yes.

546
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,760
Of course I can.

547
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,120
But it’s not for the offices.

548
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,430
It’s my personal affairs.

549
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,630
Don’t worry.

550
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,550
Whether it’s for you or the offices,

551
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
I will do the autopsy well.

552
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,840
I won’t put you off.

553
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,480
This time you can’t do it in public

554
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,270
and you can’t use any tools.

555
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,000
You also need to dress up as my maid

556
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and come with me.

557
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,430
Is it okay?

558
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,670
Dress up as a maid and do the autopsy?

559
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,840
But

560
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,080
I’ve never done that before.

561
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,000
If you think I can do it,

562
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,000
I’ll go with you.

563
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,600
You can do it.

564
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,390
Feed these grains to the chickens.

565
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
Thank you.

566
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,840
This dress is too troublesome.

567
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,240
Putting it on is even harder
than making a basket.

568
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,600
You will get used to it.

569
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,550
Your Highness.

570
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,200
Don’t be afraid.

571
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,480
They don’t bite people.

572
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,120
How would I be afraid of them?

573
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,200
I just don’t want to stain my garments.

574
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,790
Your Highness.

575
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,150
It’s the first time for me
to wear this kind of clothes.

576
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,150
How should I work dressed like this?

577
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,600
Stay here for a while,

578
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,880
I’ll teach you later.

579
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,790
The towel.

580
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,510
Isn’t the towel right in front of you?

581
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,420
You are a maid.

582
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,510
If I take it by myself,
why would I need you?

583
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,840
Use your both hands.

584
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,790
Keep your head down.

585
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,200
It’s too much, lift up a little bit.

586
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,840
Your Highness.

587
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,630
My third neck bone is about to break.

588
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,430
Stand up.

589
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,510
Keep your spine straight.

590
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,030
Place the towel
on the palms of your hands.

591
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,670
Lower your elbows.

592
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,080
Raise your wrist bones
to the collarbones.

593
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,600
Keep your sixth and seventh
neck bones straight.

594
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,760
Bend the fifth to the first neck bones.

595
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,790
Withdraw your jawbone a little bit.

596
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,910
Have I allowed you to move?

597
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,150
Have you remembered this posture?

598
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,960
Yes.

599
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,960
I’ve remembered
the position of each bone.

600
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,270
Put it back.

601
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,790
Answer yes.

602
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,720
Yes.

603
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,720
Keep your hands folded.

604
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,910
Put your right leg back.

605
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,790
Then squat down.

606
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, get up.

607
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,510
How dare you!

608
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,180
You...

609
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,720
Why do you have no scars?

610
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Weren’t you hurt before?

611
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,830
What?

612
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,720
A sword wound.

613
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,550
About two inches long,
so deep that the bone was visible.

614
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,880
After healing, there is a scar
as thin as an ink line.

615
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,550
No.

616
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,670
Is he really not the Handsome Judge?

617
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,430
What did you say?

618
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,270
Nothing.

619
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,430
But you are really white.

620
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,630
The creamy skin in the book

621
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
should be like this.

622
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,240
Enough, come with me.

623
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,700
(Feng’s Mansion)
(Funeral)

624
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,150
Banxia greets Your Highness.

625
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,030
You are exempted.

626
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,720
Is Aunt Banxia here
to mourn for your mother?

627
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,760
Yes.

628
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,200
You are...

629
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,840
I’m also here to mourn Minister Feng.

630
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,760
I’ll leave then.

631
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,820
Your Highness.

632
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,600
Did I just give it away?

633
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,390
Yes.

634
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,510
What to do then?

635
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,430
It doesn’t matter.

636
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,120
It’s okay that you gave it away here.

637
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,270
Just follow my instructions

638
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,790
after we get in there.

639
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,520
Senior Jing.

640
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,070
Okay.

641
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,070
Scholar Xue

642
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,840
and Vice Minister Jing have arrived!

643
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,200
Senior Jing.

644
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,960
Sir.

645
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,270
After we get in Feng’s Mansion,

646
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,720
I will go to the mourning hall.

647
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,600
After I finish the funeral service,

648
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,200
I will give the incense to you.

649
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,430
Then you take a look at Feng Jie’s body

650
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,760
when you insert
the incense into the burner.

651
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,550
I can only take one look?

652
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,120
If you can tell the cause of
his death by taking one look,

653
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,840
then yes.

654
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,910
What if I can’t?

655
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,880
Miss.

656
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,000
Let me do it.

657
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,910
Hurry up.

658
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,070
Servants!

659
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,390
Servants!

660
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,390
Clear it up.

661
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,080
Come on, get up.

662
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,420
Come on.

663
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,150
My lords.

664
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,760
Please move to the side hall to rest.

665
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,270
These are... scratches?

666
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,220
Miss!

667
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,950
Madam, look at her!

668
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,270
What are you doing?

669
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,030
This incense ashes were
splashed on Minister Feng.

670
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,270
He can’t wear this shroud.

671
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,670
What are you doing?

672
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,840
When ashes fall on the shroud,

673
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,080
it’s the dead soul
protesting against an injustice.

674
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,000
It’s unlucky.

675
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,080
You should change the shroud now.

676
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,080
What injustice?

677
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

678
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,110
Don’t slander our Master.

679
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,760
Well...

680
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,600
Don’t talk nonsense.

681
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,080
Apologize to Madam Feng now.

682
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,350
I’m not talking nonsense.

683
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,150
Don’t you talk back!

684
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,430
Your Highness, she is not
talking nonsense.

685
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,430
I have also heard about it before.

686
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,800
Madam, I think

687
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,360
you’d better change
Minister Feng’s shroud.

688
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,550
We don’t believe it.

689
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,790
But if someone who believes it sees it

690
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,720
and spreads it out,

691
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,270
won’t it hurt
Minister Feng’s reputation?

692
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,270
Well...

693
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,740
(Antique Store)

694
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,150
Sir.

695
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,760
We got new products from the Southwest.

696
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,500
(Book of Songs)

697
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,550
Give it to me.

698
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,880
By the way,

699
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,150
Senior Jing rushed us a few times.

700
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,160
Pack his goods

701
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,390
according to the list
as soon as possible

702
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,430
(Book of Songs)
and send them to him.

703
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,200
Yes.

704
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,760
(Auspicious)

705
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,270
Master passed away suddenly.

706
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,990
Everything is prepared in a rush.

707
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,630
Please forgive us if we
didn’t serve you well.

708
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,510
When did Minister Feng
return to the capital?

709
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,910
What kind of disease

710
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,720
caused his sudden death?

711
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,910
Just before the gate closed yesterday,

712
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,310
Master entered the capital

713
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,080
and went to the welcome banquet

714
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,480
held by his colleagues.

715
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,360
It was a laborious trip
and he had a few more drinks

716
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,270
which brought about
the terrible disease.

717
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,120
When you get old,

718
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,790
you can’t neglect your health.

719
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,150
Scholar Xue is right.

720
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,960
That’s how our Madam said to Master.

721
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,000
But Master was busy
with official duties

722
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,430
and he turned a deaf ear to her words.

723
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,120
I remember that Minister Feng
had no sons

724
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,550
but three daughters.

725
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,270
Why didn’t I see any of them?

726
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,000
Their husbands are talking offices
outside the capital.

727
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,080
The three ladies are out there
with their husbands.

728
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,030
Master passed away suddenly.

729
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,030
I’m afraid they won’t come back

730
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,000
until the day when Master is buried.

731
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,030
What about the Second Lady?

732
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,910
Master went to the Southwest for
inspections and had been away for long,

733
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,150
he died suddenly just as he came back.

734
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,910
The Second Lady is too sad

735
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,840
and she falls sick.

736
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,030
She can’t greet guests now.

737
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,120
What’s gone is gone.
You should comfort her.

738
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,880
Yes.

739
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,480
I’ll leave.

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,200
Your highness.

741
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,670
I met Prince An before
I left Feng’s Mansion.

742
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
Jinyu went to Feng’s Mansion
to express condolences?

743
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,550
Yes.

744
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,880
Did he go there alone?

745
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,910
He also brought a girl.

746
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,310
I’ve asked someone

747
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,430
and she is a coroner.

748
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,630
Jinyu

749
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,310
brought a coroner to Feng’s Mansion
to express condolences?

750
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
Go to the Three Judicial Offices

751
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,790
and tell Jinyu

752
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,000
that there is something
really important.

753
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,550
If he doesn’t come to me,

754
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,760
I’ll go to see him.

755
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,700
Yes.

756
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,900
(Feng’s Mansion)
(Funeral)

757
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,200
Good day, Commandery Prince An,
Scholar Xue.

758
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,150
What was that about
in the mourning hall?

759
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,630
I have some doubts.

760
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,000
I want to know the truth.

761
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,630
Is there anything wrong?

762
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,510
I haven’t found it out.

763
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,270
You are getting crazier.

764
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,790
What if the Emperor knows it?

765
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,150
Good day, sir.

766
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,310
Good day, Senior Jing,
Vice Minister Jing.

767
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,200
If you have time,

768
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,710
come to my mansion
and have a simple meal.

769
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,270
Father, forget it.

770
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,430
If Commandery Prince An
comes to our mansion,

771
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,030
Mother will introduce girls
to him again.

772
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,030
Just give me a break.

773
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,910
What does it have to do with you

774
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,000
that your mother introduces girls
to Commandery Prince An?

775
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,910
What does it have to do with me?

776
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,840
The city gate is on fire, disaster
is brought to the fish in the moat.

777
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,590
Well...

778
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,360
Senior Jing.

779
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,480
There have been many trivial matters
in the Three Judicial Offices.

780
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,760
I won’t bother you today.

781
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
I’ll visit Aunt in person
some other day.

782
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,240
But I have some official affairs
to discuss with Jing Yi.

783
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,760
Can you let Jing Yi go back with me?

784
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,270
Okay.

785
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,840
Be serious about your work
with Commandery Prince An.

786
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,840
Otherwise, I’ll go back
and tell your mother about it.

787
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,510
Senior Jing, don’t worry.

788
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,720
I’ll leave.

789
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,840
What a tattletale.

790
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,430
At lease

791
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,960
you parents are healthy.

792
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,260
(Feng’s Mansion)

793
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,960
Your Highness, I was really scared.

794
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,480
I thought I was going to
give myself away.

795
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,630
You really went there
to do an autopsy?

796
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,430
Don’t you know that?

797
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,240
Then why did you help me out?

798
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,000
Commandery Prince An

799
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,910
doesn’t attend any wedding or funeral.

800
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,790
He brought a coroner
to the funeral this time.

801
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,270
Isn’t it obvious?

802
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,150
When the fox preaches,
take care of your geese.

803
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,630
Fox?

804
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,840
It’s just an inappropriate analogy.

805
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,480
Chu Chu, did you find anything

806
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,760
from that quick glance?

807
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,150
There is...

808
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,430
Hold on.

809
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,840
It’s time for lunch.

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,120
Chu Chu, are you hungry?

811
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,270
I’m a little hungry.

812
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,240
I fed the chickens but forgot to
feed myself this morning.

813
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,350
Your Highness, considering how hard

814
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,630
we tried to help you.

815
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,910
shouldn’t you treat us a good meal?

816
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,910
No, I’m fine.

817
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,910
I am healthy.

818
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,360
It’s okay to be hungry for a while.

819
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,670
No way.

820
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,840
Your brain can’t work well
when you are hungry

821
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,790
and it’s easy to forget stuffs.

822
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,240
And it’s easy to make mistakes
when you think.

823
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,360
You are a coroner.

824
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,120
Shouldn’t you know better than I do?

825
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,510
Okay, let’s talk while eating.

826
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,600
What do you want to eat?

827
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,400
(Rugui House)

828
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,150
Vice Minister Jing, please come in.

829
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,910
This is...

830
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,110
This is Commandery Prince An
from the Three Judicial Offices.

831
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,590
I’m Xu Rugui, the owner of Rugui House.

832
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,800
Greetings to Commandery Prince An.

833
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,630
You may rise.

834
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

835
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,430
(Rugui House)

836
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,150
The same old dishes.

837
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,360
Braised pigeon with soy sauce,
seared salamander,

838
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,320
and roast lamb ribs.

839
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,280
Remember, it must be baby lamb.

840
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,910
Don’t roast it for too long.

841
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,240
Get us more dipping sauce.

842
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,520
I like you nomads’
dipping sauce the most.

843
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,320
Rest assured. I got it.

844
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,000
Commandery Prince An,
it’s your first time to be here,

845
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,110
may I introduce you

846
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,390
our specialties?

847
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,960
No need.

848
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,960
I want a flower chicken,
a sour fish soup

849
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,350
and a houttuynia salad.

850
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
Why does Prince An
order Qianzhou dishes?

851
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,760
Your Highness, you do know what to eat.

852
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,040
Houttuynia is rare in Chang’an.

853
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,800
Only Rugui House has it.

854
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,200
These three dishes
ordered by Commandery Prince An

855
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,830
are all authentic Qianzhou cuisine.

856
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
There happens to be

857
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,800
a cook from Qianzhou.

858
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,000
I won’t say that the cooking is superb,

859
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,670
but this cook can

860
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,390
make the authentic Qianzhou taste.

861
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,350
Commandery Prince An,
Vice Minister Jing.

862
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,430
Please wait for a while.
The dishes will be ready soon.

863
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,760
Hold on.

864
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,110
Get this girl a cup of tea.

865
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,320
Forgive me for being clumsy
and neglecting this girl.

866
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,700
It’s okay.

867
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,280
Sit down.

868
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,200
This man looks strange.

869
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
I’ll leave.

870
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,110
Are you a regular here?

871
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,630
Not really.

872
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,070
The food is delicious here.

873
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,280
But it’s too expensive for me.

874
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,150
I won’t eat here

875
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,590
if no one gives me a treat.

876
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,200
(Jiangshan Hall)
Have you known Feng Jie’s death?

877
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,350
Your Majesty.

878
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,760
I received an obituary from
Feng’s Mansion early in the morning.

879
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,670
I went to Feng’s Mansion
to offer my condolences.

880
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,280
Minister Feng passed away
just after he came back.

881
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,590
The Feng’s Mansion
wasn’t prepared at all.

882
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,830
It was hectic when I went there.

883
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,110
I feel really sorry for them.

884
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,240
The Feng’s Mansion wasn’t prepared,

885
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,520
wasn’t I caught off guard?

886
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,830
Now Feng Jie is gone,

887
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,150
someone needs to
take over the Ministry of War.

888
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,480
You are right, Your Majesty.

889
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,830
It’s easy to talk.

890
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,800
Who can take it over?

891
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,470
Since I took the throne,

892
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,000
I’ve been racking my brains
for my country day and night.

893
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,630
Everyone in court is trying to

894
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,280
consolidate the power of Tang

895
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,870
and restore the prosperity.

896
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,230
How important it is to find a talent.

897
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,280
Do you think it’s that easy

898
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,000
to appoint a third-rank minister?

899
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,800
Feng Jie is only in his early 50s.

900
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,390
He is even healthier than
those military officers.

901
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,960
How did he die in such a sudden?

902
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,000
I heard from Feng’s housekeeper

903
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,390
that it was a laborious trip
to the southwest

904
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,110
and he had a few more drinks
at the welcome banquet,

905
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,910
which aroused the terrible disease,

906
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,960
leading to his sudden death.

907
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,040
What? He died of drinking?

908
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,910
-Prince An, Vice Minister Jing.
-Please enjoy yourselves.

909
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,590
Miss, please enjoy yourselves.

910
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,960
Feel free to tell me

911
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,200
if you need anything else.

912
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,870
I’ll leave.

913
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,840
Well?

914
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,560
These dishes don’t suit your appetite?

915
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,590
No.

916
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,000
I just feel that this owner looks...

917
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,070
It’s nothing.

918
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,240
It has been a hard day for you.

919
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,800
Go ahead and eat.

920
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,200
Your Highness.

921
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,320
Do you also like Qianzhou food?

922
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,720
I never tasted it before.

923
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,070
My older brother is a general
stationed in the Southwest.

924
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,520
He mentioned
these Qianzhou dishes before.

925
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,670
Qianzhou is a thousand miles
away from Chang’an.

926
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,200
You have left home
at least for one month.

927
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,000
You haven’t had your hometown food
for some time, right?

928
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,280
You ordered these dishes for me?

929
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,670
I treat you two to a meal,

930
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,200
of course I should order dishes
for you two.

931
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,200
But, Your Highness,

932
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,110
I haven’t found the cause of his death.

933
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,200
It doesn’t matter.

934
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,870
Fill your stomach first.

935
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,320
Come on, give me the bowl.

936
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,470
Thank you, Your Highness.

937
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

938
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,720
It should be true
that she was born in Qianzhou.

939
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,350
Chu Chu, are these Qianzhou
dishes authentic?

940
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,560
Yeah, they are really authentic.

941
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,520
I’m glad you enjoy them.

942
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,720
Take your time. Don’t feel restrained.

943
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,830
Thank you, Your highness.

944
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,800
Did you find anything

945
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
in the mourning hall
of the Feng’s Mansion?

946
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,150
There are several obvious injuries
on Feng Jie’s chest.

947
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
But those are not to hurt him.

948
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,110
But to save him.

949
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,910
Save him?

950
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,350
How to save him?

951
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,620
Can I show it to you in person?

952
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,360
You pretend to be Feng Jie.

953
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
I’ll be the one to save him.

954
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,390
Okay.

955
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,150
What are you doing?

956
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,470
I’m showing it to you.

957
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,960
Minister Feng should be dead now.

958
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,430
You need to relax

959
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,620
and lie down with your eyes closed.

960
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,320
You can’t move

961
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,390
no matter what I do to you.

962
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,430
That should be how Minister Feng

963
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,830
got those scratches.
