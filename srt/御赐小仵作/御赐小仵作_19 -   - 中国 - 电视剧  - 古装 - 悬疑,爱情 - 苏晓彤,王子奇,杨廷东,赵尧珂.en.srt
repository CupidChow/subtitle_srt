1
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,270
Xu Rugui used Chu Chu’s identity

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,350
and induced Chu He to
help him escape.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,040
I don’t know if he is alive now.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,550
I am a survivor of the rebellious party.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,000
But Commandery Prince An

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,040
jumped into the river to save me
without hesitation.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
I didn’t realize how special

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,040
Chu Chu is for me.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,950
But Chu He is also...

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,200
You must go home when I ask you to.

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,590
If you really see yourself as
the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
you must follow my orders.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,560
If you think of my words
as unworthy of your attention,

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,400
you shouldn’t keep working for me.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,150
Three Judicial Offices will be fine
with one less coroner.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,590
Come on, Miss Chu.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,270
Let’s go, come on.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,400
Three Judicial Offices will be fine
with one less coroner?

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,120
You too. Out.

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,940
=The Imperial Coroner=

21
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,740
=Episode 19=

22
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,310
Take it.

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,740
Come again.

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
I won’t charge you if it’s not tasty.

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
General Xiao, what’s wrong
with His Highness?

26
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,720
He...

27
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,390
Is he angry with me
because I jumped into the water

28
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,320
to save my brother?

29
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,240
-I’m good at swimming.
-Take a look.

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,910
He saw it.

31
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,670
Do you only see Chu He as your brother?

32
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,910
Of course.

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,990
What about Commandery Prince An?

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,480
What do you think of him?

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
I think of him as a prince.

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,430
Umbrella!

37
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,280
General Xiao, what do you want to say?

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,390
Umbrella!

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,510
Forget it, it’s too complicated
to be explained in a few words.

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Miss Chu!

41
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,060
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

42
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,860
Is my brother awake?

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,480
General Xiao.

44
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,230
Miss Chu, don’t worry.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,760
It’s not about Chu He.

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Miss Chu, I don’t know
if it is convenient for you

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,510
to have a few words with me.

48
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,390
Deputy Magistrate Tan,
what’s the matter?

49
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,430
Delicious rice noodles!

50
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,720
Since that thing happened
in Xu’s Mansion,

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,640
I always want to talk to you

52
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,920
but never get the chance.

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,310
Deputy Magistrate Tan,
you can just tell me.

54
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,530
When Xu Zongfang took you
to Xu’s Mansion,

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,430
there were only my father,
Xu Zongfang and you

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,480
in that room.

57
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,430
Now my father is gone.

58
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,480
Xu Zongfang is missing.

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,150
I can only ask you

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
about what happened on that day.

61
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,550
Well...

62
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,880
Miss Chu, my father died a tragic death.

63
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,320
As his son,

64
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,610
I don’t even know the cause.

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,680
I’ve been anxious during these days

66
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,670
and I don’t know how to face my mother.

67
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,430
Please let me know what happened.

68
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,600
Deputy Magistrate Tan, get up.

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,550
Xu Zongfang said that day

70
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,080
that he wanted to avenge my mother.

71
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,650
If you want to avenge your mother,

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,090
I can do it for you.

73
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,190
Then he killed Butler Tan.

74
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,880
My mother died an unfair death.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
But I never wanted to

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,270
avenge her in such a way.

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,390
Miss Chu, don’t worry.

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
I don’t blame you at all.

79
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,200
Thank you for telling me the truth.

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,320
I hope you can do me another favor.

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,600
Please don’t tell
Commandery Prince An about

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,240
our conversation today.

83
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,320
Why?

84
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,660
I’m the Deputy Magistrate

85
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,470
and the son of the deceased.

86
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,240
It’s nothing wrong with asking that.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
But for the sake of my career,

88
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,550
I think I should avoid
arousing suspicion.

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,830
Okay.

90
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,710
Thank you, Miss Chu.

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,390
Vice Minister Jing.

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,980
Are you going home?

93
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,710
Yes.

94
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,200
From the County Office to Xu’s Mansion,

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,710
you shouldn’t take this way.

96
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Vice Minister Jing, do you have
any instructions?

97
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,600
I asked you to send out the message.

98
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,390
Why haven’t I gotten any news from you?

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,060
Vice Minister Jing,
I’ll let you know immediately

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,760
if I have any news.

101
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,790
Deputy Magistrate Tan, you should know

102
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,110
that I can tell if you are lying.

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,580
I... I dare not.

104
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,600
You got some news. But it’s not for me.

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,830
It’s for you, right?

106
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,920
Have you verified Chu Chu’s identity?

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,990
Senior Jing doesn’t
want to get you involved.

108
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Please don’t waste his good intention.

109
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,240
What kind of things
that I can’t get involved in?

110
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,640
Are you going to...

111
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Vice Minister Jing.

112
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,150
I’ve handled such matters many times.

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,040
Please don’t worry about it.

114
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,240
My family is preparing for the funeral

115
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,670
and there are a lot of things to do.

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
I should leave.

117
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,270
Your Grace.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Today I got a very interesting
endgame by chance.

119
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,760
I thought that you are
a master of chess,

120
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,080
so I’m here to consult you.

121
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,800
Have you ever seen such an endgame?

122
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,270
No, I haven’t.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,870
Please, Senior Jing.

124
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,870
Please, Your Grace.

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,480
Senior Jing.

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,740
I remember when you
and your wife got married,

127
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,920
my mother

128
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,360
gave you a pair of lily hairpins
as the wedding gift.

129
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,830
I wonder if that pair of hairpins

130
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,320
is still in your mansion.

131
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,020
Your Grace, that’s
a hard question for me.

132
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,090
You know my wife well.

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,440
She bought a handful of
hairpins every time.

134
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,320
There are more hairpins in my mansion

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,480
than the chopsticks in the kitchen.

136
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,360
They all look the same.

137
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,390
How can I recognize it?

138
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,600
Why do you suddenly ask about that?

139
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,680
A few days ago
when I was at the flower market,

140
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,750
I saw someone wearing a similar one.

141
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,360
It just occurred to me.

142
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,000
I guess maybe Madam Jing

143
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,040
gave it to someone else.

144
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,440
I’m just curious.

145
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,150
I’ll ask her when I get back.

146
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,510
Then I’ll let you know.

147
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,680
I know you are quite

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,070
worried about
the marriage of General Xiao

149
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,630
and Leng Peishan’s daughter.

150
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,310
I want to give you a piece of advice.

151
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,190
I hope you can make this marriage
happen as soon as possible.

152
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,480
A good marriage is fated.
Why should we rush it?

153
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,390
A good relationship is fated.
But human effort is the decisive factor.

154
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,280
This matter should be decided
sooner than later.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,150
Thank you for your concern.

156
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,510
I’ll find a master and see

157
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,830
if their dates of birth
and eight characters match.

158
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,800
Then I’ll discuss this with the Emperor.

159
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,270
Your Grace, you are superb in chess.

160
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,120
I’m truly impressed.

161
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,560
You are flattering me.

162
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,750
Stop looking.

163
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,630
You are in Guanling Yamen now.

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,270
Why am I in Guanling Yamen?

165
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,910
Chu Chu?

166
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,880
Where’s Chu Chu?

167
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,450
I want to see Chu Chu.

168
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,360
I want to see my sister!

169
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,560
Where is my sister?

170
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
Do you still see her as your sister?

171
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Of course she is my sister.

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,730
Could it be...

173
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,510
Didn’t Chu Chu tell you

174
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,190
that her biological father, Yun Yi,

175
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,040
killed Xiao Jinyu
and Xiao Jinli’s father?

176
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,650
They must want to take revenge on her.

177
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,530
You killed my sister?

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,910
Listen,

179
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,200
if you dare do anything to my sister,

180
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,880
I will fight you with my life!

181
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,680
Fight me with your life?

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Fight me

183
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,630
with this?

184
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,240
You...

185
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,800
You keep saying
that Chu Chu is your sister.

186
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,490
That’s how you
put your sister in danger?

187
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,360
Listen,

188
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,710
Chu Chu is at home now,

189
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,620
telling your family
that you are safe.

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,710
She is fine.

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
But she almost got killed in the river
because of you.

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,150
Commandery Prince An.

193
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,610
I did this all by myself.

194
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,100
It has nothing to do with Chu Chu.

195
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,630
It has nothing to do with my family.

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
What did you do?

197
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,600
I...

198
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,930
I heard

199
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,480
the man who kidnapped Chu Chu

200
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,800
is her uncle, Xu Zongfang.

201
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,210
I wanted to ask him

202
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,580
if he is Chu Chu’s family

203
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,600
and who else there is
in Chu Chu’s family.

204
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,080
But...

205
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
He told me

206
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,610
Chu Chu’s father

207
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,880
is the rebel who killed your father.

208
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,830
You two took Chu Chu out

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,270
to kill Chu Chu.

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,710
You just took that bandit’s words?

211
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,750
I didn’t.

212
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,880
But I worried...

213
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,910
I worried

214
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,440
that you would imprison Chu Chu
and interrogate her

215
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,710
if you know it.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,540
It happened many years ago.

217
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,880
What can you find out?

218
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,560
His words were clear and logical.

219
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,880
If you take his words

220
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,270
and believe that Chu Chu
is the child of your enemy,

221
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,530
she will be wronged.

222
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,520
That’s why you gave him
this filing blade

223
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,690
and help him escape?

224
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,580
Chu Chu is my sister.

225
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,650
She is innocent.

226
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,070
I have to save her.

227
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,670
You are putting her in danger!

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,190
Chu He, even you don’t trust my conduct,

229
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
you should have considered
the possibility

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,560
that the bandit was lying

231
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,150
and inducing you to untie him.

232
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,800
What you did is putting Chu Chu
in the position of being disloyal!

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,390
If what the bandit said is true

234
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
and you helped him take away Chu Chu,

235
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,190
then Chu Chu will be doubly guilty.

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,190
Everyone in the Chu family
will be punished.

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
If that bandit managed to escape,

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
killed everyone in the Chu family

239
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,390
and killed innocent people,

240
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,800
can you afford such a result?

241
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,440
Can Chu Chu afford it?

242
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,270
I...

243
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,680
As a coroner working
in the County Office,

244
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
you are also a public servant.

245
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,880
But you acted recklessly,

246
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,120
you don’t deserve to be called
a faithful and upright subject

247
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,310
as Chu Chu said.

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
You kept saying

249
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
that what you did is for Chu Chu.

250
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,350
Do you have the nerve

251
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,150
to say it again in front of Chu Chu?

252
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,390
Commandery Prince An.

253
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,830
I was too worried to think clearly.

254
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,190
You can punish me

255
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,680
as you want.

256
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,770
Please don’t punish Chu Chu

257
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,830
and my family.

258
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I’m glad you know your mistake.

259
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,000
As a matter of fact,

260
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,190
Chu Chu knows

261
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,940
what that bandit said

262
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,100
and she told me everything.

263
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,310
What did Chu Chu tell you?

264
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,480
Chu Chu and I are both public servants.

265
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,240
Chu Chu trusts me

266
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,710
and I trust her.

267
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,900
I will handle it impartially

268
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,260
and clarify the truth.

269
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,430
I won’t wrong Chu Chu.

270
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,040
You can rest assured.

271
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,830
You must also remember

272
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
not to do such stupid things again.

273
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,040
Otherwise you won’t be
the only one to be punished.

274
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,360
I won’t.

275
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,240
I won’t do it again.

276
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,310
Let me ask you,

277
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,560
how did you fall into the river?

278
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,990
After I gave the filing blade
to Xu Rugui,

279
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,690
I kept an eye on the coffin shop.

280
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,260
I found Xu Rugui

281
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400
escaped after killing people.

282
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,470
There were also two bandits chasing him.

283
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,780
Did you fight with them?

284
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,510
No, no.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,350
I followed them from a distance.

286
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,020
They were particularly cautious

287
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,590
and I was almost spotted.

288
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,470
Then I slipped

289
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,190
and fell into the river.

290
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,920
Did you see

291
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,190
where they were heading for?

292
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,630
The northeast.

293
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
It seemed to be the direction
of Phoenix Mountain.

294
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,150
Get up first.

295
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,230
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

296
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,600
What you did is ridiculous,

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,390
but you sincerely regretted

298
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,480
and almost got killed in the river,

299
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,920
I think you have learned your lesson.

300
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,390
I won’t give you any serious punishment.

301
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,240
Let me ask you one thing.

302
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,750
You must answer me truthfully.

303
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,830
Please go ahead, I’ll be honest.

304
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,390
I heard from Magistrate Zheng earlier

305
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,800
that the bridge between
Guanling County and the outside

306
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,040
was built five years ago.

307
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,480
Before that,

308
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,750
it was very difficult to get in
or leave Guanling County.

309
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,040
Is it true?

310
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,630
Yes, it’s true.

311
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,270
The Prefect granted the money
to build the bridge.

312
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,600
It was a great thing that benefited
everyone in the county.

313
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,750
Do you still remember

314
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,630
whether the bridge was finished

315
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,480
when the witch doctor

316
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,000
living in the back of your house left?

317
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,830
Not yet.

318
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,630
I remember it clearly.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,440
My family also found it strange.

320
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,320
The witch doctor’s legs
didn’t work well.

321
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,900
He couldn’t leave
Guanling County at all.

322
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
How did he disappear suddenly?

323
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,950
Your Grace.

324
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,810
You must be tired after playing chess

325
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,830
with Senior Jing for so long.

326
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,120
I’ve asked someone
to prepare some hot water

327
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,400
and give you a bath later
to relieve your fatigue.

328
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,030
I’m afraid

329
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,000
that Jing Zhi came here
not just to play chess with me.

330
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,970
I can’t help but feel worried.

331
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,670
I think

332
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,950
Senior Jing came to urge you

333
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,740
to promote Miss Leng’s marriage.

334
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,330
The more he urges me,

335
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,710
the more it means
this marriage won’t work.

336
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,790
I hope Mr. Xue can
talk the Emperor out of this idea

337
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,950
during their trip to Qianzhou.

338
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,640
Your Grace, are you worried

339
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,790
that it will involve
General Leng’s military power

340
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,520
if General Xiao and Miss Leng
get married?

341
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,640
Not all because of this.

342
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,430
If we only consider the interests
involved in this marriage,

343
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,030
it’s safer to let Leng Yue marry Jinyu.

344
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,600
It won’t involve the military power
of the Leng clan

345
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,180
and can make the Leng clan

346
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,950
continue to support Jinyu in the court.

347
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,160
What I care about is still Yue.

348
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,030
She has been following Jinyu
since she was a child.

349
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,760
She does everything
Jinyu tells her to do.

350
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
I guess she has fallen for Jinyu
for a long time.

351
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,910
It’s just Jinyu cares about nothing else

352
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,080
but the official affairs.

353
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
I always wanted to find a chance

354
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,360
and talk to Jinyu about it.

355
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,360
Tell him not to fail Yue.

356
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,030
Unexpectedly, such a thing happened

357
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,710
before I get the chance.

358
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Now Yue is going to be
Jinyu’s sister-in-law.

359
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,950
Your Grace, relax.

360
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,670
We have Mr. Xue’s full support
in this matter.

361
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,480
Besides, Commandery Prince An
is also in Qianzhou.

362
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,640
He has been thoughtful
since he was young.

363
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,410
If he knows it,

364
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,640
he will figure out a way

365
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,280
to solve all the problems.

366
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,160
Have you asked Wu Jiang?

367
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,310
Is there any news about Jinyu recently?

368
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes.

369
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,280
Wu Jiang said that His Highness
is at Miss Chu’s house in Guanling.

370
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,280
Who?

371
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,910
The female coroner.

372
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,710
Coroner?

373
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
Have you met that coroner?

374
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,640
What does she look like?

375
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,430
She...

376
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,830
She is delicate.

377
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,240
What if compare her with Leng Yue?

378
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,110
How can they be compared?

379
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,570
Miss Leng is one of the most

380
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,240
beautiful girls in Chang’an.

381
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,560
That girl is cuter than Miss Leng.

382
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,980
But in terms of appearance,

383
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,640
she is just delicate.

384
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,000
There is no way to
compare her with Leng Yue.

385
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,310
Cute?

386
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,300
I mean, could it be that Jinyu

387
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,650
just likes cute girls?

388
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,710
Chu Chu.

389
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,090
His Highness always protects me.

390
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,310
He said I’m the best coroner.

391
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,890
But why did he say that to me?

392
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,840
You must go home when I ask you to.

393
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,230
If you really see yourself as
the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

394
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,280
you must follow my orders.

395
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,340
If you think of my words
as unworthy of your attention,

396
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,090
you shouldn’t keep working for me.

397
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,350
Three Judicial Offices will be fine
with one less coroner.

398
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,070
Chu Chu.

399
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,670
Father.

400
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,920
What are you thinking about?

401
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,710
Nothing.

402
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,940
I’m just thinking

403
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,340
where that man

404
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,940
could escape to.

405
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,760
Chu Chu.

406
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,790
You know who that person is, right?

407
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

408
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,640
That man is my uncle.

409
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,220
You also know it, right?

410
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340
Your brother accidentally

411
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,160
heard a few words said by the people

412
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,030
around that lord.

413
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,910
When I sent water to them last night,

414
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,240
I took a look at that person.

415
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,160
Although his eyes were covered
and his mouth gagged,

416
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,540
I can still recognize him.

417
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,170
That’s Master Xu.

418
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,180
I didn’t dare to tell your brother
because I was afraid that he couldn’t

419
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,330
hold back his temper
and make a big deal out of it.

420
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,820
I only told your grandpa.

421
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,430
Chu Chu, don’t think too much about it.

422
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,030
Xu Zongfang is Xu Zongfang. You are you.

423
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,190
No matter what he did,

424
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,760
it has nothing to do with you.

425
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,600
Do you know it?

426
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,710
Yes, I do.

427
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Father, don’t worry.

428
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
I won’t bring shame on the Chu clan.

429
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,040
Of course you won’t.

430
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,830
You are Commandery Prince An’s
coroner now.

431
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,560
You make the Chu clan proud,

432
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,700
right?

433
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,600
Don’t think too much about it.

434
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,940
Your Highness, Miss Leng
and Magistrate Zheng are here.

435
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,650
Your Highness.

436
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,710
Your Highness.

437
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,110
Magistrate Zheng,
please wait inside for a while.

438
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,100
Yes.

439
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,090
What’s wrong?

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,240
How do you know something is wrong?

441
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
If there is nothing wrong,

442
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,480
you should send the medicine
to the kitchen first.

443
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,910
You wouldn’t come here to stop me.

444
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,430
What is it?

445
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,650
There is a little thing
I’m curious about.

446
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,800
I want to ask you casually.

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,210
Then I will listen casually.

448
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,810
Your Highness.

449
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,260
Does the Deputy Magistrate Tan Gui
have any relation with you?

450
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,670
What relation?

451
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,330
Like

452
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,020
is he your confidant or your spy?

453
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,110
Why do you ask that?

454
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,490
Answer my question first.

455
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,520
No.

456
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,640
Really?

457
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,430
No.

458
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,710
If he is my confidant,

459
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
how come I didn’t know

460
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,790
Xu Rugui is Xu Zongfang until now?

461
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,710
Alright, you just casually asked me.

462
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,160
And I’ve casually heard you.

463
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,000
Just take the medicine to the kitchen

464
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,160
and ask someone to decoct it for Chu He.

465
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,950
Get him some food.

466
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,310
Let him go home

467
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,710
after he gets better

468
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,190
lest the Chu family should worry.

469
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,950
Your Highness.

470
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,830
Don’t you ask me why I asked you that?

471
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,540
You will tell me when you figure it out.

472
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,400
You already know it?

473
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,800
Know what?

474
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,390
Know that Jing Yi has been stalking me

475
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,910
and sending message to Chang’an
behind my back?

476
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,880
Or know

477
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,070
that you found out the person Jing Yi
has been meeting behind my back

478
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,550
is Tan Gui?

479
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,430
You know it.

480
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,600
It’s nothing strange that I know it.

481
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,160
Jing Yi has been around me

482
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,900
for almost 20 years.

483
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,070
It’s too obvious for me what he did

484
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,600
and what he didn’t do.

485
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,600
He also knows if I know

486
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,190
what he did.

487
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,310
Your Highness, there must be
some misunderstanding here.

488
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,360
You know that Jing Yi
will never hurt you.

489
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,360
I know.

490
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,360
The strange thing is how you know it?

491
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,790
Have you been stalking him?

492
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,310
I...

493
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,640
When I was keeping an eye on Chu Chu,

494
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,050
I saw Jing Yi stalking you and Chu Chu.

495
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,300
I thought

496
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,750
Jing Yi was after Chu Chu.

497
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,160
I’m worried that the Jing family

498
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,550
would do something to Chu Chu,

499
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,670
so I stalked him a few times.

500
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,140
Earlier, I found out by chance

501
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,330
that he met someone alone.

502
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,140
I didn’t see that person’s face,

503
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,060
but I saw the footprints.

504
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,390
When I saw Tan Gui’s just now,

505
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,480
I realized that he was

506
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
the person Jing Yi met.

507
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,080
Your Highness, what is Jing Yi doing?

508
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,430
Don’t worry.

509
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,740
What Jing Yi needs to do in his life

510
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,530
is not only the work I give him.

511
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,840
It’s just like I won’t let him do

512
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,710
all the work.

513
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
It’s the same.

514
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,550
When it’s necessary.

515
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,530
he will give me an explanation.

516
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,190
Your Highness, thank you.

517
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,330
For what?

518
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,460
Thank you for trusting Jing Yi.

519
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,550
Why should you thank me?

520
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,710
Your Highness, you...

521
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,070
Your Highness.

522
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,070
Your Highness.

523
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,250
Forgive me for interrupting you.

524
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,360
Just say it.

525
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,850
Something weird happened.

526
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
I don’t know what to do.

527
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,350
So I’m here to ask you for advice.

528
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,430
Chu He asked me for

529
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,830
flogging.

530
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,830
Ask you for what?

531
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,950
Flogging…

532
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,490
He wants to get beaten.

533
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,360
He asked me to beat him.

534
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,280
Why does he want to get beaten?

535
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,160
I don’t know.

536
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
I asked him why,

537
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,400
but he wouldn’t tell me.

538
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,630
He said he deserves it.

539
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,280
Your Highness,

540
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,640
what should I do?

541
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,080
Just give him what he wants.

542
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,830
What kind of thing is that

543
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,780
to give him flogging?

544
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,400
He asked for it.

545
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,280
Flog him as many times

546
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,710
as he asks.

547
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,030
Don’t beat him too hard.

548
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,880
Just let him suffer a little bit.

549
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,190
Remember not to hurt his bones.

550
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:34,830
Yes.

551
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,930
Also remember,

552
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,790
don’t let others know

553
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,240
what I just said to you.

554
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,430
What are you waiting for?

555
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,030
You’ve never been here.

556
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,000
Do you understand?

557
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,450
Yes.

558
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,880
I think I understand. I understand.

559
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,480
I understand.

560
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,400
Your Highness, does the medicine

561
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,760
for Chu He need to be decocted?

562
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,660
(Shangyang Gate)

563
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,710
Minister Han is perceptive indeed.

564
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,910
That female coroner

565
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,950
only took an exam

566
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,520
in the Three Judicial Offices,

567
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,750
and you found out her identity

568
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,920
as a survivor of the rebellious party
through the details.

569
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,710
Yeah.

570
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,070
Minister Han is great indeed.

571
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,310
Be careful of your words.

572
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,320
She is suspected of

573
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,850
being the daughter of a rebel.

574
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,130
We still need the Emperor
to make the final decision.

575
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,240
However,

576
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
as public servants,

577
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,500
we should always remember the teachings
of Commandery Prince An.

578
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,590
We can’t make any mistake
in this matter.

579
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,810
Otherwise,

580
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,070
he has a lot of ways

581
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,970
to teach us a lesson.

582
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,140
Yeah.

583
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,190
Commandery Prince An hasn’t realized
he opened the door to a dangerous person.

584
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,580
If it wasn’t for you to find out
who she is,

585
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,660
I’m afraid he can’t go back to
Chang’an being alive.

586
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,060
Commandery Prince An hired
the daughter of a rebel.

587
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,160
After he returns to Chang’an,

588
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,760
he should punish himself
for hiring a wrong person.

589
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,830
Yeah.

590
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,440
It’s just Xue Rucheng took the credit.

591
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,010
If he wasn’t ordered to
handle affairs in Qianzhou,

592
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,700
how would the Emperor ask him to
investigate it

593
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,570
and catch the rebels by the way?

594
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,160
He took the credit for nothing.

595
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,010
All right, no big deal.

596
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,590
A person points at the rabbit.

597
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,740
A dog catches the rabbit.

598
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,330
The Emperor

599
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,880
knows who makes what contributions.

600
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,120
We don’t need to take this credit.

601
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,030
Moreover,

602
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,790
the daughter of a rebel threatens
Commandery Prince An’s life.

603
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Xue Rucheng

604
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,670
dares not neglect it.

605
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,940
It’s a good thing for us.

606
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,560
We don’t need to confront
the Commandery Prince An

607
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,120
and he saved us from
the hardship of the trip.

608
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,610
Why shouldn’t we feel happy about it?

609
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,400
Brilliant.

610
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah.

611
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,280
Hurry. Hurry up.

612
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,830
Set the meal.

613
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,030
Don’t delay the meal.

614
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,910
Minister Han.

615
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,830
Eunuch Qin.

616
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,400
Congratulations, you’ve found out
the survivor of the rebellious party.

617
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,700
This is what I should do.

618
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah.

619
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,520
What is this?

620
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,040
How can we eat this?

621
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,450
Eunuch Qin, did you
serve the wrong dishes?

622
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,190
Yeah.

623
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,060
That’s what you are going to eat today.

624
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,240
The Emperor said

625
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,550
it’s not easy for Tang to be peaceful.

626
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,200
You are the pillars of the country.

627
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,950
You should be prepared for danger
in times of peace.

628
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,250
Don’t forget His Majesty’s grace
and your responsibility

629
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,970
when you get cocky.

630
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,680
Minister Han, am I right?

631
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,170
Yeah.

632
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,120
All right, enjoy your meal.

633
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,160
Enjoy your meal.

634
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
Enjoy your meal.

635
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,310
It isn’t so much about
Han Ji taking the credit.

636
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
It’s about Han Ji

637
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,120
finishing this tricky matter for us.

638
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,910
You are right, Master.

639
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,500
Ever since the female coroner
came to Chang’an,

640
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,600
there hasn’t been one day
that is not troublesome.

641
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,670
After I get something useful out of her,

642
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,710
I’m going to vent all of my anger.

643
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,830
I won’t let her die easily.

644
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,160
Then you need to hurry up
and think about

645
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,400
how to kill her.

646
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,280
Listen,

647
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,030
it won’t take us long

648
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
to get her.

649
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,070
That’s great.

650
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,110
Xiao Jinli?

651
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,910
Leng Yue?

652
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,820
Why are you here?

653
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,690
I found him strange

654
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,160
when he stopped Miss Chu on the street

655
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,220
and asked her some questions.

656
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,460
A moment ago, I saw him

657
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,790
sneak out from the County Office.

658
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,950
I’m afraid he will do harm to you.

659
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,030
So I’ve been following him.

660
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,800
Then I saw him lying in ambush
near Chu’s house.

661
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,970
He followed Miss Chu all the way here

662
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,910
and tried to attack Miss Chu.

663
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,330
But I didn’t expect her to be Leng Yue.

664
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,590
Say it, what do you want to do?

665
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,070
I want to kill Chu Chu
to avenge my father!

666
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,960
No wonder.

667
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,690
You asked Miss Chu

668
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,940
how your father died.

669
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,000
She told me.

670
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
Then I told Commandery Prince An.

671
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,900
Miss Chu is clever.

672
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,900
She said it’s only when bad people
want to do bad things

673
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,370
that they don’t want
Commandery Prince An to know it.

674
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,920
You are really up to no good.

675
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,010
Jinyu, we’re on the same page this time.

676
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,680
You asked Leng Yue to dress as Chu Chu

677
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,990
in order to catch him, right?

678
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,150
Despicable. Shameless.

679
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,930
What did you say?

680
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,190
I’ll chop your head off.

681
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,580
Xiao Jinli, it has nothing
to do with you.

682
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,510
You’d better leave.

683
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,340
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

684
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,290
I just saved you.

685
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,470
Did I ask you to save me?

686
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:23,880
I...

687
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,660
All right.

688
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,030
We don’t need to keep it from him.

689
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,180
Keep me from what?

690
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,450
Tan Gui, you should know

691
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,160
why I got someone to dress as Chu Chu.

692
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,390
This method isn’t above-board.

693
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,030
But this is the only way

694
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,350
to get you out

695
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,760
and make things clear for you.

696
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,030
I don’t understand what you are saying.

697
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,190
You don’t understand?

698
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,880
You went to see Chu Chu

699
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,830
in front of Jinli on purpose,

700
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,120
and asked her mysteriously
about your father’s death.

701
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,600
You even told her

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
not to tell me about it

703
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,170
to make sure I would know it.

704
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,400
You asked about your father’s death.

705
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,110
In this way, whether you will
make it or not,

706
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,670
it can be the most powerful testimony

707
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,550
to explain why you want to kill Chu Chu.

708
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,880
What do you mean?

709
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,310
I don’t understand.

710
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,070
Enough!

711
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,950
Stop lying

712
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,310
at this point.

713
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,930
What you did is really shameful.

714
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,350
My family asked him to kill Chu Chu.

715
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,830
Vice Minister Jing, you can’t...!

716
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,560
Brother, no!

717
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,600
Xiao Jinli, are you crazy?

718
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,210
I’m sick of your Jing family’s

719
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,920
sneaky tactics.

720
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,700
Say it, what are you up to?

721
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,380
It has nothing to do
with Vice Minister Jing.

722
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Shut up.

723
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,360
Say it, why do you want to
kill Miss Chu?

724
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,320
Say it! Why?

725
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,130
Commandery Prince An, General Xiao.

726
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,740
Chu Chu is the daughter of
the person who killed your father.

727
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,790
What?

728
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,540
Vice Minister Jing.

729
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,470
Do you still remember
the hairpin we rubbed?

730
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,520
The one Chu Chu’s mother gave to her.

731
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,310
Your mother recognized
the pattern on it.

732
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,480
She gave this hairpin

733
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,120
to a general’s wife as a wedding gift.

734
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,190
That general is Yun Yi, a subordinate of
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

735
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,310
Chu Chu is Yun Yi’s daughter,

736
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,280
which means she is
a survivor of the rebellious party.

737
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,430
After I passed the Imperial Examination,
I took Senior Jing as my master.

738
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,400
Then I went back to Qianzhou

739
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,450
to look for and get rid of

740
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,270
these fugitives

741
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,450
to avenge the Prince Consort.

742
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,830
Why are you stopping me?

743
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,760
Vice Minister Jing.

744
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,140
How should you explain to Senior Jing?

745
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,470
I don’t need to explain to him.

746
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,830
He wants to kill Chu Chu for someone
who was like a real brother to him.

747
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,160
I won’t let him kill Chu Chu

748
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,750
also for someone
who is like a real brother to me.

749
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,400
These are two different things.
But the feelings are the same.

750
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,440
My father knew I would do this.

751
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,410
That’s why he kept it from me

752
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,440
and asked you to do these things.

753
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,860
No need to say much. I trust you.

754
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,920
Commandery Prince An.

755
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,830
What Senior Jing did

756
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,890
is for avenging your father.

757
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,310
That’s your father!

758
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,990
Why are you protecting
your enemy’s daughter?

759
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,120
You can only protect her for a while.

760
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,880
Even I won’t say it,
and they won’t say it,

761
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,070
but someone else will

762
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,500
reveal her identity one day.

763
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,320
At that time,

764
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,960
you will be convicted of covering up
the survivor of the rebellious party.

765
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,280
What’s in that for you?

766
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,620
How should you face Prince Consort
and Princess Xiping?

767
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,860
General Xiao.

768
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,990
Are you also going to
let her get away with it?

769
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
Even she is a survivor
of the rebellious party,

770
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,340
it’s the County Office’s bushiness
to punish her.

771
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,430
Senior Jing can’t use lynching.

772
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

773
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,200
Since you work for Senior Jing,

774
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,680
you should know why I came to
the Southwest this time.

775
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
Senior Jing wants you to kill Chu Chu

776
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,420
to avenge my father.

777
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,880
But if my father wants you to
let her go,

778
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,360
are you willing to
put off killing Chu Chu

779
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,840
and tell Senior Jing about
the situation first?

780
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,480
You mean Prince Consort is still...?
