1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,310
My mother was killed!

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,590
Please redress the grievance for her!

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,270
Who exactly is Lady Xu?

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,000
Xu Rugui kidnapped Chu Chu,

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,440
but left her mother’s hairpin.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,070
What exactly does he want?

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,080
Who...? Who are you?

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,240
But everything was in a mess that day.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,910
You may not remember my face.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,080
Or you may have only remembered

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,840
another image of mine in Rugui House.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,140
You... You are...?

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,460
I’m Xu Rugui.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,260
=The Imperial Coroner=

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,260
=Episode 16=

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,660
Why are you coming again?

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,980
Xu Rugui kidnapped Chu Chu.

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:09,940
What?

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,410
Tell me.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,260
Did you find something

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,020
in Lady Xu’s remains?

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,260
Why do you care for this now?

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,490
Go find Chu Chu!

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,700
I checked where she was kidnapped!

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,450
This is what Xu Rugui left there.

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,940
It also belongs to Lady Xu.

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,300
What do you mean?

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,900
Xu Rugui must be knowing something

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,810
about Chu Chu’s parents.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,580
He left the hairpin,

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,580
so that I’ll check on it.

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,660
Tell me.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,340
What did you find

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,170
or what did you know?

35
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,090
What...?

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,020
What do you mean?

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,900
Since we left the capital,

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,450
you’ve been hiding something from me.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,980
I didn’t ask
when you didn’t want to tell me.

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,940
I turn a blind eye,

41
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,530
but you think I’m really blind!

42
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,620
What are you losing temper on me?

43
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,020
What did I do?

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,730
I trust you,

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,380
like I trust the other me in the world!

46
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,380
I believe you won’t hurt me!

47
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,530
But you must explain to me

48
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,090
what happened today!

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,730
If Chu Chu is dead,

50
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,060
I won’t let go of you

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,770
or your family!

52
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,060
Are you crazy?

53
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,650
Xiao Jinyu,

54
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,810
don’t you remember what Qin Luan wants?

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Xu Rugui wants to kill us

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,190
and catch Chu Chu alive! Alive!

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,030
Don’t you know what it means?

58
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,320
It means Chu Chu won’t be dead
for the moment!

59
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,240
But if you keep losing temper like this,

60
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,680
it’ll be too late!

61
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,880
Yes.

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,520
I stalked you

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
to the Witch Doctor’s house

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
and peeked when you opened the coffin.

65
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,720
But it had nothing to do with Chu Chu.

66
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,130
I care for you only.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Before coming to Qianzhou,

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,550
my father gave me another mission.

69
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,110
He concerned
if there were remnants of the rebels.

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,600
In case you ignore your safety,

71
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,630
he asked me to keep a close eye on you!

72
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,820
(To Jing Yi)

73
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,880
These are letters my father sent me.

74
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,960
Read them.

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,550
Why did you do those things
without telling me?

76
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,440
What do you think?

77
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,670
Will you take me if there’s real danger?

78
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,880
Will you tell me?

79
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,600
Chu Chu, don’t be scared.

80
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
I’m trying to save you.

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,830
I won’t hurt you.

82
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,720
I brought you here to protect you.

83
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Stay away!

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,390
Didn’t you ask me

85
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,600
where you were?

86
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,440
I’m telling you.

87
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,390
This is where your mother used to live.

88
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,880
My mother?

89
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,030
Finished?

90
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,910
It’s my turn to ask questions.

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
How do you know

92
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,830
Xu Rugui left you

93
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,470
the hairpin,

94
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,390
but not Chu Chu dropped it?

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
I knew there were two groups,

96
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,030
according to tracks of carriage
and footprints.

97
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,240
They left in two directors.

98
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,270
I found the hairpin from one direction.

99
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,240
He knew

100
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,270
I would ask my men

101
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,390
to search the whole lane.

102
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,440
He deliberately put the hairpin

103
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
under a basket.

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,190
I gave it to Chu Chu yesterday.

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,390
Now that Xu Rugui knew the hairpin,

106
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,790
he must have known

107
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,790
about Chu Chu’s parents.

108
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,390
I’m sure he left the hairpin to me

109
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,920
for a purpose.

110
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,270
When I figure out his purpose,

111
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,510
I’ll know what he’s after.

112
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,880
When I know what he’s after,

113
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,390
I’ll follow the trail of his.

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,950
then I may know

115
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,070
where he took Chu Chu to.

116
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,160
Purpose, hairpin...

117
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,510
If you’re right,

118
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,480
I can really find something

119
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,670
from the remains.

120
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,600
It’s authentic Sichuan embroidery
on the clothes.

121
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,070
It’s not from an ordinary embroiderer,

122
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,920
but an imperial embroidery workshop.

123
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,270
It’s not what common people can use.

124
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,230
And this hairpin...

125
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,510
My mother has a large number of hairpins

126
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,670
of the similar style.

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,070
It’s said that girls and ladies
of rich families

128
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,390
wore such hairpins
to compete with each other

129
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,070
ten or twenty years ago.

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,480
But the more popular they are,

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,790
the faster they become antiquated.

132
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,390
After the fashion died down,

133
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,070
the hairpins were no longer used.

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,200
Among the clothes and jewels,

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,480
there’s only something special
on the hairpin.

136
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,480
I think she wore the hairpins

137
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,440
because of decency.

138
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,270
Decency?

139
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,510
Your mother is a princess.

140
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,510
So, she’s always dressed up

141
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,600
based on imperial rules.

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
She doesn’t need
to concern about decency.

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
You don’t know that

144
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,040
ladies and girls from rich family

145
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,880
can’t eat or wear

146
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,230
in the way

147
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,040
they personally want to.

148
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,760
For example,

149
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,920
look at the hairpin.

150
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,550
When it’s popular,

151
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,760
wives of third-rank ministers wear it.

152
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,960
Wives of fifth-rank censors
also wear it.

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,390
If wives of fourth-rank officials
don’t wear it,

154
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,480
when staying with them,

155
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
they’ll be mocked.

156
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,950
Their husbands will be disgraced, too.

157
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,950
She could afford Sichuan embroidery

158
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,350
and she had to wear something

159
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,110
for decency.

160
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,110
Looks like

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
she’s a wife of an official

162
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,230
in Jiannan.

163
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,390
Her husband didn’t seem like an official

164
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,320
in the state or county.

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,110
He should have a higher ranking.

166
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,390
Then he had such precious cloth
from an imperial embroidery workshop.

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,640
He was more likely to be

168
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,600
Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

169
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,350
You know my mother?

170
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,230
Sure.

171
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,070
Your mother is
the sister of Xu Zongfang,

172
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,440
master of the Xu Family
in Guanling County.

173
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,880
Her name is Yixiang.

174
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,040
She was the third child of her family.

175
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,270
When she was 18,

176
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,040
she married a military officer Yun Yi.

177
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,040
He worked very hard.

178
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,600
Based on his military exploit,

179
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
he became the best vice general,
working for Chen Ying,

180
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,390
Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,670
In the 8th year of Emperor Wenzong,

182
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,790
he rebelled with Chen Ying

183
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,510
and killed Censor Xiao Heng

184
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,510
who told on them.

185
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Xiao Heng is the husband
of Princess Xiping,

186
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,270
and the father of Xiao Jinyu
and Xiao Jinli.

187
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,510
The Emperor was furious

188
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,000
and sent troops
to exterminate all rebels.

189
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,200
Rebellion is an unpardonable crime.

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Their families should have been killed.

191
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,160
But at that time,

192
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,720
your mother was pregnant.

193
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,270
To give birth to you,

194
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
she ran away overnight.

195
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,350
In the Southwest,

196
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,200
a disaster that could ruin a family

197
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
was very likely to be the rebellion

198
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
by Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

199
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,110
Looks like Chu Chu’s father worked

200
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,950
for Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

201
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,270
And Xu Rugui knew that before.

202
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,920
If Chu Chu’s father

203
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,880
really worked for Chen Ying,

204
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,350
his daughter should have been executed.

205
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,760
Can she be...?

206
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,270
No.

207
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,880
Xu Rugui left me the hairpin,

208
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,230
possibly to make me suspect that

209
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,920
Chu Chu ran away to escape punishment

210
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,160
and she arranged the kidnapping case

211
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
to get away.

212
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,320
If I check the case in the way he wants,

213
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,280
I’ll really make Chu Chu desperate.

214
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,000
No way! You’re taking nonsense!

215
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,440
My father can’t be a rebel.

216
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
He never killed His Highness’s father.

217
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,550
You’re the criminal.

218
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,440
I won’t believe
even a single word of yours.

219
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,880
Xiao Jinyu proposed to open the coffin,

220
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
didn’t he?

221
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,150
I knew it.

222
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,590
Xiao Jinyu came to the Southwest

223
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,670
to find his father.

224
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,440
Since he met you in Chang’an,

225
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,000
he’s been suspecting you,

226
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,880
spying you

227
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,710
and checking on you.

228
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,230
He also tried to make you trust him,

229
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,710
because he wanted to find his father

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,550
with your help.

231
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,320
Since he met you,

232
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,000
he’s been caring for your pendant,

233
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,080
hasn’t he?

234
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,550
I know it’s his father’s pendant.

235
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,960
He has told me

236
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
everything.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,880
Don’t you understand?

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,520
You’re of no use

239
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,910
to him.

240
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,110
Capable as Xiao Jinyu is,

241
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,470
he must have figured out

242
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,110
who your parents are

243
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,640
from your mother’s remains.

244
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,840
There’s a blood feud between you.

245
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,280
If you go back to him,

246
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,840
you’ll be arrested as a rebel.

247
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,030
Or he’ll kill you in a fit of anger

248
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,670
to avenge his father.

249
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,150
He won’t do that!

250
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,710
I don’t believe you!

251
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,030
Anybody there?

252
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,550
Open the door!

253
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,350
Xiao Jinyu always has dealings

254
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,710
with criminals.

255
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,790
He thinks of the worst,
in case of anything.

256
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,520
When he figures out
who your parents are,

257
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,790
he’ll suspect that

258
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,550
you ran to escape punishment

259
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,320
or you even had this plan personally.

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
What does Xu Rugui want?

261
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,080
He kidnapped Chu Chu,

262
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,880
for my father.

263
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,640
He set the trap and used the hairpin,

264
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
to make Chu Chu suspect

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,670
for escaping punishment.

266
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,550
If I fall into his trap,
I’ll concern that

267
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,230
my father’s secret will be exposed.

268
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,790
Then I’ll check on Chu Chu

269
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,400
and look for my father at the same time.

270
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,670
I can hardly handle two things well.

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
And I’ll take action.

272
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,110
Then he can deceive Chu Chu

273
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,110
and make her think she can do nothing,

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,520
but seeks refuge with him

275
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,670
and depend on him.

276
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,000
Eventually, he can ask Chu Chu

277
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,910
for some clues about my father.

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,350
Isn’t he considering

279
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,200
too simply?

280
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,790
Chu Chu checked the case of Rugui House

281
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,470
and witnessed how he tried to kill us
at the border of Guanling County.

282
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,880
Chu Chu knows very well

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,550
what kind of man Xu Rugui is.

284
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,440
Even if her father was indeed a rebel,

285
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,150
she wouldn’t believe it at all

286
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,470
when he told her about it.

287
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,110
I won’t believe you,
no matter what you explain.

288
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,350
His Highness never wrongs
an innocent person.

289
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,280
He won’t wrong me

290
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,550
for what I haven’t done.

291
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,080
No matter why you kidnapped me,

292
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,400
I won’t listen to you.

293
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
I won’t tell you anything

294
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,880
or do anything for you.

295
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,960
I know

296
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,030
you think I’m a villain.

297
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,440
But you know what?

298
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,790
Over the past years,

299
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,470
I was forced

300
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,080
to do evil things.

301
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,280
Chu Chu, I never mean to hurt you.

302
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,150
Since I knew you worked
in Three Judicial Offices,

303
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,030
I’ve been trying to get you out.

304
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,590
But Xiao Jinyu sent men

305
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,840
to guard you closely,

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
I had no chance to save you.

307
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,550
Later when I knew

308
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,350
you and Xiao Jinyu would come
to Qianzhou,

309
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,200
I waited for you

310
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,110
at the border of Guanling County.

311
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
Unexpectedly,

312
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
I still failed.

313
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Today, when I knew

314
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,030
he asked you
to open your mother’s coffin,

315
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,910
I didn’t have a choice,
but to kidnap you.

316
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,880
Chu Chu, I did this to save you!

317
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,470
I’m not as smart as His Highness.

318
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,550
But I’m not a fool.

319
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,110
I work for the government,

320
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,880
but you’re a wanted murderer.

321
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,960
I have nothing to do with you.

322
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,350
Why do you want to save me?

323
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,790
Xu Rugui knows this.

324
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,710
He must have another chip,

325
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,670
which is more important
than Chu Chu’s trust on me.

326
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,000
Is that possible?

327
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,030
One kind of trust exists
without any condition

328
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,080
and it can’t be broken.

329
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,880
Does that really exist?

330
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,100
(On the ninth day of the first month,
Xu Zongfang’s sister came to him.)

331
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,030
It’s the original trust,

332
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,440
between family members.

333
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,230
Your mother is my own sister!

334
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,590
You...

335
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,350
You’re Xu Zongfang?

336
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,790
I’m your uncle!

337
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,710
No way.

338
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,880
You must have stalked me.

339
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,400
You must have heard us.

340
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,230
I won’t be deceived by me!

341
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,440
I don’t have an uncle like you!

342
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,550
Don’t tell anyone

343
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,880
about Chu Chu’s parents.

344
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,710
All right.

345
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,670
Where are you going?

346
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,080
When you’re in the Southwest,

347
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,910
you must protect Commandery Prince An

348
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,640
all the time.

349
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Also, if you meet any remnant
of the rebels,

350
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,280
send me a secret letter immediately.

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
Father, what do you mean?

352
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,320
It’s about the rebellion.

353
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,910
If it can’t be handled properly,

354
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,440
there’ll be big trouble in the court.

355
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,710
When I know it ahead of time,

356
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,520
I can make preparations in Chang’an.

357
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,470
That’s what
His Highness never understands.

358
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,000
Chu Chu,

359
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,880
this is our old house.

360
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,520
Maybe you haven’t come before.

361
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
But you grew up in Guanling County,

362
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,640
you must know Butler Tan.

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
He’s right out there.

364
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
I can get him in.

365
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,400
I don’t believe you!

366
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,100
(Good Luck and Harmony)

367
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,590
Your Highness.

368
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,230
You may rise.

369
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,710
Deputy Magistrate Tan,

370
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
I hear your father is the butler

371
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,960
of the Xu Family in this county?

372
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,710
You’re right, Your Highness.

373
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,440
How old are you?

374
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,440
I’m... I’m 30 years old.

375
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,350
Had you seen Xu Zongfang

376
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,400
before he moved away?

377
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,150
Your Highness,

378
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,230
I was born in the Xu’s Mansion.

379
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,400
Before the Xu Family moved away,

380
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,470
I met Xu Zongfang

381
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,280
nearly every day.

382
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,550
Do you remember what he looks like?

383
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,550
I’m afraid

384
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I can hardly describe his look.

385
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,350
But if I see him again,

386
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
I can recognize him.

387
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,110
Look at this carefully

388
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,470
and see if he’s Xu Zongfang.

389
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,080
He is.

390
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,110
He looks older than I remember.

391
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,880
But that’s him.

392
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,110
Did he go back to his mansion lately?

393
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,760
To be honest, Your Highness,

394
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,110
I’ve lived in the office lately

395
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,000
and hasn’t gone back home.

396
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,200
I’m not sure.

397
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,400
Take me there immediately.

398
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,280
Yes. This way, please, Your Highness.

399
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,080
This way, please.

400
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
It’s impossible! Impossible!

401
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,880
Chu Chu, what must you hear

402
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,470
or what do you want to see

403
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,520
before you believe I’m your uncle?

404
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,520
I’m your real uncle!

405
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,000
Chu Chu, I asked the captured killers.

406
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,470
They were ordered to catch you.

407
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,520
Catch me?

408
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,350
Don’t worry.

409
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,230
I’ll figure it out.

410
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,000
But you must remember.

411
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,910
If someone takes you away alive,

412
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,280
you’re of use to them

413
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,880
simply when you’re alive.

414
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,110
They may want to know something from you

415
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,670
or want you to do something for them.

416
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
Don’t be scared.

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
You must let them believe

418
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,280
they can convince you

419
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,960
and make them put time and energy

420
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,910
in trying to persuade you.

421
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,000
Then you can be safe.

422
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,280
And then?

423
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,280
Then run away if there’s any chance.

424
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,280
If there isn’t,
stall for time until I come.

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,110
I recognize Butler Tan.

426
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,910
But it doesn’t mean

427
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,710
this is the old house of the Xu Family.

428
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,400
You could have found another house

429
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,840
and brought Butler Tan here.

430
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,440
You make sense.

431
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
I won’t believe you,

432
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
unless...

433
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,470
Unless you tell me

434
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,230
how my mother died.

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,760
Don’t try to deceive me.

436
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,920
I inspected my mother’s corpse.

437
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,830
Butler Tan, no strangers are here.

438
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
Just tell her the truth.

439
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,310
Yes, Master.

440
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Miss Chu,

441
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,560
your mother Miss Xu came to Master

442
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,710
all the way from Jiannan,

443
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,950
to seek for shelter.

444
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,040
She said her family suffered
from a disaster.

445
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,070
Master found it a bit weird

446
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,710
and then had me ask about it.

447
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,000
It was when

448
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,110
we knew what happened to your father.

449
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,590
What? Rebel?

450
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,040
It’s a capital crime
that all families will be killed!

451
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,880
We can’t let her stay.

452
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,640
If the government knows,

453
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,000
we’ll all be executed.

454
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,920
Yeah, Master.

455
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,710
We’ll be killed for sheltering a rebel.

456
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,040
But she’s pregnant!

457
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,400
So what?

458
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,920
It’s a baby of a rebel!

459
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,190
The baby will be killed, anyway.

460
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,190
Tan Hong, be quick!

461
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,640
Kick her out!

462
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,350
Yes.

463
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,950
Wait.

464
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,070
Wait for what?

465
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,590
If we wait, the government will know!

466
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
Stop yelling!

467
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,400
I...

468
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,470
I’ve got a plan.

469
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,760
In order not
to get the whole family involved,

470
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,110
Master asked me to handle the problem,

471
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,560
because he was a good friend
with the former magistrate.

472
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,520
Yixiang! Yixiang,

473
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,470
it’s me.

474
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
Zongfang? Butler Tan?

475
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,470
You haven’t slept yet?

476
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,040
What do you come for?

477
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,310
Yixiang, I know you had a tough life.

478
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,710
But I have my own difficulty.

479
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,680
Hope you can understand me.

480
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,800
Zongfang, what do you mean?

481
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
You shouldn’t stand.

482
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Come and be seated.

483
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,280
Without telling Master,

484
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,070
I killed your mother with the latch

485
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,280
and hit her head to the wall,

486
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
pretending she suicided.

487
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,680
Miss Chu, I didn’t have a choice,

488
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,160
but to kill her.

489
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,160
We can’t put the whole family in danger,

490
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,950
because of her.

491
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,920
Master didn’t know that before.

492
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Chu Chu, I know

493
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,680
I’m sorry to your mother.

494
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,640
I was too scared.

495
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,710
In case soldiers tracked down to us,

496
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,710
I moved the whole family to Chang’an.

497
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,280
To make a living,

498
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,880
I did evil things.

499
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,190
From now on,

500
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,950
I’ll make it up for you!

501
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,040
You...

502
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,350
You killed her!

503
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,760
You killed my mother!

504
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,000
I didn’t have a choice.

505
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,470
So far,

506
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
no matter what I do,

507
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,040
I can’t get your mother back to life.

508
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,230
But,

509
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,350
if you want to avenge your mother,

510
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,160
I can let you do that.

511
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,710
Which one?

512
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,560
Here we are, Your Highness.

513
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,950
Your Highness, it’s Chu Chu’s voice!

514
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760
Be quick!

515
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,590
Tell me, where’s Chu Chu?

516
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,430
In the room of the backyard.

517
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,430
Father!

518
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,560
Xu Rugui killed him to keep the secret.

519
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,950
Tan Gui, how many back doors are there?

520
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,400
Three.

521
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,280
Chu Chu.

522
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,880
Master, here’s a letter from Xu Rugui.

523
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,780
(Xu Rugui.)

524
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,470
He has succeeded?

525
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,680
Have a look.

526
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,710
The female coroner is Xu Rugui’s niece?

527
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,280
Isn’t she the daughter...?

528
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
The daughter of a rebel.

529
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,640
How will you deal with her?

530
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,190
How?

531
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,160
Isn’t it a right thing

532
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,470
to catch the daughter

533
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,590
of a rebel?

534
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,310
It’s wise of you, Master.

535
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,760
How shall I reply to Xu Rugui?

536
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,070
Don’t reply to him.

537
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,800
Go and find Zhou Han.

538
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,920
Also,

539
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,000
ask him to keep a close eye
on Antique Store.

540
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,160
Yes, Master.

541
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,230
I don’t think
Antique Store is a simple store.

542
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,590
What?

543
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,430
Send someone to kill Xu Rugui?

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,560
Go on.

545
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,160
Keep yelling!

546
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,230
Do you fear others can’t hear you?

547
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,830
But,

548
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,800
why does Eunuch Qin suddenly want
to kill him?

549
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
Well,

550
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,070
Xu Rugui took his men

551
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,710
to ambush Xiao Jinyu in Qianzhou.

552
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,160
Unexpectedly,

553
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,070
Xiao Jinli arrived in time.

554
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,950
Xu Rugui ran away alone.

555
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,160
His plan failed. What could he do?

556
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,110
He wasn’t unconvinced.

557
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,350
Then he stalked them
and checked secretly.

558
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,350
Guess what he found out?

559
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,710
The female coroner is a rebel’s daughter

560
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,160
from the Southwest.

561
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Isn’t it a good thing?

562
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,230
Shouldn’t he be awarded,
instead of being killed?

563
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,920
What if he’s caught by Xiao Jinyu

564
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,880
and he tells Xiao Jinyu everything?

565
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,400
He’s a big trouble.

566
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,190
Why don’t we keep him,
instead of killing him?

567
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,470
I don’t think he’ll betray us.

568
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,350
We have his families in control,
don’t we?

569
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
He doesn’t dare to betray us.

570
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,710
I’m warning you.

571
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,640
Eunuch Qin wants you

572
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,950
to kill Xu Rugui,

573
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,950
at whatever cost.

574
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,350
And his families...

575
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,190
Kill them all.

576
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,520
I see.

577
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,190
Will I also kill Xiao Jinyu?

578
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,680
Sure. Of course.

579
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,520
Look how strong you are!

580
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,350
Xiao Jinli protects his brother
with his soldiers.

581
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,760
How can you kill Xiao Jinyu
with your men?

582
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,190
Don’t be anxious.

583
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,110
Xiao Jinli is protecting Xiao Jinyu

584
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,110
in Qianzhou

585
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,590
with his men.

586
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,110
But Xiao Jinyu will leave Qianzhou
sooner or later.

587
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,710
Think about it.

588
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,560
Once he leaves Qianzhou,

589
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,230
can’t you have a chance to kill him?

590
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,350
I understand.

591
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,000
By the way,

592
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,280
Eunuch said,

593
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,920
when you find the female coroner,

594
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,830
catch her immediately and torture her.

595
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,190
You must make her tell you

596
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,110
where the Witch Doctor is.

597
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,350
After you find the Witch Doctor,

598
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,280
take back his corpse.

599
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,000
Don’t let Xiao Jinyu find him
before you.

600
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,400
Here’s another thing.

601
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,000
Eunuch Qin asked you

602
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,830
to keep a close eye on Antique Store.

603
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,350
Chu Chu?

604
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,710
Chu Chu!

605
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,110
Chu Chu!

606
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,190
What happened?

607
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,470
Grandfather, what happened to Chu Chu?

608
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,160
Father, what happened to Chu Chu?

609
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,040
I don’t know.

610
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,520
She’s having a fever.

611
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,070
Chu He, go get a doctor. Be quick.

612
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,950
Don’t bother.

613
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,280
I had a doctor check on her.

614
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,310
The medicine is in the kitchen.

615
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Please boil it for her.

616
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,310
Go.

617
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,520
If Chu Chu is in danger,

618
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,760
I won’t let you go!

619
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,070
What are you talking about? Go boil it!

620
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,000
Childish boy!

621
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,270
Your Highness, he’s too childish.

622
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,790
Don’t be angry with him.

623
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,190
I failed to protect Chu Chu.

624
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,470
He should blame me.

625
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,040
I should apologize to you.

626
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,230
Don’t. Don’t.

627
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,760
Your Highness,

628
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
what happened to Chu Chu?

629
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,760
I was so careless

630
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,200
that a wanted criminal

631
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,640
kidnapped her.

632
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,430
The person

633
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,760
your men took to the woodshed?

634
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,430
Yes.

635
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,400
Leng Yue!

636
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
What are you yelling for! Noisy!

637
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,310
Where have you been?

638
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,110
What took you so long?

639
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
I heard you fought with Xu Rugui.

640
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,950
Are you hurt?

641
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,640
Are you hurt?

642
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,430
I’m fine.

643
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,040
Let me check.

644
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
Must I beat you to prove I’m fine?

645
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,710
Don’t bother.

646
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,920
I’m glad you’re fine.

647
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,590
Who’s he?

648
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,830
Where’s His Highness?

649
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,590
He’s accompanying Chu Chu in the room.

650
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,920
Is Chu Chu alright?

651
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,070
She’s alright.

652
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,430
She was scared

653
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,190
and she passed out
because she was depressed.

654
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,520
Depressed?

655
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,430
She has a lot on her mind lately.

656
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,400
Everyone will be depressed
in the face of so many problems.

657
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,350
Xu Rugui, I’ll see how long you hold on.

658
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,710
Your Highness.

659
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,640
Your Highness.

660
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,560
Let me stay with her.

661
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,040
Son, it’s getting late.

662
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,350
Go make dinner.

663
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,470
All right.

664
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,640
I’m sorry.

665
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,710
I underestimated His Highness.

666
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,070
What do you mean?

667
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,230
Don’t underestimate the water drops.

668
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,520
When it keeps dropping,

669
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,590
even a stone will be worn through,

670
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,470
not to mention his forehead.

671
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,430
You mean

672
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,160
His Highness wants a hole
in his forehead?

673
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,640
What are you talking about?

674
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,160
I mean

675
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,740
don’t underestimate the water drops.

676
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,490
A man feels the weakest in darkness.

677
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,070
At this moment,

678
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,040
when he can’t see,

679
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,230
he’ll feel more sensitively.

680
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,040
Then we give him

681
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
a repeated and fixed stimulation,

682
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,190
he’ll break down.

683
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,640
He’ll tell us everything.

684
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
What you said

685
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,950
even gives me gooseflesh.

686
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,190
His Highness looks like a weak scholar

687
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,760
and he talks very gently.

688
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,350
But he has cruel ways to torture people.

689
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,070
Weak scholar?

690
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,430
You didn’t see how he went crazy.

691
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,560
Today, he pushed me to the wall fiercely

692
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,190
and nearly punched me.

693
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,430
Looks like I’ve got more to learn
from His Highness.

694
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,590
Learn what?

695
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,470
You can push me to the wall.

696
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
But don’t use water drops.

697
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,710
Why can’t I?

698
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
When someone lies,

699
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,230
I can use it.

700
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,110
I swear to you.

701
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,230
I’ve never lied to you once.

702
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,070
Really?

703
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,680
Yes.

704
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,360
Let me ask you something.

705
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
What did you say to His Highness

706
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,590
in Yamen today?

707
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,640
I said a lot to him.

708
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,160
But I didn’t complain about you.

709
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:55,920
Don’t worry.

710
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,110
Stop joking. Be serious.

711
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,350
After Chu Chu was kidnapped,

712
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,920
His Highness immediately checked

713
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
where she was taken away.

714
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,350
He then went back
and asked you something.

715
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,430
Before saying anything,

716
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,560
he went to see Tan Gui
with Xu Rugui’s portrait

717
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,350
for recognition.

718
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,230
Tan Gui recognized Xu Rugui

719
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,040
and then we rushed to Xu’s Mansion.

720
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,310
We found Chu Chu

721
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,590
and caught Xu Rugui.

722
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,400
You also don’t understand

723
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,240
why His Highness can connect such clues,

724
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,950
do you?

725
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,310
I don’t.

726
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,000
We saved Chu Chu,

727
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,000
and caught Xu Rugui.

728
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,710
But why did Xu Rugui catch Chu Chu?

729
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,470
What did you say to His Highness

730
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,520
that he managed to connect Xu Rugui

731
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,280
to Xu Zongfang?

732
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
Also,

733
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,350
isn’t Xu Rugui Chu Chu’s uncle?

734
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Even if Chu Chu doesn’t know,

735
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,830
doesn’t Xu Rugui know?

736
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,710
His Highness knows more

737
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,280
than you have imagined.

738
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,830
But this thing concerns

739
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,520
about Chu Chu’s safety.

740
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,520
And some details aren’t confirmed yet.

741
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,880
We can’t tell you now.

742
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,950
All you must know is that

743
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,560
His Highness has clever strategies

744
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,110
and all evil men are within his control.

745
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,000
All right, then.

746
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,830
You sound so mysterious.

747
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,680
I don’t bother to know

748
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,830
about your official secrets.

749
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,400
Why did you kick me so hard?

750
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,760
The medicine is ready.
Hasn’t Chu Chu woken up yet?

751
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,470
Go have some rest.

752
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,590
I’ll stay with her.

753
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,830
Don’t bother.
She doesn’t want me to leave.

754
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,350
I’ll put it here.

755
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,830
If it gets old when she wakes up,
I’ll boil it again.

756
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,040
Thank you.

757
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,520
Please get her a basin of water,

758
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,880
a pot of liquor and a towel.

759
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,470
She’s still having a fever.

760
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,710
She’ll feel better
if I cool her forehead.

761
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,070
All right.

762
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,830
What else do you want?

763
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,280
The person in the woodshed...

764
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,400
What’s his relationship with Chu Chu?

765
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,800
He kidnapped Chu Chu.

766
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,070
Why did he do that?

767
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
I’ll interrogate him later.

768
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,040
Chu Chu, finally you’re back.

769
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
Go! Go with me!

770
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,190
If Xiao Jinyu comes,

771
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,110
it’s too late to run away.

772
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,760
Rebels!

773
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,950
I’m not! I’m not!

774
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,590
Your Highness, I’m Chu Chu.

775
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,000
I’m not a rebel!

776
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,430
Chu Chu, don’t waste your time on him.

777
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,400
He’s coming to kill you.

778
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,470
No, he won’t.

779
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,280
Children of rebels must be executed!

780
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,710
I was wrong about you.

781
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,350
From now on,

782
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
we’re strangers!

783
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,310
If you surrender now,

784
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,640
you’ll have an intact corpse

785
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,400
for the sake of our old friendship.

786
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,160
Don’t be scared, Chu Chu.

787
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,190
I’ll take you away.

788
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,830
Ridiculous!

789
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,070
You think you can run away?

790
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,000
Somebody!

791
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,160
No!

792
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,310
No!

793
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,430
Chu Chu!

794
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,920
Here I am.

795
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,070
Don’t worry.

796
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,710
Xu Rugui has been caught.

797
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,680
You’re home and you’re safe.

798
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,830
Don’t be scared.

799
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,710
Your fever is down.

800
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,190
Are you feeling better?

801
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

802
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
I had a nightmare

803
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,470
in which...

804
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,320
You abandoned me again.

805
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,630
Now that I promised you,

806
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,190
I won’t break my promise.

807
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,630
Chu Chu, remember.

808
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,910
No matter what difficulty you have,

809
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,120
I’ll try my best to help you.

810
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,280
I don’t have difficulty.

811
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,230
I just had a dream.

812
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,600
Remember that even in your dream.

813
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,150
I remember.

814
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,710
Take the medicine.

815
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,670
Chu Chu, you’re awake?

816
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,520
Are you getting better?

817
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,000
Much better.

818
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,390
Your Highness,
Xu Rugui can no longer hold on.

819
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,000
All right. I’ll go check on him.

820
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,760
Have something to eat

821
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
before you go back for some rest.

822
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,840
All right.

823
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,190
Your Highness.

824
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Your Highness, it’s wise of you.

825
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,870
Xu Rugui, I guess you know who I am.

826
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,390
Make up your mind.

827
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,950
You have only one chance.

828
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,950
Once you tell even one lie,

829
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,000
you’ll spend the rest of your life

830
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,120
under the water drops.

831
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
What? After killing so many people,

832
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
you’re scared of mere water drops?

833
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,710
Your Highness, I confess.

834
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,950
I’ll tell you everything!

835
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,950
Everything!

836
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Please,

837
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,320
please stop the water drops.

838
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,470
I beg you! Please stop.

839
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,670
I haven’t had dinner yet.

840
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
If you want to bargain,

841
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,560
I can come after having dinner.

842
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,430
Don’t! Don’t!

843
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,760
I confess!

844
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,430
Rugui House...

845
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,080
It belongs to Qin Luan.

846
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,630
He ordered me

847
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,230
to kill you and catch Chu Chu.

848
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,230
I knew that!

849
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,950
Tell me!

850
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,120
Why are there illegal copper coins
with Qian Printing?

851
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,470
Qian Printing...? Illegal copper coins?

852
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
I... I don’t know.

853
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,760
I don’t know.

854
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,630
I don’t know.

855
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,870
What about Duke Chang?

856
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,120
What Duke Chang? I have no idea!
