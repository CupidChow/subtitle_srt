1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,840
When there was a fire in the archive
of Guanling Yamen,

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,830
between the shifts of two magistrates,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,400
(Unknown)
the Xu Family moved away and disappeared.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,520
It was such a coincidence.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,960
(Xu’s Tomb)
Someone tried to cover something up.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,550
Sir Witch Doctor left a letter to me
and left home.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,040
Where has he gone?

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,040
Why did he hide an end-game

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,470
(Knight, Elephant, Pawn)

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,500
in his room?

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,300
(Elephant, Rook, Pawn, Knight)

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,200
There’re so many secrets.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,360
I will figure everything out.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
You mean she not only hurt her forehead,

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,270
when hitting the wall,

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,200
but also wounded the back of her head?

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,040
No. She didn’t hit the wall.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,270
She was hit
by something blunt intensively.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,230
You mean...?

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,200
Your Highness,

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,840
There’re fractures

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,000
in her carpal bones, ulnas,

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,710
and radii.

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,070
She was wounded before she died.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,390
How was she wounded?

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,840
To protect me.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,920
Protect you?

28
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,430
I was nearly born

29
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,240
when she was hurt.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,990
She had a swollen belly.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Someone suddenly pushed her from behind,

32
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,070
trying to make it an accident
that she hit the wall herself.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
To protect me in her body,

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,600
she held her arms
against the wall immediately.

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,030
Because of the fierce hitting,

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
she had fractures of different levels

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,250
(Multiple fractures)
in her carpal bones, ulnas,

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,960
and radii.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
Failing in killing her,

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,630
the murderer hit
the back of her head again,

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,240
and then she died of the fracture
in her occipital.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,310
Your Highness,
my mother didn’t kill herself.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,560
She was killed by others!

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,800
Please redress the grievance for her.

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,360
Stand up.

46
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,990
Not to mention she’s your mother,

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,030
even if she’s an irrelevant woman,

48
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,800
I’ll also find out the truth

49
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,310
and redress the grievance for her.

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,320
Well.

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,870
You’re the coroner,

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,600
taking care of the case.

54
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,710
Don’t do this.

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,710
I’m sorry.

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,790
Your Highness, I know
how to find my father.

57
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,170
How?

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,150
Do you remember I told you that

59
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,630
human’s appearance had something to do
with his skull?

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,230
Yes.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,630
With my mother’s skull for reference,

62
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,880
I can restore her appearance

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,550
with pottery clay.

64
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,120
Then you can portray her.

65
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,350
If someone can recognize her,

66
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,350
he might also know my father.

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Restore her appearance with clay?

68
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,350
Just like the statue.

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,550
It’ll look more real with the clay.

70
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,160
Sounds like a good idea.

71
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,240
But Chu Chu,

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,430
she’s your mother.

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,760
Have you made up your mind?

74
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,880
Your Highness, it’s something
about my mother’s grievance.

75
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,160
As you said,

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,990
even if she’s an irrelevant woman,

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
we’ll also find out the truth,

78
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,760
not to mention she’s my mother.

79
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,600
She had risked her life to protect me
before she died.

80
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
As a coroner,

81
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,120
I should do everything I can

82
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,350
to speak for the dead.

83
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,600
Please let me do it.

84
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,070
All right. You can do it.

85
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Do as the way you think.

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

87
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Who is that?

88
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,460
=The Imperial Coroner=

89
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,460
=Episode 15=

90
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,460
(Jing’s Mansion)

91
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,290
Master, a letter from Young Master.

92
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,140
(Dear Father,)
(From Jing Yi)

93
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,140
Master, is there anything wrong

94
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,810
with Young Master?

95
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,050
Commandery Prince An
found a eunuch’s corpse

96
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,170
in the house

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,940
where Xiao Heng used to live.

98
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,340
A eunuch’s corpse?

99
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,530
Why was a eunuch in Qianzhou?

100
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,490
Qin Luan went to Qianzhou,

101
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,620
to pacify the rebellion of Chen Ying.

102
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,650
Later, eunuchs went there

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,740
to exterminate the remnants.

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,630
I guess that was when
the eunuch went there.

105
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,350
Commandery Prince An asserted that

106
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,190
Xiao Heng killed the eunuch.

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,030
Prince Consort killed a eunuch?

108
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,070
It doesn’t sound right.

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Prince Consort was almost killed
by rebels.

110
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,630
Eunuchs exterminated rebels.

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,870
Speaking of this,

112
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,120
Prince Consort and eunuchs

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,870
should be on the same side.

114
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,840
It’s true that
eunuchs exterminated rebels.

115
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,870
But Xiao Heng never
went on well with eunuchs.

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,200
When he worked in the court,

117
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
he often punished eunuchs.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
It’s also possible that

119
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,100
they took the chance

120
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,540
to kill Xiao Heng.

121
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,290
You make sense, Master.

122
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,730
According to this,

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,060
Xiao Heng is likely to be alive.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,940
As reported,

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,010
Princess Xiping just
visited His Majesty.

126
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,730
Now, she may go to Xue’s Mansion.

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,020
Keep a close eye on Xue’s Mansion.

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,180
(Xue’s Mansion)

129
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,280
Come in, please, Your Grace.

130
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,290
Banxia, guard at the door.

131
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:46,900
Yes.

132
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,730
This way, please, Your Grace.

133
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,540
Mr. Xue,

134
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,380
please save my son and me!

135
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,780
What are you doing, Your Grace?

136
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,170
If you want me to do anything,

137
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,130
I’ll do it, regardless of any danger.

138
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,500
You’re the princess.

139
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,780
Don’t kneel to me.

140
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,130
Your Grace, be seated and tell me.

141
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,850
Don’t cry, Your Grace.

142
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,170
Or your eyes might be hurt.

143
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,010
Your Grace, you visited His Majesty?

144
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,130
If I guess correctly,

145
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,620
His Majesty told you about the marriage

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
between General Xiao and Miss Leng Yue.

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
You knew that?

148
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,700
I heard of that.

149
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,900
I treat you as my family

150
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,450
and I always tell you everything.

151
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,290
Why did you keep it from me?

152
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,850
I...

153
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Your Grace, you watched Leng Yue
grow up.

154
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,730
You also wanted Commandery Prince An
to marry her.

155
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,130
Why don’t you allow General Xiao
to marry her?

156
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,500
Are you trying to fob me off?

157
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,940
I’m not an ignorant woman.

158
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,470
I’m one of the imperial family,

159
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,870
and I grew up in the Palace.

160
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,300
Leng Yue is only granddaughter
of Leng Peishan,

161
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,780
Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

162
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,250
His Majesty is feeding my son to wolves!

163
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,470
Now that you know the real problem,

164
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,720
I’ll get to the point.

165
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,310
General Leng is your uncle.

166
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,960
He’s also the head of the Leng Family.

167
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,190
It concerns his family interests.

168
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,650
If General Xiao forcibly takes over
the military power in the Southwest,

169
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,370
I’m afraid he’ll be in danger.

170
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,620
If Jinli takes over the military power
in the Southwest,

171
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,300
he and I will go the same old way

172
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,860
like my mother did,

173
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700
becoming chess pieces

174
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,460
to restrain the Leng Family
in the Southwest.

175
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,890
Your Grace,

176
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,980
may I ask

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
how you replied to His Majesty?

178
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,090
I’m no longer a young girl.

179
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,070
I didn’t lose my temper
in front of His Majesty.

180
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,750
His Majesty promised me that

181
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,260
I could divine their birthdays

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,060
before he gives the order
about the marriage.

183
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,830
I can only stall him for a short time.

184
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,260
Sir, please do something for me.

185
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
I...

186
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,630
I know.

187
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,680
You’re Senior Jing’s disciple

188
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,930
and you don’t want to disobey him.

189
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,200
If you worry about your future,

190
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,670
please tell me directly.

191
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,430
It’s human nature.

192
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,420
I won’t blame you for it.

193
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,210
Your Grace, I watched General Xiao

194
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,590
and Commandery Prince An grow up.

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,860
To be honest,

196
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,600
I’ve been thinking about it so far.

197
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,580
If you trust me,

198
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,910
I’ll try to solve the problem for you.

199
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,060
What’s the plan, Mr. Xue?

200
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,370
I’m going to the Southwest.

201
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,400
Your Highness?

202
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,800
What brings you here?

203
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,320
I’m looking for Jing Yi. Where’s he?

204
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,510
I didn’t see him when I woke up.

205
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,800
Maybe he’s still sleeping.

206
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,080
Your Highness,
I’ve got something to tell you.

207
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,710
May I have a word with you?

208
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,680
Your Highness,

209
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,330
I know I may sound ungrateful,

210
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,200
but I must make something clear.

211
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,320
Or it’ll hurt us both.

212
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,470
Just get to the point.

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,640
We grew up together.

214
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,440
I admire you
for your morality and ability,

215
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,320
so I always obey you.

216
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,740
But...

217
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,030
I only treat you as my good friend.

218
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,480
So do I.

219
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,590
That’s fine, then.

220
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,510
Wait.

221
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,930
Be specific.

222
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,240
I hear Aunt wants us to get married.

223
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,120
I don’t know if you have agreed.

224
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,470
I want to make it clear to you.

225
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,830
But it’s fine now.

226
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,010
From now on,

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,030
let’s still be good friends.

228
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,240
I’ll still obey you.

229
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,950
Leng Yue,

230
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,910
I don’t know how you heard of that.

231
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,090
My mother never told me about it.

232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,180
I respect you for being straightforward,

233
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,790
ebullient and as brave as men,

234
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,000
But as you said,

235
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,470
I only treat you as my good friend.

236
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,760
Also, we’re cousins.

237
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,270
I never mean to love you.

238
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
I obey imperial rules and live my life.

239
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,510
You enjoy yourself in the martial world.

240
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,040
If you’re forced to stay
in Three Judicial Offices,

241
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,240
there’ll always be a mess

242
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,680
until we fight against each other

243
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,000
and both suffer great losses.

244
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,030
Yes, you’re right.

245
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,240
Now that we make it clear,

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,080
I have something to ask you.

247
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,000
Go ahead.

248
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,710
You never wanted to come to Qianzhou.

249
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,510
But you insisted
on coming with me this time.

250
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,560
Why?

251
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,240
Aunt asked me to come with you.

252
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,680
No one can ever control you.

253
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,320
I can figure it out.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,760
My mother must have asked you
to keep an eye on Chu Chu

255
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,440
in case she might hurt me.

256
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,710
But you wouldn’t be convinced to come

257
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,100
or risk your life to save her.

258
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,340
So, why did you come?

259
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,510
I know

260
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,270
I can hide no secret from you.

261
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,800
I did come for Chu Chu.

262
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,590
Chu Chu?

263
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,140
Yes. For her.

264
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,370
Because she’s like me.

265
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,030
Who’s talking out there?

266
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,850
Your Highness?

267
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,950
What are you talking about?

268
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,120
Chu Chu is working in the mortuary.

269
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,910
Yamen runners can’t keep her company.

270
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,950
Go send her some pottery clay

271
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,810
and stay with her,

272
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,350
in case she imagines things.

273
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,490
All right.

274
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,590
Go guard the door

275
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,730
and keep everyone away.

276
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,530
Yes.

277
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,000
Your Highness, you look so serious.

278
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,080
Insiders know you come to talk with me.

279
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,030
Ignorant people will think

280
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,150
you’re coming to date a girl.

281
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,200
Are you looking for trouble

282
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,460
simply because
I haven’t punished you for days?

283
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,170
I’m too exhausted to make a trouble.

284
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,010
Who?

285
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,390
Didn’t you just get up?

286
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,680
Why are your shoes muddy?

287
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,270
Who told you I just got up?

288
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,260
I woke up very early,

289
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
went around the county,

290
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,080
and checked about local copper coins.

291
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,560
Then I came back to bed.

292
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,860
But just a while later, you came.

293
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,820
I do come to see you

294
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,130
for some girl’s stuff.

295
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,140
Girl? Which girl?

296
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,120
Tell me about it.

297
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,830
A girl from the Xu Family.

298
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,800
The Xu Family?

299
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,570
They don’t look like a girl’s stuff.

300
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,000
They’re jewels and clothes of a woman.

301
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,440
Why don’t they look like a girl’s stuff?

302
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,710
I mean

303
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,760
they belong to a married woman,

304
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,690
instead of a young girl.

305
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,050
Also they look old-fashioned.

306
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,920
Chu Chu.

307
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,390
Miss Leng?

308
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,660
His Highness said
you were doing something important

309
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,170
in this place

310
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,590
and asked me to bring you some clay.

311
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,820
You need this for autopsy?

312
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,950
It’s not for autopsy.

313
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,020
It’s for...

314
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,470
restoring my mother’s face.

315
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,270
Your mother?

316
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,170
His Highness and I

317
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,340
opened my mother’s coffin.

318
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,960
I’ll use the clay
to restore her appearance.

319
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,350
When it’s done,

320
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,440
we may find someone who knows her

321
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,580
and confirm her identity.

322
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,150
No wonder His Highness worries
when you stay here alone.

323
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,830
He worries?

324
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,990
No. No, I don’t mean that.

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,910
I mean he worries you’ll imagine things

326
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,750
when you stay here alone.

327
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,590
Miss Leng, don’t worry.

328
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,550
I promised His Highness that

329
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,520
I would treat my mother

330
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,880
in the way I treat other corpses.

331
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,140
I won’t think about anything else,

332
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,940
except restoring her appearance.

333
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,880
Speaking of that,

334
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,910
when I learned medical skills,
I noticed that

335
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,680
a person’s skull had something to do

336
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,600
with his appearance.

337
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,260
But whether the person is fat or thin

338
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,800
also plays an important role.

339
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Luckily, we found
a set of my mother’s clothes,

340
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,840
which was buried with her in the coffin.

341
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,720
Based on the clothes,

342
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,940
I can figure out her shape.

343
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,490
When I finish this,

344
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,300
I’ll know

345
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,860
what my mother looks like.

346
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,900
Your Highness, where did you get them?

347
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,520
They belong to Chu Chu’s mother.

348
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,530
Chu Chu’s mother? Lady Xu?

349
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,120
She’s been dead for many years.

350
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
How did you get..?

351
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,760
From her coffin?

352
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
Your Highness, you went too far!

353
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,830
It’s all right
when you checked who Chu Chu was,

354
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,880
but you shouldn’t have opened
her mother’s coffin!

355
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,880
Chu Chu allowed me to do that.

356
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,090
She was there
when the coffin was opened.

357
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,290
She opened her mother’s coffin?

358
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,380
She has inspected her mother’s skeleton.

359
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,060
Now, she’s trying
to restore her mother’s appearance

360
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
in the mortuary,

361
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,950
so as to provide more clues

362
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,280
for her mother’s identity.

363
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,760
Chu Chu has seen all kinds of corpses

364
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,570
as a coroner,

365
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,910
but opening her mother’s coffin

366
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,240
and checking her mother’s skeleton?

367
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,240
It’s hard for anyone, Your Highness.

368
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,200
That’s why

369
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,310
we must check

370
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,880
every single clue very carefully

371
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,470
and don’t waste her bravery.

372
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
You’re familiar with girls’ stuff.

373
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,350
Check them carefully

374
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,460
and see what information you can find.

375
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
What do you want me to find?

376
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,350
If I tell you now,

377
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,830
I’ll influence your judgement.

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,880
Check them first.

379
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,760
I’ll go see Chu Chu in the mortuary.

380
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,530
All right.

381
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
Speaking of it,

382
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,590
I don’t remember
what my mother looks like.

383
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,030
When I was very little,

384
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,470
my parents died, too.

385
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,280
Princess Xiping brought me up.

386
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,370
Princess Xiping?

387
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,760
Why did she bring you up?

388
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,800
Your parents died early,

389
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,560
but you have a grandfather, don’t you?

390
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,430
Didn’t I tell you?

391
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,920
His Highness’s mother Princess Xiping

392
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,110
is my aunt.

393
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,230
When my parents died,

394
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,760
my family was in a mess.

395
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,350
My aunt brought me to her house
and looked after me.

396
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,680
But my grandfather?

397
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,350
He didn’t come back to Chang’an

398
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,430
until years after my parents died.

399
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,070
He was summoned
to meet the new emperor.

400
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,160
If I had waited for him,

401
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,950
I might have been dead.

402
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,800
I’m simply complaining.

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,830
Don’t take it seriously.

404
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
Don’t tell His Highness or Xiao Jinli.

405
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,400
They always want to patch things up

406
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,520
between my grandfather and me,

407
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,830
especially Xiao Jinli.

408
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,110
If he knows,

409
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,160
he’ll be nagging again.

410
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,520
I see.

411
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,230
Don’t worry.

412
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,280
I won’t tell anyone about it.

413
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,230
Miss Leng, don’t be too sad.

414
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
I think when you look into the mirror,

415
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,920
you’ll know what your parents look like.

416
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,830
Look into the mirror?

417
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,040
Yeah.

418
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,400
People think we’re born to be different.

419
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,430
It’s not right.

420
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,710
We look like our parents.

421
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,830
I’m serious.

422
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,040
I studied it very carefully.

423
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,190
(Father, Mother)

424
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,000
(Appearance inheritance)
One doesn’t have a face out of nowhere.

425
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,400
He looks like his parents.

426
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,070
For example,

427
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,520
if a couple don’t have tall noses,

428
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,920
their child

429
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,430
will hardly have a tall nose.

430
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,430
And eyes...

431
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,190
If the couple have single eyelid,

432
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,210
their child

433
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,230
won’t have double eyelids like I do.

434
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,940
(Single eyelid, Double eyelids)

435
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,590
Sounds interesting.

436
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
I haven’t noticed that before.

437
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,110
I don’t know
what your parents look like.

438
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
But you look so beautiful.

439
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,280
It’s not only because of your father.

440
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,680
Thank you, Chu Chu.

441
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,160
You’re welcome.

442
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,040
I’m telling the truth.

443
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,040
Do you know why I came to Qianzhou?

444
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,430
You told me about that.

445
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
Princess Xiping sent you.

446
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,640
Before I went back to Chang’an,

447
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,680
I had heard about you.

448
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,830
At first, I thought
you got close to His Highness

449
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,000
for a purpose.

450
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,280
But after I met you in Chang’an,

451
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,040
I knew I misunderstood you.

452
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,230
I met all kinds of people
in the martial world.

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,470
The first time I saw you,

454
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,190
I knew you and I were
the same kind of person.

455
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
I’m a coroner.

456
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,950
You’re from a rich family.

457
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,230
We’re totally different.

458
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
How can we be the same kind?

459
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,880
I don’t mean the family background,

460
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,190
but what we pursue.

461
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,950
What we pursue?

462
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,230
You went all the way to Chang’an,

463
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,070
just like I ran away from Chang’an.

464
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,560
We pursue what we want.

465
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,280
You want a chance to be a coroner.

466
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,160
All I want

467
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,230
is to be freed from the clan.

468
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,230
There aren’t many chances for girls.

469
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,000
When I see you tried hard
to be a coroner,

470
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,400
I kind of see the old me.

471
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,560
So,

472
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,000
I promised my aunt

473
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,590
to come to Qianzhou with you

474
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,350
so that I could help you
realize your dream.

475
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,830
Now, His Highness has finally hired you.

476
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,070
Congratulations.

477
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,430
You’ll be an official coroner
in Three Judicial Offices.

478
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,710
Thank you, Miss Leng.

479
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,680
What for?

480
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,680
I’m just an idler

481
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,680
who is quite self-sentimental.

482
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,230
You should say thank you

483
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
to His Highness.

484
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,000
Forget it.

485
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,040
Who do you think

486
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,160
is the most handsome,

487
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,640
His Highness, Jing Yi or Xiao Jinli?

488
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,950
They all look handsome.

489
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,040
But in different ways.

490
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,230
Be specific.

491
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,070
Vice Minister Jing has a pretty face.

492
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,590
General Xiao has a strong body.

493
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,430
His Highness...

494
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,760
You know what?

495
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,430
I’m sure his skull looks great.

496
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,920
I’m right about you.

497
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,560
You’re indeed a good coroner.

498
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,470
His Highness looks handsome.

499
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,000
But I always think

500
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,040
he shouldn’t look like this.

501
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,310
Why?

502
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,680
Is he General Xiao’s biological brother

503
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,190
of the same parents?

504
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,470
Yeah.

505
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,800
They’re twins.

506
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,730
Some twins look different.

507
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,830
It’s not weird, isn’t it?

508
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,640
It’s not weird
when twins look different.

509
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,070
But as I said,

510
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,760
I can infer the child’s appearance

511
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
from his parent’s skulls.

512
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
It’s not perfectly correct,

513
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,760
but based on their appearances,

514
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,230
they don’t look like brothers

515
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,160
of the same parents.

516
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,090
Shh.

517
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,160
Don’t let Xiao Jinli hear you.

518
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,930
You saw

519
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,830
how hard he protected His Highness.

520
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,830
If he hears you, he’ll punch you!

521
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,430
As far as I see,

522
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,920
one of them

523
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,400
may look like their father

524
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,040
while the other looks like their mother.

525
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
Or maybe His Highness decided a lot

526
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,400
before he was born.

527
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,880
You know what?

528
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,800
His Highness has been
making his own decisions

529
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,230
since he was little.

530
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,190
Maybe when he wanted to look like this,

531
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,160
he then had the face.

532
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,710
He has a good taste, then?

533
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,000
Your Highness.

534
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,920
Your Highness.

535
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,800
How’s the pottery statue going?

536
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,710
It’s done.

537
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
It’s my first time to do this.

538
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,640
I may have done a poor job.

539
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,590
But the crude face

540
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,430
won’t go wrong.

541
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,470
Well done.

542
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,040
Leave the rest to me.

543
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,070
You had a long day.

544
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,590
Go back for some rest.

545
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,950
When I find any clue,

546
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,190
I’ll tell you personally.

547
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

548
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,640
Leng Yue, walk her back.

549
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,520
All right.

550
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,200
Let’s go.

551
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,040
Eunuch Sun. Eunuch Qin.

552
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,950
Eunuch Qin.

553
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,110
You, leave!

554
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,800
Yes.

555
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Do you know why you can stay?

556
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,590
He’s asking you. Say something!

557
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,830
He’s dead?

558
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah. I think he took some poison.

559
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,280
Aconitine.

560
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,520
He’s really from the Southwest.

561
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,830
How daring!

562
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,470
He even dared to make trouble here.

563
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,470
He thought I was totally ignorant?

564
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,830
It’s not your place to stir up trouble.

565
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,000
Master, who do you mean?

566
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,430
Are you sure he’s the man

567
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,760
who spread rumors about Duke Chang?

568
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,350
Absolutely sure!

569
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,430
We came unexpectedly

570
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,000
and he killed himself hastily.

571
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,880
There must be some clues
that haven’t been destroyed yet.

572
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,760
Search this room carefully.

573
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,640
Yes.

574
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,640
Master.

575
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,430
What’s this?

576
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
Look. A receipt of Antique Store.

577
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,580
(Jin Lin, Chi Fang with Antique Store,
The 20th day of the tenth month)

578
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,640
Antique Store?

579
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,660
(Jin Lin, Chi Fang with Antique Store)

580
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,860
(Antique Store)

581
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,040
Manager,

582
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,280
Qin Luan has come.

583
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,950
Coming in, please.

584
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,470
Eunuch Sun!

585
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,880
(Elegant Literature)
Be quick. Get us some tea.

586
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,000
Don’t bother.

587
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,040
You’re the manager?

588
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,040
I’m Chi Fang,

589
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,590
manager of Antique Store.

590
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,520
Greetings, Eunuch Qin.

591
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,350
It’s our great honor

592
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,160
to have you come.

593
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,860
(Jin Lin, Chi Fang with Antique Store,
The 20th day of the tenth month)

594
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,520
It’s for another eunuch, I guess.

595
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,470
Now that you have the receipt,

596
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,070
I’ll go get it for you.

597
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,230
Please wait a second, Eunuch Qin.

598
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,660
(Elegant Literature)

599
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,580
(The Book of Songs)

600
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,560
Eunuch Qin.

601
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,710
It’s well repaired.

602
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Your skill is good
as imperial craftsmen.

603
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,400
You are flattering me, Eunuch Qin.

604
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,470
When he brought this here,

605
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,950
did he say something?

606
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,520
He simply asked me to repair this.

607
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,520
He said nothing else.

608
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,040
Officials often say that

609
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,680
Antique Store is the granary

610
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,760
for literary scholars.

611
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,680
When I see it with my own eyes,

612
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,230
I know it deserves the reputation.

613
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,880
Look.

614
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,350
Even you hold the Book of Songs.

615
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,920
I’m simply arty-crafty.

616
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,560
You flatter me, Eunuch Qin.

617
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,560
I don’t deserve the honor.

618
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,640
Eunuch Qin, you seldom come.

619
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,590
This is a little gift for you.

620
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,560
Please accept it.

621
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,000
Here you are, Eunuch Qin.

622
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,310
Thank you, Manager Chi.

623
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,070
You’re welcome.

624
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
See you, Eunuch Qin!

625
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,680
Miss Leng, has your wound healed?

626
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,560
Yes.

627
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,310
I nearly forgot it.

628
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
You risked your life to help me.

629
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,920
I don’t know how to pay you back.

630
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,040
Beautiful figured cloth.

631
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,160
Let me treat you something to eat.

632
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,350
There’s a shop of rice noodles ahead.

633
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,830
It’s the best in Guanling County.

634
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,430
Good idea. Let’s go.

635
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,830
How’s it going?

636
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,040
Not smoothly.

637
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,590
How about Chu Chu?
Is she doing all right?

638
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,110
She did a very good job.

639
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,950
I asked Leng Yue to walk her back.

640
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,520
Why do you want me
to play chess with you?

641
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,110
Play it with me.

642
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,040
Active your mind
before checking the exhibits.

643
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,000
What... what’s this?

644
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,760
It’s an end-game.

645
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,040
End-game?

646
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,920
Your Highness, don’t torture me.

647
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,710
You know how poorly I play chess.

648
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,830
Within one hour,

649
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,920
you can defeat me ten times
even if we start a new game,

650
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,310
not to mention an end-game.

651
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,230
As long as you win,

652
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,040
I’ll return all your deductions.

653
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,590
Really?

654
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,710
If you lose,

655
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,560
you’ll also lose your salaries
for the next three months.

656
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,190
Rice noodles for you.

657
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,430
Thank you, sir.

658
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,310
Wait a second.

659
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,470
Rice cake!

660
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,150
I want to eat that. What about you?

661
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,280
Rice cake?

662
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,160
All right. I’ll go buy some.

663
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,680
No, no. I’ll go.

664
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,280
-I want to see how he makes it.
-Delicious rice cake!

665
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,640
Come and have a look!

666
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,450
Figured cloth.

667
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,230
-Sir, get me some water.
-Nice figured cloth.

668
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,790
Come and look at the pouches.

669
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,230
Miss.

670
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,760
Sir.

671
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,470
-Try some. It’s home-made.
-All right.

672
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,800
It smells delicious.

673
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,310
Sure, it’s home-made.

674
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,780
Chu Chu!

675
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,160
Chu Chu!

676
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,680
Your Highness,

677
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,310
playing chess with you is more tiring
than viewing files.

678
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,920
My mind is in a whirl.

679
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,400
I’ll even lose my salaries
for the next three months.

680
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,430
I can’t hold on. I’ll go have some rest.

681
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
Check the exhibits carefully,

682
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
or you’ll lose more salaries.

683
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,280
Brother.

684
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,410
Your Highness.

685
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,470
Don’t bother to salute.

686
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,400
Leave us.

687
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,720
I have something to ask you.

688
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,640
What is it?

689
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,880
Who is better in Swift Moving,

690
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,800
you or Jing Yi?

691
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,830
Speaking of martial arts,

692
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,710
I can defeat him with single hand.

693
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,000
But speaking of Swift Moving,

694
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,040
I don’t want to admit it,

695
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,710
but he does much better than me.

696
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,560
Considering his Swift Moving,

697
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,680
when he deliberately sneaks

698
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,640
about ten meters away from you,

699
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,190
can you notice him?

700
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,280
He has poor martial arts.

701
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,310
If I pay attention,

702
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,420
I’ll notice him.

703
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,800
But I may not
if I’m not paying attention.

704
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,310
Why do you suddenly ask?

705
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,520
Nothing.

706
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,350
Your Highness!

707
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,190
Your Highness, bad news!

708
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,460
Chu Chu was kidnapped!

709
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,040
What?

710
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,050
When? Where?

711
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,830
Just now. Less than a quarter.

712
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,070
In the fair near Yamen.

713
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,430
When I was buying something,

714
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,110
that man knocked her out
and took her away!

715
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,160
It was my fault. I was too careless.

716
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,230
Did you see him clearly?

717
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,230
A middle-aged man with a medium height.

718
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,680
I think I met him before.

719
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,590
He was alone?

720
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,350
Yes.

721
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,880
Then you let him run away?

722
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,680
I...

723
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,680
Jinyu, I’ll go assemble the soldiers.

724
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,070
Leng Yue, go borrow some men

725
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,830
from Zheng Youde.

726
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,230
Do take Deputy Magistrate Tan Gui.

727
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,110
He’s native.

728
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,350
He’s more familiar with local condition.

729
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,750
All right.

730
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,230
Be quick!

731
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,500
Be quick!

732
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,560
Your Highness, here it is.

733
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,590
After he caught Chu Chu,

734
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,560
he ran into the lane.

735
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,590
I was a bit late

736
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
and they were gone.

737
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,280
Over there.

738
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,110
What kind of people live nearby?

739
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:48,920
Your Highness,

740
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,190
common people live nearby.

741
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,400
Most of them do small business.

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,310
If I remember correctly,

743
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,800
no one has a criminal record.

744
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,040
Precisely.

745
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,800
Leng Yue, you said when you caught up,

746
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,310
a carriage passed by

747
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,400
and stopped you

748
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,310
so that you failed in catching up.

749
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes.

750
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,760
Where?

751
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
Right here.

752
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,600
Here, Your Highness.

753
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,910
Tracks of the carriage?

754
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,040
The carriage was parked there.

755
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,470
Chu Chu sat there.

756
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,520
That man knew Leng Yue was responsive
and had good martial arts.

757
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,600
He asked the carriage to stop her.

758
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,320
Chu Chu!

759
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
He met Leng Yue before.

760
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,080
Chu Chu!

761
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,230
And he knew what she could do.

762
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,970
It’s Xu Rugui!

763
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,630
Jinyu!

764
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,760
Is this Miss Chu’s hairpin?

765
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,320
Where did you find it?

766
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,840
Under the basket.

767
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,280
Under the basket?

768
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,470
Chu Chu can’t have dropped it.

769
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,280
Xu Rugui asked his man to stop Leng Yue.

770
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,760
He knocked Chu Chu out
and took her away.

771
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,470
In such a short time,

772
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,430
he dropped the hairpin
under the basket.

773
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,430
He did it on purpose!

774
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,600
Who did it?

775
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,430
Xu Rugui.

776
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,630
Brother, keep searching this place
with your men.

777
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,910
Have two runners stay and help.

778
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
Let the rest of them go back to Yamen.

779
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,190
All right.

780
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,630
Does it have something to do
with Jing Yi?

781
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,000
Who... who are you?

782
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,600
I think I met you before.

783
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,000
Where am I?

784
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I’m warning you!

785
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,470
I work for Yamen.

786
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,800
Commandery Prince An, you know?

787
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,430
I’m a coroner, working for him.

788
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,710
He’ll come and find me!

789
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,760
I’m sure he’ll come, Chu Chu.

790
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,560
You know my name?

791
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,390
You know my name, too.

792
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,670
But everything was in a mess that day.

793
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,560
You may not remember my face.

794
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,710
Or you may have only remembered

795
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,430
another image of mine in Rugui House.

796
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,630
You... you are...?

797
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,150
I’m Xu Rugui.
