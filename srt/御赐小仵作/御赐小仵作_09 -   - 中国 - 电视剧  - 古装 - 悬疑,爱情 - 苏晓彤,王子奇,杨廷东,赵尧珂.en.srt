1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,030
Since the Coroner Qualification Test,

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
I’ve done several autopsies

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,230
for Commandery Prince An.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,840
But I still failed the test.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,000
Vice Minister Jing was right.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,120
Commandery Prince An
seems to want me to stay.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,630
Although he said he is not
the Handsome Judge,

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,840
he is really scrupulous and chary.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,360
None of the Shence Army’s tricks

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,600
escaped his eyes.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,950
He strictly enforces the law
and doesn’t bow to power.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,520
He is exactly the same as
the Handsome Judge

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,110
in the Legend of
the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,080
What’s happening here?

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,360
It was you who came up with that title?

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,000
I was just joking.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
There was no one else around

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,080
when I said that.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,200
If anyone knows about this,

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,430
it can only be
Prince Consort himself.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,310
Could it be...

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,590
Could it be that Prince Consort
is still alive

23
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,830
and he is in Qianzhou now?

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,800
I thought about
whether Prince Consort

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,720
is behind this girl.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,910
But I got news from the Southwest

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,870
that the witch doctor who turned

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,190
Prince Consort’s cases into stories

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,680
was living in Pingle Town,
Guanling County, Qianzhou.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,590
Maybe it was because of
some serious injuries,

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,480
he had trouble moving around for years.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,190
Five years ago, he left his home.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,830
Since then, he went missing.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,400
How would a person
who had trouble moving around

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,310
suddenly went missing?

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,120
He didn’t have many friends
in Pingle Town.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,190
The only people who were close to him
were the Chu family members.

38
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,230
If no one from the Chu family knows it,

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,270
then no one else would know it.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,740
=The Imperial Coroner=

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,740
=Episode 9=

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,360
There should be another reason

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
for Commandery Prince An
to go to Qianzhou.

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,210
I’m afraid something went wrong
in Qianzhou.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,330
What Feng Jie, Liu Yue,
Lu Chuansheng were dealing with

46
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,330
is more or less related to Qianzhou.

47
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,690
But what’s the relation between

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,490
the dancing girl and Qianzhou?

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,900
Although aconitine grows in many places,

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,260
the variety and toxicity vary

51
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,970
in different places.

52
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,820
I’ve checked it. The aconitine used by
the dancing girl to commit suicide

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,830
is made in an ancient method
in Qianzhou.

54
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,080
There are still some doubts

55
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,950
about the case of Yan Ming.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,160
I’ll tell you about it
after I verify it.

57
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,490
Now everything is related to Qianzhou,

58
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,030
it cannot be a coincidence.

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,800
I’m afraid something
concerning the country

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,780
will happen in the Southwest.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,370
Concerning the country?

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
What else did he say?

63
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,030
It seems to get more troublesome.

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,750
Do I have to go?

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
You have to go

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,110
to the Southwest this time.

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,550
Besides what you need to
do for Commandery Prince An,

68
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,080
I also have something for you to do.

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,270
Your Highness, are you all right?

70
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,400
I’m fine.

71
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,470
Your Highness.

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,360
Take these people back

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,750
and find out who they are.

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,240
Yes!

75
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,390
I didn’t expect that someone dares to

76
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,870
assassinate you in Chang’an.

77
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
It isn’t long since we met last time.

78
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,520
You got better at making enemies.

79
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,710
It’s getting late.

80
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,030
You should go to
Princess Xiping’s Mansion.

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,630
If my mother asks about it...

82
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,600
Rest assured.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
I know how to make up a story.
I’m leaving.

84
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,960
Hold on.

85
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,960
Are you not asking me why?

86
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,870
I’ve been doing what you
told me to do since I was a child.

87
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,960
I don’t care about the reason.

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
You won’t screw me up anyway.

89
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,710
Commandery Prince An likes pretty girl.

90
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,150
Then I’ll show him a pretty girl.

91
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,360
This should be catering to his pleasure.

92
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,550
I can even fix a rotten face.

93
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,870
How hard can it be to fix my face?

94
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,540
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

95
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,410
Miss Chu.

96
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,220
Miss Chu.

97
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,500
General Wu, what’s the matter?

98
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,220
I found your pass

99
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,370
in that inn.

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,090
I guess you accidentally
dropped it there.

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,510
You found it? Great.

102
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Thank you, General Wu.

103
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
I’ve brought the pass.

104
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,410
Miss Chu, open the door.

105
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,780
I’m not quite dressed yet.

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,160
Why don’t you put it at the door

107
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,340
and place a stone on it?

108
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,160
I’ll pick it up later.

109
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,220
Thank you, General Wu.

110
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,060
By the way,

111
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,740
Commandery Prince An brought back

112
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,330
what you left in

113
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,570
Feng’s mansion last night.

114
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,340
I’ll also leave it here for you.

115
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,640
Really? That’s great.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,570
Thank you, General Wu.

117
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,620
(Pass)

118
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,460
By the way, General Wu.

119
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,940
Did Commandery Prince An
see the autopsy result?

120
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,940
Yeah.

121
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,370
Did he say anything?

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,570
His Highness said

123
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,970
that you are a rare good coroner.

124
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,940
Really? Did he really say that?

125
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,100
I dare not make up

126
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,570
what His Highness said.

127
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:53,970
That’s great.

128
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,340
General Wu, has he come back?

129
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,440
He should be on his way back.

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,790
If you want to see Commandery Prince An,

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,280
I’ll tell him for you

132
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,910
when he comes back.

133
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
Thank you, General Wu.

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,510
Your Highness.

135
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,230
We’ve carefully checked
the eight corpses.

136
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,230
They are not from the Shence Army.

137
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
They are all death row inmates
with marks on their faces.

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,710
We haven’t found out

139
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,120
which prison they escaped from.

140
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,990
It’s Qin Luan indeed.

141
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,110
Qin Luan?

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,630
It was a eunuch from
the Palace to offer condolence

143
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,280
who exposed the identity of
Chu Chu to the Feng family

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,310
and encouraged them
to tell the Emperor on me

145
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,160
so as to prevent me from investigating
the cause of Feng Jie’s death.

146
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,430
It was the people from Shence Army
who set a fire at the mourning hall

147
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,550
and tried to burn up the corpse.

148
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
It was also the people from Shence Army
who fooled the guards at the gate

149
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,630
and sent Xu Rugui out of Chang’an.

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,400
Except Qin Luan,

151
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,950
there is no one else in Court

152
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,800
who can order the both parties.

153
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,480
So the person who is behind Rugui House

154
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,110
is Qin Luan.

155
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
You knew that this eunuch holds grudges.

156
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,040
So you went with it

157
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,510
and locked down

158
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,870
the Shence Army in the name of plague,

159
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,840
forcing Qin Luan to use
other forces to tackle you

160
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
and proved your speculation.

161
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,640
No.

162
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,420
Today I asked the Emperor

163
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,380
to allow me to leave Chang’an tomorrow.

164
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,550
If he wants to kill me,
he has to do it tonight.

165
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,140
In such a short time,

166
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,800
he had no choice but to
use his reserve force

167
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,300
that is hard to find out in normal days.

168
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,570
Although he has been
living in the palace,

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,050
there are only a few kinds of people

170
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,350
he can buy off,

171
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,450
I still can’t rest assured to leave

172
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,530
without finding it out myself.

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,180
Based on the current situation,

174
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,180
The Rugui House isn’t a determinant
of Qin Luan’s power.

175
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,890
It’s not the most important thing

176
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,970
to find evidence
and prove my speculation.

177
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,200
What matters is

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,090
my mother’s safety after I left.

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,850
Memorize the contents of these papers,

180
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,380
then burn them.

181
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,880
After I leave,

182
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,170
you must do what’s written in the letter

183
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,700
in person.

184
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,710
Remember,

185
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,340
you must be really careful.

186
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,740
Any news you have

187
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,050
(Keep an eye on all the parties)
can’t be passed to others.

188
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,330
Send a letter directly to me.

189
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,530
Your Highness.

190
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,330
Are you not taking me to the Southwest?

191
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,450
How can I not worry about it?

192
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,380
The Southwest is not Chang’an,
Your Highness.

193
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,620
Not to mention you will take

194
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,060
that suspicious Chu Chu with you.

195
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,650
Did she act suspiciously tonight?

196
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,090
No.

197
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,450
After Miss Chu finished dinner,

198
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,950
she has been staying in Liutao Office

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,580
and doesn’t come out.

200
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,550
But...

201
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,160
No matter why she came here,

202
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,680
she has no interest in my life.

203
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,950
I’ve given her many chances.

204
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,920
If she wants to kill me,

205
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,070
she would have made a move
a long time ago.

206
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,840
Qin Luan failed to kill me tonight.

207
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,340
He will take action again.

208
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,720
Find some reliable people

209
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
to protect my mother in secret.

210
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,980
Besides, after I leave Chang’an,

211
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,630
the case files and items here

212
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,030
will be coveted by someone.

213
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,600
These stuffs also
need to be guarded well,

214
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,410
as well as the contents in the papers.

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,240
If you don’t stay in Chang’an,

216
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,110
I can’t leave without
worrying about them.

217
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,310
Your Highness, rest assured.

218
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
I’ll take care of
these things in Chang’an

219
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,380
and wait for you to return safely.

220
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,860
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

221
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,260
Chu Chu.

222
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,940
Your Highness.

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,140
She is...

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,440
The way he looks at me is different.

225
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,700
Her look...

226
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,010
You...

227
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,230
He should like it.

228
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,990
Are you studying to dress up the corpse?

229
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,840
Dress up the corpse?

230
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,660
No.

231
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,400
How can you try it on yourself?

232
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,230
I...

233
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,670
Wash your face first before we talk.

234
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,750
I mean,

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,990
they said that I am impatient.

236
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,500
After you come back,

237
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
I’m not the most impatient person.

238
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,770
That Sun Mingde is hateful indeed.

239
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,530
You asked for a reward from the Emperor

240
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,580
to let him lead a horse for you.

241
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,970
Be careful that he will
retaliate against you.

242
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,570
Even he wants to retaliate against me,

243
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,970
will I fear a eunuch?

244
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,010
You are in Chang’an now.

245
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,500
We are under the Emperor’s watch

246
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,570
and you don’t need to worry about it.

247
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,180
But if you leave Chang’an,

248
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,410
you must be careful about everything.

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,330
I just came back.

250
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I’m not going to leave.

251
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,530
I want you to leave.

252
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,220
Where do you want me to go, Aunt?

253
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,530
Qianzhou, the Southwest.

254
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,260
You are good-for-nothing.

255
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,330
Master, calm your anger.

256
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,940
Although we missed it
and didn’t kill Xiao Jinyu

257
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,100
this time,

258
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,180
it was still a demoralizing blow

259
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,410
for him.

260
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,850
How is that a demoralizing blow?

261
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,920
Wise like you, Master.

262
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,030
Think about it.

263
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,280
who dares to blatantly
assassinate Xiao Jinyu

264
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,640
in the imperial city?

265
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,080
No one

266
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,840
but you.

267
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,160
How awe-inspiring you are.

268
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,630
That’s a glorious defeat.

269
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,430
Get away!

270
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,480
Are you afraid that Xiao Jinyu
won’t find it out it was me?

271
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,630
Who did you learn from?

272
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,280
How can you be that stupid?

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,720
I learned from you...

274
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,080
No, no... I...

275
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,630
I thought myself.

276
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,600
Thanks to Xu Rugui.

277
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,240
Xu Rugui...

278
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,350
Xu Rugui was thrown

279
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,480
out of Chang’an by Xiao Jinyu.

280
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,240
I do better than he does.

281
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,430
Master, I’m stupid.

282
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,870
Please enlighten me.

283
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,480
Order Xu Rugui to head for
Qianzhou immediately.

284
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,130
You want him to go to Qianzhou?

285
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,630
Qianzhou is his hometown.

286
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,040
He couldn’t be more familiar with

287
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,540
the people and the environment there.

288
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,980
We can’t kill Xiao Jinyu in Chang’an.

289
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,800
But in the place with
those wild bandits and thieves,

290
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,310
it’s not up to him anymore.

291
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,310
Master, what about the female coroner?

292
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,080
Xiao Jinyu keeps a close eye on her.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,640
It’s hard to get her.

294
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,310
Ask Xu Rugui to take her together.

295
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,990
Don’t tell him too much about it.

296
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,100
Just ask him

297
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,280
to bring her alive to see me.

298
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,720
Yes.

299
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,550
Wu Jiang said you want to see me.

300
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,750
What’s the matter?

301
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,430
I was going to show you my...

302
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,240
My skill to dress up the corpse

303
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,920
and see if you like it.

304
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,720
That’s it?

305
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,630
I have something for you.

306
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,750
This is...?

307
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,710
This is a mirror.

308
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,430
Look.

309
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,190
One side of it is convex.

310
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,720
The other side is concave.

311
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,960
The convex side

312
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,400
can provide a wider field of view.

313
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,640
The concave side

314
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,300
can magnify small things.

315
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,580
I named it as the universe mirror.

316
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,410
Universe mirror...

317
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,140
Make big mirrors flat.
Make small mirrors convex.

318
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,380
There is such a rule
in the ancient method of making mirrors.

319
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,260
You are quite creative.

320
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,970
But why are you giving me this?

321
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,330
Now you have this universe mirror,

322
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,180
you don’t need to go into

323
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,330
places without windows.

324
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,120
You can use it to look

325
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,740
inside the room at the door.

326
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,770
Thanks.

327
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,210
Do you like it?

328
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,210
Yes.

329
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,700
That’s great.

330
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,410
But you don’t need to thank me.

331
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,410
I just put some effort.

332
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,770
I used your ladle to make this mirror.

333
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,010
My ladle?

334
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,060
Miss Chu, what are you doing?

335
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,800
I want to make a mirror.

336
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,130
Make a mirror with this?

337
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,860
I bet you don’t have such a mirror
in the Three Judicial Offices.

338
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,530
This mirror is made with a ladle.

339
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,860
By the way,

340
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,570
the stone used to polish the mirror

341
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,460
was picked up in your backyard.

342
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,650
Chu Chu, please keep the secret for me

343
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,610
that I can’t enter a place
without a window.

344
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
I know.

345
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,060
I won’t tell anyone about it.

346
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,370
Your Highness, if you don’t believe me,

347
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,370
we can pinky swear.

348
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,220
I pinky swear.

349
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,770
All right, rest assured.

350
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,580
Today you asked me about
the exam result.

351
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,250
I didn’t finish my words.

352
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,860
What?

353
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,280
In terms of

354
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,300
the criteria I set for the selection,

355
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,770
no one passed the exam.

356
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,930
But right now, what I need

357
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,260
the coroner to do

358
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,580
is slightly different from before.

359
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,820
I can make some adjustments.

360
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,300
You can try again.

361
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,860
Really? Can I take the exam again?

362
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,530
When and where?

363
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,910
I will leave for Qianzhou tomorrow
to solve a case.

364
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,310
Would you like to go with me?

365
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,240
Qianzhou?

366
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,510
I remember it.

367
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,030
The shopkeeper who escaped
is from Qianzhou.

368
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,390
Your Highness, are you
going to catch him?

369
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,200
You can say that.

370
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
You will go to Qianzhou with me,

371
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,270
and I will test you along the way.

372
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,510
If you pass it,

373
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,910
I’ll keep you in Chang’an
to work for me.

374
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,310
If you fail again,

375
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,510
I can also verify your identity
in Qianzhou.

376
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,100
If there is nothing wrong
with your identity,

377
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,630
you will be reviewed and rated.

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Going with me

379
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,270
can also save you the expenses
of going back home.

380
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,630
Are you willing to go with me?

381
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
Yes, I do.

382
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,240
But,

383
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,000
what’s the exam like?

384
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,510
How can I pass it?

385
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
It’s up to me to decide.

386
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,840
You only need to do it as usual

387
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,080
and wait for the result.

388
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,670
Okay, I’ll do well.

389
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:30,780
(Antique Store)

390
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,620
(Book of Songs)
(Xiao heads for Qianzhou. Be careful.)

391
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,860
(Travel on an Autumn Day
in the Mountain...)

392
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,910
Someone.

393
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
Master.

394
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,670
Send it to Qianzhou immediately.

395
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,270
Yes.

396
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:10,780
(Xiao heads for Qianzhou. Be careful.)

397
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,030
Fortunately, I didn’t miss you.

398
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,640
Are you here to send me off?

399
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,030
Wake up from your dream.

400
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,510
Is that for me?

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,510
Go away.

402
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,510
Aunt asked me to come.

403
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
What’s the matter?

404
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
She asked me to go to Qianzhou with you.

405
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,670
Do you want to come with us?

406
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,790
There is always a way out indeed.

407
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,000
What are you talking about?

408
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,870
Why are you going to Qianzhou with us?

409
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,670
I can do whatever he can do.

410
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,550
Childish.

411
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,630
How am I childish?

412
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,030
I’m maturer than him.

413
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,360
Besides, last night...

414
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,310
What’s wrong?

415
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,270
I promised my aunt.

416
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,840
I can’t break my promise.

417
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,390
Haven’t you always refused to
set foot in Qianzhou?

418
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,720
It’s different this time.

419
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,270
Your Highness, I think

420
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,080
we should let Leng Yue come with us.

421
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,490
Leng Yue has more experience
being out there.

422
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,600
She might be able to

423
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,120
save a lot of trouble for us.

424
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,020
Moreover,

425
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,330
Miss Chu will have a companion
in this way.

426
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,370
They can take care of each other.

427
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,350
Yes, just leave Miss Chu to me.

428
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,630
I’ll take good care of her.

429
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,510
All right.

430
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,920
But I have something to say first.

431
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,180
If you want to come with me,

432
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,140
you need to

433
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,220
take your temper down a notch

434
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,530
and follow my instructions all the time.

435
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,820
You can’t fight as you want.

436
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,730
Okay, I’ll listen to you.

437
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,820
Let’s go.

438
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,300
Tell me

439
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,620
what happened

440
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,510
in that year?

441
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,880
Where have you been

442
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,270
all these years?

443
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,340
If Jinyu finds you,

444
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,130
please come back with him.

445
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,820
You must come back with him.

446
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,380
(Jiangshan Hall)

447
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,250
Soldiers, money and news

448
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,610
are all abnormal.

449
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,250
They all gather in the Southwest.

450
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,490
If I may be so bold,

451
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,730
this buyer is up to something big.

452
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,530
I’m afraid it might jeopardize
the stability of the Southwest of Tang.

453
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,680
The Southwest...

454
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,960
The last upheaval in the Southwest
was in the Wenzong Dynasty.

455
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,750
The eunuchs were in great power
and intervened in politics.

456
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,360
They controlled the Emperor
and ruled the world.

457
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,030
The Prince Consort,
Princess Xiping’s husband, Xiao Heng

458
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,720
went to investigate the Military
Commissioner of Jiannan, Chen Ying.

459
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,390
The head of the eunuchs, Qin Luan took
the Shence Army to the Southwest

460
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,270
in the name of cracking down Chen Ying

461
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,030
and supporting Xiao Heng.

462
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
But Xiao Heng never returned.

463
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,560
No one has ever seen him after that.

464
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,150
I don’t know

465
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,290
what happened exactly.

466
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,500
The eunuchs are no longer in power.

467
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,860
The Palace Domestic Service
is under my watch.

468
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,340
I don’t need to
control them too tightly.

469
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,260
I’ve been makings all day long,

470
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,650
trying to balance the ministers
and the eunuchs.

471
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,740
What I want is just to
restore the prosperity

472
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,100
and make Tang flourishing again.

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,840
Your Majesty.

474
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,910
This is

475
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,670
what you want.

476
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,460
Your Majesty... mercy!

477
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,840
Mercy!

478
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,480
That’s what you got?

479
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,790
Get up.

480
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,230
This is the sword of

481
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,120
our famous founding member,
Duke Li Jing.

482
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,030
It’s normal that you are scared.

483
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,360
Your Majesty, I’m truly honored

484
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
to be pointed by

485
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,230
the sword of a famous general

486
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,390
which is held by the rightful emperor.

487
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,670
My life is not wasted

488
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,960
even though to be cut into pieces.

489
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,430
Sun Mingde.

490
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,640
You didn’t learn much from your master.

491
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,910
But your tongue does get glibber.

492
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
Thank you for your praise.

493
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,310
All right.

494
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,910
I’ll keep this sword.

495
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,600
Take the rest of these back.

496
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

497
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,030
Take it.

498
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,720
Master, I was scared to death.

499
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,910
Oh my goodness.

500
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,910
I mean, what did His Majesty

501
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,270
want to do?

502
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,990
He just drew

503
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,960
the sword out

504
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,230
and pointed it

505
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,310
at the tip of my nose.

506
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,600
I thought

507
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
I was going to die there.

508
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,630
You always teach me to guess

509
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,460
the Emperor’s intentions.

510
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,040
I keep guessing

511
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,680
and racking my brains,

512
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,950
but I still can’t figure it out.

513
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,270
The Emperor suddenly did that to me,

514
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,880
what does he mean?

515
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,880
To tease you.

516
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,880
The Emperor shouldn’t pick
a fine sword for no reason.

517
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,630
But there is no war now.

518
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,240
What does he want to do?

519
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,000
I mean, Master...

520
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,360
What does the Emperor want to do?

521
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,380
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

522
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,480
Your Highness.

523
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,630
Miss Leng Yue came back.

524
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,550
Have you ever asked her about it?

525
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,080
What do you mean?

526
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,310
She and Commandery Prince An.

527
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,430
Well,

528
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,390
all Jinyu thinks about
is the official affairs.

529
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,760
They left before

530
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,910
I found a chance to ask them.

531
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,840
Anyway, Yue went with him.

532
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,310
They might be together
when they come back.

533
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,680
It would save me
the trouble to talk to them

534
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,840
and annoy them.

535
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,840
But I heard

536
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,080
that Commandery Prince An
brought another girl

537
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,390
to the Southwest this time.

538
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,430
That’s the new coroner he hired.

539
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,220
Are you worried

540
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,340
that Jinyu, a first-rank prince,

541
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,840
will marry a coroner?

542
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,430
Of course not.

543
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,390
Commandery Prince An is noble.

544
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,270
That coroner is lowly.

545
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,790
It’s even inappropriate for her
to be a maidservant

546
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,200
for Commandery Prince An.

547
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,630
Even if Commandery Prince An
has any absurd idea,

548
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,390
the Emperor won’t allow that.

549
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,200
I think

550
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,000
you should ask the Emperor

551
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,820
to grant a marriage to
Commandery Prince An and Miss Leng Yue.

552
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,200
They are perfectly matched.

553
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,100
The Emperor won’t object it.

554
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,630
With the imperial decree,

555
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,000
this will be a godsent marriage.

556
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,550
You can rest assured earlier

557
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,360
if they settle down earlier.

558
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,240
They said that I’m impatient.

559
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,510
Right now,

560
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,030
you are more impatient than I am.

561
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,120
It’s about their happiness.
How can I not worry about it?

562
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,510
You are born to worry about people.

563
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,220
Your Jing Yi

564
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,030
has been attractive to
girls since he was young.

565
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,270
There are countless girls
who fall for him.

566
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,000
I think your mansion

567
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,630
must be thronged with girls.

568
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,760
What’s the use of that?

569
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
That kid

570
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,200
flirts with different girls every day.

571
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,430
Sometimes I think
he is interested in every girl.

572
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,870
Sometimes I think

573
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,910
he is interested in no girl.

574
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,200
When I ask him,

575
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,630
he just jokes about it.

576
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,720
He never takes it seriously.

577
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,080
If his reputation
as a playboy spreads out,

578
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,720
I’m afraid no decent girl
will marry him.

579
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,310
Speaking of him,

580
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,120
he hasn’t written a letter to us

581
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,600
since he left.

582
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,760
Only I am worried about him.

583
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,760
I’m not worried about

584
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,680
his eating or sleeping.

585
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,800
He would never treat himself badly.

586
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,230
I’m just worried about Qianzhou.

587
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,030
I heard that there are wild bandits
and the people are suffering.

588
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,840
Where did you hear that?

589
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,300
Even though Qianzhou is far away,

590
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,790
it’s still the territory of Tang.

591
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,630
Not to mention it’s heavily garrisoned
by the Military Commissioner,

592
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,230
The bandits in the Southwest

593
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,880
have been terror-stricken long ago.

594
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,200
They are far less wild
than in the Sui Dynasty.

595
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,150
What’s more,

596
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,240
The Emperor has approved Jinli

597
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,510
to lead troops to protect
their safety in Qianzhou.

598
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,790
Don’t worry about it.

599
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,030
They will be fine.

600
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,910
Dear.

601
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,840
Dear, what’s wrong?

602
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,600
Dear, the paper is really expensive.

603
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,430
What’s wrong, Dear?

604
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,030
Dear, what’s wrong with you today?

605
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,870
What the hell is that?

606
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,670
It wastes my effort and comes to
nothing. I’m not doing it anymore.

607
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,150
Dear, calm you anger.

608
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,630
Dear, did you fail to
persuade Princess Xiping

609
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,430
to ask the Emperor to grant a marriage?

610
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,480
She said

611
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,630
she is not worried as his mother.

612
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,510
I’m the only one who is worried.

613
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,950
Although I’m not like her,

614
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,700
I’m still a Commandery Princess.

615
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,240
I suffered this

617
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,600
all because of you!

618
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,000
I...

619
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,600
Jing Zhi.

620
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,880
If you don’t tell me

621
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,360
why you want them to
get married in such a hurry,

622
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,760
it won’t be over!

623
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,630
Dear, calm down.

624
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,000
Dear, have some water.

625
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Dear, I did that

626
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,390
for the sake of our son.

627
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,120
You are smart.

628
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,030
You know that our son
falls for Leng Yue.

629
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,960
Think about it.

630
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,030
The five generations of the Jing family
are all royal subjects.

631
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,670
Our roots are deep among the ministers.

632
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,670
The Leng family

633
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,760
has a big army
and is occupying the Southwest.

634
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,520
If our children get married,

635
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,150
this is bound to affect
the current situation.

636
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,940
For the two families,

637
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,310
there are all harms but no benefits.

638
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,150
We can rest assured earlier

639
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,550
if we end his thought earlier.

640
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,510
I implore you

641
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,310
to keep urging Leng Yue’s marriage.

642
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,350
This is not just about
the Jing family and the Leng family.

643
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,950
It’s about everyone.

644
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,960
Everyone?

645
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,260
I just got

646
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,190
news from the Southwest

647
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,450
that the camp of
the Military Commissioner in Qianzhou

648
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,250
is slightly abnormal.

649
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,610
Leng Peishan is not
as healthy as before.

650
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,530
He needs to burn mugwort every day.

651
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,100
It can be seen that something is wrong
with his body.

652
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,570
But he refuses to
report it to the court.

653
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,610
He is training soldiers
in private and building his army.

654
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,940
It’s suspicious indeed.

655
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,490
Well... What does Leng Peishan...

656
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,370
What does he want to do?

657
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,370
Leng Peishan hides it deliberately.

658
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,140
We can’t be sure

659
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,210
what his intention is right now.

660
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,690
But if Leng Peishan is gravely ill,

661
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,380
I’m afraid he will make a big move

662
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,620
to preserve his power in the Southwest.

663
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,660
Does Leng Yue know that?

664
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,740
It’s hard to say.

665
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,700
What if...

666
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,300
No way.

667
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,820
You have to tell our son about it.

668
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,260
He is with Commandery Prince An
all the time

669
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,820
with Leng Yue following them.

670
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,250
This matter

671
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,620
can’t be said from any of us

672
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,730
in our Jing family.

673
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,580
I will find out another way.

674
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,010
Dear, remember.

675
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,890
You can’t say one word about this

676
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,130
to anyone else.

677
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,300
(Qianzhou)

678
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:17,340
(Guanling Border, Qianzhou)

679
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,010
(Guanling Border, Qianzhou)

680
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,100
Your Highness, we’ve arrived at
the Guanling border.

681
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,540
(Guanling Border, Qianzhou)

682
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,690
Your Highness.

683
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,250
We will arrive in Pingle Town soon
after we pass through the border.

684
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,660
We used to use the rope as a bridge.

685
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,530
A few years ago, the former prefectural
government built a stone bridge.

686
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,620
It’s much easier to get to our town now.

687
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,490
How can you use a rope as a bridge?

688
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,180
(Hillstone River)
We would swing on a rope first

689
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,420
(Cross the river with a rope)
and then climb for a while.

690
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,930
When there was no stone bridge,

691
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,930
that was the only way for us.

692
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,610
It was really dangerous.

693
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,730
Master, I’ve sent the spices
to Princess Xiping

694
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,770
as you asked.

695
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,100
Is everything okay?

696
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,140
Banxia said Princess is doing well.

697
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,610
She thanked you for your concern.

698
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,820
She also asked me

699
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,100
that if you receive any news from
Commandery Prince An.

700
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,660
Well?

701
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,340
Didn’t Princess Xiping get news from
Commandery Prince An?

702
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,730
No.

703
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,380
But the Emperor
has ordered General Xiao Jinli

704
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,050
to lead troops to protect

705
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,860
Commandery Prince An in Qianzhou.

706
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,010
I think they should be fine.

707
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,380
The Southwest is turbulent.

708
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,730
No news is the best news.

709
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,820
The time is up.

710
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,360
Master, it’s time to enter the Palace.

711
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,240
I don’t like this.

712
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,420
I’m really scared.

713
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,770
Don’t talk.

714
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,820
The terrain is complex.
We can’t stay long.

715
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,010
Let’s hurry up.

716
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,290
What’s the rush, Commandery Prince An?

717
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,940
Long time no see since we met
in Chang’an last time.

718
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,180
I heard that you even
painted a portrait of me

719
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:31,940
to look for me.

720
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,490
I’m truly honored.

721
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,370
I’ve been waiting for you for a while.

722
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,210
I will send you to
the underworld right now!
