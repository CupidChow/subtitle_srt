1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,880
His Highness has poor health,

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,190
yet he stayed up all night to
make autopsy tools for me.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,880
You made these with your own hands?

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
He even took me to investigate the case.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,630
But I don’t know what
my brother was thinking.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,600
Why couldn’t he
get along with His Highness?

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,470
And why must he take His Highness to

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,040
the witch doctor’s
house to catch the ghost?

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,200
Indeed, they’ve caught the ghost,

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,950
but they discovered a body,

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,270
a eunuch’s body.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,000
(Domestic Service)
What secret does Sir Witch Doctor hide?

13
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

14
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,140
=Episode 12=

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,550
Multiple wounds caused by
sharp weapons on the body.

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
The cuts are small and shallow.

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,960
The lethal injury was an upward stab

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
from the fifth rib

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,830
on the left

20
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,750
through the heart

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,600
to the upper left of the back.

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,190
The murder weapon

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,390
should be a hard cylindrical object

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,190
with a sharp point.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,110
Like...

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,960
Like this.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes, like...

28
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,720
No, not like this.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
This is the murder weapon.

30
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,190
This is the murder weapon?

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,670
The murder weapon and the body

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,750
were preserved together.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
What was the purpose of the one
who hid the body?

34
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,240
Oh,

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
if this iron rod is the murder weapon,

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
what is that blade for?

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,720
The positions of the wounds

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,520
are very strange.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,830
What do you mean?

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,270
Most of the injuries
were on the forearms,

41
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,550
(Wound positions)
belly and upper part of the thighs.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
The lethal injury at the top

43
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,110
was stabbed upwards.

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,030
(In Out)

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,830
What’s so strange about that?

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
The dead was a martial artist.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,720
If one were to kill him,

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the murderer would
also be a good fighter.

49
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,880
Wait,

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,880
how do you know that
he was a martial artist?

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,550
Miss Leng told me that

52
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,800
martial artists know when to yield.

53
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,390
It means when they know they

54
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,720
have to get injured,

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,670
they know the level
of their own injuries.

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,550
The non-lethal injuries on this person

57
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,440
are long and shallow.

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,110
Because when the
murder weapon cut his skin,

59
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,550
he drew himself back

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600
from deep cuts,

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
which could cause heavy damage.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
That’s true.

63
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,670
But there’s nothing strange about it.

64
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,630
The murderer is someone who

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,750
could kill a martial artist,

66
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,160
then he should attack the vital parts.

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,110
For example, head, throat.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,030
But the murderer didn’t do so.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,390
Girl, is this what you’re trying to say?

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,350
Yes.

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,200
But...

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,950
It’s not like the
murderer didn’t want to,

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,510
he couldn’t.

74
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,040
Your Highness.

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,830
Here we go.

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Other than the lethal injury,

77
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,200
the rest wounds are shallow.

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,390
The deepest is 5-centimetre deep.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,350
However, the iron rod
is at least 60-centimeter long.

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,510
It means the murderer and the dead

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,640
didn’t have

82
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,160
a close fight.

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,000
They kept about 60-centimeter

84
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
away from each other.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,110
The dead has a wound
on the right forearm,

86
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,600
which was stabbed upwards
from left to right.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Cut my neck from the left.

88
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,790
The dead has another
wound on the right thigh,

89
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,110
which was cut downwards.

90
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,790
And the wound on the belly

91
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,390
was cut from left to right.

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,950
The lethal injury was

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,950
an upward stab.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,160
What are you doing?

95
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,390
Don’t take advantage of my sister.

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,110
Get up.

97
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Chill out.

98
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,200
I didn’t say your sister took advantage
of my brother.

99
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,550
Shoo!

100
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,510
Brother, I was being rude.

101
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,110
Brother, we’re trying to
make an inference

102
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,720
of how the person was murdered

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
and how the murderer acted.

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
I played the dead,
he played the murderer.

105
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,640
Somehow, something felt strange

106
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,160
in our inference.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
The wounds on the dead

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,350
are at the same altitude,

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
same side.

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,760
And judging from his height,

111
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,920
the murderer’s attacks

112
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,320
were so low as if he’s a child.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,120
But a child wouldn’t have the strength.

114
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,070
If the murderer was
kneeling or lying down,

115
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,670
that would make sense.

116
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
What sense?

117
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,550
Nonsense, in my opinion.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,790
It wasn’t a friendly match.

119
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,760
The murderer could just get up

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
and cut his throat, couldn’t he?

121
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,200
Why the extra steps?

122
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,600
He just wanted to take advantage of you.

123
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,200
You...

124
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,320
I couldn’t figure that out as well.

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,790
It’s not that he didn’t want to get up,

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,230
he couldn’t.

127
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,760
He couldn’t?

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Do you mean...

129
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,550
Sir Witch Doctor?

130
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,510
His leg is injured.

131
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,670
He can’t stand.

132
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,920
So you mean the suspect is...

133
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,640
Sir Witch Doctor?

134
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,230
No way. Why would he murder someone?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,950
Didn’t you see how they moved?

136
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,160
The eunuch wanted to kill him.

137
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,480
He fought the eunuch back

138
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,550
to keep himself alive.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,110
It wasn’t his fault.

140
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,950
No, Sir Witch Doctor
didn’t do it on purpose.

141
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,670
Hadn’t he killed the eunuch,

142
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,000
he would have been dead.

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,830
Yes.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
It was a justifiable homicide.

145
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,110
Why didn’t he go to law enforcement?

146
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,550
If he didn’t want others to know,

147
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,000
he could’ve buried the body.

148
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,390
Why would he spend so much effort

149
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,930
keeping the body well-preserved

150
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,770
and hide the murder weapon and

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,950
the body in the wall?

152
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,600
He did this because

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
he was trying to keep the evidence.

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,510
Keep the evidence?

155
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,070
The evidence of the murder he committed?

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,880
Chu Chu,

157
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,550
you said

158
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,790
you heard a ghost’s cry

159
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,070
in this house

160
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,880
on a random day when you were little,

161
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,670
then people said it was haunted.

162
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,110
Can you remember

163
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,350
when it started exactly?

164
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,110
I can’t.

165
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,200
I do.

166
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,110
My father and I

167
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,040
helped Sir Witch Doctor build the walls.

168
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,510
Right after the walls were built,
the house was haunted.

169
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
My father felt bad about it at the time.

170
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,950
He must have kept the evidence

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,830
for some reason.

172
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,350
But he didn’t want
other eunuchs to find it,

173
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,790
so he kept the body
and the murder weapon

174
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,760
in the wall.

175
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,920
Also, because it’s windy at night,

176
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,200
he made it a so-called haunted house.

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,790
A witch doctor’s business is related

178
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,670
to ghosts and spirits anyway.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Him living in a haunted house

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,710
makes sense to

181
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,470
common civilians.

182
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,150
The civilians fear but won’t doubt.

183
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,590
But Sir Witch Doctor never

184
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,320
mentioned that he had enemies.

185
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,280
We never saw anyone come to

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,200
seek revenge on him.

187
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,960
Should we go to law enforcement?

188
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
I’m a law enforcer.

189
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,670
Since the dead was eunuch,

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,670
the imperial palace
needs to investigate it.

191
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,640
Listen up, the three of you.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Without my permission,

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
none of you is allowed to tell

194
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
anyone about what happened tonight.

195
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,030
Especially you.

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,910
It’s late.

197
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,760
Let’s go.

198
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,110
Collect the evidence

199
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,470
and take it back.

200
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,280
Father.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,230
Chu Chu,

202
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,880
where were you
in the middle of the night?

203
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,030
I went to get some wine,

204
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,440
you were all gone when I came back.

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,110
I wanted to go out to find you.

206
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,000
I’m a bad drinker,

207
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,400
I wanted some fresh air,

208
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,840
so I asked them out for a walk with me.

209
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,150
Sorry.

210
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,520
It was inconsiderate of me.

211
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,350
No, no. I’m glad you’re OK.

212
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,710
Where is Chu He

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,910
and the general?

214
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,470
My brother took General Xiao
for a walk at the back.

215
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,440
They’ll soon be back.

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
They haven’t gone to the hill, have you?

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
It’s been raining on and off these days,

218
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,910
they mustn’t go to hill.

219
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,910
No, they haven’t.

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,790
Father, don’t worry.

221
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,000
They’ll soon be back.

222
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,400
Uh, is the table cleaned up?

223
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,350
No.

224
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,760
Let’s go clean up the table

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,760
and go to bed afterwards.

226
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,110
Please rest early.

227
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,110
Your Highness.

228
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:34,910
Follow me.

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes.

230
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,440
Quickly, this way.

231
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,320
Put him in it.

232
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,790
The coffin hasn’t been here for years.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,710
No one claims it.

234
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,230
You keep on the watch here.

235
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,760
Yes.

236
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,380
(Archive)

237
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,790
Chu He,

238
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,200
where were you and General Xiao

239
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,470
in the middle of the night?

240
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,520
Father, do you remember the wall

241
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,760
that you helped the witch doctor
build in the summer?

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,670
Yes.

243
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,590
He said the walls were too old

244
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
and that he was afraid that they’d
collapse in the rainy season.

245
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,470
I heightened and thickened

246
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,520
the walls in accordance
with his requirements.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Why are you asking me this?

248
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,440
Father,

249
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,200
the witch doctor killed someone,

250
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,320
and hid the body in the wall.

251
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,910
What?

252
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,820
Shush!

253
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,760
The officer in charge of criminal cases

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,710
from Chang’an found it out.

255
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,470
I thought he was a phony,

256
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,710
so I wanted to humble him

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,350
with the haunted house,

258
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,000
but he actually figured it out.

259
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,550
The ghost is in the wall.

260
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,960
The officer also said that

261
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,590
it mustn’t be leaked

262
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,840
and that the leaker would be punished.

263
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,710
Why are you telling me this, then?

264
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,640
You serve in the Yamen,

265
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,710
how can you make this mistake?

266
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,150
Because I haven’t been clear

267
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,110
about his true identity.

268
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,520
What if he’s fooling us around?

269
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,910
If Lord Zheng knows

270
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,790
and blames it on us,

271
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,550
what do we do, then?

272
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,710
We’re the coroners of Guanling County.

273
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,710
It isn’t a small thing.
Don’t mess around.

274
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,320
I’ll pry for information
from the Yamen tomorrow.

275
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,590
Let’s find out who the officer is first.

276
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,710
It doesn’t matter if he’s from Chang’an,

277
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,910
or he’s in charge criminal cases,

278
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
he’s the real deal.

279
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,910
I feel like

280
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,790
he’s insightful.

281
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,710
He can’t stay in our house for long.

282
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,000
Is he suspicious of Chu Chu?

283
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,280
I don’t know.

284
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,150
But she told me that

285
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,110
the officer would

286
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,640
personally investigate her identity.

287
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,640
If he found it out,

288
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,760
Chu Chu’s life would be over.

289
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,030
How about this?

290
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I’ll take her away.

291
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,710
Nonsense. Where are you taking her to?

292
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,000
If you take her away now,

293
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,320
you’re telling him that

294
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
there’s something wrong with Chu Chu.

295
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,790
I’ll break your leg

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
if you mess around.

297
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,280
Go to work.

298
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,030
Now.

299
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
Your Highness, General Xiao.

300
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,110
My house can’t compete with
those in Chang’an,

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,710
but all the bedding is new,

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,230
and the table and chairs are cleaned up.

303
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,470
Don’t worry,

304
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,400
they’re all clean.

305
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,520
Brother, I’d like to speak to
Chu Chu in private.

306
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,520
I’ll excuse myself, then.

307
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,960
Your Highness, your brother is so nice.

308
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
He listens to everything that you say.

309
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,350
He thinks everything
that you do is right.

310
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,110
No, he doesn’t take orders from me,

311
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,030
I’ve just been spoiled
by him since I was little.

312
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,710
My brother spoils me, too.

313
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,760
But he thinks everything
that I say is nonsense,

314
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,960
and everything that I do
is messing-around.

315
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,760
The witch doctor encourages you,

316
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,760
doesn’t he?

317
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,760
Why do you bring him up again?

318
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,590
Are you going to ask more questions
about the case?

319
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,110
Chu Chu, what we discovered tonight
matters a lot.

320
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,760
It’s come to this far,

321
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,440
won’t you tell me the truth?

322
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,790
Your Highness, you have questions
about Sir Witch Doctor, right?

323
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,550
I’ve told you the truth.

324
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,590
Sir Witch Doctor is a good man.

325
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,550
I really don’t know
where he is right now.

326
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,840
You know I’m not talking about that.

327
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Your pendant

328
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,840
was handmade by my father.

329
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,880
The pendants

330
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
are the tokens of love
between my father and mother.

331
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,520
This is my mother’s.

332
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,790
It pairs with the one in your hand.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,350
When I first saw the pendant,

334
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,760
I knew that

335
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,840
you had clues about my father,

336
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,440
this is the only lead
for me to find him.

337
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Chu Chu, can you tell me

338
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,550
where you got the pendant?

339
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,910
So it is the pendant

340
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,150
that you care about.

341
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,110
Your Highness,

342
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,710
there has never been
a second test, right?

343
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,150
You never wanted to hire me.

344
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,470
You keep me at your side because

345
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
you’re investigating the pendant, right?

346
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,760
You never thought of
me the best coroner.

347
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
The purpose of your
praises and compliments

348
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,000
is this pendant, right?

349
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,920
Chu Chu.

350
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,590
You can seize and interrogate me.

351
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,400
Don’t coax me like this.

352
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,520
No.

353
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,400
What’s wrong, Jinyu?

354
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,070
Let’s count the days.

355
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,520
It was four years after the rebellion
of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

356
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,520
that the eunuch showed up.

357
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,950
What happened back then
couldn’t be that simple.

358
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,800
Our father didn’t
return to the capital city,

359
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,520
didn’t contact Chang’an,

360
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,560
didn’t contact the imperial garrison
in the southwest.

361
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,430
This matter must be one of the reasons.

362
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,070
I know that.

363
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,590
I mean...

364
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,520
What’s wrong with Miss Chu?

365
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,430
Up all night? What have you been doing?

366
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,950
Looking for the tomb of
Chu Chu’s biological mother.

367
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,760
Looking for the tomb?

368
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
Both His Highness and I think

369
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,430
that the tomb of
Chu Chu’s biological mother

370
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,190
is among the tombs that Chu Family
often pays respects to.

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,710
But Chu Family pays respects to

372
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,000
every dead one that
they examined or encoffined.

373
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,830
All my night has been

374
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,710
spent on that.

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Have you found anything?

376
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,280
No.

377
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,560
Eat something first, then.

378
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,000
You drunk so much last night,

379
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,230
you should eat something for breakfast.

380
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,350
What are these? Are these just for me?

381
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,560
What’s your problem?

382
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,000
Are you going to eat them or what?

383
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,160
I’ll take them away.

384
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,680
I will.

385
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,630
Your Highness says

386
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,390
you aren’t allowed to eat while
reviewing the case records.

387
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,440
Are you challenging me?

388
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,910
Fine. I’ll go tell His Highness.

389
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,740
(January 9, the tenth year of Taihe reign)

390
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,760
Wait.

391
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,110
No.

392
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,310
Out of my way!

393
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,430
Greetings, Your Grace.

394
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,710
What are you doing here?

395
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,430
Your Grace,

396
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,110
His Majesty knows it’s the death
anniversary of the Prince Consort

397
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,880
and ordered me to pay respects.

398
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,590
Ma, put the offerings on the table.

399
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,160
Yes.

400
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,800
Who dares to take a step further!

401
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,430
Your Grace, years have passed.

402
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,040
Are you still holding a grudge

403
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,110
because I didn’t take the Prince
Consort back?

404
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,160
Grudge?

405
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,950
Eunuch Qin,

406
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,000
stop thinking highly of yourself.

407
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,190
You don’t deserve my grudge.

408
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,430
How magnanimous of you.

409
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,590
Had I done a good job at the time,

410
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,430
Commandery Prince An wouldn’t

411
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,800
need to go to the southwest,

412
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,190
where rebellions often break out.

413
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Commandery Prince An travels lightly,

414
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,710
I’ve been worrying about him.

415
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Listen,

416
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,830
if you dare touch my son,

417
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,560
I’ll make sure you die horribly.

418
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,950
Come on,

419
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,160
what are you talking about, Your Grace?

420
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,350
I spend all my time

421
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,560
serving His Majesty in the palace,

422
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,470
how is it possible

423
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,950
for me to touch Commandery Prince An?

424
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,160
Rubbish!

425
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,520
Uh,

426
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,190
what?

427
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,230
Hasn’t Commandery Prince An

428
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,680
sent his regard to you after he left
the capital city for a month?

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,710
Eunuch Qin.

430
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,760
Your Grace.

431
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
Lord Xue.

432
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,110
What? Are you here to pay respects to
the Prince Consort as well?

433
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,190
I’m here on behalf of His Majesty.

434
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,160
However, Her Grace doesn’t seem
to appreciate His Majesty’s concerns.

435
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
How strange.

436
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,800
I, too, was ordered to pay respects

437
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,950
on behalf of His Majesty.

438
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,560
He ordered me to take
four fruits of the season

439
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,710
to put before the memorial tablet.

440
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,070
Since His Majesty has ordered you here,

441
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,000
why did he ask me to do the same?

442
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,400
Uh, uh...

443
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,160
I guess His Majesty must have forgotten
that he sent me.

444
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,310
Since you reject the goodwill,

445
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,590
I’ll have to go back
and tell His Majesty so.

446
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,640
See you. See you.

447
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,800
Come. Back to the palace.

448
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,160
See you.

449
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,590
Lord Xue.

450
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,400
Congratulations on your promotion
to Minister of War.

451
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,590
You won’t have to speak behind the
folding screen

452
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,920
in Jiangshan Hall.

453
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,830
Congratulations. Congratulations.

454
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,520
Let’s go.

455
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,590
Quickly.

456
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,190
Your Grace, His Majesty
asked me to bring these.

457
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,950
I thank His Majesty’s concerns.

458
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,440
I haven’t congratulated you

459
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,640
on your promotion yet.

460
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Don’t tease me, Your Grace.

461
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,800
I’m incompetent.

462
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,950
I undertake

463
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,520
the responsibility with great humility.

464
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,590
I fear that I might not
live up to His Majesty’s trust.

465
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,680
Senior Jing said a long time ago that

466
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,640
you were a man of great talent.

467
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,160
You don’t pursue fame,

468
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,830
but have greatness in heart.

469
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,160
You will be given a peerage in no time.

470
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,190
You overrate me, Your Grace.

471
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,710
Master, you’re back.

472
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,230
Piss off.

473
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,040
What happened...

474
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,470
Bastard! Bastard!

475
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,800
You...

476
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,680
Why do you bring the food for the dead

477
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,950
into the room?!

478
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,640
Toss it out to feed the dog!
Feed the dogs!

479
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,950
Idiots!

480
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,000
Out! Out! Quickly!

481
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes, yes.

482
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Out!

483
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,520
Master, did the widow upset you again?

484
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,830
Calm down. Watch your health.

485
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,400
Xue Rucheng

486
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,400
has Jing Zhi and the Xiaos
backing him up.

487
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,830
He becomes overweening

488
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,350
right after being promoted
to Minister of War.

489
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,430
Who does he think he is?

490
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
A poor and pedantic scholar who
crawled into the imperial palace

491
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,190
dares to mess with me?

492
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
A disgrace!

493
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,000
A disgrace!

494
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,230
Master, calm down.

495
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,760
Even if he’s in charge of
ten ministries,

496
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,310
he’s still a pathetic scholar.

497
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,160
If he disgusts you,

498
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,430
just say the word,

499
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,830
I’ll find someone and

500
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,590
make sure he disappears
before tomorrow sunrise.

501
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,230
You...

502
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,880
You promised me the
disappearance of many people!

503
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,920
Answer me,

504
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
it’s been so long,

505
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,950
what has Xu Rugui accomplished?

506
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,160
Where’s the head of Xiao Jinyu?

507
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,470
What about the female coroner?

508
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,310
Master,

509
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,520
when Xu Rugui ambushed Xiao Jinyu
in Qianzhou,

510
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,070
Xiao Jinyu happened to lead

511
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,000
Qianzhou garrison there.

512
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,190
The ambush failed

513
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,640
and Xu Rugui lost half of his men.

514
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,190
He’s useless!

515
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,310
Master, please don’t be mad.

516
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,950
Xu Rugui has now made
his new ambush plan,

517
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,680
which is a guarantee of success.

518
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,230
When the good news comes back,

519
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,350
you’ll be the first to know.

520
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,920
You know what? It feels quite strange.

521
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,800
The wood itself isn’t scary,

522
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
but once it’s made into a coffin,

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,950
it becomes pretty creepy.

524
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,110
When the arms and legs on a human,

525
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,000
they aren’t creepy.

526
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,920
When they’re amputated,
they become creepy.

527
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,760
You shouldn’t say this around all
these coffins.

528
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,920
The good thing is,

529
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,800
the coffins are all empty.

530
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,920
Empty?

531
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,280
This one isn’t.

532
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,920
Don’t try to scare me.

533
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,350
No coffin-maker would

534
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,000
put a dead body to try the coffin out.

535
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,110
From my years of experience,

536
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,400
the coffin must have been

537
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,760
used as a storage box.

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,710
Don’t believe me? Let’s have a look.

539
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
What is it? So well covered.

540
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,470
Don’t touch it!

541
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,640
Stop howling.

542
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,190
You’ve seen corpses before.

543
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,800
What’s wrong with those Chu people?

544
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,190
Why did you put a dead body in it?

545
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,920
Where should a dead body be
if it isn’t in a coffin?

546
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,400
Watch your hand!

547
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,680
Chu Family didn’t put it in the coffin,

548
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,710
I did.

549
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,070
You did?

550
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,920
This is an important piece of evidence.

551
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,310
You figure a way to bring it

552
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,760
back to the Yamen later.

553
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,920
Speak. What’s the matter?

554
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,430
I got Chu Chu’s background.

555
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,400
What?

556
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,310
This is what I found yesterday

557
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,590
in the archive.

558
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,190
A suicide case in a large family.

559
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,430
The dead was the younger sister
of the master of Xu Family

560
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,800
in Guanling County,
who had been married.

561
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,800
His sister came to Guanling County,

562
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,350
seeking refuge under
him for some reason.

563
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,710
The brother and sister had a fight

564
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,190
and she then committed suicide.

565
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,470
Why does it have anything
to do with Chu Chu?

566
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,280
Check the date.

567
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,500
(January 9, the tenth year of Taihe reign)

568
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
January 9?

569
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,280
(January 9)

570
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,430
The case record says,

571
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Chu Ping collected Mrs. Xu’s body.

572
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,350
He buried her on the very night.

573
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,590
So,

574
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,560
Chu Ping took a body

575
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,710
on Chu Chu’s birthday.

576
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,880
Yes. In my opinion,

577
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,640
Chu Chu is the abandoned baby

578
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,590
that Chu Ping took in when he buried
Mrs. Xu.

579
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,560
Abandoned baby?

580
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,190
Your Highness, abandoned babies
are common

581
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,230
in the southwest.

582
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,000
The land is barren in the southwest,

583
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,040
and natural disasters often happen.

584
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,710
When the life becomes too difficult,

585
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,920
a family

586
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,000
throws away the youngest kid.

587
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Especially girls.

588
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,800
They are often
dumped at graveyards

589
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,920
and let fate make the decision.

590
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
If a kind-hearted visitor sees the baby,

591
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,150
they may take her home and raise her.

592
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,990
If not,

593
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,110
she’s just another dead body
in the graveyard.

594
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,710
Mrs. Xu should have been pregnant
when she killed herself.

595
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,950
Yes.

596
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,590
I wonder how serious

597
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,680
the fight between them was?

598
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
Why would a pregnant woman kill herself

599
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,590
by desperately hitting her head
on the wall?

600
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,190
Two lives!

601
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,680
How come the record is so brief?

602
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
What was Mrs. Xu’s full name?

603
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Who was her husband?

604
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,000
What did she and
her brother fight about?

605
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,160
None of these is recorded

606
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,070
when it got archived.

607
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,800
Last night, Zheng Youde told me that

608
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,920
the archive had a fire.

609
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,920
The old records were all burnt up.

610
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,590
These were re-recorded after the fire.

611
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,590
Does Chu Family pay respects to Mrs. Xu?

612
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,640
Yes.

613
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,680
Chu Family pays respects to anyone

614
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
that encoffined or examined.

615
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,590
Mrs. Xu was one of them.

616
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,920
Are you trying to...

617
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,160
You go back to the Yamen.

618
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,070
She’s rude.

619
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,430
Excuse me.

620
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,110
I’d like to ask you some questions.

621
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,710
Come in, please.

622
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,000
Mr. Chu,

623
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,470
this is the case record that

624
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,830
I asked my man to find in the Yamen.

625
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,230
The record says

626
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,600
you took care of

627
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,860
the dead body in this case.

628
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,040
Please have a look. Any impression?

629
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,100
(Mrs. Xu...)

630
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,250
So?

631
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,920
Yes.

632
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,790
The record is too brief.

633
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,710
Please recall the details

634
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,680
of that day for me.

635
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,310
According to the case record,

636
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,230
Mrs. Xu had been pregnant when she
hit the wall to kill herself.

637
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,560
Since you took care of her body,

638
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,400
you should know

639
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,590
how many months she had been pregnant.

640
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,190
More than 8 months.

641
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,230
Nearly 9 months.

642
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
So she was near the time of labor.

643
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:26,920
Yes.

644
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,950
Why do you ask this?

645
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
She’s been dead for many years.

646
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,350
Chu He.

647
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,590
Yes, Mrs. Xu has been
dead for many years,

648
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,400
what about the baby in her?

649
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,160
To be honest,

650
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,680
when the first I met
Chu Chu in Chang’an,

651
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,710
I admired her skills

652
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,520
and wished to hire her,

653
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
so I asked my men to
investigate her background.

654
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,160
I didn’t understand

655
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,470
what her birth is

656
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,430
so that the family that raised her

657
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,160
would rather let her be slandered

658
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,610
by a bastard

659
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,180
than defend her with the truth.

660
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,400
Now that I’ve

661
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,710
seen the case record,

662
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,430
I finally understand
poignancy behind it.

663
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,350
Chu Chu isn’t a bastard,

664
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,070
nor is she an abandoned baby
rescued at the graveyard.

665
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,950
She is the baby that you saved

666
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,110
from Mrs. Xu’s dead body.

667
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,230
The folks call them

668
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,710
coffin babies.

669
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,500
Chu Chu.

670
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,560
Chu Chu, don’t listen to him.

671
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,950
He’s made it up.

672
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,800
It’s not true.

673
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,310
Chu Chu, follow me out.

674
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,040
Enough.

675
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
We’ve been hiding the truth from her,

676
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,590
but we can’t lie to her.

677
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,230
Chu Chu, you’ve grown up.

678
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,110
I need to tell you something.

679
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
My lord,

680
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,350
she isn’t my son’s biological daughter.

681
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,710
But my son saved her and took her back.

682
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,880
Since she was taken to our family,

683
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,520
I saw her as my granddaughter since.

684
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,310
Father, I did it.

685
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,950
Let me speak.

686
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,430
My lord.

687
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,350
Father.

688
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,520
In the evening, January 9,

689
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,830
an officer from the Yamen

690
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,350
asked me to collect a body at Xu Family.

691
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,950
The officer said

692
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,830
the county magistrate had known
her cause of death

693
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,280
(Xu Family)
and that I didn’t need to conduct an autopsy.

694
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,590
Mr. Xu’s sister killed herself
by hitting her head against the wall.

695
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,710
It was still new year period,

696
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,760
Xu Family thought it was ominous,

697
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,230
and paid me to take away the body.

698
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,830
I didn’t think too much

699
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,920
because Mrs. Xu did have an obvious
bruise on her forehead.

700
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,150
Xu Family was cold-hearted,

701
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,630
they just rolled her
body in a straw mat.

702
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,080
I thought it was heartless,

703
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,430
so I wanted to get her a proper coffin.

704
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,910
But something unexpected happened...

705
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,560
What’s the matter?

706
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,040
Why are you holding a baby?

707
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,150
Father, look.

708
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,600
Father, she just died.

709
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,670
She was about to give birth.

710
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,520
I thought this baby...

711
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,870
I thought this baby could be saved,

712
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,870
so I gave it a try.

713
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
And I did save her life.

714
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,560
It’s an infant girl.

715
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,280
Her life is strong.

716
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,600
I’m sure she’ll have good fortune.

717
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,910
Who was she?

718
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Xu Zongfang’s sister.

719
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,120
I heard that her husband’s entire family

720
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,840
was disastrously dead.

721
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,280
so she went to seek refuge
under her brother.

722
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,710
But she wasn’t welcomed by
her brother and his wife.

723
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,230
The butler paid me twenty coppers

724
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,950
to take the body away

725
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,870
and bury her at a random spot.

726
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,520
How about I send them a message

727
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,470
and ask them to take the baby home?

728
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,390
What message? Take her home?

729
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,840
A dead woman

730
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,800
gave birth to a baby in the coffin room

731
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,870
in a coroner’s house,

732
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
who would take the baby?

733
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,390
You’re right.

735
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,320
It’s January 9, Father.

736
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,190
It’s the Jade Emperor’s birthday.

737
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,710
The baby has survived.

738
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,670
Maybe she got God’s blessing.

739
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,280
How about we keep her in our home,

740
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,600
and after the Lantern Festival,

741
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,560
when the new year is over,

742
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,120
I’ll speak to Xu Family.

743
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,230
After all,

744
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,710
she’s a half Xu.

745
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,600
Also, Xu Family is rich,

746
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,390
They have enough food.

747
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,390
They can raise the baby.

748
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,430
She’s a poor soul.

749
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,150
OK, OK.

750
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,520
We buried Mrs. Xu’s body

751
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
and after the Lantern Festival,

752
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,430
I visited Xu Family.

753
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,390
I then knew that the entire family had
escaped from trouble.

754
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,190
I didn’t want the baby

755
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,040
to be involved.

756
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,040
I didn’t know what trouble
they got themselves into,

757
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,870
but even Mr. Xu had to

758
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,630
escape from it,

759
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,280
a newborn baby surely needed to be
kept away from it.

760
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,560
So I didn’t tell anyone about her.

761
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,710
After all, the baby did nothing wrong.

762
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,560
So I brought her up as my own daughter.

763
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,560
I’ve heard all kinds of rumors.

764
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,800
Some say

765
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
she’s a bastard that
my mistress and I had.

766
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,710
Some say

767
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,760
I picked her up in the graveyard.

768
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,560
But like you said, my lord,

769
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,710
it’s better than letting people

770
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,330
know a dead woman

771
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,280
gave birth to her,

772
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,360
a coffin baby.

773
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,870
My lord, Mrs. Xu is dead.

774
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,760
She doesn’t exist in this world anymore.

775
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,800
Chu Chu was born after her death.

776
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,190
She has nothing to do with Mrs.Xu.

777
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,320
My lord.

778
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Sir, please don’t.

779
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,150
If you convict us of hiding the truth,

780
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,870
we plead guilty.

781
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,760
But Chu Chu has nothing to do

782
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,320
with what Xu Family had done.

783
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,520
Don’t blame anything

784
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,150
on Chu Chu.

785
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,190
The pendant.

786
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,470
He’s after the pendant.

787
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,710
Chu Family did nothing.

788
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,840
It’s my fault.

789
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,600
Don’t punish them.

790
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,560
You investigated my background

791
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,560
and want to punish Chu Family

792
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,520
is because you want to know more
about the pendant.

793
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,840
Whatever you want to know, ask me.

794
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,950
But please,

795
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,910
don’t punish Chu Family.

796
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,000
Please!

797
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,230
Is this your trust in me?

798
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,000
Please!

799
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,470
