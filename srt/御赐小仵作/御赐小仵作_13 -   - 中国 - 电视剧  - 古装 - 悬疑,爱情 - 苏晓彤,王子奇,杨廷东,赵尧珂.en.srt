1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,150
In His Highness’s heart,

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,760
am I only a tool

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,070
to look for Sir Witch Doctor?

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,560
(The ninth day of the tenth month)
From Chang’an to Qianzhou,

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,520
did he pay attention to me,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,250
simply for this pendant?

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,700
He investigated my family background

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,450
and threatened me with my families.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,330
What do I mean

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,080
to him?

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,790
The pendant is quite important.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,080
I have to check on it.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,470
But anyway,

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,840
I feel sorry for her.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,110
Maybe this is where
we have to leave each other.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,850
My Lord, it just rained.

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,630
But you came out so hurriedly?

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,240
Why don’t you go until it clears up?

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,010
I haven’t made dealings

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,270
with Commandery Prince An before.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,430
But considering

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,880
how he deals with criminal cases
of different states,

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,190
he certainly knows everything very well

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,300
before making any decision.

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,880
This time, he asked me

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,160
to handle the illegal coining case.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
I feel quite agitated.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,580
Qianzhou is within your jurisdiction.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,820
Commandery Prince An can’t work well
when he first came to a strange place.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,770
It makes sense

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,980
when he asked you
to take care of the case.

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,880
You have no idea.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,870
Xiao Jinyu never plays by the rules.

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,190
What shall we do, then?

35
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,590
Let’s get back to Yamen first.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,980
=The Imperial Coroner=

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,980
=Episode 13=

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,800
Look carefully and keep it in mind!

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Isn’t he Shen Yu,

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,720
the new Capital Liaison Representative
of Qianzhou?

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,440
I’m telling you.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Keep a close eye on him
as soon as he arrives in the capital.

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,950
Pay special attention
to whomever he contacts.

44
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,130
Yes.

45
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,950
Sun Mingde.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,390
Here.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Go check the sheet again.

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,780
Sheet? Of Rugui House?

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,650
What shall I check?

50
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,930
Anything about the Southwest

51
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,270
and Qianzhou.

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,780
Master, why do you suddenly want that?

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,490
Ask no questions!

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,960
I still feel something fishy.

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,550
Keep a close eye

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,710
on Princess Xiping’s Mansion,
Xue’s Mansion, Jing’s Mansion

57
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,750
and Three Judicial Offices.

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,470
Yes.

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,750
As for Xiao Heng...

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,470
When I say he’s dead,

61
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,470
he’s completely dead!

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,010
Yes.

63
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,550
Yes.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,580
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

65
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,850
Jinyu and Jinli are still young.

66
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,760
I don’t want them to be famous,

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
but to be always safe.

68
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,440
Unexpectedly, the court is
quite changeable.

69
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,880
When I’m out of the court,

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,750
I can hardly defend them.

71
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,520
Sir, hope you can help them.

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Don’t flatter me, Your Grace.

73
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,600
I’ll spare no effort

74
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,550
to pay you back.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
I have some confusion.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Could you enlighten me?

77
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,800
Be free to ask me, Your Grace.

78
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,110
You’re now the Minister of War.

79
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Have you heard of anything
from the Southwest Army

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,830
The Southwest Army?

81
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,030
You mean General Leng in Qianzhongdao?

82
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,910
I...

83
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,720
I haven’t heard of anything
about the Southwest.

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,830
Your Grace,

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,640
what kind of info do you want?

86
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,920
Anything unusual.

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,510
Unusual?

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
This is very serious.

89
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,550
Please pay attention
in the Ministry of War.

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,070
I understand your concern.

91
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,200
Rest assured.

92
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,000
I’ll try to get enough information.

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,110
Grandfather, it’s all my fault.

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,130
I got our family in trouble.

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,920
What are you talking about, Chu Chu?

97
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,600
It’s our destiny

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,160
to meet your mother.

99
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,320
It means you’re destined

100
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,880
to be one of our family.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
This is our fate, too.

102
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,980
What exactly happened?

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,290
Tell me about it.

104
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,270
I won’t let anyone bully you!

105
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,390
No, Grandfather.

106
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,670
He... he isn’t an ordinary official.

107
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,670
He’s Commandery Prince An.

108
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,160
Commandery Prince An?

109
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,200
You mean Commandery Prince An

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
who takes care of Three Judicial Offices
and all criminal cases?

111
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,790
Commandery Prince An...

112
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,510
I was too heady.

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
He’s such an important official

114
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,000
that even Minister of Justice
and Vice Minister

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
of the Court of Judicial Review
take orders from him.

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,230
But I annoyed him so greatly.

117
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,350
It was my fault.

118
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,040
Chu Chu, I’ll go beg him.

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,270
If he feels unhappy,

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
I’ll ask him to punish me!

121
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,510
Grandfather,

122
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,270
Father, Brother.

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,270
You raised me up.

124
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,760
Over the past years,

125
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,440
you’ve been protecting me.

126
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,760
For me, you lived with anxiety

127
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,440
and were gossiped about.

128
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
I’ve grown up now.

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,350
I should take responsibility
for what I did.

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,270
This time, I’ll protect our family!

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,240
Miss Chu, Jinyu asked to see you.

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,320
Don’t be scared. I’ll go with you!

133
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,830
Jinyu wants to see her alone.

134
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,900
This is my family!

135
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,480
Chu He!

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,230
Brother, don’t worry.

137
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,920
I’ll handle that.

138
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

139
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,950
Raise your head.

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,070
Look at me.

141
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,950
Today,

142
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,950
I made clear
about your family background.

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,270
Considering your performance
in the Coroner Qualification Test,

144
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,440
you can have the certificate of coroner.

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
Relevant paper will be issued
in a couple of days.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,550
Certificate of coroner?

147
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,920
I lied a few times to you.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
But about this,

149
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,720
I’m not lying.

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,550
You’re indeed a great coroner.

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,020
When I first met you in the Test,

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,290
I wanted to hire you.

153
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,160
But Chu Chu,

154
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,110
an official like me

155
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,200
must be very cautious.

156
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,090
Every decision I make

157
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,950
concerns the safety of people around me.

158
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,350
So, I can’t make a choice,
depending on my likes or dislikes.

159
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,200
There’s a lot about you
that confuses me.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,440
It doesn’t mean I don’t trust you.

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
But I have to be very cautious.

162
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,040
If I want to keep you with me,

163
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,830
I must know everything about you,

164
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,440
for their good,

165
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,110
and also for your own good.

166
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,200
For my own good?

167
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,070
Jinyu is really alright?

168
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,570
He is.

169
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,620
He was just exhausted

170
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,770
and then annoyed.

171
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,720
He simply needs some good rest.

172
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,380
Wasn’t he doing all right just now?

173
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,510
Who annoyed him so greatly?

174
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,880
He...

175
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,070
It’s a long story.

176
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Come on. Can you really treat him?

177
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,910
He felt sick all the way he came.

178
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,770
Shall I get a doctor from the town

179
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,470
and check on him?

180
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,670
He’s alright. Don’t mess about.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Just ask him to have more rest.

182
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,690
But I’m still worried.

183
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,260
Why is he so weak?

184
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,200
He even spat out blood out of anger.

185
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,550
Think about it.

186
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,080
What food should I feed him?

187
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,080
Just stay and take good care of him.

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,670
But...

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,030
What shall I feed him for nutrition?

190
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,670
People think
I consider everything very carefully.

191
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
In fact, I simply know a bit more

192
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,320
before I make any decision.

193
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,520
The more I knew,

194
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,520
the better my plan will work.

195
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I still haven’t known

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,470
what the man behind it wants.

197
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,870
You also hide a lot from me,

198
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,000
instead of telling me the truth.

199
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,570
I couldn’t stop worrying on my way

200
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,350
and I couldn’t even sleep,

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,210
in case I have an imperfect plan,

202
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,590
make a mistake,

203
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,180
and then get you in irreparable trouble,

204
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,110
simply because
I don’t know enough about you.

205
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,840
Everyone has his secrets.

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,010
I don’t blame you

207
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,760
when you refuse to tell me.

208
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,230
But I must figure everything out

209
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,960
in other ways.

210
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,770
I know what I did

211
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,790
would make you unhappy.

212
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,790
But compared to your safety,

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,840
I prefer...

214
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,790
I prefer to make you hate me.

215
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,590
No, I don’t hate you.

216
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,350
You think

217
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,150
I threaten you with your family.

218
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,000
Aren’t you hating me already?

219
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,280
You don’t trust me anymore.

220
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,570
If I force you to work for me,

221
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,170
it’ll do nothing good to us.

222
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,570
I’ll sign the paper

223
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,000
to prove you as a coroner.

224
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,110
I can recommend you,

225
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,760
no matter where you want to work.

226
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,470
You’re wrong, Your Highness.

227
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,150
I don’t hate you. I just...

228
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,910
Your Highness, you’re perfect.

229
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,840
You’re smart and upright.

230
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,850
Especially when you solve a case,

231
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,490
you’re almost shining,

232
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,880
like the sun.

233
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,550
Such a good man like you
treats me so nicely.

234
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,110
Except the Chu Family,

235
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,110
no one has been so nice to me before.

236
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
I’m just scared.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,670
What if it’s an illusion?

238
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,670
Chu Chu, I’m nice to you,

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,110
because you’re worth it.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,930
Your Highness, I’m not going anywhere.

241
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,080
I want to work for you.

242
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,790
Let me take the test again.

243
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,200
I’ll work hard.

244
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,500
I’ll trust you

245
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,850
and I won’t annoy you again.

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,590
Don’t bother.

247
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,910
Your Highness.

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,030
Don’t bother to take another test.

249
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,140
Really?

250
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,110
When you agree to work for me,

251
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,110
that’s exactly what I want.

252
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,530
Don’t trust me again?

253
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,960
I do. I trust you.

254
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,740
I’ll work hard

255
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,550
and become the world’s best coroner.

256
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,670
So, you’ll no longer

257
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,230
punish my family?

258
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,490
Stand up.

259
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Do something for me.

260
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,400
After you make it,

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840
I’ll let them go.

262
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,980
What is it, Your Highness?

263
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,840
I’ll make it.

264
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,760
I want some chicken soup.

265
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,850
Don’t make it oily.

266
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,200
No blood foam.

267
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,250
No grease.

268
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,330
It should taste strong, but also light.

269
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,090
Can you do that?

270
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,590
Yes. I’m going right away.

271
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,550
Brother.

272
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,590
Chu Chu,

273
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
are we really safe now?

274
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,730
I was so stupid

275
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,160
that I misunderstood His Highness.

276
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,110
Luckily, he forgave me.

277
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,760
When I can work for him,

278
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,910
our family will be safe.

279
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,660
That’s great.

280
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,030
I feel like I was in a dream.

281
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,200
Have you made up your mind

282
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,350
to work for him ever after?

283
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,400
After...

284
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,000
After going back to Chang’an with him,

285
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,760
will you not come back again?

286
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,760
I will.

287
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,440
This is my home.

288
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,910
Why will I never come back again?

289
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,030
Brother, this is forever my home.

290
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,200
I’ll look after Grandfather and Father,
together with you.

291
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,960
I’ll also work hard as a coroner.

292
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,790
I won’t ever humiliate our family.

293
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,560
What are you talking about?

294
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,520
-Nothing, Father.
-Father.

295
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,390
She’s making chicken soup.

296
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,470
Be quick. Be quick.

297
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,590
Miss Chu is an orphan?

298
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
What her families said

299
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,710
makes me think she’s poor,

300
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,200
but also lucky.

301
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,150
It’s said that everyone in this world

302
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,110
cares for nothing, but profit.

303
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,710
The Chu Family live such a poor life,

304
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,570
but they still raise up an orphan

305
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,030
who brings no profit to them.

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,230
Those rich families
where siblings fight for money

307
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,590
should be ashamed.

308
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,110
Only these kind men in the Chu Family

309
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,250
managed to cultivate Chu Chu

310
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,030
to be such an upright and brave girl.

311
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,230
Yeah.

312
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,590
But look at you.

313
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,710
When she annoyed you,

314
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,840
you could have scolded her.

315
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,910
Why were you so angry?

316
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,880
I don’t know, either.

317
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,670
What?

318
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,670
Now, I don’t think
I should have been so angry.

319
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,400
When I asked Jing Yi to check on her,

320
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,350
I knew

321
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,030
she would blame me.

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I expected that.

323
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
I shouldn’t have been so angry.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
I don’t know the reason, either.

325
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,440
Sorry for making you laugh.

326
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,710
You think I can still laugh?

327
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,400
I was nearly freaked out.

328
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,790
I think you’re exhausted.

329
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,790
Leng Yue said you needed some good rest.

330
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
Why don’t we live
in the government office?

331
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,910
The condition there is better
for your recovery.

332
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,730
I don’t know

333
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,670
how Jing Yi is doing with his mission.

334
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,550
Let’s not decide before asking him.

335
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,150
Haven’t found Xu Rugui yet?

336
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,700
Not yet.

337
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,590
Haven’t you got anything useful
from the men we captured?

338
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,400
They were simply ordered

339
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,320
to kill me

340
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,590
and kidnap Chu Chu.

341
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,790
They don’t know

342
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,520
why they must do that.

343
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,610
They also don’t know

344
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,090
who Xu Rugui exactly is.

345
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,550
Jinyu,

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,790
I wonder if I should say something now.

347
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,590
But...

348
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,560
Brother, if I even have to guess
what you try to say,

349
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,710
I’ll exhausted to death.

350
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,120
Don’t say that.

351
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,820
I mean

352
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,730
now that Miss Chu is straightforward

353
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,060
and there’s nothing fishy
with her background,

354
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,370
why doesn’t she tell us

355
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,400
about our father?

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,550
Come in.

357
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:30,910
Your Highness.

358
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,940
Take your time. I’ll leave you alone.

359
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,500
General Xiao, there’s much chicken soup
in the kitchen.

360
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,440
Why don’t you go have some?

361
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,350
All right.

362
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,500
After hiding Chu Chu’s secret

363
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,150
for so many years,

364
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,320
we finally told her.

365
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,440
I never expected

366
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,760
to tell her in this way.

367
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,200
Luckily, she understood.

368
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,100
Also, Commandery Prince An is sensible.

369
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,160
Everything will not change.

370
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,790
That’s great.

371
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,080
You’re wrong.

372
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,440
What did you say?

373
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,150
Father,

374
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,490
Chu Chu knew who she was.

375
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,580
Something will change.

376
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,840
She hasn’t thought about it carefully.

377
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,130
After she does,

378
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,760
she’ll look for her own father.

379
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,000
Didn’t I tell you?

380
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,620
Her father died

381
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,680
because his family suffered
from disaster,

382
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,320
and then her mother fled to our village.

383
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
What about other relatives?

384
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
Blood is thicker than water, anyway.

385
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
I can understand

386
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,880
if she wants to look for her relatives.

387
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,880
Father,

388
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,110
you saved her life.

389
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,710
If she really wants to leave
for other relatives,

390
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,710
do you want to let her go?

391
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
I don’t, so what?

392
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,160
I can’t stop her

393
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,710
from finding other relatives.

394
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,770
I adopted her,

395
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,590
because she was helpless and poor.

396
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,710
Over the past years,

397
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,710
I’ve never wanted anything from her.

398
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,880
I’ll be relieved

399
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,510
as long as she lives a good life.

400
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,310
Father, I don’t mean
I want anything from her.

401
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,310
I...

402
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,800
I have a way to satisfy both.

403
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,590
What is it?

404
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,680
Let me marry her.

405
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,380
Then she’ll be my wife.

406
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,740
Whether she wants her own family or not,

407
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,760
she’ll be one of our family.

408
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,350
Chu He,

409
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,490
do you know what you’re talking about?

410
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,000
No, Father.

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,200
Don’t get me wrong.

412
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,220
I don’t simply mean

413
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,440
keeping her to our family.

414
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
I really like her.

415
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,560
Since when?

416
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,760
I don’t know.

417
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,280
When I was little,

418
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,640
I knew she wasn’t my real sister.

419
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,680
I had pity on her

420
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,920
and took good care of her.

421
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,110
But a few days ago,

422
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,190
she went to Chang’an
for the Coroner Qualification Test.

423
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Your and Grandfather told her that

424
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,470
if female coroners were not accepted

425
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,950
in Chang’an,

426
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,920
just like other places,

427
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,570
she would come back

428
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,410
and marry someone who was nice to her.

429
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,520
At that time,

430
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,160
I thought

431
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
if only she would marry me!

432
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,160
Chu He, even if you like her,

433
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,680
she won’t marry you
unless she likes you, too.

434
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,830
I know.

435
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,520
Anyway,

436
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,180
I’ll take care of her forever.

437
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,070
General Xiao,

438
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,950
what do you need?

439
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,310
I come to get some chicken soup.

440
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,670
It’s being simmered.
Let me get some for you.

441
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,280
No.

442
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,730
I suddenly have something else to do.

443
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,280
Don’t bother.

444
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,190
That’s all we can do.

445
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,760
It’s been days

446
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,920
since Commandery Prince An
and Vice Minister Jing left the capital.

447
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,920
They have arrived in Qianzhou, I guess.

448
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,880
Senior Jing,

449
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,440
have you heard from them?

450
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,950
Not at all.

451
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,680
Minister Wang, you know the way

452
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,790
Commandery Prince An always behaves.

453
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,740
He’s very strict

454
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,230
in sending messages.

455
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,950
Since Jing Yi left the capital,

456
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,520
he hasn’t even sent
one single letter home.

457
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,340
You’re right.

458
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,490
Since His Highness found the murderer
who killed Yan Ming,

459
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,920
he’s been tightly encircling
Three Judicial Offices,

460
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,760
as if guarding against someone.

461
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,110
Senior Jing, everybody,

462
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,040
after Yan Ming died, I heard that

463
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,810
he had talked wildly

464
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,800
during the banquet,

465
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,260
saying he found the evidence that

466
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,040
Emperor Wuzong’s son,
Duke Chang was still alive.

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,760
Minister Xue,

468
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
didn’t you hear of that, too?

469
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,040
I heard about it.

470
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,620
But Yan Ming simply talked nonsense

471
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,350
after he was drunk.

472
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,860
As far as I know,

473
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,000
Yan Ming never talks nonsense.

474
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
If it’s true,

475
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Yan Ming must have been killed for that.

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,830
Minister Han,

477
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,760
you know more about his case.

478
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,560
What are you talking about?

479
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,950
How can I know more?

480
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,310
Commandery Prince An solved the case.

481
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,640
I simply know how much he said.

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,560
You heard him, too.

483
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,900
He said that

484
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,130
the murderer poisoned himself in prison
of the Court of Judicial Review.

485
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,350
But why was Yan Ming killed?

486
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,920
There wasn’t even an answer,

487
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,870
until His Highness left the capital.

488
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,930
This time,

489
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,230
he has gone to the Southwest

490
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,980
with light luggage and few attendants,

491
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,710
looking for his father
who was dead there.

492
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,520
Could he...

493
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,070
What?

494
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,680
Why don’t you understand, Minister Xue?

495
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,130
Qianzhou was

496
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,680
Duke Chang’s fief.

497
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,950
Master,

498
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,920
Wang Jun said that
Duke Chang was still alive.

499
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,160
Duke Chang?

500
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,230
That’s what he said.

501
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,230
Ridiculous!

502
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,860
How dare he say that!

503
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,040
To be honest, Master,

504
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,160
I’ve heard a lot about that
in the Palace

505
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,520
these days.

506
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,010
But I found it ridiculous

507
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,680
so that I didn’t tell you.

508
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,780
Our men out of the Palace

509
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,000
also brought us some news.

510
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,250
Xiao Jinyu’s Chief Guardsman Wu Jiang

511
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,520
has been surreptitious lately.

512
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,590
We can’t figure out
what he’s doing.

513
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,210
Does Xiao Jinyu

514
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,970
not close Yan Ming’s case,

515
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,830
because of Duke Chang?

516
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,810
You sound more ridiculous.

517
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,970
They’re risking their necks!

518
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,760
What the hell!

519
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,920
Duke Chang?

520
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,040
He’s been dead for so many years.

521
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,070
Why is he suddenly brought up again?

522
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,440
Go check in the Palace

523
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,800
and find out

524
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,110
who started such rumors.

525
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Go!

526
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,310
Did Xiao Jinyu go to Qianzhou

527
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
for another reason?

528
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,580
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

529
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,800
Your Highness, over the past years,

530
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,710
I haven’t had a mother.

531
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,830
Because of that,

532
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,760
a lot of people bullied me.

533
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,760
Now I know who my mother is,

534
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,560
though I can’t acquaint her.

535
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,350
But when I know where she is,

536
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,560
I feel quite relived

537
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
after being confused
for such a long time.

538
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

539
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,590
I know

540
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,950
you want to find your father.

541
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,090
I promised Sir Witch Doctor that

542
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,710
I wouldn’t tell anyone else about him.

543
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,800
But now that you’re his son,

544
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,710
you’re not anyone else.

545
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,000
You’re right.

546
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,970
It’s Sir Witch Doctor

547
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,350
who told me the stories

548
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,710
and gave me the pendant.

549
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,880
I have nothing valuable,

550
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,010
but this pendant.

551
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,590
I kept it for many years.

552
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,640
Now, I give it you

553
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
as a souvenir.

554
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,310
Souvenir? Why?

555
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,430
Sir Witch Doctor, you’re leaving?

556
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,830
Where are you going?

557
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,350
Where can I go?

558
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
I’m not going anywhere.

559
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,880
Keep it carefully.

560
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
I will keep it carefully.

561
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,920
Also, you must remember.

562
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,760
Do not...

563
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,910
I remember. I remember.

564
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,760
I won’t tell anyone about you.

565
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,710
He went missing five years ago.

566
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,830
This is what he left me.

567
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,560
It’s been five years

568
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,950
and I’ve been keeping this letter.

569
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,180
(To Chu Chu)

570
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,760
Sir Witch Doctor?

571
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,350
Where’s he?

572
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,760
I said I would come for the story.

573
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,060
(To Chu Chu)

574
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,040
Chu Chu, I’m going on a long trip
for some emergency.

575
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,350
I didn’t have time to bid farewell
face to face.

576
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,340
Then I leave you this letter.

577
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,710
Practice your skills carefully
and believe that

578
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,030
you can achieve anything with efforts.

579
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,520
You’ll become a coroner.

580
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,280
I had thought he would come back.

581
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,320
But he hasn’t come back yet.

582
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,920
When I was little,

583
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,130
I believed that
the Handsome Judge existed.

584
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,780
I want to bring him back.

585
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,830
I always think

586
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,800
when I bring him back,

587
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,760
I’ll know
where Sir Witch Doctor has gone.

588
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,110
Your Highness, this is all I know.

589
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,590
Thank you for telling me this.

590
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,190
Can you find him

591
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,000
with so little information?

592
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
I will find him.

593
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,710
I trust you.

594
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,230
Chu Chu.

595
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,710
Grandfather.

596
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,280
Your Highness,

597
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,750
thank you for sparing us.

598
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,650
We don’t know how to pay you back.

599
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,280
If you need any help,

600
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,290
we’ll help even at risk to our lives.

601
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,230
Thank you, sir.

602
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,350
Chu Chu,

603
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,800
I have something for you.

604
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,560
This is what your mother carried.

605
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,000
When I put her in the coffin,

606
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,040
I asked someone to get it

607
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,580
from your mother’s bun.

608
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,920
I had planned to give it to you
on your wedding,

609
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,110
as if it were your mother’s gift.

610
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,110
Now that you already knew,

611
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,000
I’d like to give it to you now.

612
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,310
Thank you, Grandfather.

613
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,710
May I have a look?

614
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,530
I don’t know much about your mother.

615
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,590
No one talked about her before.

616
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,280
I took a quick look at her

617
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,740
on the night

618
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,370
she was buried.

619
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,250
She looked pretty and fair-skinned.

620
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,160
Obviously, she was from a rich family,

621
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,400
but she looked a bit thinner.

622
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,160
I guess

623
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,230
she had suffered a lot

624
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,230
after her husband died.

625
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,760
Chu Chu, anyway,

626
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,670
she carried you for months

627
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,550
so that you came to this world.

628
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,080
Though she tried to suicide with you,

629
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,310
she must have been in great trouble.

630
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,590
Don’t hate her.

631
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,070
Don’t worry, Grandfather.

632
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,770
My mother came all the way here,
carrying me.

633
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,710
I’m sure she wanted to give birth to me.

634
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
No matter what happened,

635
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,720
she was my mother for months.

636
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,150
I didn’t know this before.

637
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,550
But now I do.

638
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,310
I’ll keep her in my mind carefully.

639
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,510
You’ve grown up, Chu Chu.

640
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,470
Don’t worry, Grandfather.

641
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,040
All right. All right.

642
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,190
Chu Chu.

643
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,930
Besides this hairpin,

644
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,970
is there anything else

645
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,800
from Chu Chu’s mother?

646
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,430
The Xu Family told us that

647
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,830
all her stuff had to be buried with her.

648
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,400
Your Highness, you find some clues?

649
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,920
No.

650
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,840
I was just asking.

651
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Don’t bother about it.

652
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,520
All right.

653
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,310
All right.

654
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,350
Your Highness,
are you drawing this hairpin?

655
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,350
Why?

656
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,670
It doesn’t look like something

657
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,120
from an ordinary family.

658
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,910
But I know very little

659
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,080
about girls’ stuff.

660
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,930
I’m drawing it

661
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,910
and then ask people in the capital
to check about it.

662
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,120
Maybe we’ll find some clues
about your parents.

663
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,670
About my parents?

664
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,390
Don’t you want to know
who your father is?

665
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,940
Don’t you want to know

666
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,120
what he had suffered

667
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,960
that made your mother
come all the way here?

668
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,170
My father died of disaster,

669
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,210
didn’t he?

670
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,050
Your Highness, what are you suspecting?

671
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,930
I simply feel a bit confused.

672
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,250
When you were born,

673
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,780
there wasn’t any natural disaster

674
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,620
in Jiannan

675
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,900
that could ruin a whole clan.

676
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,810
So, it couldn’t be a disaster

677
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,930
like flood or an earthquake.

678
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,500
It was more likely
to be a man-caused disaster.

679
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,930
Man-caused? What do you mean?

680
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,620
Calm down.

681
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,570
I’m simply guessing.

682
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,020
After we find out who your parents are,

683
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,210
we’ll know the truth.

684
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,100
Later,

685
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,100
go to the government office with me
to check the household register.

686
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,900
Now that the Xu Family is a big family,

687
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,980
there must be a detailed record.

688
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,020
We can easily check out
who your mother married.

689
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,370
If there’s something fishy

690
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,230
with your father’s death,

691
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,920
I’ll figure it out.

692
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

693
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,610
Now that
Sir Witch Doctor is your father,

694
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,610
do you know

695
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,010
where Six Gates is

696
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,550
and who the Handsome Judge is?

697
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,100
What?

698
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,350
Shortly after you work for me,

699
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,930
you want to go somewhere else

700
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,980
and find another job?

701
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
No, No.

702
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,590
I really want to work for you.

703
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,190
However good the Handsome Judge is,

704
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,470
he isn’t you.

705
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,730
He never said I was the best coroner.

706
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,140
He didn’t rush into the fire,

707
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,150
regardless of his own safety.

708
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,120
He didn’t make autopsy tools for me.

709
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,490
He didn’t live in my home

710
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,910
without any unwillingness

711
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,120
or treat my family like his own family

712
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,540
I know

713
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,790
this isn’t what a judge must do

714
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,080
for a coroner.

715
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
You did all this for me.

716
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
Looks like

717
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,470
I can’t let you play around
with Jing Yi or Leng Yue.

718
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,470
After so few days,

719
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
they’ve made you thick-skinned.

720
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,680
Anyway, I know you’re nice to me.

721
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,310
Very nice to me.

722
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,370
Your Highness, I won’t work
for anyone else,

723
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,430
unless you expel me!

724
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,430
Then why do you still want to find

725
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,830
Six Gates and the Handsome Judge?

726
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,830
I...

727
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,160
I’m simply curious to know that.

728
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,710
When I was little,

729
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,950
Sir Witch Doctor told me stories
about Six Gates.

730
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,560
If it weren’t for finding
the Handsome Judge

731
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,690
or being a coroner in Six Gates,

732
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,230
I wouldn’t have been brave enough
to go to Chang’an.

733
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,110
I wouldn’t have met you, either.

734
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,950
Also, you look so much
like the Handsome Judge.

735
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,520
But you’re right.

736
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,310
When I first heard his story,

737
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,920
I was six years old.

738
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,120
You were also a child then.

739
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,790
You can’t be the Handsome Judge.

740
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Even if Sir Witch Doctor is your father,

741
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,610
he wouldn’t know

742
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,390
what you would look like.

743
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
That’s odd.

744
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,920
It’s not odd.

745
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Just some coincidences.

746
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,680
Coincidences?

747
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,220
I read the notes you gave me carefully.

748
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
I had read about many stories

749
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,920
before that.

750
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,730
But when I read about them,

751
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,400
they were not legends,

752
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,370
but real recorded cases.

753
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:42,950
Really?

754
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,160
Who solved the cases, then?

755
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
He’s the Constable, isn’t he?

756
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,280
No.

757
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,640
My father solved the cases

758
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,410
when he served as a censor.

759
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,810
Then isn’t he the...

760
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,590
He isn’t.

761
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,200
I guess the Handsome Judge is a man

762
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,720
my father expected to exist

763
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,390
in this world.

764
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,910
What do you mean?

765
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,590
You asked me

766
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,630
why I knew what the Handsome Judge said.

767
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,590
I read about them in some old notes

768
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,630
my father left me.

769
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,040
The Ten-Commandment Hall was set up

770
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,450
according the record

771
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,430
in his note.

772
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,350
The Handsome Judge you admire...

773
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,830
I guess he’s the ideal judge

774
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,720
in my father’s heart

775
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,330
and he’s that kind of man

776
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,240
my father wants all judges to be.

777
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,000
That explains.

778
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,910
Sir Witch Doctor told me that

779
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,280
all stories in Six Gates were real,

780
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,070
but he never wanted me
to look for the Handsome Judge.

781
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,480
Your Highness, in my heart,

782
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,630
you’re the best judge

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,520
that other judges should imitate.

784
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,760
Keep the hairpin carefully.

785
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,940
(Jiangshan Hall)

786
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,630
What...?

787
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,950
Your Majesty, what happened?

788
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,740
What’s the time now?

789
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,280
Your Majesty, it’s nearly the midnight.

790
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,630
Time to go to bed.

791
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,570
Go get me some tea.

792
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,470
I’ll go to bed after completing this.

793
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

794
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,190
Master, what do you think happened?

795
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,150
Why was His Majesty so scared?

796
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,840
He was so scared

797
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,740
possibly because he heard that

798
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,360
Duke Chang might still be alive.

799
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,800
I thought His Majesty was wise.

800
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,840
At first,

801
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,060
almost everyone in the Palace thought

802
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,560
he was insane.

803
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,800
Even Eunuch Ma didn’t see him through,

804
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,040
and was kept in ignorance.

805
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,130
Only the late emperor thought

806
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,800
His Majesty was pretending to be insane.

807
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,360
He then tried every possible means

808
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,470
to kill His Majesty.

809
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,740
Unexpectedly,

810
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,190
His Majesty took the throne at last.

811
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,370
Everything

812
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,760
that the late emperor predicted

813
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,520
came true.

814
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,150
Did His Majesty dream that

815
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,640
the late emperor’s son Duke Chang
came back to life

816
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,320
and would take back the throne?
