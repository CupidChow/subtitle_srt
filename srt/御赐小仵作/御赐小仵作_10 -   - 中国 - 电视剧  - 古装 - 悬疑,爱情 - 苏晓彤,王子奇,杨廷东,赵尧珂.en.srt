1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,880
His Highness said
he likes beautiful girls.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,150
So, I...

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,070
Forget it.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,840
But he seems to like

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,150
the mirror I made.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,520
He said he could give me one more chance

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,120
and take me to Qianzhou with him.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,200
This time I must do my best.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,470
Manager Xu from Rugui House

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,790
ambushed us at the only way

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,950
to Qianzhou.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,470
What on earth is his identity?

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,270
Chu Chu.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,190
Leng Yue.

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,950
Jinyu, how is it?

16
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,750
(Xiao Jinli, Marquis Duyu)
Are you all right?

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,160
(Xiao Jinli, Marquis Duyu)
I’m fine.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,920
(Xiao Jinli, Marquis Duyu)
Are you hurt?

19
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,480
(Xiao Jinli, Marquis Duyu)
No.

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,910
Chu Chu.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,590
Help Leng Yue get in and rest.

22
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,910
Yes.

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,270
Do you come to the southwest

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,270
with so few men?

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,480
It’s too dangerous!

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,540
Thanks to you.

27
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,850
Upon getting the edict
the other day,

28
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,480
I went to Chang’an to receive you.

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,080
Right after leaving Guanling County,

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,800
we encountered you here.

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,300
Slowly.

32
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,000
They are dressed like bandits,

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,190
but their doing isn’t like bandits.

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,630
Who on earth are they?

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,420
The fugitives of Rugui House’s case.

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,020
I saw you hurt him just now.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,080
He can’t go far away.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,460
I’ll have men to seize him. No worries.

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,580
Thank you, Brother.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Don’t mention it.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,220
We’re brothers.

42
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,320
Moreover, this is a mission
from His Majesty.

43
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,590
Thank you anyway.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,170
Brother, do you have money?

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,790
That’s all I have. Is it enough?

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,320
I can have men to get more.

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,430
It’s enough.

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,710
I just borrow it for a look.

49
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,740
=The Imperial Coroner=

50
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,700
=Episode 10=

51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
Stop crying.

52
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,720
I can’t see girls cry.

53
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,390
I don’t even cry.

54
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,320
What are you crying for?

55
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,320
It’s my bad.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
It’s all my fault.

57
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,350
I wasn’t hurt by you.

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
How should you be blamed?

59
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,640
But you got hurt on protecting me.

60
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,640
Sorry.

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,390
What are you talking about?

62
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,720
Girls are supposed to protect girls.

63
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,920
Cheer up.

64
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,270
Badly, my suit was ruined.

65
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,040
How about this?

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,720
If you feel sorry,

67
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,600
why don’t you buy me a new dress?

68
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:58,920
Sure.

69
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,880
Luckily, the wound isn’t very deep.

70
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,480
Bones and muscles are not hurt.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,270
It’s nothing about luck.

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
It’s my prowess.

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
For martial artists traveling around,

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,950
injuries are inevitable.

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,790
But there’s a rule for injures.

76
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,510
Those getting hit head on

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,600
won’t stand to the last.

78
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,640
To be a true master,

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,790
you should learn how to fail.

80
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,230
Like my injury,

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,230
I knew I couldn’t dodge it.

82
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
But how serious the wound would be

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,320
still depended on me.

84
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,550
Leng Yue.

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,510
His Highness said your grandfather is
Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

86
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,440
His ranking is way higher than prefect.

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,270
Why are you traveling around the world?

88
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,760
I like it.

89
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,920
Leng Yue.

90
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,510
Leng Yue. How are you now?

91
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,670
Come on.

92
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,550
Slowly.

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,390
Be careful.

94
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,510
How are you?

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,350
Is it serious?

96
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,270
It’s fine. Just a scratch.

97
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,320
Is it a scratch?

98
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,390
You bled a lot.

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
No, I’ll write to my father

100
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,040
and ask for some physicians
from Chang’an.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,550
Hey, are you alright?

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,880
You are not alright now.

103
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,320
You write a letter to your father.

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,350
It’s delivered from here to Chang’an.

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,790
Then physicians come
from Chang’an to here.

106
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,510
By then, I’d have fully recovered.

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
What do you want the physician see?

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,110
To make fun of me?

109
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,600
Alright. Alright. Alright.

110
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
Mr. Jing, don’t worry about it.

111
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,070
Given her hand strength,

112
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,040
does she seem unwell?

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,920
If you feel uneasy,

114
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
let her give you some punches.

115
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,040
Cut it out.

116
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,640
Be careful not to split the wound.

117
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,640
You may see a physician
later in the city.

118
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,720
Don’t bother. Chu Chu is highly skilled.

119
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,760
She’ll change the medicine
and I’ll recover soon.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,270
What about you?

121
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,830
Thanks to Miss Leng, I’m fine.

122
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,160
Brother. Is there a place
to rest nearby?

123
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,720
Before entering the city,

124
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
I have something to tell you.

125
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,790
Sure.

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Take the carriage.

127
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,510
Come here.

128
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,320
(Xue’s Mansion)

129
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,880
Miss Banxia, you come in person.

130
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,720
Is there an order for me from Princess?

131
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,830
Princess hasn’t heard from His Highness.

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,760
She worries His Highness a lot.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Thinking that there could be
information in the court,

134
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,640
she sent me here to ask you.

135
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,950
Her Highness doesn’t have to be worried.

136
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,040
To tell you the truth,

137
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,920
people from the Ministry of Personnel
met her lately.

138
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,000
They’ve been investigating you
by the edict.

139
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,000
She’s worried
if something happened to him

140
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,950
and got you implicated.

141
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,200
Are they investigating me?

142
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,880
I didn’t hear anything about it.

143
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,950
That said,

144
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,390
Minister Feng has been conferred.

145
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,040
Nothing happened in the court either.

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
I suppose nothing big will happen.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,760
Tell Princess not to worry
too much about it.

148
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,920
If there’s anything related
to Commandery Prince An,

149
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,160
I’ll tell her everything I know.

150
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,720
Sir, I may thank you in her stead.

151
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,180
(Jiangshan Hall)

152
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,270
Your Majesty, I’m just a scholar

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
dealing with literature.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,830
You want me to be
the Minister of War.

155
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,470
I’m afraid to fail my duty

156
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,350
and disappoint you.

157
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,670
Unlike a general, Minister of War only

158
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,760
takes charge of the appointment
of military officials,

159
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,520
military manuals, weapons and the like.

160
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
Generally,
a military official is assigned

161
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,520
just because they know more

162
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,400
about the situation in the army.

163
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,710
Du Ruhui, the famous Prime Minister
in the times of Taizong,

164
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,470
was a civilian court official

165
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
acting as the Minister of War. Right?

166
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,110
I dare not

167
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,640
to be compared with Prime Minister Du.

168
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,470
You are inexperienced
in military affairs,

169
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,840
but don’t belittle yourself.

170
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,910
You’ve been working in Hanlin Academy

171
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,030
for years.

172
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,440
In the court,

173
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,230
you’ve been working close to me.

174
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,790
I know

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
how capable you are.

176
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
Taking charge of Ministry of War

177
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,350
isn’t too hard for you, is it?

178
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,200
Your Majesty, many talents
in the court

179
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,710
are qualified for this position.

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,760
I know I am not the best choice.

181
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,710
Think twice, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,520
There are indeed many talents for it.

183
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,000
Since Feng Jie’s death,

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,760
they’ve been fighting for it
openly or covertly,

185
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,960
trying every way to let me see them.

186
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,550
But you,

187
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,840
you’ve been hiding from me

188
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,760
for fearing that I’d think of you.

189
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,960
Quite the opposite, I will

190
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,520
have you to be the Minster of War

191
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,320
against your will.

192
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Your Majesty.

193
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,350
Alright. It’s settled then.

194
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,230
Just wait for the official document.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Jinbao.

196
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,440
Give my blade to Minister Xue.

198
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,520
Yes.

199
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,640
Congratulations, Minister Xue.

200
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,710
His Majesty, thanks for the blade.

201
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,090
Master. Prefect of Qianzhou
brings gifts.

202
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Master. These are gifts from
Prefect of Qianzhou.

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,700
This is the list.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,780
Please check it.

205
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
(Prefect Qianzhou.
Rosa roxburghii, 10kg.)

206
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,610
Master, these are gifts from Qianzhou.

207
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,480
(Rose sugar, 2.5kg. Yacca tea, 1.5kg)

208
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,350
That Li Zhang

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,910
does know the rules.

210
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,040
Master. I don’t quite understand it.

211
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,230
Why does Prefect of Qianzhou

212
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,230
(List of Gifts)
give gift to those officials in Chang’an

213
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,280
from time to time?

214
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,690
He’s never asked you

215
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,810
for any favor.

216
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,940
What is he up to by giving gifts?

217
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,060
You don’t know it.

218
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,420
He’s an orphan from a humble family.

219
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,300
In childhood, he studied in a temple.

220
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,570
Perhaps he sees many things of hypocrisy

221
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,940
in the world.

222
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,100
(List of Gifts)

223
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,960
After growing up,

224
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,790
he knows well the ways of the world.

225
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,640
He’s evasive and worldly-wise,

226
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,030
but not greedy.

227
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,640
He became a prefect at a young age.

228
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,910
His future is promising.

229
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,200
Alright. Accept all the gifts.

230
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,300
Yes, Master.

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,050
Go and ask around tomorrow

232
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,650
if he gave gifts to any other mansion.

233
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,840
As usual,

234
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,460
buy some Chang’an specialties
at the same price

235
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,440
and give him in return.

236
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,790
Yes, Master.

237
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,830
Master.

238
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,720
General Wu from Three Judicial Offices
comes.

239
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,430
He asked me to give you this.

240
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,900
(Qian)

241
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,110
Just one copper coin?

242
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,160
What does he mean by this?

243
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,900
(Kaiyuan Coin)

244
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,670
Where is he?

245
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,430
He gave me this letter and left.

246
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,520
He only asked me to give you this.

247
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,940
(Qian)

248
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,520
Go get the carriage ready.

249
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Yes, Master.

250
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,200
This is an open ground.

251
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Let’s rest here.

252
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:26,880
Sure.

253
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,880
Miss Leng, are you all right?

254
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,550
I... I’m fine.

255
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,500
Why don’t you

256
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,550
lie on my lap?

257
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,270
You can feel better.

258
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,770
Thanks. I’m fine.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,520
Really?

260
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,950
You are nagging

261
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
like Xiao Jinli.

262
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,640
General Xiao?

263
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,030
He didn’t say anything just now.

264
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,890
He won’t nag me.

265
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,860
He only nags His Highness.

266
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,430
He will nag him half a day

267
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,410
for some trivia.

268
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,820
You’ll know it later.

269
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,890
What is that saying?

270
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,840
He’s the apple

271
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,000
of his eyes.

272
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,200
General Xiao and His Highness

273
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,880
are so intimate.

274
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,620
His Highness is kind to General, too.

275
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,530
These two brothers have been different
since childhood.

276
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,410
When His Highness was a kid,

277
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,970
he was weak and quiet.

278
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,130
But Xiao Jinli was like a monkey,

279
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,250
climbing up and down every day.

280
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,130
They were once playing by the lotus pond
in the mansion.

281
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,650
Xiao Jinli climbed on a tree

282
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,840
very quickly,

283
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,380
but he ended up falling into the pond.

284
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,790
His Highness couldn’t swim,

285
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,720
but he jumped in to save him instantly.

286
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,430
Luckily,

287
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Aunt Banxia heard the sound

288
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,910
and got people there in time.

289
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,110
Otherwise, they could’ve been drowned.

290
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,110
Princess must’ve punished
General Xiao, right?

291
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,200
Punishment was no big deal.

292
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,020
It was early spring back then.

293
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,160
The water was very cold.

294
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
His Highness caught a cold in water.

295
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,870
He didn’t get better until the summer.

296
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,600
Princess beat Xiao Jinli

297
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,400
and got the pond leveled.

298
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,230
Xiao Jinli behaved better since then.

299
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,400
I wonder if he’s terrified

300
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,670
or he felt guilty.

301
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,550
Ever since then,

302
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,910
Xiao Jinli has been closely
watching over him.

303
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,350
So, do not mess with Xiao Jinli.

304
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,160
I’ll keep it in mind.

305
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,770
Leng Yue. How are you?

306
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,210
How about I carry you?

307
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,860
I’m fine.

308
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,680
We’ve arrived. Can you move?

309
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,620
Let me help you.

310
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,210
I can walk. Get off.

311
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,980
I’m fine. I can do it.

312
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,980
(Marquis Zhang)

313
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,650
“Fail to repair the room,
for on worker can be found.”

314
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,810
Bravo. Bravo.

315
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,940
Wang Xizhi’s “Clearing After Snowfall”.

316
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,300
The penmanship is stable and tidy,
with round and sharp fonts.

317
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,450
It’s easy to imitate the fonts,

318
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,010
but not the conception.

319
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,810
It says, “Fail to repair the room”.

320
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,690
It’s upset to fail to do it.

321
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,060
But from the strokes,

322
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,770
the writer is obviously

323
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,980
in a peaceful state.

324
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,310
You imitated not only the form

325
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,830
but also the conception.

326
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,540
You are really great.

327
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,380
These days,

328
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,250
you must’ve put lots of efforts on it.

329
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,420
It didn’t take much time.

330
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,810
But the paper and pen
did take lots of money.

331
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,570
You’re flattering me, Mentor.

332
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,570
I have a strange thing as well.

333
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,010
You may take a look at it.

334
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,130
I’m much flattered.

335
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,890
In terms of paintings and calligraphy,

336
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,330
I know a thing or two.

337
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,770
But about antiques,

338
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,810
I dare not show off in front of you.

339
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,220
(Qian. Kaiyuan Coin)

340
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
You are injured.

341
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,810
Why are you still here?

342
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,620
Go back and sit.

343
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,810
Stop it. Go back and sit.

344
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,560
You’re skilled.

345
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,070
“Carefully cut as thin
as cicada’s wings.

346
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,190
Pile up like yarn. Separate like snow.

347
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,560
Fly with the wind.
The edge keeps moving”.

348
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,350
What?

349
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
What flying snow?
It’s not snowing.

350
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
It was a lord’s comment

351
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,920
on fillets 600 years ago.

352
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,470
It means, “very good”.

353
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,160
Really?

354
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,680
Enjoy yourselves then.

355
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Jinyu, what are you trying to say?

356
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,520
Of these 23 copper coins
printed with “Qian”,

357
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,680
18 coins are fake.

358
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,400
What?

359
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,660
Fake?

360
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
I can’t tell.

361
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,000
Fake?

362
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,070
How come it looks genuine?

363
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,710
Let me see.

364
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,400
Counterfeiting coins is a death penalty.

365
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,520
Who would do this business?

366
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,760
Counterfeiting coins is huge.

367
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,760
If they’re not powerful enough,

368
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,350
they can’t afford to do this.

369
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,070
Qianzhou has been in peace these years.

370
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,190
I’ve never heard of anyone

371
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,190
who could do this.

372
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,190
Nor have I during my travel.

373
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,550
Since Jinyu said it’s in Qianzhou,

374
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,910
it must be in Qianzhou.

375
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,920
Seriously?

376
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,350
Could it be Prefect of Qianzhou?

377
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,020
Chu Chu. You live in Qianzhou.

378
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,040
How is this prefect’s reputation
in the commoners?

379
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,160
Prefect Li is known as a good official.

380
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,920
Hadn’t he allocated funds
to Guanling County

381
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,870
and built bridges and roads,

382
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,190
we’d still use slings now.

383
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,070
I contacted with this prefect

384
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,070
for several times.

385
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,190
He’s kind of cunning,

386
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,810
but there’s nothing wrong with him.

387
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,760
Your coins must be your military pay.

388
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,230
Even in the military,

389
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,040
there are so many counterfeit coins.

390
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,830
It must concern many things.

391
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,850
As Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang

392
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,880
must have something to do with it.

393
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
If I guess it right,

394
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,770
this prefect

395
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,670
must be waiting for us
in Guanling County.

396
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,950
Don’t you believe it?

397
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,470
A bet of five gold.

398
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,560
Bad habit.

399
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,730
Commandery Prince An

400
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,470
sent it here

401
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,110
but didn’t say anything.

402
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,040
He wanted to see our reactions.

403
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,560
For Commandery Prince An,

404
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,810
everyone is suspicious.

405
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,600
He even suspected you, his mentor.

406
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,080
In that case,

407
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,250
you’ve also figured it out

408
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,150
about the coin, right?

409
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,590
When I received his coin,

410
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,430
(Qian)
I didn’t get it either.

411
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,000
Then I got another ten coins
printed with “Qian”

412
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,730
and made a comparison.

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Turned out this coin was illegal.

414
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,230
He’s your favorite student.

415
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,160
What do you think of this?

416
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,160
What will he do?

417
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,160
He sent the coin into the capital

418
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,040
and gave us in this way.

419
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,760
I suppose

420
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,560
he wanted to know our reactions.

421
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,920
It’s like what he does.

422
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,500
Illegal copper coin appeared

423
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,130
in all dynasties.

424
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,280
The southwest area is remote,

425
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,070
yet it’s rich in minerals.

426
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,570
Illegal cooper cash casting continues
despite repeated prohibitions.

427
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,110
I’m worried that

428
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,880
he can’t find where
illegal coins are made.

429
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,920
It’s just that this issue

430
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,430
must concern the dignitaries
in the court.

431
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,920
Given his righteousness,

432
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,560
he could cause a trouble unknowingly.

433
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,230
You worry too much.

434
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,950
He’s also a dignity, isn’t he?

435
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,950
If he’s aware that

436
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,430
he’s one of the dignities,

437
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,040
why do I bother worrying about this?

438
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,170
I’m not worried about dignitaries.

439
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,760
I’m afraid it’s related to eunuchs.

440
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,120
Qin Luan lives long in the palace.

441
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,400
Qianzhou is thousands of miles away.

442
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,470
He can barely manage this thing.

443
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,110
Mentor, in your opinion,

444
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,560
who do you think

445
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,400
is casting coins illegally?

446
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,520
What? Don’t you have any clue?

447
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
The other day,

448
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,800
you invited the newly appointed
Capital Liaison Representative

449
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,070
to your mansion.

450
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,560
Wasn’t it for the investigation
of this case?

451
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,710
No, you misunderstood it.

452
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,510
I invited him to my place

453
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
to learn about something

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
about the border military and

455
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,910
political affairs in the prefectures.

456
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,120
It had nothing to do with this case.

457
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Military and political affairs?

458
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,600
His Majesty ordered me
to be the Minister of War.

459
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,760
Congrats to you in advance,
Minister Xue.

460
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,640
I’m Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou.
My respects, Commandery Prince An.

461
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,560
Commandery Prince An comes to Qianzhou.

462
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
I’m here to visit you.

463
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,430
Please pardon me for any offense.

464
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,280
I lost to His Highness again.

465
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,640
Li Zhang is really here.

466
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,989
(Zheng Youde, Magistrate of Guanling County)
My respects. I’m Zheng Youde.

467
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,160
(Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou)
My respects. I’m Zheng Youde.

468
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,830
(Tan Gui, Deputy Magistrate of Guanling County)
My respects. I’m Tan Gui.

469
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
There are too many state affairs.

470
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,830
Even Prefect Li is disturbed to come.

471
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,040
Not at all.

472
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,830
I’m much flattered.

473
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,470
Alright.

474
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,590
I’ll do it as His Highness said.

475
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,520
Who is this lady?

476
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,230
Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao,

477
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,830
General Leng’s granddaughter,
Leng Yue.

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,350
So, you’re Miss Leng.

479
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,590
My respects.

480
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,110
Qianzhou is remote and impoverished.

481
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,800
It’s incomparable with Chang’an.

482
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,560
But you’re guests from afar.

483
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
Now that you come here,

484
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,190
we should show our hospitality.

485
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes. Show our hospitality.

486
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,830
Well...

487
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,760
Rest assured, Commandery Prince An.

488
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,040
I’ve long heard of your integrity.

489
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,880
I dare not do anything out of line.

490
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,430
I just want to treat you to dinner

491
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,280
at Zheng’s place,

492
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,400
to receive you.

493
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
Everything will be simplified

494
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,280
so that we’ll all be pleased.

495
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,350
Please give us the honor.

496
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,310
Give us the honor.

497
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,110
In this case...

498
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,470
Since you say so,

499
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,710
I cannot refuse it.

500
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,800
And I have something

501
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,710
to learn from Prefect Li
and Magistrate Zheng.

502
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,470
My pleasure. My pleasure.

503
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,520
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

504
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Hurry and serve tea.

505
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,680
Commandery Prince An, Please.
Miss Leng, please.

506
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,190
Please.

507
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,660
(Guanling County Government)

508
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Here. Try this.

509
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah.

510
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,010
This is tasty.

511
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,790
Eat up.

512
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,580
Eat.

513
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,920
Isn’t she the girl of the Chu’s family?

514
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,430
Yeah. Didn’t she go to Chang’an?

515
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,710
These guys must be rich.

516
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,830
I agree.

517
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,950
How come these people

518
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,590
come with Miss Chu?

519
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,280
I wonder what she did in Chang’an.

520
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,830
Women are not allowed in government.

521
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,190
Who knows?

522
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,470
(Chu He, Chu Chu’s brother)
Who do you mean by Miss Chu?

523
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,430
(Chu He, Chu Chu’s brother)

524
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,110
Who are rich?

525
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,400
Chu He, don’t you know it?

526
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,830
Your sister is back

527
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,350
with a bunch of men.

528
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,800
Come and look.

529
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,970
Dried goods. Herbs. Have a look.

530
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,030
My home is over there,

531
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,820
not far from this fair.

532
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Your home is quite remote.

533
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,110
Chu Chu. Chu Chu.

534
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,680
Brother.

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,450
Stop. Who are you?

536
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,520
This is my sister. I’m her brother.

537
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,760
Step back.

538
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,150
He... He’s my brother.

539
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,670
You’ve been out for so long,

540
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,880
and didn’t write a letter to us.

541
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,310
Who are these guys with you?

542
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,510
Come here.

543
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,880
Brother, they’re not bad guys.

544
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,120
I’ll take the coroner’s exam with them.

545
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,160
The coroner’s exam?

546
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,110
Who are these guys?

547
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,200
How come you take the exam in this way?

548
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,550
I... It’s true
I’m taking coroner’s exam.

549
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,430
Let’s go home.

550
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,600
Are you Chu He?

551
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,490
How come he knows my brother’s name?

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,270
How did you know it?

553
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,630
Who on earth are you?

554
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,670
We’re from Chang’an.

555
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,760
You can take her home,

556
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,790
but we’ll go along with you.

557
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,190
When we see your seniors

558
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,390
at home,

559
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,840
I’ll tell you who we are.

560
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,190
I don’t even know you people.

561
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,270
Why should I take you to my house?

562
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,870
Because we came here with her

563
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,080
all the way from Chang’an.

564
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,910
We are strangers to you.

565
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,840
I understand you’re vigilant.

566
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
But we can’t trust you, either.

567
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,240
She’s my sister. I’m her brother.

568
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,390
Why would I harm her?

569
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,510
Brother. They’re helping me.

570
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,630
Since you mean no harm to her,

571
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,960
why can’t we send her home?

572
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,390
Alright.

573
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,630
Listen up.

574
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,030
My family works
for the county government.

575
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,880
If you have any evil intention,

576
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,030
Magistrate Zheng won’t spare you.

577
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,520
Brother.

578
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,150
Shut it.

579
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,030
Stop saying.

580
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,030
Please lead the way.

581
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,910
Brother.

582
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,630
Chu He, Miss Chu said

583
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,630
your family have been coroners
for generations.

584
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,840
My family is one and only coroner here.

585
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,510
You can ask around here.

586
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,880
Chu is a household name.

587
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,720
In this case,

588
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,840
Zheng Youde, the Magistrate,

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,550
contacts with your family a lot, right?

590
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,550
Of course.

591
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
How is he as an official?

592
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,550
He’s a good official,

593
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,360
never bullying people,
also a good judge.

594
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,760
Why do you ask about this?

595
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,200
I’m new here. I’m just asking.

596
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,390
Ermao. Ermao.

597
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,680
Ermao. Come here.

598
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,270
Ermao.

599
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,510
(Chu Ping Chu’s father Chu’s grandfather)
Grandfather.

600
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,670
Chu Chu.

601
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,600
I’m back.

602
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
Chu Chu is back.

603
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,430
Grandfather. Father.

604
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,580
Chu Chu is back.

605
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,490
Father.

606
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,630
Are you back now?

607
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,800
You’re good, huh?

608
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,590
You left for so long,

609
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,340
yet you didn’t send a message to home.

610
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,760
Come here. I’ll break your legs...!

611
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,640
Sorry, Grandpa. I’m wrong.

612
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
Father. She’s back safe and sound.

613
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,000
Don’t be angry.

614
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,070
-Don’t defend her.
-Sorry.

615
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,000
If she doesn’t learn a lesson,

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,270
she’ll do it again.

617
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,910
I meant to write to you.

618
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,280
But I wanted to pass the exam

619
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,430
and then wrote the good news to you.

620
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,590
Are you arguing with me? You lass!

621
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,960
What if you were cheated?

622
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,430
What if you got harmed?

623
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,680
No one harmed me.

624
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
People in Chang’an are very nice.

625
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,000
No one bullied me.

626
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,520
I’ve served as a coroner

627
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
and filled out autopsy forms.

628
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,270
It’s just that...

629
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,800
I haven’t passed the exam yet.

630
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,510
Are you lying now?

631
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,310
Who asked you to be a coroner?

632
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,950
Who asked you
to fill out autopsy forms?

633
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,360
I am not lying.

634
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,240
Calm down, sir.

635
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,030
She isn’t lying.

636
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,030
I asked her to be the coroner

637
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,390
and filled out autopsy forms.

638
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,640
Did you ask her to be a coroner?

639
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,600
Who are you?

640
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,070
I’m an official from Chang’an

641
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,790
in charge of prison affairs.

642
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,270
This is my elder brother,

643
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,240
a general under Military Commissioner
of Qianzhongdao.

644
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,700
Chu Chu worked for me

645
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,030
while she was in Chang’an.

646
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,360
She’s meticulous and highly skilled,

647
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,030
one of a kind.

648
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,270
She told me

649
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,030
your family has been coroners
for generations,

650
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,310
with a long origin.

651
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,360
I went to the southwest for work,

652
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,670
passing by your place
and paying a visit.

653
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,940
Look. Now do you believe it?

654
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,310
I’ve worked as a coroner.

655
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,670
Father.

656
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,630
An official in charge of prison
in the court?

657
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,150
I don’t buy it.

658
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,950
There’s no big criminal case here.

659
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,790
What does an official
from the court come for?

660
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,310
Moreover,

661
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,720
officials from the court
must come for big issues.

662
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,360
There should be a convoy
at least for a prefect.

663
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,790
We’re men of the world.

664
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,240
Don’t try to fool us like this.

665
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,480
Girl. Be honest.

666
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,270
Did you ask them
to make a lie for you?

667
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,310
Watch your tongue.

668
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,120
Brother. I told you the truth.

669
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,790
So did him.

670
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,030
By the way,

671
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,200
he has the official credential.

672
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,200
Since you don’t believe my words,

673
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,000
even though I show you the credential,

674
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,200
you’ll still doubt if it’s true.

675
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,550
To prove my identity to a coroner,

676
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,360
these things are not necessary.

677
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
You said

678
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,910
your family is the only coroner
in this county.

679
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,510
That means,

680
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,680
all the murder cases handled

681
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,910
by the county government

682
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,360
are examined by your family.

683
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,030
Is it right?

684
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,270
Yes. Then what?

685
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,720
On October 19 last year,

686
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,720
a debtor in this county

687
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,670
had Gelsemium elegans and killed himself
to frame the creditor.

688
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,550
Zheng Youde originally thought

689
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,080
the creditor was the murderer.

690
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,310
But the report was rejected by the court
for an reinvestigation

691
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,760
soon after it’s submitted.

692
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,430
In the report, it’s marked that

693
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,270
the testimonies of the debtor’s wife
were contradictory.

694
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,120
Zheng Youde retried the debtor’s wife

695
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,480
and the truth was revealed.

696
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,840
How did you know it?

697
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,180
I also know another vendetta case

698
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,390
on the 5th day of the 7th lunar month,
the year before last.

699
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,760
The murderer robbed and killed,
disguised as a bandit.

700
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,710
Zheng Youde reported it to the court
as a bandit crime.

701
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,600
It’s rejected as well.

702
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,630
The report was replied that

703
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,840
the murderer was a local woman
in her twenties.

704
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,760
Zheng Youde re-investigated

705
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
several young women in their twenties.

706
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,310
The culprit was finally arrested.

707
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,940
I examined this case. I know it.

708
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,910
That’s true.

709
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,000
How did you know the reply

710
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
from the court

711
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,150
that Magistrate Zheng received?

712
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,910
Because I wrote these replies.

713
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,150
We come here for work.

714
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,430
To make it convenient,

715
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,030
we’re dressed as businessmen.

716
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,080
It’s crowded in the street.

717
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,670
I couldn’t tell you the truth.

718
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Please pardon me.

719
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,550
Do you believe it now?

720
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,300
I’m too ignorant.

721
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,150
Sorry for my discourtesy.

722
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,670
Please forgive me.

723
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,840
I came uninvited.

724
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,960
Skip the formalities.

725
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,310
Sirs, please go upstairs.

726
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,080
Girl, come with me.

727
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,390
But...

728
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,240
Come in, please.

729
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,270
Please.

730
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,580
We’re a humble family.

731
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,670
It’s incomparable to Chang’an.

732
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,600
Please make do for a rest.

733
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,150
Please have a seat.

734
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,360
Please.

735
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,960
Thanks.

736
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,120
Please.

737
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,910
-After you, sir.
-Sit, please.

738
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,200
Sir.

739
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,230
Chu Chu is a girl.

740
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,630
Did she really work as a coroner
in Chang’an?

741
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,430
Yes.

742
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,080
She’d never been
to the government before

743
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,910
and knew little about the rules.

744
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,790
Did she make any mistake?

745
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,320
No.

746
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,960
Girl. Listen to me.

747
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,430
Why do these high-ranking officials

748
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,040
come to our family?

749
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,630
Did you make any trouble?

750
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,910
Listen.

751
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,520
I won’t allow anyone to bully you.

752
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,110
No.

753
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,430
I don’t know either.

754
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,520
I want to work for him.

755
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,910
He’s still testing me.

756
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,140
He said if he would hire me,

757
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,080
he’d verify my identity

758
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,150
of the test.

759
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,000
They want to know Chu Chu’s background.

760
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,110
He’s already sent me home.

761
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,320
I guess he won’t hire me.

762
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,910
What are you talking about?
I don’t understand.

763
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,000
Nothing.

764
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,480
Brother, I missed you so much
when I was outside.

765
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,670
Silly girl.

766
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,760
Don’t do this again. Understand?

767
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,240
Since she didn’t make any mistake,

768
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,150
why do you

769
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,150
send her home?

770
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,200
To be honest,

771
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,240
I didn’t mean to send her back.

772
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,070
I just passed by and encountered Chu He.

773
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,150
On the one hand,

774
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,910
I was afraid she couldn’t explain it
and get punished

775
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,830
if she came back alone.

776
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,050
On the other hand,

777
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,970
I’d like to come
and learn about something.

778
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,960
Is it about Chu Chu?

779
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,110
I heard that,

780
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,830
a witch doctor lived in Pingle Town.

781
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Does he still live here now?

782
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,150
You... Were you talking about
a witch doctor?

783
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,910
The man who used to tell you stories,

784
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,280
living behind our house.

785
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
What... What happened to him?

786
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,480
He moved away long ago,

787
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,320
about four or five years.

788
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,390
Yes.

789
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,630
Back then,

790
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,720
his legs were hurt. He couldn’t walk.

791
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,310
The villagers around here thought

792
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,040
he couldn’t even cure his own legs.

793
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,430
They didn’t trust him.

794
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,110
Besides,

795
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,070
he’s reluctant
to do superstitious things.

796
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,960
He led a hard life

797
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,870
like a beggar.

798
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,800
It’s good that
he didn’t loathe our family.

799
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
I used to ask Chu Chu

800
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,000
to give him some food and necessaries.

801
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,830
Her father often helped him
with some work,

802
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,870
like picking herbs.

803
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,150
Chu Chu was very close to him.

804
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,630
She’s very sad

805
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,240
when he just left.

806
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
No one has ever seen him again?

807
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,690
No.

808
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,280
Military Commissioner sent troops

809
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,560
to suppress bandits here before.

810
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,910
Was he living here at that time?

811
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,760
Yes. Yes.

812
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,350
I remember

813
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,040
I went to tell him that

814
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,830
the troops were suppressing bandits,

815
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,390
and told him to lock the door
and stay at home

816
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,350
lest he got hurt.

817
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,590
Didn’t he say anything

818
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
about the troops?

819
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,350
No.

820
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
Oh, right.

821
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,830
When I left,

822
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,720
he asked me to lock the door.

823
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

824
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,530
You’re our honored guests.

825
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,650
Just be frank. It’s my pleasure.

826
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,810
It’s getting late now.

827
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,800
Would you please allow us

828
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,420
to stay the night at your place?

829
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,970
Will he stay in my family?
