1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,110
I misunderstood His Highness.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,070
He checked on my family background,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,190
because he wanted me to work for him.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,280
And I finally knew who my mother was.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,950
Fate is such a fantastic thing.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,550
I never expected to meet such a good man
like His Highness

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,360
in the Coroner Qualification Test.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,600
Life had mercy on me

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,270
so that I managed to meet her.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,180
Did His Majesty dream that

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,330
the late emperor’s son Duke Chang
came back to life

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,370
and would take back the throne?

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,230
Don’t talk nonsense.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,710
Go. Go get some tea.

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,870
I’m the lineal son of Emperor Wuzong.

16
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,160
You’re simply my father’s uncle.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,270
If you didn’t pretend to be insane

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,760
and let eunuchs kill my families,

19
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,110
you wouldn’t have taken the throne.

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,500
I’m doomed to be the emperor.

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,220
=Episode 14=

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,550
(Antique Store)
Manager, a letter from His Highness.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,500
(The fish)

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,340
(rose)

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,740
(to)

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,660
(the bait.)

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,800
The fish rose to the bait. Stand by.

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,890
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,090
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,220
Your Majesty, please enjoy some tea.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,250
Qin Luan.

33
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,780
Here.

34
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,980
There’re rumors in the Palace

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,010
about the late emperor’s son Duke Chang.

36
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,900
Have you heard about that?

37
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,660
Your Majesty, like you said,

38
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,530
they’re mere rumors.

39
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,260
Ignorant men are wrongly informed.

40
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,700
Don’t bother to trust them.

41
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,140
Ignorant men?

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,730
Censors reported to me about it.

43
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,940
Are my censors

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,370
also ignorant men?

45
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,620
All sons of the late emperor died.

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,170
It’s been recorded in the genealogy.

47
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,370
Nothing will go wrong.

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,610
It’s ridiculous to say that
Duke Chang is still alive.

49
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,730
If it becomes a serious problem,

50
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,700
our state may be harmed.

51
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,330
Nothing comes out of nothing.

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,300
Who would make an issue

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
of a long-gone duke?

54
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,500
Qin Luan.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,220
Here.

56
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,620
You served three emperors.

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,420
I make you the Acting Chief Eunuch,

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,700
because I believe that

59
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,060
you can take care of everything
in the Palace.

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,900
When I assign you to figure out

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,680
where such rumors came from

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
and who started them,

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,550
this isn’t tough job, is it?

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,560
Your Majesty, I’ll do my best

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
and not to disappoint you.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,780
(Guanling Yamen)

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,670
General Xiao, I’m on my way to see you.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,670
Lend me some soldiers.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
It’s getting dark. Why do you want them?

70
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,720
His Highness hides a dead man
in the Chu Family.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,190
He wants to get the body here.

72
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,700
Why are you in the official costume?

73
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,530
You were recognized?

74
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,580
What? Li Zhang was back to his mansion.

75
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,370
Let’s talk about it later.

76
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,250
Lend me some soldiers, first.

77
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,530
How can you do it secretly like this?

78
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,050
Doing it secretly means

79
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,470
not letting people know
about the dead man,

80
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,280
instead of seeing me.

81
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,370
You were with His Highness last night.

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,930
Do you know who the dead man is?

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,770
Well,

84
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,600
it’s hard to explain.

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,630
Ask him yourself.

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,530
Then what are you coming for?

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
To get some medicine for Jinyu

88
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,800
and see how it is going with you.

89
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,850
We must get Jinyu to live in Yamen
as soon as possible.

90
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,700
He should no longer live
in Chu Chu’s home.

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,410
Why?

92
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,290
It’s hard to explain.

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,140
Leng Yue told me that

94
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,170
Chu Chu annoyed His Highness.

95
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,130
It’s...

96
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,620
Hard to explain again?

97
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,690
Yes.

98
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,750
I simply left His Highness for one day

99
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,600
and so many things happened?

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,960
You four, work for Vice Minister Jing.

101
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,640
Yes!

102
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,390
Anybody in?

103
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,220
My Lord.

104
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,070
Is Miss Chu Chu in?

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Yes. Yes.

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,960
Chu Chu? Chu Chu!

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,640
Come down.

108
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,480
Father.

109
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,390
Greetings, Your Highness.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,760
You may rise.

111
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,670
What do you come for?

112
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,310
I want to borrow something
from the Chu Family,

113
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,060
for some business.

114
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,950
What business?

115
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,550
General Xiao’s subordinates
captured a bandit.

116
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,800
Unexpectedly, they fought hard

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,440
and accidentally killed him.

118
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,510
We need to take his corpse back
for inspection,

119
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,710
but we might ruin him
on the slippery road after the rain.

120
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,190
I hear that the Chu Family sell coffins.

121
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,510
I’d like to borrow one.

122
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,070
May I?

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,480
Yes. Yes.

124
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,000
We have coffins available.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Let me take him there.

126
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
Please stay, Sir.

127
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,950
Let Chu Chu take them there.

128
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,030
No matter which one they pick,

129
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,600
I’ll pay according to the fixed price.

130
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,790
Don’t bother to pay.

131
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,000
We’re coroners.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,320
It’s our duty to work for officials.

133
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,640
It’s generous of you, Sir.

134
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,270
Chu Chu,

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
let’s go back to Yamen with Jing Yi

136
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,670
and take care of the bandit thing.

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,590
Yes.

138
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,950
I’m sorry!

139
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,790
I’m sorry, Your Highness!

140
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,880
I’m sorry, Your Highness!

141
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,150
Last night, I was drunk

142
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,400
and I overslept.

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,590
Your... Your Highness...

144
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,990
This is Commandery Prince An.

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,270
I’m Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

146
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,110
But, but...

147
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,680
But yesterday...

148
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,750
Yesterday...

149
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Yesterday, you and Prefect Li greeted me

150
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
without recognizing me.

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,590
I didn’t say anything.

152
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Greetings,

153
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,350
Your Highness.

154
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,470
It’s just misunderstanding.

155
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,270
Don’t bother about it.

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,320
You may rise.

157
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,230
Your Highness,

159
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,280
the coffin...?

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,480
Well,

161
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,030
it’s a bandit

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,430
General Xiao’s subordinate killed.

163
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,200
We brought the corpse back in a coffin
from the Chu Family.

164
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,710
Ask no questions about this issue.

165
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,110
I’ll have it handled.

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,790
I’m sorry.

167
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,510
I had weak governance
in Guanling County,

168
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,320
so that you were disturbed by bandits.

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,080
Please punish me.

170
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,520
It takes a long time
to annihilate bandits.

171
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,870
Just work hard on it.

172
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,350
Yes. Yes.

173
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,030
I’ve got something else to do.

174
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,440
Magistrate Zheng,

175
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,790
could you take me to the archive?

176
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,240
Ar... archive?

177
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,310
What? We can’t go?

178
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,880
You... you can.

179
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,960
This way, please, Your Highness!

180
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,140
(Guanling Yamen)

181
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,380
(Archive)

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
This way, please.

183
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,270
Come in, please.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,350
Your Highness, this is our archive.

185
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,590
This way, please.

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,710
Where’s the household register?

187
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Your Highness,

188
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,390
these are local household registers.

189
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,630
Find out the household register
of the Xu Family.

190
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,590
The Xu Family?

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
It was a big family

192
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,260
that moved away years ago.

193
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,870
Your Highness, do you mean the Xu Family

194
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,200
where Deputy Magistrate Tan lived?

195
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,200
Deputy Magistrate lived there?

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,280
Your Highness,

197
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,550
his father Tan Hong was the butler,

198
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,440
working for the Xu Family.

199
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,190
After they moved away,

200
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,880
the Tan Family lived in the old mansion

201
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
to take care of it.

202
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,190
Is this family you’re looking for?

203
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes.

204
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,000
Please wait, Your Highness.

205
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,880
Please review it.

206
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
(Household register of the Xu Family)

207
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,660
(Xu Zongfang, unknown.
Lady Liu, unknown.)

208
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,880
Why is there only the record

209
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,500
of Xu Zongfang and his wife?

210
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,910
What about his ancestors?

211
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,230
Does he have siblings?

212
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,550
Where did he move to?

213
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,670
Why isn’t there any record?

214
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
Please don’t get angry, Your Highness.

215
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,000
I’m not too lazy to make records.

216
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,150
Before I took up my post,

217
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,400
the archive had been in fire.

218
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,790
Nearly all files were burned.

219
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,080
I made up all the files

220
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,670
you’re reading.

221
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,470
There’re some omissions, without doubt.

222
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,030
I’m telling the truth.

223
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,670
I don’t dare to lie.

224
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,020
Do you remember

225
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,380
when the fire was on?

226
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,200
I didn’t know.

227
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,870
I was on my way to this county.

228
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,230
I simply knew
the previous magistrate left.

229
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,000
I guess the fired happened after he left

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,200
and before I came.

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
I see.

232
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,550
Thank you.

233
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,280
You’re welcome, Your Highness.

234
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,790
Get back to your business.

235
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,640
Yes.

236
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,080
Isn’t she Chu Chu?

237
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Why is she staying with His Highness?

238
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,200
(Archive)

239
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,030
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

240
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,150
Your Highness, are we going
to the Xu Family

241
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,150
and ask Butler Tan?

242
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,640
It’s not time to go yet.

243
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,230
Who else can we ask, then?

244
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,960
Deputy Magistrate Tan?

245
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,760
I want to ask someone

246
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,280
before the Tan Family.

247
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,710
But I need your permission.

248
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,630
I permit.

249
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,440
Go wherever you want.

250
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,390
I permit.

251
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,910
I don’t mean going somewhere.

252
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,560
I mean seeing someone
with your permission.

253
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,000
Who?

254
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,860
Your mother Lady Xu.

255
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,540
You... you mean?

256
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,900
Open her coffin.

257
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,740
The fire in the archive was quite odd.

258
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,860
It happened between the shifts
of two magistrates,

259
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,660
also after the Xu Family moved away.

260
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,340
It may have something to do with them.

261
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,860
Your Highness,

262
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,100
do you suspect

263
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,100
my mother didn’t kill herself?

264
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,130
I don’t know yet.

265
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,660
So, we shouldn’t
visit the Xu’s Mansion first.

266
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,370
In the coffin

267
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,370
are your mother’s remains and corpse.

268
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,130
Tan Hong may lie.

269
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,450
But your mother will not, right?

270
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,740
I agree.

271
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,010
But Your Highness,

272
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,370
may I inspect my mother’s corpse?

273
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,930
I assure you that

274
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,370
I’ll inspect her corpse

275
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,740
as I do to other bodies.

276
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,180
All right. You can do that.

277
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

278
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,930
Tomorrow, I’ll ask my men

279
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,690
to prepare some necessary things.

280
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
You can get ready, too.

281
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,610
Brother, where have you been?

282
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,050
You didn’t come back for dinner.

283
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,410
Did you have it out there?

284
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,180
Yes.

285
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,130
I had dinner with Jing Yi in Yamen.

286
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,810
Magistrate Zheng is quite clingy.

287
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,360
I know you like to be quiet.

288
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,490
I didn’t invite you, then.

289
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,690
Did Chu He tell you something?

290
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,860
Chu He?

291
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,740
No.

292
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,980
What would he tell me?

293
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,860
He...

294
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,480
It’s hard to explain.

295
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,540
I’ll tell you later.

296
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,880
What?

297
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,590
I’m used to a casual life in the army.

298
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,470
But you love to be clean.

299
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,790
If I don’t have a bath,

300
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,000
I’m afraid you can’t fall asleep.

301
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Brother, don’t feel restrained for me.

302
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,550
I don’t.

303
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,820
I feel comfortable as long as you do.

304
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,440
Go to sleep. I’ll be back after a bath.

305
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,340
All right.

306
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,490
Brother, may I use

307
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,420
some of your soldiers tomorrow?

308
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,540
Sure. What for?

309
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,980
You’ll know tomorrow.

310
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,980
Jinyu,

311
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,980
did you ask Leng Yue
to keep an eye on Jing Yi?

312
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,660
Leng Yue’s keeping an eye on Jing Yi?

313
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,370
Yeah.

314
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,770
Before I came back,

315
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,730
I saw Leng Yue peeking furtively

316
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,970
outside Jing Yi’s room.

317
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,690
I thought you asked her to do that

318
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,920
and I didn’t stop her.

319
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,010
What are they up to?

320
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,220
What? You didn’t ask her to do that?

321
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,780
Then why did she peek at Jing Yi?

322
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,490
I guess Leng Yue came with me,

323
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,830
under my mother’s order.

324
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,880
I think Mother is vigilant about Chu Chu

325
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,880
and she asked Leng Yue
to keep an eye on her

326
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,520
because Leng Yue’s also a girl.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,350
Leng Yue was with Chu Chu
all the way here

328
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,590
and never let Chu Chu stay out of sight.

329
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,350
Now, she’s keeping an eye on Jing Yi,

330
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,780
instead of Chu Chu.

331
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,340
She possibly does it,
because of Chu Chu, too.

332
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,490
Leng Yue...

333
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,660
But it looks like

334
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,860
Miss Chu has nothing to do

335
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,490
with the Jing Family.

336
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,930
Vice Minister Jing.

337
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,100
Greetings, Vice Minister Jing.

338
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,490
Deputy Magistrate Tan, it’s you?

339
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,230
When I was in the capital
for the civil exam,

340
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,160
Senior Jing helped me.

341
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,310
I’d like to work for your family.

342
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,110
Send the two drawings back
to the capital.

343
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,230
Rest assured.

344
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,920
I’ll have them sent as soon as possible.

345
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,460
Jing Yi.

346
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,180
Jing Yi!

347
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,330
Why are you here?

348
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,780
Why are you in such a desolate place

349
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,290
in the middle of night?

350
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,490
I saw a man behaving furtively

351
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,090
at the gate of Yamen.

352
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,530
Then I followed him.

353
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,500
But he was gone when he came here.

354
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,820
Did you see someone

355
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,660
when you came?

356
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,410
No.

357
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,560
You really followed someone here?

358
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,000
Or what?

359
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,630
I thought you came out
in the middle of night

360
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,800
to flirt with some girl.

361
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,990
It’s such a desolate place.

362
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,160
What girl can I flirt with?

363
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,760
What did you say?

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Nothing.

365
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,400
I mean

366
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,590
I shouldn’t flirt with any girl.

367
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,070
All right. It’s too late.

368
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,000
Let’s get back for sleep.

369
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,690
General Xiao. Your Highness.

370
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,310
Anything unusual?

371
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,760
General Xiao, nothing is unusual.

372
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,260
Only nearby people come to have a look.

373
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,150
As ordered,

374
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,560
we told them that

375
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,390
the mansion’s wall collapsed
because it had been in long disrepair,

376
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,440
and we guarded this place

377
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,710
in case people got hurt.

378
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,310
Good job.

379
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,070
Last time, we didn’t check carefully
in the middle of night.

380
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,680
Now that

381
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,190
Father left this place willingly

382
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,070
and left a corpse,

383
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,800
there must be something else
in this room.

384
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,670
You wanted to borrow soldiers

385
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,280
to search this room?

386
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,210
No.

387
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,880
You mustn’t come in!

388
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,680
Let me in. I come to see His Highness!

389
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,100
General Xiao ordered that

390
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,480
no one could come in,

391
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,790
without the permission
from him or His Highness.

392
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,760
Let her in.

393
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,160
Let her in!

394
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,610
Yes!

395
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,300
What’s the rush?

396
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,380
What happened?

397
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,490
Nothing. Nothing.

398
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,920
When I woke up this morning,

399
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,930
I didn’t see you.

400
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,090
I... I thought...

401
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,410
You thought I broke my promise

402
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,290
and took another coroner
to open the coffin,

403
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,780
instead of you?

404
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,290
Your Highness, it’s not that
I don’t trust you.

405
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,460
I just... I just...

406
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,060
I’m sorry.

407
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,130
What coffin?

408
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,010
Everything’s still in preparation.

409
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
Brother, you’ll know later.

410
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,850
Are you looking for Sir Witch Doctor?

411
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,580
Has the room remained the same

412
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,490
since he left?

413
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,260
Yes.

414
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,100
So, Sir Witch Doctor never planned

415
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,490
to come back again.

416
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,490
No matter where he has gone,

417
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
I will find him.

418
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,820
What will we do now?

419
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,850
Look around for some clues.

420
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,850
Chu Chu, Brother,

421
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,700
don’t take it as a job.

422
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,650
Based on how much you know him,

423
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,500
look for anything

424
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,760
that may be related to him

425
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,830
or about his whereabouts.

426
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,060
Brother.

427
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
What’s this?

428
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,490
It’s...

429
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,290
Chess!

430
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,380
Chess?

431
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,580
Baoying Chess.

432
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,220
It was quite popular
in the Northern Zhou Dynasty.

433
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,540
You can call it Chess.

434
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,300
Chess?

435
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,500
(Elephant)

436
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,820
Chu Chu, did you see this before?

437
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,340
I saw Sir Witch Doctor

438
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
polishing the stones.

439
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,290
But there weren’t any characters

440
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,010
on the stones.

441
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,490
Did he teach you to play chess?

442
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,820
No.

443
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,090
Brother, when you searched the room,

444
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,900
did you see anything like a chessboard?

445
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,370
No.

446
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,180
Brother.

447
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,250
Here it is!

448
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,010
It’s flexible.

449
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,250
Let me try.

450
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,700
(Chess book)

451
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,490
It’s... it’s like an end-game.

452
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,900
Brother, let’s try it.

453
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:48,980
(End-game)

454
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,540
I simply asked for one-day sick leave,

455
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,780
but you caught me home.

456
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,490
If it weren’t for complicated business
in the Ministry of War

457
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,260
and I didn’t know what to do,

458
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,700
I wouldn’t dare to come and disturb you.

459
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,490
When you first work
in the Ministry of War,

460
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,610
you get bullied with a reason.

461
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,560
When you want to apply strict measures,

462
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,440
they also want to deflate you.

463
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,270
You’re Commandery Prince An’s teacher

464
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,710
and my disciple.

465
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,990
It makes sense when they fear you.

466
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,800
Speaking of Commandery Prince An,

467
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,120
since he gave me the copper coin,

468
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,780
he hasn’t contacted me again.

469
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,900
I’m really worried.

470
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,850
But I don’t dare to send him a letter,
without consideration.

471
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,900
I win.

472
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
What... what does it mean?

473
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,130
I don’t understand, either.

474
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,130
Is there any clue?

475
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:51,940
Well,

476
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,050
I’ll try again with the white chessman.

477
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,700
All right.

478
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,370
Commandery Prince An is
always considerate.

479
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,930
When there’s no news,

480
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,460
it means good news.

481
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,120
In the court, no one is better than him

482
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,330
in solving criminal cases.

483
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,860
He’ll solve the illegal coin case

484
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,300
sooner or later.

485
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,010
I worry that

486
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,610
he hasn’t reported this case yet.

487
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,660
Considering his temper,

488
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,130
I’m afraid he’ll make trouble.

489
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,300
I win.

490
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,800
I’ve never improved my skill
in playing chess.

491
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,370
Sorry, Sir.

492
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,300
You don’t have poor skills.

493
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,370
You simply worry too much.

494
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,290
You should give up unnecessary concerns.

495
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,130
Or when you’re lost in worries,

496
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,700
you’ll lose more than gain.

497
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,820
I’ll keep that in mind, Sir.

498
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,470
It’s getting late.

499
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,880
I’ll leave you alone.

500
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,680
It’s a draw.

501
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,480
No one wins or loses?

502
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,070
Yes.

503
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,920
Jinyu, what does it mean?

504
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,740
(Rook)

505
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,220
(Knight)

506
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,340
(Elephant)

507
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,540
(Pawn)

508
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,100
(Rook, Knight, Elephant, Pawn)

509
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,830
What are you doing?

510
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,800
When the last game ended,

511
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,560
these four chessmen were
in the same four squares.

512
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,000
What have you got?

513
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,740
Father wouldn’t take trouble

514
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,510
to leave a useless end-game

515
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,160
without a reason.

516
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,160
There must be some secret
I haven’t figured out yet.

517
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Your Highness,

518
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
everything’s ready on the mountain.

519
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,420
(Xu’s Tomb)

520
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:41,830
The ninth day of the first month,
the first year of Emperor Wenzong.

521
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,630
Father, am I correct?

522
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,310
Yes. You’re right.

523
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,310
The ninth day of the first month
is my birthday.

524
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,230
Is it her birthday, too?

525
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,460
No, it’s not her birthday.

526
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,820
It was the day she died.

527
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,900
She died on the day you were born.

528
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,730
It’s your fate.

529
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,250
Fate?

530
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,900
It...

531
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,780
It means

532
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,130
she’s different to you from others.

533
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,090
Come on, Chu Chu. Kneel.

534
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,490
Burn it for her.

535
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,700
(Xu’s Tomb)
Tell her that today is your birthday

536
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,300
(Xu’s Tomb)
and you’re happy.

537
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,780
Today’s my birthday.

538
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,180
Grandfather bought me a new dress.

539
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,570
Brother wove a little habit for me.

540
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,980
I’m so happy today.

541
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,330
Father, is it all right?

542
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,450
Very good.

543
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,540
Mother, I’ve come to worship you
since I was little.

544
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
But this is the first time

545
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,130
I’ve come as your daughter.

546
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,110
(Xu’s Tomb)

547
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,940
I’m sorry, Mother.

548
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,760
(Xu’s Tomb)

549
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,990
I have to disturb you.

550
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,620
(Xu’s Tomb)

551
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,080
I want to know who you are,

552
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,680
who my father is,

553
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,960
if you suffered injustice,

554
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,680
and if you were wronged.

555
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,870
These things matter a lot to me.

556
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,230
Hope you can understand.

557
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,150
Mother, don’t worry.

558
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,560
Commandery Prince An is the best judge

559
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,230
in this world.

560
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,430
I work for him.

561
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,160
As long as we inspect your corpse,

562
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,000
we’ll know

563
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,560
what you want to tell us.

564
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,920
Mother,

565
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,760
please bless me for everything

566
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,880
if you see it in heaven.

567
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,680
Your Highness, open the coffin.

568
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,280
Do we really ask Miss Chu
to inspect her mother’s corpse?

569
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,230
Don’t worry.

570
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,680
No matter what you do,

571
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,950
your mother won’t blame you.

572
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,430
On the death anniversary
of Prince Consort,

573
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,440
(Jiangshan Hall)
you visited Her Grace for His Majesty.

574
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,680
Was everything all right?

575
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,110
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

576
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,230
Otherwise,

577
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,190
Her Grace would have been annoyed
by Qin Luan again.

578
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,310
I forgot to ask you.

579
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,710
(Jiangshan Hall)
You never went in this hall, did you?

580
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,630
No.

581
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,310
I simply replied before the screen.

582
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,350
Everything in this hall

583
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,590
concerns the safety of our nation.

584
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,430
No one can enter,
but confidential officials.

585
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,710
You’re now the Minister of War.

586
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,400
You can certainly enter the hall.

587
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,860
You no longer need to reply
before the screen.

588
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,980
(Jiangshan Hall)

589
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Your Majesty, Military Commissioner
of Qianzhongdao garrisons

590
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,870
an important fastness in the Southwest.

591
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,660
But Leng Peishan is quite old.

592
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,860
A successor should be picked
as soon as possible.

593
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,290
Xiao Jinli is the son
of a national hero,

594
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,000
and he’s the son of Princess Xiping.

595
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,970
He can be the best candidate.

596
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,990
Xue, you’re now the Minister of War.

597
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,230
What do you think of?

598
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,600
Your Majesty,

599
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,800
I think Senior Jing makes sense.

600
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,030
You also recommend Xiao Jinli?

601
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,830
Yes.

602
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,600
Look at you.

603
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,190
You’re known for being detached

604
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,440
and not seeking fame.

605
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,710
Unexpectedly,

606
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,190
shortly after you become
the Minister of War,

607
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,030
you begin to gang up?

608
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,990
Please understand, Your Majesty.

609
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
I don’t dare to gang up.

610
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,920
Then what do you mean?

611
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,630
In the Army of Qianzhongdao,

612
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,870
Xiao Jinli is never the best candidate

613
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,100
to take over Leng Peishan’s post,

614
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,560
in terms of qualification,

615
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,590
military exploit, or even rank.

616
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,390
Your Majesty, considering qualification,
military exploit or rank,

617
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,280
Xiao Jinli is never the best candidate.

618
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,030
But speaking of stabilizing the nation
and winning people’s support,

619
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,800
Xiao Jinli is the best choice.

620
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,640
Stabilizing the nation
and winning people’s support?

621
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,110
What do you mean?

622
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,530
Your Majesty, the Leng Family has
a deep foundation in the Southwest,

623
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,290
We can’t underestimate their power.

624
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,770
Especially Leng Peishan.

625
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,130
He has tens of thousands
of picked soldiers.

626
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,500
By annihilating bandits
and helping the poor,

627
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,890
he’s quite supported by local people.

628
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,660
So far, a great many people
respond to his call.

629
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,580
Southwestern counties are far away
from Chang’an.

630
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,970
If it goes like this,

631
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,700
I’m afraid he’ll control the Southwest.

632
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,860
Your Majesty, Senior Jing means that

633
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,700
General Leng has been doing his duty,

634
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,650
but he’s getting old.

635
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,780
I understand what he means.

636
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,620
Yes.

637
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,250
Jing, Xiao Jinli’s mother
Princess Xiping

638
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,500
is Leng Peishan’s niece.

639
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,970
If the Leng Family wants
to reign independently,

640
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,180
isn’t promoting Xiao Jinli

641
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,330
exactly what they want?

642
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,700
Think about it, Your Majesty.

643
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,460
That year,

644
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,090
Emperor Wenzong married
Leng Peishan’s sister,

645
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,370
simply to restrain the Leng Family.

646
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,130
Now, his sister has been dead.

647
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,810
Princess Xiping is his only niece.

648
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,780
She can barely restrain the Leng Family.

649
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,720
But if Xiao Jinli can take power
of the Leng Family,

650
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,320
things will be different.

651
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,530
Princess Xiping is his mother.

652
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,410
When his mother and brother
are in Chang’an,

653
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,410
how can he act wildly?

654
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,170
You make sense.

655
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,100
But Leng Peishan will understand
what we plan.

656
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,790
I’m afraid he won’t easily agree.

657
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,970
Your Majesty,
I have a satisfactory plan,

658
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,170
but it’s not very frank.

659
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,920
What is it?

660
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,610
Leng Peishan is old
and his single son died at a young age.

661
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,320
He has no family,
but his granddaughter Leng Yue.

662
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,700
She’s nearly as old as Xiao Jinyu.

663
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,490
They also grew up together.

664
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,550
If she marries Xiao Jinli,

665
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,550
Leng Peishan will cultivate Xiao Jinli

666
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,990
with earnest efforts.

667
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,120
In this way,

668
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,990
you can maintain your relationship
with Leng Peishan

669
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,190
and remove the trouble in the Southwest
without sending any troop.

670
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,880
It doesn’t sound very frank.

671
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,460
But when it can protect people
from a war,

672
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,880
we must choose the lesser one
of two evils.

673
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,800
I can’t let them get married.

674
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,940
Senior Jing.

675
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,960
Senior Jing,
the plan doesn’t sound right.

676
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,120
It’s right.

677
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,670
It’s not a perfect plan.

678
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,600
But it’s already good enough,

679
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,080
when no troops are needed.

680
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,570
But don’t you always say that

681
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,900
you’re a close friend of Prince Consort

682
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,290
and you’ll defend Princess Xiping
and her sons,

683
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,180
no matter what happens?

684
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,570
If General Leng really wants
to reign the Southwest independently,

685
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,330
and he knows this,

686
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,860
Commandery Prince An and General Xiao

687
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,810
will be in great danger.

688
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,740
What a dangerous condition

689
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,070
will Princess Xiping be in?

690
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,600
Have you thought about their safety?

691
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,230
Minister Xue, don’t forget.

692
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,640
My son is with Commandery Prince An now.

693
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,430
He can’t be safe unless His Highness is.

694
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,150
Only His Majesty, you and I
know this plan.

695
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,030
His Majesty and I won’t
let Leng Peishan know it

696
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,510
before it’s time to strike.

697
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,270
As long as you keep it secret,

698
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,030
they’ll be safe.

699
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,360
Yes. I understand.

700
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,160
Your Highness, yesterday my father said

701
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,710
my mother hit the wall and died

702
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,790
with obvious bruises on her forehead?

703
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,600
Yes.

704
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,640
But Your Highness,

705
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,070
when I checked her skull,

706
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,800
there wasn’t any bone fracture
on her forehead.

707
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,230
Instead, there’s fracture
on the back of her head.

708
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,310
There’re ruddy bruises
on both ends of the fracture.

709
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,990
So, she was hurt before she died

710
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,600
and she was badly wounded.

711
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,750
When the back of her head was wounded,

712
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,240
she would certainly die.

713
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,830
You mean she not only hurt her forehead,
when hitting the wall,

714
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,980
but also wounded the back of her head?

715
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,610
No. She didn’t hit the wall.

716
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,770
She was hit
by something blunt intensively.

717
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,050
You mean...?

718
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,410
Your Highness,
my mother didn’t kill herself,

719
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,900
but was murdered!
