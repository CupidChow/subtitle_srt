1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,760
Lord Jing said that

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,000
I still had a chance

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,350
unless His Highness expelled me.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,150
He asked me to learn

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,150
how to please His Highness.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,280
I’ve made up my mind what to do.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,120
But His Highness keeps asking
about Sir Witch Doctor.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,870
Considering he’s so smart,

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,600
if I keep working for him,

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,000
I’m afraid I can no longer
keep the secret.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,540
(Two Merits Hall)

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,110
Take back your handkerchief.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,880
How many identical handkerchiefs
do you have?

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,470
Where are you going?

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,360
I’m going to the Palace.

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,980
=The Imperial Coroner=

17
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,940
=Episode 8=

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,800
No way.

19
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,600
I can no longer stay here.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,360
Where’s my pass?

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,600
Qin Luan, the old fool!

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,750
How reckless he’s getting!

23
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,360
He even dared to bully you like that!

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,440
I’m going to avenge you.

25
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,030
Ridiculous!

26
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,440
I...

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,830
I’m being ridiculous under an order.

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,180
(To Leng Yue)

29
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,520
Knowing I would arrive today,

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,800
Aunt asked someone to wait for me
at the city gate with the letter.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,270
(Princess Xiping)

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,000
She insisted that I should go
to tea gathering in the Palace.

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,670
I didn’t mean to go.

34
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,750
But now, I do.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,190
Stop.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,750
Your Highness! Your Highness!

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,960
Get her in.

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,190
Your Highness.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,830
What happened?

40
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,470
My pass is missing.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,910
Your pass is missing?

42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,110
When did you find it missing?

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,960
Just now.

44
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,270
When I was packing my bag,

45
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,440
I found it missing.

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,320
Why did suddenly pack your bag?

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,830
I...

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I want to go home.

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,080
I didn’t pass the selection test.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,830
And I’ve lost my tools.

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,750
I can do nothing here if I stay.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,550
I want to go home,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,290
make new tools,

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,320
and practice harder
before I come back again.

55
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,440
You failed the test?

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,600
Your Highness, you’re quite partial.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
You even think highly of a useless man

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,190
like Jing Yi.

59
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
She looks sincere.

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
She must be a useful talent.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
She won’t be poorer than Jing Yi.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,830
Wait for me out there.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,040
It doesn’t matter.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,160
I’m going out for some business.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
Go back to your room
and look for your pass carefully.

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
If you still can’t find it,

67
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,720
when Wu Jiang comes back,

68
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,670
tell him

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,760
how you found it missing

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,040
and he will help you.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Silly girl.

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,640
Don’t try to find the Handsome Judge.

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,670
You can’t find him.

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
If you want to say something,

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,230
but no one listens to you,

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,760
look at the pendant

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
and talk to it.

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,390
Pretend I were listening to you.

79
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,510
I’ll keep it carefully.

80
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,270
I believe that

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,070
you’ll be the best coroner.

82
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,390
Also, you must remember.

83
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,880
Do not...

84
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,920
I remember. I remember.

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,070
I won’t tell anyone about you.

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,760
I’ll practice my skills carefully

87
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,230
and become the best coroner.

88
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,510
I will find the Handsome Judge.

89
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,480
Sir Witch Doctor,

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,040
I can no longer stay here.

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
But I can’t leave without the pass.

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,160
Also,

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
I don’t want to leave.

94
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,390
Since I was born,

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,440
he’s been the first man
who allows me to perform the autopsy

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,790
and trusts me.

97
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,350
I want to work for him.

98
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,640
But he keeps asking about the pendant.

99
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,920
He even managed

100
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,550
to portray you.

101
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,160
Sir Witch Doctor,

102
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,000
what do I do?

103
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,320
Should I keep doing

104
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,200
what Lord Jing asked me to do?

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,270
I have something he’s interested in.

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
Then why did he want General Wu

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,200
to help me find my pass,

108
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,270
instead of asking me to stay?

109
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,880
Miss Chu.

110
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,510
General Wu.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Lian Qiao said you wanted to see me?

112
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,320
Yes. My pass is missing.

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
I can’t find it at all.

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
His Highness asked me to tell you

115
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,480
and said you would help me.

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
All right. I’ll help with that.

117
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,480
But Miss Chu,

118
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,320
shall we go to the Ten-Commandment Hall?

119
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,790
Ten-Commandment Hall?

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Yes. His Highness wants you
to do him a favor.

121
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,160
Do him a favor?

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,880
Is he going to let me stay?

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
(Fragrance Chamber)

124
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
(Fragrance Chamber)

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,270
Xiao Jinyu hasn’t arrived yet?

126
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,320
Your Majesty,

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
someone told me that

128
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,200
Commandery Prince An had arrived.

129
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
General Zhou,
are you waiting for someone?

131
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,720
There’s some emergency in Shence Army

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,350
and I need to tell Eunuch Qin about it.

133
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
You mean a soldier in Shence Army

134
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,600
was infected with pestilence

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,640
and died last night?

136
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,760
Such a small problem even disturbed you?

137
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,920
I’m ashamed of that.

138
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,710
How can pestilence be a small problem?

139
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,320
Shence Army is part of Imperial Armies.

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,320
There’s pestilence in Shence Army.

141
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,550
If anything goes wrong

142
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,880
and it spreads into the Palace,

143
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,710
can you take the responsibility?

144
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,230
You’re right, Your Highness.

145
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,640
I know this is very serious.

146
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,200
Last night

147
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,960
when it happened,

148
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
I had the soldier taken out of town,

149
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,520
burned and buried deep,

150
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,520
exactly according to military rules.

151
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,760
It’s very efficient of you.

152
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,000
No wonder Eunuch Qin
thinks highly of you.

153
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,520
I’m simply doing my duty.

154
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,000
Your Highness.

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,520
Your Highness, you said
you were busy with work.

156
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,520
But now you’re free enough

157
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,590
to ask about a sick soldier.

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,520
You’ve done your work so quickly.

159
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,080
I really admire that.

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
But Your Highness,

161
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,880
Shence Army isn’t in your charge.

162
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,760
See you, Your Highness.

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,280
See you, Your Highness.

164
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,760
Have you handled the problem?

165
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,670
Don’t worry.

166
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,150
The soldier was burned.

167
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
He wasn’t burned to ash yet,

168
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,350
but no good skin remained.

169
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,670
I’m late.

171
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
Please punish me.

172
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,200
Your Majesty,

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
the tea’s ready.

174
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,000
Please have a taste.

175
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,110
Good.

176
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,910
Your Majesty, I’ve got something to say.

177
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,790
Minister Feng loved tea before he died.

178
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
He was suddenly killed.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,350
I’ve worked with him for years.

180
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,790
I can’t help thinking of him.

181
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,760
But look at Commandery Prince An.

182
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
He kept disturbing Minister Feng’s home

183
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,000
with a female coroner.

184
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,110
Last night, he even burned
the mourning hall for Minister Feng

185
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,710
and nearly burned his body.

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,590
How can he take charge
of Three Judicial Offices like that?

187
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,910
Please perceive it, Your Majesty.

188
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,230
Your Majesty,

189
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,840
I was there last night.

190
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Commandery Prince An went there
to apologize, under your command.

191
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,880
There was simply a coincidence.

192
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,320
There can’t be such a coincidence.

193
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,440
Everybody in Feng’s Mansion
witnessed that.

194
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,790
But His Highness nearly died
in fire, too.

195
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,150
Get him to me.

196
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,550
Come in, Your Highness.

197
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,960
Your Majesty.

198
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,760
What happened last night?

199
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,960
Last night, someone set on fire.

200
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,790
I’m still checking on the case.

201
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,760
But if the female coroner

202
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,110
I took to the Feng’s Mansion for apology

203
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,440
hadn’t risked her life
to protect Feng Jie’s corpse,

204
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,470
many truths would have been ruined.

205
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,110
Minister Han devotes himself to work

206
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
and he watches out for danger

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,710
as a judge should do at any time.

208
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,760
Also, he doesn’t follow me like sheep.

209
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,470
It’s the luck of our nation.

210
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,080
It’s also our luck
when you give sympathetic consideration.

211
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,320
I’ve got something to say, too.

212
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,230
Someone was infected with pestilence?

213
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,590
How did you know, Miss Chu?

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
These are used for protection

215
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,440
when contacting pestilence victims.

216
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,400
When I was little,

217
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,670
there was pestilence in my hometown.

218
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,790
The magistrate sent men to teach us.

219
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,400
Oh, I remember.

220
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,110
When Manager Xu ran away yesterday,

221
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,230
he was taken out in a carriage

222
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,350
where there was a dead man

223
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,440
who died of pestilence.

224
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,400
You’re right.

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
It was the burned corpse

226
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,840
that was taken out of town

227
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,150
in the carriage.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
In Chang’an,

229
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,710
no news has come about pestilence.

230
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,640
So, His Highness wants you

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
to figure out

232
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,230
if this man died of pestilence.

233
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,590
But there’re many other coroners
in Chang’an.

234
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,320
Why does His Highness want me?

235
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,110
His Highness said

236
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,710
if you failed to figure out

237
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,960
how this man was dead,

238
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,960
no other coroners in Chang’an

239
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,000
would manage to do that.

240
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,110
He really said that?

241
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,350
He trusts my skills so much?

242
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,710
He also said that

243
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,520
even if the corpse was burned,

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,320
it didn’t mean no danger.

245
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,470
If you have any concern,

246
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,170
you can refuse to inspect it.

247
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
No. I have no concern at all.

248
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,590
I’ll inspect it.

249
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Qin Luan.

250
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,710
Here.

251
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,400
Commandery Prince An told me that

252
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,790
a soldier in Shence Army
was infected with pestilence, right?

253
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,760
For your information, Your Majesty,

254
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,350
that’s true.

255
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,790
I was just told, too.

256
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

257
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,320
The infected corpse

258
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,670
was taken out of town immediately,

259
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
burned and buried deep.

260
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
It’s such an important thing.

261
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,000
You simply burned the corpse?

262
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,470
Shence Army guards the Palace.

263
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,280
If you fail to figure out
the real problem

264
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,080
and let the pestilence
spread to the Palace,

265
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,280
different offices,

266
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
or even different parts of the capital,

267
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,230
can you take the responsibility?

268
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,790
Don’t get angry, Your Majesty.

269
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,710
I’ll ask them to...

270
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,470
Don’t bother.

271
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,760
I just asked the Imperial Insignia Guard

272
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,550
to cooperate
with the Imperial Medical Service

273
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,400
and seal off the battalion
of Shence Army.

274
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,440
Those who took the corpse
out of town last night

275
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,710
should all be isolated.

276
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,000
More decision will be made accordingly
in ten days.

277
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,110
I neglected my duty.
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

278
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,910
All right.

279
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Go to the battalion
and keep an eye on epidemic prevention.

280
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,110
This way, Miss Chu.

281
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,080
Where are we?

282
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,200
His Highness said,

283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,000
if you must take some tools
for investigation,

284
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,000
you can choose some

285
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,910
from these.

286
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,910
These are all made of steel.

287
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,590
By the way, General Wu,

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,710
I want to ask.

289
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,790
Can I make autopsy this time?

290
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,590
His Highness said,

291
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,640
coroners in Chang’an are not allowed
to make autopsy

292
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,880
without Permit of Autopsy,

293
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,590
or coroners will be sentenced.

294
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,350
This is the Permit of Autopsy
with an official seal.

295
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,400
His Highness said,

296
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,910
you can do whatever you want.

297
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Moreover, His Highness asked you

298
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,710
to fill in the autopsy sheet
by yourself.

299
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,800
After you finish it,

300
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,680
I’ll send the autopsy sheet to
His Highness immediately.

301
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,070
Okay.

302
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,430
General Wu, rest assured.

303
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,350
Take your time then.

304
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,190
I’m sorry to offend you at
the Thought Chamber today.

305
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,760
Please forgive me.

306
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,110
This case is weird.

307
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,590
Please protect yourself carefully
when investigating.

308
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,920
Be safe.

309
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,820
(Permit of Autopsy)

310
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,190
Xiao Jinyu.

311
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,280
Yes.

312
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,830
You did well in protecting
Feng Jie’s corpse,

313
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,590
but that’s your responsibility.

314
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,110
You disturbed Feng’s Mansion
with a coroner.

315
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,830
It’s your fault.

316
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,560
Look,

317
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,760
I heard

318
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,590
you’re good at making tea.

319
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,350
You can show it here.

320
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,680
If you’re really good at it,

321
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,830
I won’t punish you.

322
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,430
Yes.

323
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,160
Please allow me to
make some preparations.

324
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,430
Please have a look.

325
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I heard Commandery Prince An

326
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,920
is good at painting.

327
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Unexpectedly,

328
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,830
he can make paintings by tea,

329
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,760
showing the scenery
of the four seasons

330
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
in these small cups.

331
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
How amazing!

332
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,310
Thanks to your Majesty,

333
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,430
I can widen my horizon today.

334
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
Some talented persons in the palace

335
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,520
can make paintings by tea, too.

336
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,070
But compared to yours,

337
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,040
it’s nothing at all.

338
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,190
Xiao Jinyu,

339
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,560
What’s in the box?

340
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
What’s it for?

341
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,830
To be frank, Your Majesty,

342
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,430
it’s not designed to make tea,

343
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,680
but it’s helpful to stir the tea
and water,

344
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,830
and produce froth.

345
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,950
So I use it for the moment.

346
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,760
What’s it designed for?

347
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,880
Collect evidence.

348
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,560
Collect evidence?

349
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,470
When investigating lawsuits，

350
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,880
I had to analyze dirty water

351
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,070
to get clues sometimes.

352
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,920
Your Highness.

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,280
If I allow it to be precipitated
by itself,

354
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,830
it will cost a long time.

355
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,470
I may lose the opportunity to
catch the suspects.

356
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,640
I found that

357
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,280
if I rotate and vibrate the dirty water

358
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,350
before the precipitation,

359
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,560
I will need much shorter time.

360
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,520
Therefore…

361
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,350
Enough! Stop it!

362
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,000
I lose my appetite now.

363
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,310
Ridiculous.

364
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,350
Jinbao, throw it away.

365
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
His Majesty loses appetite.

366
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,350
Wait!

367
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,800
Leng Yue?

368
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,160
My greetings, Your Majesty.

369
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,800
It’s been a long time.

370
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,640
You’ve grown up.

371
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,640
Princess Xiping told me

372
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
you’d come here today,

373
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,310
I’ve arranged a seat for you.

374
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,310
Stand up.

375
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,710
Thank you.

376
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,710
Your Majesty,

377
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,920
I heard you lost your appetite
just now,

378
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,280
I want to

379
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,160
take it back for you.

380
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,680
You can make tea, too?

381
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,160
A piece of cake.

382
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,000
And I don’t need these things.

383
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,280
I just want a piece of tea block,

384
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,230
a kettle of boiling water,

385
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,310
a big bowl,

386
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,520
and a sword.

387
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,280
If you’re happy with it,

388
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,400
can I ask for something?

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,590
Okay.

390
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,280
Thank you.

391
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,040
General Wu.

392
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,880
General Wu, don’t worry.

393
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,040
This person didn’t die of plague.

394
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,430
Didn’t he die of plague?

395
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,280
Your Highness.

396
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,230
What’s the result?

397
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,680
Miss Chu has ascertained
the death cause of the corpse.

398
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,950
I forgive you.

399
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,000
Since you believe I’m a good coroner,

400
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,280
I won’t leave.

401
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,710
(Transposition of viscera)
The dead, male, about 30 years old.

402
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,520
Died two days ago.

403
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,400
Whole body burned.

404
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,310
Spine curled up.

405
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,520
Split tibia in the left leg.

406
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,590
(Split tibia)

407
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,160
The third rib on
the right side is broken,

408
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,710
(Viscera injured)

409
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,470
and stabs in the lungs.

410
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,000
(Died of losing blood)

411
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,470
Mouth,

412
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,430
nose

413
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,230
and auditory meatus have
residual blood.

414
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,230
(Nose, soot and charcoal ash, blood)
His rib was broken by external force

415
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,430
and stabbed in the lungs.
He died of losing blood,

416
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,400
not plague.

417
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,470
She’s really a good coroner.

418
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,680
Your Highness, on my way here,

419
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,560
I saw Imperial Medical Service
and Imperial Insignia Guard

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
encircle the camp of Shence Army

421
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,800
with a lot of people.

422
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,350
Should I send

423
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,560
Miss Chu’s investigation results

424
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,880
to Imperial Medical Service?

425
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,710
Don’t bother.

426
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
It’s not bad for them to clear

427
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,760
Shence Army.

428
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,830
And I need them to do this

429
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,070
to help me lock them up
for some days.

430
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,520
By the way, Your Highness,

431
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,230
there’s another thing.

432
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,040
Miss Chu asked about the pass.

433
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
What should I say?

434
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,800
Give her.

435
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,710
Give her?

436
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,040
Tell her it’s found at the hotel

437
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,520
where she lived before.

438
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,000
Your Highness, what if
she leaves Three Judicial Offices?

439
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,140
(…I won’t leave.)

440
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,280
She won’t.

441
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,920
Good! Excellent!

442
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,190
You deserve your identity
from a General Family.

443
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,880
Thank you.

444
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,310
What about my reward?

445
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,280
Reward!

446
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,950
Tell me. What do you want?

447
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:53,950
Your Majesty,

448
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,590
I want Sun Mingde to lead a horse

449
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,800
and show me around Daming Palace.

450
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Okay. I agree.

451
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,040
Thank you.

452
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,800
Sir.

453
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,760
I don’t feel well.

454
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,040
I have a rest here.

455
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,430
I’ll go back now.

456
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,350
Thank you for your help in the matters

457
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,310
involving Feng’s Mansion last night.

458
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,830
Thank you very much.

459
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,470
This…

460
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,070
Here are only you and me.

461
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,230
Tell me the truth.

462
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Did you make autopsy last night

463
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,350
when you went to Feng’s Mansion?

464
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,800
To be honest, sir,

465
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,230
I did take a coroner there.

466
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,160
These are the tools

467
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,760
left behind by the coroner.

468
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,280
You…

469
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,070
You have the right to
investigate all cases.

470
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,070
But Feng Jie’s case,

471
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,280
His Majesty had an order before.

472
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,560
How dare you do this!

473
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,040
Thank you, sir.

474
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
I know I’m wrong.

475
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,680
I have another thing to tell you.

476
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,280
I’ll leave the capital soon

477
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,880
for Qianzhou in the southwest.

478
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,190
Qianzhou? What will you do?

479
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,800
Is it General Xiao…

480
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,040
My brother is fine.

481
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,430
I want to find my father’s whereabouts.

482
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,190
Did His Majesty agree?

483
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
His Majesty will.

484
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,040
You want to find your father
in southwest?

485
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,280
Yes.

486
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,230
It’s been years.

487
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
My mother never mentioned it to me.

488
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,880
I didn’t know what buried

489
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,470
in my father’s tomb was just a set of

490
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,160
clothes until the day before yesterday.

491
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,470
The rebels tried to kill my father
in the southwest at that time.

492
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,680
His whereabouts is a mystery.

493
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,160
It’s affirmed my father was dead

494
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,040
only after Qin Luan and his people

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,560
took back my father’s things.

496
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,680
I believe it’s still suspicious.

497
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,680
Why?

498
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,920
When I was investigating

499
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,070
a murder case in the capital last night,

500
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,830
I found someone has been searching
for news about my father.

501
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,430
It seems they’ve always been
looking for my father for years.

502
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,710
Some people are looking for Xiao Heng?

503
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,000
Who are they?

504
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,110
I haven’t figured it out.

505
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,880
Anyway, they are secretive.

506
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,070
I don’t think they are of goodwill.

507
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,000
I want to

508
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,350
find out my father before they do

509
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
and figure out the details.

510
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,470
It’s my business of managing

511
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,280
criminal cases

512
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,640
as well as my duty as a son.

513
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,280
You have to go to a far place

514
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,070
to look for a missing person.

515
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,000
Any degree of certainty?

516
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,590
Even if there’re only very few clues
about my father,

517
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,160
I’d like to put all efforts in trying.

518
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,520
It’s hard for you
to be so loyal and filial.

519
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,710
In this case,

520
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,160
I’d help you.

521
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,560
You are allowed to check it
in the southwest.

522
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

523
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,520
I have another thing to report.

524
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,560
Eunuch Sun, thank you

525
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,590
for helping me to stay.

526
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,520
Hey.

527
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,160
You are welcome.

528
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,520
Sun Mingde.

529
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,830
Yes.

530
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,760
Your Majesty!

531
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,520
Go get the brocade cloak
offered by Shengzhou

532
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,800
and give it to Commandery Prince An.

533
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

534
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,190
It’s cold in the morning and evening
in the mountainous southwest.

535
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,430
Pay more attention to your health.

536
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

537
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,280
You may raise.

538
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,280
What else? Just go on.

539
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
Your Majesty, I’ve made it clear

540
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,520
that Feng Jie, Minister of War,

541
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,800
Liu Yue, Director of
the Ministry of Revenue,

542
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,040
whose accidental death
was reported last month,

543
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,590
Representative Lu Chuansheng
of Capital Liaison Office in Qianzhou,

544
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,920
were all killed by killers supported
by Rugui House.

545
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,830
What?

546
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,070
The cases are very complicated.

547
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,310
(Memorial)
I’ve reported all into it.

548
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,710
Please take a look.

549
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,160
Why did the killers kill the three?

550
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,190
Not just three of them.

551
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,070
Who else?

552
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,040
At the end of last year,

553
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,470
I found officers

554
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,070
died of accident

555
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,350
during the year were nearly 30%

556
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,350
more than that of the years before.

557
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,880
I didn’t think it’s normal.

558
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,400
Last night, I checked the files again

559
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,230
when I found out the cause
of Feng Jie’s death,

560
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,310
I figured out

561
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,040
those killers created many of

562
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,520
the accidental death cases.

563
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,350
Who appointed them?

564
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,760
Why did they kill the courtiers?

565
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,710
Not only courtiers.

566
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,710
I checked all accidental death cases

567
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,160
in the capital for recent ten years.

568
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,190
I found not only officers

569
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,950
but also the servants and singers

570
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,710
have been killed by them.

571
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,280
These people don’t have any relation.

572
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,560
That’s not over.

573
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,680
Rugui House also has a
underground backroom.

574
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,710
A lot of surveillance records are there.

575
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,640
Almost the whole Chang’an

576
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,160
has been involved in it.

577
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
What does that mean?

578
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,880
Rugui House is doing business,

579
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,950
a hotel in front

580
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,710
but killing behind.

581
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,760
Also

582
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,430
information dealing.

583
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,470
Xu Rugui

584
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,920
is just a businessman.

585
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,640
He has no root in Chang’an.

586
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
But he can do such business

587
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,110
in the capital for over ten years

588
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,310
without being found.

589
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,880
There must be someone backing him.

590
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,760
What I’m more worried about is

591
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,470
the payer for killing

592
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,110
Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng and Feng Jie.

593
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,710
Go on!

594
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,760
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

595
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,110
It’s produced in Qianzhou. What’s wrong?

596
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,800
Your Majesty, this is official.

597
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,040
This is illegal.

598
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,310
Illegal?

599
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,110
The day before yesterday,

600
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,520
I got several illegal cooper coins

601
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,400
from a Qianzhou business team

602
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,520
by accident in the West Market.

603
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,160
(Kaiyuan Coin)
So I asked people to pay attention.

604
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,110
(2-Zhu in weight, red, mixed with copper and tin)
We found nearly 20% of the currency

605
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,190
(2.4-Zhu in weight, in copper)
circulated in the markets in Chang’an

606
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,950
is illegal.

607
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
(Fake Real)
When I went to the test for coroners,

608
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,880
I met a coroner from Qianzhou.

609
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,230
80% of her money

610
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,190
was illegal.

611
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,280
You are right.

612
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,880
It’s well duplicated.

613
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,590
But

614
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,350
the fineness is a bit different.

615
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,710
It can mix the false.

616
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,640
Why is that?

617
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,070
There must be someone

618
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,350
who are making illegal cooper coins.

619
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,400
Liu Yue was the Director
of the Ministry of Revenue.

620
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,400
One of his duties is making coins.

621
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,920
Yes.

622
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,000
I guess this is the reason
for Liu Yue’s death.

623
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Lu Chuansheng,

624
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,640
Capital Liaison Representative
of Qianzhou,

625
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,350
was responsible for the liaison
of affairs

626
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,470
between Qianzhou and Capital.

627
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,800
If there is illicit coin casting
in Qianzhou,

628
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,350
he should be the one to report it.

629
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,560
As well as Feng Jie.

630
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,400
He went to the southwest
to inspect military affairs

631
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,800
and was assassinated on the night
he returned to the Capital.

632
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,920
I have read his inspection minutes,

633
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,560
but I didn’t find anything abnormal.

634
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,920
But whether he really didn’t
find anything abnormal,

635
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,070
we’ll never know.

636
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,880
Your Majesty,

637
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,920
army, money and news…

638
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,110
All these three anomalies

639
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,760
are from the Southwest.

640
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,230
I speculate that

641
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,470
the buyer’s intentions are malicious

642
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,310
and may endanger the stability
of the Southwest.

643
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,400
How dare them!

644
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,590
Your Majesty, when I searched
Rugui House last night,

645
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,520
Xu Rugui had escaped

646
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,920
and destroyed a large number
of surveillance records.

647
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,560
In the remaining records,

648
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,470
the one about my father was left.

649
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,160
It seems that someone wants me
to investigate this matter.

650
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,230
Since all the clues point to
the Southwest,

651
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,520
I plan to play along

652
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,470
to find my father’s whereabouts

653
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,920
and secretly investigate the anomalies
of the Southwest

654
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
to draw the buyer and seller out.

655
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,760
In order not to alert the enemy,

656
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,190
Your Majesty,

657
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,670
please withhold the information
of this case from the public.

658
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,710
After I find out the truth

659
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,600
and capture the buyer and seller,

660
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,840
you can close the case.

661
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,080
Okay.

662
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,710
I grant you the prerogative

663
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,950
to investigate this case.

664
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

665
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,320
Oh, right.

666
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,840
About Yan Ming’s case,

667
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,600
after the murderer committed suicide,
there is no follow-up.

668
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,280
Is it also related to the Southwest?

669
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,150
I’m still investigating it.

670
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,360
I’ll entrust you with the safety

671
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,000
of the people in the Southwest.

672
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,710
This trip is very dangerous.

673
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,520
Do you need me to send more guards
to protect you?

674
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,040
Your Majesty, my trip
to the Southwest this time

675
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,950
is in the name of finding
my father’s whereabouts.

676
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,150
If there are many people
accompanying me,

677
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,670
I am afraid that I will cause suspicion

678
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,670
and get into trouble instead.

679
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,630
Your Majesty, please allow one person

680
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,520
to go to the Southwest with me.

681
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,950
Who is that?

682
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,950
Vice Minister of the Court
of Judicial Review, Jing Yi.

683
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,760
Let me ask you.

684
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,040
Why did Commandery Prince An

685
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,080
want to look for his father?

686
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,120
It’s because of that coroner.

687
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,360
I’ve investigated her.

688
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,710
She is not involved in any parties
in Chang’an.

689
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,670
In the future,

690
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,560
you should be more careful with her.

691
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,870
You must also go to the Southwest
with Commandery Prince An.

692
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,000
Why should I go there?

693
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,430
I have things to do in Chang’an.

694
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,560
To do what?

695
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,190
Are you still thinking about Leng Yue?

696
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,040
Let me tell you.

697
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,190
If Commandery Prince An

698
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,560
asks His Majesty for you,

699
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,670
then you have to go.

700
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Father, do you think this girl

701
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,040
has something to do with Prince Consort?

702
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,760
Why do you say so?

703
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,120
In addition to the jade pendant

704
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,800
of Prince Consort and Princess Xiping,

705
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,670
she also has several volumes of legends.

706
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,190
According to His Highness,

707
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,430
the cases in the legends

708
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,950
are adapted from the previous cases

709
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,630
handled by the Prince Consort.

710
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,230
Apart from His Highness
and Prince Consort,

711
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,630
you’re the one who’s most familiar
with these.

712
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,280
Legends?

713
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:14,950
Yes.

714
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
There is a Handsome Judge in it.

715
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,670
Handsome Judge?

716
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,120
Jing, please speak your mind.

717
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,280
Your Grace,

718
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,120
you’ve handled several big cases
in a month.

719
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,560
I heard someone call you Judge

720
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,840
behind your back.

721
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,360
They calling me Judge

722
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,560
means that I’m just doing the right job.

723
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,040
Only when someone calls me
Impartial Judge

724
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,190
does it mean I’m doing a great job.

725
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,560
Impartial Judge? No way.

726
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,870
Why is that?

727
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,040
Take a look at yourself.

728
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,520
You’re not an Impartial Judge,

729
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,870
but a Handsome Judge.

730
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,600
Otherwise, Princess Xiping
may not be happy.

731
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,710
Jing, you’re making fun of me.

732
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,710
So you gave him that name.

733
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,430
I was just joking.

734
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,870
When I said this,

735
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,280
there was no one else but the two of us.

736
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,120
If anyone knew about this,

737
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,630
it would be Prince Consort himself.

738
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,470
Could it be…?

739
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,040
Could it be that Prince Consort
is in Qianzhou

740
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,360
and still alive?
