1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,440
Why are there so many

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,840
strange things in Chang’an?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,600
Prince An really looks like
the Handsome Judge.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,110
But there is no scar on him.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,680
Minister Feng also died
in a strange way.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,760
Even the owner of a restaurant

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,520
is unspeakably strange.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,950
The owner asked me
to bring you some beauties...

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,590
Some fruits.

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,790
Put it there.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,940
Chu Chu.

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,360
Watch your demeanor.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,150
If you want to
take advantage of His Highness,

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,840
you won’t just be fined.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,260
I...

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,110
I didn’t want to take advantage of him.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,390
I was saving him.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,150
Save him?

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,710
You almost scared him to death.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,560
There are people who are still alive
when their hearts stop beating.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,400
It can make the heart

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,830
beat again in this way.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,390
Many physicians know it.

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,390
But it doesn’t work every time.

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,470
It also depends on
how lucky the patient is.

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,320
Few physicians dare to use it.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,710
They are afraid of being
accused of killing the patients.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,780
=The Imperial Coroner=

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,820
=Episode 4=

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,120
(Jiangshan Hall)

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,540
If all the officials of Tang

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,430
become Wine Immortals like Li Bai,

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,710
what should the court do?

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,640
What should the country do?

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,360
What should the people do?

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,110
To count on me alone?

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,750
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
Go to draft an edict now.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,390
The seventh-rank officials
or above in the capital

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,030
are not allowed to gather and drink

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,180
on non-holiday occasions.

42
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,790
Those who break the rule will be
dismissed and severely punished.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,070
Your Majesty, what about
the canonization of Feng Jie...

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
Let’s talk about it later.

46
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,920
By the way,

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,470
Go back and tell your precious student.

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,150
He caught the murderer
before the deadline

49
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,080
and Yan Ming’s case can be closed.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
But he should handle
his social relations properly.

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,390
He has to do it

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,080
even he fakes it.

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,550
Ask him to go to Feng’s Mansion
and offer his condolences.

54
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,280
Tell him

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,470
this is an imperial edict.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,230
Your Majesty.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,160
Commandery Prince An has offered
his condolences in Feng’s Mansion.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
He did?

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
I dare not deceive Your Majesty.

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,990
When the morning court ended,

61
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,670
Senior Jing and I
went to Feng’s Mansion

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,640
and we ran into Commandery Prince An.

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,870
Go ahead.

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,920
Hurry up.

65
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
You are saying

66
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,830
there was a physician

67
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,470
who saved him like that?

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,830
Based on the bruise and the scratches,

69
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
it should be a female physician.

70
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,720
A female physician...

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,020
I got it.

72
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,880
Feng Jie’s second wife comes from

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,670
a family which runs a medical clinic.

74
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,080
I found it weird
when I was in Feng’s Mansion.

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,320
The Housekeeper Feng looked suspicious

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,670
when he mentioned the Second Lady.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
He must be hiding something.

78
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,390
Your Highness, have you noticed

79
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,670
what Madam Feng said?

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,630
Chu Chu said that when ashes
fall on the deceased,

81
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,230
it means the dead soul is
protesting against an injustice.

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,030
Then Madam Feng immediately said

83
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,000
“don’t slander our Master”.

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,640
Slander?

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
Chu Chu meant
that an injustice was done to him,

86
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,440
why would she call it slander?

87
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,020
What do you think?

88
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,950
I wasn’t thinking of anything.

89
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,110
But when I saw you two...

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,720
Doing that...

91
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,950
I got something.

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,240
I think Feng Jie
indulged himself too much

93
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,590
and died under a skirt.

94
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,800
It must be like this last night.

95
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,460
Feng Jie drank too much
at the welcome banquet.

96
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,660
The Second Lady served him
after he went home.

97
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,740
Absence makes the heart grow founder.

98
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,020
When they were doing it,

99
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,080
Feng Jie suddenly fell ill.

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,950
The Second Lady who knows
a little medical skills tried to save him,

101
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,310
but she failed.

102
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,470
The Feng’s Mansion worried
that the cause of Feng Jie’s death

103
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,020
would bring shame to them.

104
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,200
That’s why they said
Feng Jie died of a sudden illness.

105
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,590
The Feng family wants to
cover the disgrace up.

106
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,750
That’s why when Chu Chu said
that the deceased was wronged,

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Madam Feng blurted out

108
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,240
the word, “slander”.

109
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,750
Chu Chu.

110
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,640
What do you think about

111
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,200
Jing Yi’s analysis?

112
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,120
I don’t know.

113
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,390
That’s not enough

114
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,500
for explaining how he died.

115
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,110
But I can tell

116
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,920
that Minister Feng
was healthy and strong.

117
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,500
He didn’t drink too much before he died.

118
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,430
At least he didn’t die of drinking.

119
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,790
As for whether he died under a skirt

120
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,590
just like Mr. Jing said,

121
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,030
I need a thorough autopsy
before I can know it.

122
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,870
What autopsy do you need?

123
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,790
Feng Jie died at his home.

124
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,950
He didn’t die in a brothel.

125
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,260
It’s not wrong to say that he died of

126
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,520
a sudden illness, right?

127
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,030
Why take it so seriously?

128
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,710
No one will look good

129
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,260
if we reveal the true cause
of his death.

130
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,750
And you will be blamed for it.

131
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,960
Your Highness, when I
looked at Minister Feng,

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,990
I felt that he had a lot to say to me.

133
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,550
He has a lot to say to you?

134
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Everyone has something
to say before they die.

135
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,660
It’s just that some people
have time to say it,

136
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,800
and some people don’t,

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,040
Those who have no time to say it

138
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
will leave these words on their bodies.

139
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,400
Some words are said through the scars.

140
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,430
Some are said through the posture.

141
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,510
Some are said
through their relationships

142
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,550
with other people.

143
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,910
The coroner’s job is to

144
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,920
interpret these words

145
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,310
to those who are alive.

146
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,080
Who told you that?

147
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,790
Did the Handsome Judge said that?

148
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,080
Yes, he said that.

149
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,590
Have you also heard of it?

150
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,750
It’s also written in
Father’s personal letter.

151
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
How did she know it?

152
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,910
I once read it in a book.

153
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,780
What book?

154
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,640
Is it the Legend of
the Nine Constables in Six Gates?

155
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,660
What legend?

156
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,990
The Legend of
the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

157
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,920
It was in this book that I read about

158
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
Six Gates and the Handsome Judge.

159
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,270
Did you also read that book?

160
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,600
Is there any copy of this legend?

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
Yes, it’s in my bag.

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,590
If you want to read it,

163
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,200
I’ll bring it to you when I get back to
the Three Judicial Offices.

164
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,840
Okay.

165
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,240
Chu Chu, are you willing to
check Minister Feng’s body again?

166
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,350
Can I?

167
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,960
Yes.

168
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,600
Again?

169
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,100
Really? That’s great.

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

171
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,920
I should thank you.

172
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,960
Let’s eat.

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
A few days ago, you said

174
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,270
that the Emperor set a time limit for
Commandery Prince An to solve a case.

175
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,640
Today is the deadline.

176
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,990
Has the case been solved?

177
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,660
Kind of.

178
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,990
Don’t be ambiguous.

179
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,470
What do you mean kind of?

180
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
The murderer was arrested.

181
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,510
But she committed suicide in the prison
of the Court of Judicial Review

182
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,800
The prison of the Court
of Judicial Review?

183
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,360
Then our son...

184
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Did you lie to me?

185
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,710
He didn’t come back for meal today.

186
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,920
Does the Emperor ask him to stay
and want to punish him?

187
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,270
Madam, when did I lie to you?

188
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,240
Jing Yi is fine.

189
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,150
Didn’t Prince An take the blame

190
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,120
for whatever mistakes they made
in the Three Judicial Offices?

191
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,840
When did you hear

192
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,350
that he pushed out his subordinates

193
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,680
and let them take the blame?

194
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,150
Is Commandery Prince An okay?

195
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,750
He is fine.

196
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,990
Han Ji and his fellows
spoke ill of him.

197
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,960
Why?

198
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,920
Those who don’t work
speak ill of those who work.

199
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,240
I think Han Ji and his fellows

200
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,340
are just useless ducks.

201
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,590
They only quack all day.

202
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,840
Did you speak for Prince An?

203
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,870
Yes, I did.

204
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,080
Madam, don’t worry.

205
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
It’s over now.

206
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,360
By the way,

207
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,270
I heard that Commandery Prince An

208
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,360
went to Feng’s Mansion in person
to express condolences.

209
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,310
Did he bring a maid with him?

210
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,060
It’s not a maid, but a coroner.

211
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,030
A coroner?

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,710
Did Commandery Prince An
really let a girl pass the test?

213
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,400
I don’t know if she passed.

214
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,840
But he is definitely interested in her.

215
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,520
(Two Merits Hall)
Your Highness, you are finally back.

216
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
Does Mother send someone here again?

217
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,590
How did you know that?

218
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,710
Wu Jiang, you have been
serving Prince An for so long.

219
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,960
Don’t you know that he has a third eye?

220
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,750
Your Highness.

221
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,820
Aunt Banxia said

222
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,710
the Princess asked you to
see her as soon as you come back.

223
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,430
Otherwise she will come to see you.

224
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,960
Did Leng Yue reply?

225
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,710
Not yet.

226
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,150
Leng Yue? What happened to Leng Yue?

227
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Send someone to rush her.

228
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,510
Yes.

229
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,550
Leng Yue is back?

230
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,960
Your Highness. Your Highness.

231
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,360
Your Highness, tell me about it.

232
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,750
Your Highness.

233
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,750
Your Highness.

234
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,670
Tell me about it. Tell me.

235
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,160
You’ve had the meal and the tea.

236
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,400
Your tongue is glibber now.

237
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,520
Don’t you have something
to report to me?

238
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah.

239
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
You were right about it.

240
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,280
There is such a person
in the Shence Army.

241
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,960
Last night he suddenly
asked for leave to go home.

242
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
There is no trace of him.

243
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
This is the military record.

244
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,310
His physical features are on it.

245
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,520
Your Highness.

246
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,990
Last night, you asked me to
investigate it this morning.

247
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,720
You also took the morning court
off for me.

248
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
You are taking the blame

249
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,400
for the dancer’s suicide, aren’t you?

250
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,840
It was my fault being careless.

251
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,870
That’s what I should do.

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,990
But I interrogated her.

253
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,540
I asked you to do it.

254
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,080
You are even tougher than my father.

255
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,390
Being beaten one hundred times
by my father

256
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,310
is easier to bear than what you did.

257
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,140
How should I pay you back?

258
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,160
By marrying you?

259
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,870
You’d better serve me.

260
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,140
Looks like it is Qin Luan

261
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,400
who wants to catch Chu Chu.

262
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,950
But why does he want to catch Chu Chu?

263
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,910
Nothing good will happen

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,280
if being targeted by these eunuchs.

265
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,550
What about being targeted by you?

266
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,910
What do you want to say?

267
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,550
I’m saying

268
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,140
you are not just curious

269
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,750
about Feng Jie’s death, right?

270
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
Are you interrogating me?

271
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,230
Not at all.

272
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,230
I won’t ask you anymore.

273
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,550
Pretend that you are interrogating me,

274
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,600
think about it,

275
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,310
is there no clue?

276
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,350
Clue...

277
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,310
Over the past one month,
Feng Jie is the third official

278
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,480
who died mysteriously in the capital.

279
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,870
The third official who died
in less than a month...

280
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,280
But they died in public.

281
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,160
In public,

282
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,870
people still can get killed.

283
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,830
Just as fatal diseases don’t always

284
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,910
have obvious symptoms at first.

285
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,750
The most vicious killers might be hiding

286
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,350
behind the seemingly ordinary deaths.

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,900
If we don’t find it out soon,

288
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,110
the consequences can be disastrous.

289
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Your Highness, his family members
said nothing.

290
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
Why do you keep looking into it?

291
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,030
You should use the time

292
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,960
to get more sleep.

293
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Look at you red eyes.

294
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,840
By the way,

295
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,910
I’ve interrogated
the three tomb robbers.

296
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,020
They confessed everything.

297
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,340
I made a list

298
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,660
and sent my men to arrest
the people on the list.

299
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,670
Three or five days later,

300
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,160
the grave robbers in the capital

301
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
can have a party in prison.

302
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
Your Highness, Qin Luan came.

303
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,700
What is he doing here?

304
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,070
He said he came to announce
the Emperor’s verbal edict.

305
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,790
He insists on coming in.

306
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,910
He should be at the gate now.

307
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,230
It won’t be a good thing.

308
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,840
Jing Yi.

309
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,040
Are the three grave robbers
still in the prison?

310
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Yes.

311
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Go to the Court of
the Judicial Review’s prison for me.

312
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,540
Give them a chance
to atone for their crime.

313
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,280
Atone for their crime?

314
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
Do you want to dig out
the two buried capital officials

315
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,160
and do an autopsy again?

316
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
Be careful and leave from behind.

317
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,270
Don’t let Qin Luan see you.

318
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,110
Rest assured.

319
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,720
(Two Merits Hall)
You...!

320
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,200
You nasty minions.

321
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,200
Damn!

322
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,160
Commandery Prince An has arrived!

323
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,630
Eunuch Qin.

324
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,520
Your Highness.

325
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,230
Take a look.

326
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,750
I’m here to announce
the Emperor’s oral message.

327
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,830
Take a look.

328
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,390
They won’t even let me in.

329
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,230
Your Three Judicial Offices
is well guarded indeed.

330
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,670
Not really.

331
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,950
It’s just a place to store
the case files.

332
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,390
Unauthorized people are not allowed in.

333
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,600
Am I also unauthorized?

334
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,790
Fine, fine.

335
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,430
Commandery Prince An.

336
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,870
Today you brought a coroner
to Feng’s Mansion

337
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,840
and desecrated

338
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,020
the body of the Minister of War,

339
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,270
Feng Jie, in the name of mourning.

340
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,400
The Feng family has
told the Emperor about what you did.

341
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,840
Here is the imperial verbal edict.

342
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,430
Commandery Prince An,
Xiao Jinyu, is ordered

343
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,950
to apologize to
the Feng family in person.

344
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,720
If he disturbs the burial
of Minister Feng again,

345
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
he will be severely punished.

346
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,350
Commandery Prince An.

347
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,990
I hope you know what you are doing.

348
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,520
Let’s go.

349
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,750
It’s rare for Qin Luan
to do something good.

350
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,200
Now we have a reason to visit
Feng’s Mansion again.

351
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,830
Master.

352
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,200
I’ve delivered it.

353
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
You are...

354
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,030
The Emperor gave an order

355
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,430
to send these things to Feng’s Mansion.

356
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,990
Master.

357
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,520
Okay, go.

358
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,600
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

359
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,220
I’ve checked the female coroner

360
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,870
from the Southwest.

361
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
This female coroner

362
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,310
is from Pingle Town,
Guanling County, Qianzhou.

363
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,600
However, her mother has
passed away for years

364
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,520
when this female coroner was born.

365
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,830
what did you say?

366
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,280
When she was born,

367
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,870
her mother has been dead for years?

368
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,310
Did she pop out

369
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,190
from her mother’s grave?

370
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,040
That’s what is weird.

371
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,310
This female coroner’s father
is called Chu Ping.

372
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,510
It’s ascertained

373
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,480
that he only married one woman.

374
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,040
His wife

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,020
died when she gave birth to

376
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,640
his eldest son, Chu He.

377
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,630
In the tenth year of Taihe,

378
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,910
he somehow had a daughter,

379
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,990
which is this female coroner.

380
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,200
Xiao Heng died in the Southwest
and no one has seen his body.

381
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,430
Less than a year later,

382
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,310
a coroner’s family in Southwest

383
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,640
somehow had a daughter.

384
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,950
Now this daughter came to Chang’an

385
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,310
with Xiao Heng’s relics.

386
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,040
How can there be such a
coincidence in the world?

387
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,280
In this case,

388
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,140
could she be a bastard

389
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,750
of Xiao Heng?

390
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,750
Are you asking me?

391
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,100
Master, calm your anger.

392
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,470
I’ll go to find it out.

393
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,140
Get away!

394
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,840
Yes.

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
Your Highness,
Miss Chu presents herself.

396
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,790
Let her in.

397
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,350
Yes.

398
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,840
Your Highness, you are back.

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,750
This is the Legend of
the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

400
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,550
It’s all here.

401
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,910
Thank you.

402
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,700
(When someone dies,
the coroner goes to the land...)

403
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,990
Did you write it?

404
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,200
No, I heard of these stories
from other people.

405
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,790
I didn’t write these stories.

406
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,640
I mean the handwriting.

407
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,870
Yes.

408
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,840
How do you recognize my handwriting?

409
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,720
I read your exam application form.

410
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,660
So I can recognize your handwriting.

411
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,310
You remember it just with one glance?

412
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,600
That’s amazing

413
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,600
Your Highness.

414
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,670
When can I check Minister Feng’s again?

415
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,110
Your Highness.

416
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,430
Come in.

417
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,110
Your Highness, Jing Yi is back.

418
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,870
Let’s forget about Feng Jie now.

419
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,550
I have two bodies

420
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,600
that I need you to check.

421
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,400
No problem.

422
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
Do I need to dress up
as a maid this time?

423
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,640
No need.

424
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
You’ll do it here.

425
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
Get down.

426
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,200
Your Highness.

427
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,400
Your Highness.

428
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,550
Your Highness, it has been done

429
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,600
according to your instructions.

430
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,310
No one will find out

431
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,520
these two tombs are already empty.

432
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,550
You know what,

433
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,200
the craftsmanship of
these three bumpkins

434
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,230
is pretty amazing.

435
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,190
No, it’s outrageous.

436
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,910
Outrageous!

437
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,400
Where are the bodies?

438
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,550
In the autopsy room with the coffins.

439
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,720
Okay.

440
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,750
Send them to
the interrogation room first

441
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,110
and give them some food.

442
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
Find some people to keep an eye on them.

443
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,990
After Chu Chu finishes,

444
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,080
ask them to take the coffins back
to where they were.

445
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,350
Yes.

446
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,720
Move.

447
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,720
Is there an autopsy room
and an interrogation room?

448
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,550
What’s wrong?

449
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,910
Is there a place to store
the evidence of the pending case

450
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,750
and a place to do all kinds of
analysis and research?

451
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,140
How do you know that?

452
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,340
I heard of it.

453
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,910
That’s the house of the Handsome Judge.

454
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,540
He built a yard at his house.

455
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,100
There is an autopsy room,
an interrogation room,

456
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
a place to store the evidence
of the pending cases,

457
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,750
and a place to do analysis and research.

458
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,080
It’s just like...

459
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,200
It’s just like this place.

460
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,270
Are you the Handsome Judge?

461
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,880
You must be the Handsome Judge!

462
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
How old were you when you first

463
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,550
heard about these things?

464
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,360
Six.

465
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,940
When you were six,

466
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,240
I was also a child.

467
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,910
Even though I’m talented,

468
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,390
there is no way I could

469
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,030
build a yard for myself.

470
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,240
Right.

471
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,240
But...

472
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,600
Your house...

473
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,120
This house was built
in the last two years.

474
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,510
It’s just a coincidence.

475
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,240
How can there be so many coincidences?

476
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,840
Someone.

477
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

478
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,220
Take Miss Chu to the autopsy room.

479
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,820
Yes.

480
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,550
Miss Chu, please.

481
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,760
Is this the legend of the constables?

482
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,880
This is not a legend at all.

483
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,310
Wu Jiang.

484
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,270
Your Highness.

485
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,550
Ask Lian Qiao

486
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,630
to send some clothes to her

487
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,240
and find a chance to take her pass.

488
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,510
But she needs the pass
to leave Chang’an.

489
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,790
Got it, Your Highness.

490
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,430
There is a strike injury
in the left eye socket.

491
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,600
There is a bruise in the right back
of the head and it’s swollen.

492
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,670
Well...

493
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,310
Your Highness, I still don’t get it.

494
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,880
What does this mean?

495
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,430
These stories

496
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,480
are all adapted from the cases

497
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,720
my father worked on.

498
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,120
Your father’s cases...

499
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,670
Are you sure?

500
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,670
I know the files of every case

501
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
he worked on by heart.

502
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,720
Jing Yi.

503
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,270
If I remember it correctly,

504
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,430
apart from me and my father,

505
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,790
there is only one person

506
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,790
who is familiar with these cases.

507
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,550
My father?

508
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,910
You are suspecting that Chu Chu
works for my father?

509
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,680
I swear with my father’s

510
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,080
salary of this year.

511
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,150
I met Chu Chu at the gate of Chang’an.

512
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,030
I’ve told you everything.

513
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,910
You can verify it
if you don’t believe me.

514
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,180
There were a lot of people
on the street.

515
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,200
And the caravan.

516
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,390
All of them can testify.

517
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,510
Take it easy.

518
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,510
I’m just sorting out
all the possibilities.

519
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,790
This is really impossible.

520
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,310
Your Highness, my father is skilled in

521
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,670
planting his people
in all kinds of places.

522
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
How would he send someone

523
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,310
with a suspicious identity?

524
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,120
Secondly,

525
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,200
you’ve been avoiding women.

526
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,790
My mother knows it
better than anyone else.

527
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,600
Even if my father wants to
plant a coroner by your side,

528
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,550
he wouldn’t find a girl.

529
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,760
Thirdly,

530
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,510
this girl is pretty silly.

531
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,430
She is not like someone
who can work for the Jing family.

532
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,510
Your Highness.

533
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,840
Have you finished it?

534
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,630
Your Highness, can I ask you
a question first?

535
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,910
Go ahead.

536
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,720
Do these two deceased have any

537
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,030
relationship with Minister Feng?

538
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
Why do you ask that?

539
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,550
When I looked at Minister Feng today,

540
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,820
I found an injury on his

541
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,630
right brow bone.

542
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,150
It’s a strike injury.

543
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,150
Generally speaking,

544
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,000
this kind of injury isn’t enough
to kill anyone.

545
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,870
And medicine had been used
on that injury

546
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,310
before he died.

547
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,840
When I checked those two dead men,

548
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,580
I found the same injury

549
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,960
in the same place on their heads.

550
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,510
Do you know

551
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,510
how they got that injury?

552
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,340
It’s not one injury,

553
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,420
but two.

554
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,390
Two injuries?

555
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,880
One in the front, one in the back.

556
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,510
I’m not sure how they got it.

557
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,670
But I can give it a try.

558
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,390
Pretend that I am the killer
and you are the dead?

559
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,430
Is it okay?

560
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,880
I’ll be the dead man
who fell into the water.

561
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,720
He had the fewest injuries

562
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,910
and is the easiest to tell.

563
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,910
Okay.

564
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,840
There is a strike injury
inside the right arm.

565
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,390
It should be caused by a punch.

566
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,240
There is a bruise
on the left shoulder blade

567
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,030
which is caused by
hitting a smooth hard object.

568
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,270
There is a bruise on the
right forearm near the wrist bone.

569
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,310
There is also a strike injury
on the left eye socket

570
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,080
and an injury by collision
on the right back of the head.

571
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,030
You are...

572
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,880
fighting?

573
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,480
In this case,

574
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,340
they all fought with
someone before they died?

575
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,910
And the person who fought with them

576
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,580
intentionally hit them on the face

577
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,600
in the same place?

578
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,820
That’s impossible.

579
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,480
Feng Jie is a third-rank minister
in his fifties.

580
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,670
Who could he fight with?

581
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,120
What’s more,

582
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,000
Liu Yue, the Minister of Revenue,

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,430
fell off the horse

584
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,560
and many people saw it

585
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,600
and later died.

586
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,760
He might get the injury on his head
from falling off the horse.

587
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,480
No, it can’t be.

588
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,840
The injury on his head

589
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,720
was made earlier than his injury
from falling off the horse.

590
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,750
No medicine was used on it.

591
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,150
He didn’t get it in a fall.

592
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,790
And eye sockets are sunken inward.

593
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,510
They are the lowest places on the face.

594
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,060
Even if he fell on his face,

595
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,760
it was hard to hit his eye sockets.

596
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,390
I said before that

597
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
the injury in his eye socket

598
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,700
was caused by a punch,

599
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,120
instead of hitting the ground.

600
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,390
You are saying

601
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,390
that punch in the face

602
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
was the fatal injury
for the three of them?

603
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,120
No, that’s not what I’m saying.

604
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I am saying

605
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,390
the three of them all have
two similar injuries

606
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
in about the same places on their heads.

607
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,270
Based on their stature and injuries,

608
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,630
it should be the same person
who injured them.

609
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
However,

610
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
I’m still not sure

611
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,030
whether they died of the injury.

612
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,240
It can’t be.

613
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,070
There are many people

614
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,150
who saw Liu Yue fall off
the horse and die.

615
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,760
I heard that there was a group of people
riding horses and hunting on that day.

616
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,430
They were chasing a rabbit
with their bows.

617
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,980
(Broken leg bone)
(Bone of the left leg)

618
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,080
(Ribs Rib fracture)
His left leg and ribs were fractured.

619
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,670
There was a nosebleed which should be

620
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,390
(Nose bridge bones Strike injury)
caused by a nose bridge injury.

621
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,630
Lord! Lord!

622
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,600
Help! Hurry up.

623
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,640
Didn’t his fall caused by his death?

624
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,680
-Hurry.
-Lord! Lord!

625
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,720
No. For those who fall to their death,
their internal organs would be broken.

626
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,790
There will be blood

627
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,420
coming out from

628
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,310
mouth, eyes,

629
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,480
ears and nose.

630
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,670
But this man only had a nosebleed.

631
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,080
His organs were fine.

632
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,630
The injuries on his body
are not enough to get him killed.

633
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,880
As for the short deceased man,

634
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,590
there is river mud

635
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,660
in his ear canal and nasal canal.

636
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
I think he fell into
the river before he died.

637
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,160
Good wine.

638
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,880
Lord, be careful.

639
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
Go away!

640
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,680
Lord, be careful.

641
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,270
I can do it.

642
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,600
Lord! Lord!

643
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,840
Hurry! Hurry!

644
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,310
Lord! Lord!

645
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,430
Come on!

646
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,680
Lord! Lord!

647
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,360
These people failed to save him.

648
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,390
But he wasn’t drowned

649
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,310
or chocked to death by water.

650
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,200
I’m not sure

651
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,430
the cause of his death.

652
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,030
If I can check Minister Feng’s
body again,

653
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,310
I might be able to know
the cause of their deaths.

654
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
Since the injuries are the same,

655
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,270
why can you only know it
through Feng Jie?

656
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,880
These two men
have been dead for a while.

657
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,960
Although it looks like
they haven’t rotten much yet,

658
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,200
there are some things
I can’t identify anymore.

659
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,390
Especially the things in the head.

660
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,760
The things in the head?

661
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,200
What is that?

662
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,240
I’m not sure what it is.

663
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,480
I can’t tell you now.

664
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,240
You...

665
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,390
How long will it take you
to do an autopsy for Feng Jie?

666
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,600
One hour.

667
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,920
I can only give you half an hour.

668
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,480
Okay.

669
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,590
But,

670
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,790
I need to prepare something
in advance this time.

671
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

672
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,600
Leng Yue?

673
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,510
Yeah.

674
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,200
Leng Yue grew up in your mansion.

675
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,240
You know her temperament best.

676
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,840
She loves to talk and laugh.

677
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,270
Wherever she is,

678
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,150
that place is always lively.

679
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,790
Among your two sons,

680
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,270
Commandery Prince An is
knowledgeable and reliable.

681
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,630
General Xiao is heroic and gallant.

682
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,150
They have come to the age
to get married.

683
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,720
Have you ever thought about

684
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,200
who should marry Miss Leng Yue?

685
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,360
I’ve never thought about them

686
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,880
in that way.

687
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,200
Your Highness.

688
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,910
You should.

689
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,000
Miss Leng Yue is beautiful

690
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,910
and she comes from a prominent family.

691
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,000
If someone else marries her,

692
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,960
I’m afraid you would regret it.

693
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,480
It would be a pity

694
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,840
if she marries into an ordinary family.

695
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,600
But if your Jing Yi marries her,

696
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
I would be very happy.

697
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,120
Jing Yi?

698
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,840
Don’t flatter him.

699
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,150
You know

700
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,790
that they grew up together
since childhood.

701
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,030
Miss Leng Yue listens to
Commandery Prince An for everything.

702
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,430
Maybe her heart

703
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,760
has belonged to Prince An.

704
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,120
With their childhood friendship,

705
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,200
it’s just a matter of time

706
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,390
for them to be together.

707
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But we are not her parents.

708
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Her parents are gone.

709
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,120
No matter what she thinks,

710
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,390
we should ask
her grandfather first, right?

711
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,790
But with my uncle’s temperament...

712
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,600
Never mind, it’s too early
to talk about this now.

713
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,040
(Funeral)

714
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,790
Fortunately,

715
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,360
the eunuch from the Palace
warned me today,

716
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,600
otherwise, I would be fooled by
the Commandery Prince An.

717
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
Although the Emperor
issued a verbal edict

718
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,080
and forbade him to keep looking into it,

719
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,480
I still can’t

720
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,840
rest assured.

721
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,630
General Zhou.

722
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,790
How much does Eunuch Qin
hate Minister Feng?

723
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Why did he ask us to destroy his body?

724
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,510
That’s not for you to ask.

725
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,000
If other people know

726
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,240
that Master died under a skirt,

727
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,430
his reputation will be ruined.

728
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,030
Madam, don’t worry.

729
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,790
Although Commandery Prince An came,

730
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,310
he didn’t ask anything, right?

731
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,080
That coroner is just a little girl.

732
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,960
I guess she is a novice

733
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,790
and she couldn’t find out anything.

734
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,240
I can’t stop worrying it

735
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,910
until Master

736
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,630
gets buried.

737
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,390
Madam, if you are worried,

738
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,480
why don’t we bury Master in advance?

739
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,390
You are right.

740
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
Let’s not wait for twenty-one days.

741
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,790
Tomorrow, find a Taoist who can
perform the religious rite.

742
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,510
Tell him

743
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,910
we want to bury Master
after the first seven days.

744
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,670
Yes.

745
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,270
Keep an eye on them. We will do it
as soon as Madam Feng leaves.

746
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,430
It’s getting late.

747
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,080
Tomorrow morning,

748
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
Master’s relatives and friends
will come to offer condolences.

749
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,960
You should go back and rest earlier.

750
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,720
Is the Second Lady sleeping now?

751
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
The Second Lady took tranquilizer.

752
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,910
She is sleeping now.

753
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,630
She can still fall asleep now.

754
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,390
Madam.

755
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,880
Commandery Prince An came
with that coroner again.

756
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,560
Madam.

757
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,760
Why is he doing here

758
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,840
in the middle of the night?

759
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,310
Madam, why don’t you go back
to your room and rest?

760
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,600
I’ll sound him out for you.

761
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,880
Never mind.

762
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,390
If he found out something,

763
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,670
it’s useless to hide it.

764
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,910
Serve some tea
to Commandery Prince An.

765
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,150
Ask him to wait at the side hall.

766
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,550
Yes, Madam.

767
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Commandery Prince An?

768
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Is he here in the middle
of the night to do an autopsy?

769
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,990
I’m going to tell Eunuch Qin.

770
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,920
Tell what?

771
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
You are seeking your death
if you tell him now.

772
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,240
Let’s wait and see.

773
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,510
Madam.

774
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,390
Your Highness.

775
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,960
You may rise.

776
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,550
I was being suspicious in the day

777
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,430
and I offended Minister Feng’s body.

778
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,910
The Emperor reprimanded me
and I feel bad about it.

779
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,000
I can’t wait to apologize to you.

780
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
So I came here at night.

781
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,270
Please forgive me, Madam Feng.

782
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,390
Don’t say that.

783
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,030
It’s not that serious.

784
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,080
I’m just a woman.

785
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,720
Such a tragedy happened in a sudden,

786
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,270
I panicked

787
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,360
and talked nonsense to
the people from the Palace.

788
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,080
I wasn’t expecting you to be
reprimanded by the Emperor.

789
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,080
It’s my fault.

790
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,310
You are very generous to not blame me.

791
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,060
Please allow my maid

792
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,160
to offer a joss stick
to Minister Feng’s spirit

793
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,480
to apologize for our offense today.

794
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,120
Steward Xu.

795
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,390
Get the joss stick
from Commandery Prince An

796
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,790
and offer it before Master’s spirit.

797
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,760
Yes.

798
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,150
We are here to apologize.

799
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,150
How can we let you do it for me?

800
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,840
If you mind my maid’s inferiority,

801
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,600
I can offer the joss stick in person.

802
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,550
I dare not.

803
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,600
We dare not let you do that.

804
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,430
Steward Xu, take this girl there.

805
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,550
Yes.

806
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,790
Miss, please.

807
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,240
Master...

808
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,080
This way, please.

809
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,390
Madam Feng.

810
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,880
Did Minister Feng say anything

811
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,150
when he came back last night?

812
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,430
Minister Feng went to the Southwest
to inspect military affairs.

813
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,960
He was away for more than a month.

814
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,360
He must miss you a lot.

815
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,880
Even he was drunk late at night,

816
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,630
he should also come to see you.

817
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,390
He was taken to the Second Lady’s room

818
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,960
as soon as he came back last night.

819
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,240
When I saw him, he was...

820
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,880
Madam,

821
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,230
did the person

822
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,960
who served Minister Feng last night

823
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,630
mention how he got
the injury on his head?

824
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,720
Minister Han took his back last night.

825
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,220
He said that Master got drunk

826
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,430
and accidentally hit something.

827
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,670
Minister Han?

828
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,600
Yes.

829
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,840
Why do you ask that?

830
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,840
Nothing.

831
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
It’s just that Minister Feng
passed away in such a sudden.

832
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,390
It’s still hard for me to believe it.

833
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Since Minister Feng was injured,

834
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,360
did the person who was serving him
get a physician here?

835
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,310
The Second Lady’s family
runs a medical clinic.

836
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,880
She knows a little about medicine.

837
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,470
When Master had
a minor injury or illness,

838
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,510
he would go to see her.

839
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,550
He never saw any physician.

840
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,430
Is the cause of Minister Feng’s death

841
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,910
also diagnosed by the Second Lady?

842
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,200
Steward Xu has been away for some time.

843
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,430
Why hasn’t he come back?

844
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,910
Get someone to take a look.

845
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,670
Don’t offend
Commandery Prince An’s people.

846
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes.

847
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,430
Madam, have you

848
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
counted the belongings

849
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Minister Feng brought back
from the Southwest?

850
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
His belongings?

851
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,960
Minister Feng hadn’t reported on

852
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,200
the inspection of military affairs
in the Southwest.

853
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,310
There will be officials coming
to take it over in a few days.

854
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,390
You’d better count his belongings

855
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,910
and keep them safe.

856
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,720
Who is that?

857
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,210
Who went down?

858
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
No one, General Zhou.

859
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,250
We are all here.

860
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,480
What are you waiting for? Get him!

861
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,760
Get him?

862
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,960
Listen,

863
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,840
if anyone disturbs Commandery Prince An,

864
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,150
everyone in Feng’s Mansion
won’t get away with it!

865
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,390
Yes... yes.

866
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,670
You, come with me!

867
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,480
Yes.

868
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,080
Hurry up! Don’t let the thief run away!

869
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,150
General Wu, what’s wrong with you?

870
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,720
I have a stomachache.

871
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,150
Where is the lavatory here?

872
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,560
Go out and turn left...

873
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,240
The Feng’s Mansion is too big.

874
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,720
I can’t find it.

875
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,870
Take me there.

876
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,470
But...

877
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,150
I’ll crap my pants
if you keep saying but.

878
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,280
Let’s go.

879
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,430
Come on.

880
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,320
This way.

881
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,430
(Funeral)

882
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,480
My stomach...

883
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,300
(Funeral)

884
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,530
Not good. The coroner is inside.

885
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,650
She wants to do an autopsy.

886
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,380
Coroner?

887
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,950
Doesn’t Eunuch Qin want to
capture this coroner alive?

888
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,080
Why don’t we go down
and take her away now?

889
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Xiao Jinyu is
in the side hall right now.

890
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,480
If we fail to take her away,

891
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,550
then she cries for help

892
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
and makes some noise,

893
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,670
none of us can get out of here.

894
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,320
Do what I say.

895
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,280
Set a fire and burn the corpse
and the coroner.

896
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Hurry up!

897
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,600
Yes!

898
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,870
Hurry!

899
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,480
Get him!

900
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,100
He is over there!

901
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,760
Chu Chu, you’d better hurry up.

902
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,910
Get him!

903
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes!

904
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,350
General Wu?

905
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,560
Fire!

906
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,590
Stop chasing him,
go to put out the fire!

907
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,390
Fire!

908
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,040
Fire!

909
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,200
Open the door!

910
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,630
Open the door!
