1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,800
(Two Merits Hall)
Things are odd with Minister Feng’s death.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,270
The two corpses His Highness
dug up from the graves

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,150
are also related to
Minister Feng’s death.

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,470
He somehow found the connections
between the three cases

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,120
which seemed irrelevant at first sight.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,420
(The Imperial Family)

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,040
His Highness is the best judge
I’ve ever seen.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,630
I’ll definitely help him

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,400
find out Minister Feng’s
real cause of death.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,680
Burn Feng Jie and this coroner.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,230
Open the door.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,550
Fire! Anyone?

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,510
The mourning hall is on fire.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,270
She can’t escape this time.
Fall back.

15
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,190
Who?

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,360
Minister Feng.

17
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,720
Hurry! Go!

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,510
Go!

19
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,310
Here’s water!

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,870
Where’s Chu Chu?

21
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,870
Chu Chu is inside.

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Master.

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,230
Water.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,870
Hurry.

25
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,360
Here’s water.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,720
Put out the fire.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,870
Hurry! We need more people!

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,800
Your Highness.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,480
Here’s water.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,050
Your Highness, just let me go.

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,040
Your Highness.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,910
More water.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,830
Hurry up!

34
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,440
Here’s water.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,190
Chu Chu.

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,440
Your Highness.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,760
Chu Chu.

38
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,160
I’m here.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Do we have more water?

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,390
Here.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,000
Here. Come.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,310
Your Highness,
Minister Feng’s body is still here.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,140
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Let me take care of it.

45
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,160
Your Highness, go!

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,190
There’s more here.

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,630
Hurry. Go.

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,670
Hurry up.

49
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,080
This way.

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,910
More water?

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,750
It’s coming!

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,300
=The Imperial Coroner=

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,300
=Episode 5=

54
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,880
What’s going on in the front yard?

55
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,830
My Lady, don’t be scared.

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,080
The mourning hall is on fire.

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,190
The mourning hall is on fire.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,160
How about Master?

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,240
My Lady, don’t worry.

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,360
Master was carried out of the fire
in time and was unharmed.

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,720
Master’s body was saved
from the fire?

62
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,470
It must be him.

63
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,960
Master has come.

64
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,190
He’s coming for me.

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,590
My Lady.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,720
Master is coming for me.

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,190
My Lady.

68
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,520
It’s all right, My Lady.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,920
My Lady, it’s all right.

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,360
Master,

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,870
Minister of War,
Minister Feng’s mansion caught fire.

72
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,230
What?

73
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,960
Minister Feng’s mansion was on fire?

74
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,800
Yes.

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,110
I heard that Commandery Prince An
was also at Feng’s mansion.

76
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,160
What will he do this time?

77
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,800
Someone’s here. Hurry! Hide.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,750
Shence Army’s battalion.

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,100
(Feng’s Mansion)

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,720
Hurry.

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,160
Lower the poles. Hurry.

82
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,790
Slow down. It bumped my head.

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,230
(Feng’s Mansion)
Hurry and take a look inside.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,830
Hurry.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,860
Ask them all to leave.

86
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,510
Yes.

87
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,760
Let’s leave for now.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,760
Are you hurt?

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,910
No. You just...

90
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,760
Where is Master?

91
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,320
Madam.

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
Master.

93
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,320
Master.

94
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,370
Commandery Prince An,
have our Feng Family ever wronged you?

95
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,610
My Master has just deceased.

96
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,050
You already brought a coroner with you.

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,380
Madam.

98
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,980
Madam. Madam. Madam.

99
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,240
I’ve decided to put what happened
in the day behind us.

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,890
I didn’t expect you to be so vile.

101
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,700
You ordered others to set fire in
my husband’s mourning hall.

102
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,650
Xiao Jinyu, I’m the one
who told on you.

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,330
If you want revenge,

104
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,740
just kill me.

105
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,740
Madam. Madam.

106
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,490
Xiao Jinyu, if you don’t,

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,490
I’ll kill this despicable girl

108
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,020
who disrespected my husband.

109
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,620
Madam.

110
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,190
Madam.

111
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,610
What happened?

112
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,020
Commandery Prince An,
why are you here?

113
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,300
Lord Han.

114
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,850
Academician Xue.

115
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,580
I’m sorry to disturb you
because of our fire accident.

116
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,820
-Lord Han.
-Madam.

117
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,420
Madam Feng.

118
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,460
You and our Master are close friends.

119
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,160
You must uphold justice for him.

120
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,480
Madam Feng, please stand up first.

121
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,830
What’s going on?

122
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,510
Commandery Prince An,

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
I heard that His Majesty

124
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,030
has given you a verbal order,

125
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,670
forbidding you from
disturbing Feng’s Mansion.

126
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
You even disobey His Majesty now?

127
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,320
Madam Feng, I happened to
hear your conversation.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,950
There might be misunderstanding.

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
Misunderstanding?

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,950
That’s a coroner.

131
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,150
Commandery Prince An came here
in the middle of the night

132
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,760
with a coroner.

133
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,070
And he set the mourning hall on fire.

134
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,230
That’s misunderstanding?

135
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,070
I think he’s disregarding
the emperor’s order

136
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,230
and revenging his personal grudges.

137
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,990
He’s such a disloyal
and heartless person.

138
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,600
How can he properly manage
Three Judicial Offices?

139
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,230
Commandery Prince An, I’ll definitely

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,190
unite ministers
of Three Judicial Offices

141
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,300
and report what happened today

142
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,880
to His Majesty for his judgment.

143
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,270
Lord Han. Madam Feng.

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,390
Commandery Prince An
is a student of mine.

145
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,920
I know his characters.

146
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,440
He’s definitely not a vile person.

147
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,830
Please give him a chance
to explain today’s incident.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,790
If he can’t convince you,

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,430
Lord Han and I can bring him

150
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,020
to see His Majesty in person.

151
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,830
Madam, how do you think of that?

152
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,270
What does he have to say?

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,110
Nothing.

154
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,760
I didn’t do this.

155
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,390
However, I don’t have evidence
to prove my innocence right now.

156
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,440
I can’t give an explanation now.

157
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,470
I can only provide it

158
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,830
when I catch the real culprit.

159
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,160
By then, if Madam Feng wants to
take me to His Majesty,

160
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,390
I’ll cooperate.

161
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,480
Madam Feng, I have a thing
to show you now.

162
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,200
Give me your hands.

163
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,790
Reach out your hands.

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
She was trapped in flames.

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,680
To save Minister Feng’s remains
from the fire,

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
she was willing to sacrifice her life.

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,160
These are the bruises left by dragging.

168
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,110
If she hadn’t guarded
the remains with her life,

169
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,720
they would’ve become ashes
in the flames.

170
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,320
Whoever the arsonist is,

171
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,040
this incident has nothing
to do with her.

172
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,950
You mustn’t humiliate her like this.

173
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,870
Your Highness.

174
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,670
Shut up.

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,350
Madam. Forget it.

176
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,670
It’s late into the night.

177
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,900
If we disturb the neighbors,

178
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,860
and allow them to know the incident,

179
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,430
Master’s reputation will be stained.

180
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,230
It’s better that we let Master
rest in peace sooner.

181
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,040
Madam.

182
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,230
I found this in the mourning hall.

183
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,280
I don’t know what it is.

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,670
It was found next to Master’s coffin.

185
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,350
It must have fallen from the top
of the house because of the fire.

186
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,550
Don’t make a fuss before the lords.

187
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,390
Madam Feng, are there any other matters
you wish me to elaborate on?

188
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Lord Han,

189
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,350
Madam Feng is a house wife.

190
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,670
It’s natural that she panics
and jumps to conclusions

191
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,670
based on preliminary evidences
before incidents.

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,590
But you’re the Minister of Justice.

193
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,760
You’re an expert of observing
and judging cases.

194
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,640
You speak recklessly
without research and interrogation.

195
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,670
Even if you don’t criticize me
before His Majesty,

196
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,280
I’ll criticize you.

197
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,200
Okay.

198
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,710
Go ahead.

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,440
What?

200
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,350
It’s tilted.

201
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,000
What’s tilted?

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,710
Your bun is tilted.

203
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
It was struck by the sedan.

204
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
It’s still tilted.

205
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,960
Move away. Where are they?

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,670
Well.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,350
Commandery Prince An!

208
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,960
Zhou Han, you are such a fool!

209
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,590
What are you capable of?

210
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,350
You’ll get me killed one day.

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
-Eunuch Sun.
-Eunuch Sun.

212
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,840
Master! Bad news.

213
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,110
Zhou Han failed again.

214
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,550
Failed again?

215
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,760
He almost succeeded.

216
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,110
That female coroner

217
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,280
was almost burn to death
in the mourning hall.

218
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,080
What?

219
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,400
Zhou Han! That Loser.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Who asked him to
kill the female coroner?

221
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,470
He can’t get things done
but can make things worse.

222
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Wait.

223
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,350
You just said that

224
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,110
Xiao Jinyu brought that female coroner
to Feng’s Mansion again?

225
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,900
He insisted on apologizing
to Madam Feng.

226
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,440
Who will apologize to a widow
in the middle of a night?

227
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,880
He was not there to apologize.

228
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,350
He was there to inspect the corpse.

229
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,710
We’re in trouble this time.

230
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,400
Come closer.

231
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,820
Well. What can he find?

232
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,640
Hurry! Go!

233
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,110
Yes. Yes. Yes.

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Master, don’t be mad.

235
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,590
Miss Chu.

236
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
Miss Chu.

237
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,790
Master, it’s Miss Lian Qiao.

238
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,470
Lian Qiao.

239
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,280
See if the kitchen has prepared
spirit-calming decoction.

240
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,400
Yes.

241
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,360
You must be frightened.

242
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,550
I’m not scared.

243
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,150
I just...

244
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,520
I lost all my tools.

245
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,110
I’m sorry. I was late.

246
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,350
No. No. It’s not your fault.

247
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,070
I was so careless that

248
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,550
I didn’t notice my tools were missing.

249
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,520
Thankfully, those tools were
destroyed by the fire.

250
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,230
They can’t tell what they are.

251
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,960
Otherwise, I’ll get you
in big trouble again.

252
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,640
It’s fine.

253
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,200
I made those tools myself.

254
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,840
I can make a set again.

255
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,000
It’s just that

256
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,000
I’m feeling a bit sad

257
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,110
because those tools are
like old friends to me

258
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,880
since they’ve been with me
for a long time.

259
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,960
I’ll be fine soon.

260
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,760
In the previous situation,

261
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,320
it’s awkward for you to ask for
the return of the tools.

262
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,640
If you really want them,

263
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
I can order someone
to retrieve them later.

264
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,280
Thank you, Master.

265
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,150
You were the closet to the mourning hall

266
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,590
when it caught fire.

267
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,520
Do you know how the fire was started?

268
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,550
I don’t know.

269
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,080
I was too busy with the autopsy.

270
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,550
I only found the house on fire
when I finished the autopsy.

271
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,080
You locked the doors and windows
of the mourning hall?

272
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
No, I only shut the door.

273
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,550
But I don’t know why I couldn’t open it.

274
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,760
Your Highness,
the fire was so fierce.

275
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,470
Why did you run into it?

276
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,000
Aren’t you afraid of death?

277
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,400
I am.

278
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,030
Then, why did you do that?

279
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,320
I was afraid that you might die.

280
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,350
You were afraid that I might die?

281
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,960
I...

282
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,470
I’m afraid, because if you die,

283
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,790
I’ll stay up all night to write reports
and archive the cases.

284
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,960
Remember,

285
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,150
whenever and wherever,

286
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,030
if you’re in a situation
like this again,

287
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,640
you must do everything to
keep yourself alive first.

288
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,440
The consequences of
having a corpse destroyed by fire

289
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,750
and having a living person
killed by fire

290
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,840
are totally different
for the office and for me.

291
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,840
But there were guards.

292
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,370
If you were worried about me,
you didn’t have to rush in yourself.

293
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,790
If only Wu Jiang and
the other guards went in,

294
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,350
would you flee

295
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,610
or would you guard
the corpse with them?

296
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,190
Of course, I’d protect the corpse.

297
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,000
That’s it then.

298
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,520
I had to rush in and bring you out.

299
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,550
I know the deceased are

300
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,790
as important as the living ones to you.

301
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,260
You’re willing to sacrifice your life
to make sure their remains are intact.

302
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,400
But, to me,

303
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,230
I was the one who sent you
to inspect the corpse.

304
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,960
I must ensure your safety.

305
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Highness,
you’re such a nice person.

306
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,470
Try these grapes.

307
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,000
They’re from the Western Regions.

308
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,030
Grape skin is bitter.

309
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,230
This is how you eat it.

310
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,940
(Three Judicial Offices)

311
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,550
You’ve inspected Feng Jie’s remains.

312
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,230
What did you find?

313
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,470
I knew their cause of death.

314
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,520
I carefully inspected the wounds
on Minister Feng’s head.

315
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,910
The wound on his left brow bone
was caused by a punch of the fist.

316
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,310
That punch caused
the right back of his head

317
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,960
to crash into a smooth but hard object,

318
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,590
resulting in small fractures
on his skull.

319
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,760
This is the same with
the other two victims.

320
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,200
I’m now certain that

321
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,520
they were all killed by a similar punch.

322
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
But according to people
from Feng’s Mansion,

323
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,440
Feng Jie was hurt in the tavern.

324
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,670
If this punch was lethal,

325
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,000
he wouldn’t be able to
walk back to the mansion.

326
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,430
Besides, you’ve said that

327
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,870
these little fractures

328
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,440
are not fatal.

329
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,960
Let me put it this way.

330
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,000
There was a staircase
where he was wounded.

331
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,550
You’re right.

332
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,550
The killer chose to carry out
the murder on a staircase

333
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,080
because it’s convenient
to adjust their height difference

334
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,590
so as to make sure the punch

335
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,880
land on Minister Feng’s eye socket
and below his bow bone.

336
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,060
(On the eye socket
Below the bow bone)

337
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,780
(The punched position)

338
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,590
The back of Minister Feng’s head
hit a hard object that was protruded,

339
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,710
thus causing a small fracture.

340
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,420
(A blow on the back of his head)

341
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,660
(A small fracture)

342
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,260
This wound wasn’t instantly fatal.

343
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,470
It didn’t even inflict much pain.

344
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,440
So Minister Feng thought
it wasn’t a big deal.

345
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,590
He didn’t take it seriously.

346
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,550
What’s his problem?

347
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,110
But this small fracture

348
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,000
would gradually
cause blood clots in his brain.

349
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,960
Within less than an hour,

350
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,430
the clotted blood

351
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,320
would make him dizzy.

352
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,590
He couldn’t talk clearly
or walk straightly.

353
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,350
That’s the thing you said
that was in the brains?

354
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,320
Yes.

355
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,640
I’ve inspected.

356
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,150
The wounds on the other
two victims were the same.

357
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,790
But they’ve died for quite a while.

358
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,670
I won’t have an accurate inspection

359
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,790
even if I cut open their skulls now.

360
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,110
Cut open their skulls?

361
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,320
You cut Feng Jie’s skull open?

362
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,030
Yes.

363
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,520
How could I know whether
he has blood clots in his brains or not

364
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,640
if I hadn’t cut open his skulls?

365
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,840
I’ve inspected carefully.

366
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
There were indeed
blood clots in his brains.

367
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,080
Moreover, he took strong
erectile medications

368
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,430
which caused his blood
to flood to his brain,

369
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,790
worsening his wounds.

370
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,280
Then he died instantly.

371
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,460
But I just saw that
Feng Jie’s corpse is intact.

372
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,790
Of course, it is.

373
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,900
I stitched it back

374
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,310
after the autopsy.

375
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,710
You stitched it back?

376
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,430
Yes.

377
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,500
It’s the same with the way

378
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,190
the officers search the crime scenes.

379
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
They open doors when they go in.

380
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,230
But they have to close the doors
when they leave.

381
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,280
That’s why you asked for
a wig before you left.

382
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,110
You made it into
the shape of Feng Jie’s bun

383
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,190
because you wanted to

384
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,400
restore it to its original shape
after your autopsy?

385
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Our skin, hair, and body
are given to us by our parents.

386
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,640
It’s disrespectful to harm them.

387
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,400
So, you’re not ignorant of that.

388
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,190
Do you know that coroners
from capital’s offices

389
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,400
need permits
mandated by the cases’ chief officers

390
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,430
in order to perform autopsy.

391
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,470
Those who perform autopsies
without permits

392
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,680
will be charged.

393
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,710
There’s such a rule?

394
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,680
But I’ve already mended the corpse.

395
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,790
I put clothes back on.

396
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,110
It’s like I’ve never
performed the autopsy.

397
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,040
In that case,

398
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,160
will I still be charged?

399
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,310
I’ve never met such

400
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,020
a lawbreaking coroner like you.

401
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,190
How to punish you?

402
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,310
I have to think carefully.

403
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,350
I didn’t break the rules.

404
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,280
I complied with the rules of
the Judicial Service.

405
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,830
The rules of the Judicial Service?

406
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,160
Handsome Judge once said that
the Judicial Service

407
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,760
shouldn’t be restricted by doctrines
when handling cases.

408
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,140
Any method is acceptable

409
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,310
as long as it leads to the truth.

410
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,430
But we mustn’t commit crimes
in order to solve cases.

411
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,150
We mustn’t ruin the remains

412
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,470
in order to inspect them.

413
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,830
So, the Judicial Service’s coroners

414
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,020
are allowed to conduct autopsy

415
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,400
so long as they can restore the corpses
to their initial shapes.

416
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,190
You don’t know this?

417
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,640
I know.

418
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Really? You really do?

419
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,500
Then, are you...?

420
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,830
Am I Handsome Judge?

421
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,040
Are you?

422
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,160
Why are you looking for
Handsome Judge?

423
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,230
Is it because of your pendant?

424
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,230
Why does he care about
the pendant so much?

425
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,790
So, has the person
who gave you the pendant

426
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,040
told you that

427
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,160
the pendant might
belong to Handsome Judge?

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,950
Lord Jing, why are you here?

429
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,520
I’ve been busy all night.

430
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,160
You found the arsonist?

431
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
Your Highness,

432
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,020
can’t you just pretend you don’t know

433
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,920
and praise me a little bit?

434
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,900
Stop beating around the bushes.

435
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,800
There were five of them.

436
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,230
They all wore masks and black clothes.

437
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,400
They’re all skilled fighters.

438
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
I followed them

439
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,920
and saw them disappear into
the battalion of Shence Army.

440
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,430
It’s Qin Luan again.

441
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,350
Go to meet Han Ji
when you’re done eating.

442
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,590
Han Ji?

443
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,190
Your Highness, it’s so late that
even cats are sleeping.

444
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,160
What do I visit that old crow for?

445
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,040
According to people from Feng’s Mansion,

446
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,920
it was Han Ji who sent Feng Jie home
last night.

447
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,220
So, Han Ji was one of the people

448
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,040
who threw reception banquet
for Feng Jie.

449
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,590
If we can find out

450
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,670
which tavern Feng Jie was at

451
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,520
on that night,

452
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,280
it won’t be hard to
find the real murderer.

453
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,950
Wait. What does it have to do
with the tavern?

454
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,710
Chu Chu just found out
the cause of death

455
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,920
of the three victims,
including Feng Jie.

456
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,040
They were hit at the bow bones
and the eye sockets,

457
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,310
causing back skull fractures.

458
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,110
The wounds of the three victims
are on the exactly same positions.

459
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,020
It means that the murderer
is a trained killer.

460
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,190
So he can kill with just one strike.

461
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,280
As for drinking,

462
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,350
it’s the key element to
conceal his killing method.

463
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,470
Drinking?

464
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,830
Chu Chu, you just said that

465
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,740
the victims would gradually become dizzy

466
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,560
after they were hit in the face

467
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,950
and the skulls were
rammed into the wall.

468
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,800
They couldn’t speak clearly
or walk steadily,

469
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,350
as if they were drunk.

470
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,550
Yes, that’s it.

471
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,920
It was just like they were drunk.

472
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,760
Drunk?

473
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,560
You mean

474
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,040
the murderer used this method

475
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,260
so the victims could walk out of
the tavern alive

476
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,880
in front of the crowd.

477
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,430
That means

478
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,430
someone murdered Minister of War

479
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,510
in front of Minister of Justice

480
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,640
without him knowing it.

481
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,430
That’s right.

482
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,160
To accomplish this crime,

483
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,230
the killer has to make sure that

484
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,400
the victim was drinking
when he was injured.

485
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
It’s even better if the victim

486
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,070
kept on drinking after the injury.

487
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
So, there must be someone
facilitating the killer

488
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,310
from within the tavern.

489
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,190
Karma is real.

490
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,760
Han Ji’s got his turn now.

491
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,310
This old crow.

492
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,560
He told on me many times
before my dad.

493
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,590
He also criticized you many times
before His Majesty.

494
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,590
When I see him this time,

495
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,590
I’ll definitely...

496
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,710
You must keep your mouth shut!

497
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,830
When you see Han Ji tonight,

498
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,310
you should only find out
the whereabouts of the tavern.

499
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,470
Once you find that out,

500
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,260
pretend you’re pursuing a wanted suspect

501
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,110
and search the tavern.

502
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,980
Don’t tell Han Ji
anything more than that.

503
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,230
Don’t leak any information

504
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,680
before all the facts of this case
come to light.

505
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,920
Tavern?

506
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,000
Your Highness, if you’re right,

507
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,430
the last meal Minister Feng
had before his death

508
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,350
might be at that tavern.

509
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,470
What?

510
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,590
When I was performing autopsy
on Minister Feng’s remains,

511
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,710
I found in his teeth gaps

512
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,280
the roots of fish mints.

513
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
Judging from the degree of decay,

514
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,950
they might be left from
the last meal he had.

515
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,800
Rugui House.

516
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,680
The weather is dry.
Things are flammable.

517
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,520
Beware of the flames.

518
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,630
The killer dared to commit the murder

519
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,470
in plain sight.

520
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,470
Rugui House must
have something to do with it.

521
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,000
(Rugui House)
Go!

522
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,070
Commandery Prince An.
Vice Minister Jing.

523
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,430
Such rare guests.

524
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,590
How come?
We just came here this morning.

525
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,710
By the order of Commandery Prince An,
from Three Judicial Offices,

526
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,950
we’re here to search for
the wanted criminals.

527
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,020
Where is your Manager Xu?

528
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,950
We have some words for him.

529
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,110
I’ll find him for you.

530
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,040
This is indeed
where the killer committed the crime.

531
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,560
Wait.

532
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,350
What’s that place?

533
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,880
That’s the kitchen.

534
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,760
It’s so late.

535
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
Who are you cooking for?

536
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,430
We’re not cooking.

537
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,640
Our master wants to take a bath
after auditing the accounts.

538
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,280
I’m heating up bath water for him.

539
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,140
Look. Master’s lights are still on.

540
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,400
He must be still awake.

541
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,040
Wu Jiang.

542
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,240
You two. Follow me.

543
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,070
Yes.

544
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,390
Master, Commandery Prince An is here.

545
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,800
Chen Feng.

546
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,430
They say...

547
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,110
Your Highness,
we found nothing suspicious.

548
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,310
Your Highness, we neither.

549
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,520
It’s so weird. Where is Master Xu?

550
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,590
Who are you asking?

551
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,110
We haven’t asked you yet?

552
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,230
Where is your master?

553
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
He was in the room previously.

554
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,310
It’s in the middle of the night.

555
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,640
And the doors are locked
from the inside.

556
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,760
I didn’t hear him go outside.

557
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,310
Xu Rugui might have jumped
out of the window and fled

558
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
when he heard our movements.

559
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,680
Where are his family?

560
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,230
Our master doesn’t have family members.

561
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,800
He lives here on his own.

562
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,070
I also heard
that Xu Rugui has no family.

563
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,110
Although Rugui House
is packed with beauties,

564
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,040
he has no romance with any of them.

565
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,710
Is that true?

566
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,950
Vice Minister Jing,
you’re being too hard on me.

567
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,100
I’m just a small manager

568
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,160
who’s in charge of a few waitresses.

569
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,760
I know nothing about
master’s personal life.

570
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,800
Rugui House is surrounded by water
and is connected to various paths.

571
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,870
It’s easy for Xu Rugui to flee
when he’s startled.

572
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,760
(The Map Chonghua Rugui House Huaiyuan)
But he can’t be perfect when he panics.

573
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,000
There must be evidences in Rugui House.

574
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,800
Any findings?

575
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,640
Your Highness,

576
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,590
we found nothing suspicious inside.

577
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,310
Pass on my words.
Seal Rugui House immediately.

578
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,430
We must find Xu Rugui,

579
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,510
no matter he’s dead or alive.

580
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,310
Yes.

581
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,800
It’s so late now.

582
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,040
Why hasn’t our son come back?

583
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,470
Why don’t you send someone
to look for him?

584
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,180
My lady, don’t worry.

585
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,650
How can I not?

586
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,640
We have so many men.

587
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,880
How can we possibly
lose his sight in Chang’an?

588
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,410
Okay, my lady.

589
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,530
Don’t think too much.

590
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,190
We’ll know everything

591
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,070
when we wake up tomorrow.

592
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,080
Your Highness, you woke me up

593
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,310
because you told me
there might be a corpse.

594
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,310
Are you referring to Manager Xu?

595
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,950
When did your manager
ask you to boil water?

596
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
About an hour ago.

597
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,710
It took you an hour and
the water was still not boiled?

598
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Your Highness,

599
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,470
I’m the only one on duty tonight.

600
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,640
I fetched and boiled water
all on my own.

601
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,590
It’s so tiring.

602
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,900
To do it faster,

603
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,220
I started the fire first before

604
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,760
I began to fetch water
one bucket at a time.

605
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,560
Maybe it was because
the firewood were dampened.

606
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,560
It was so hard to start the fire.

607
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,760
Xu Rugui must have something to do

608
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,710
with the series of homicides
that happened here.

609
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,350
The fire at Feng’s Mansion didn’t destroy
the corpse along with evidences.

610
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,880
Maybe, that’s the reason
he fled in a hurry.

611
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,680
Answer me.

612
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,390
Did Feng Jie, the Minister of War,

613
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,990
drink at this place last night?

614
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,840
Yes.

615
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,150
Along with Minister Han,
the Minister of Justice,

616
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,360
and a few other ministers.

617
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
Did Minister Feng had
an argument with someone?

618
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,950
And he was injured.

619
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,830
That’s true.

620
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Then, last month,

621
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,800
did Liu Yue,
Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

622
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,560
and Lu Chuansheng, Capital Liaison
Representative of Qianzhou,

623
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
also drink at your place?

624
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,830
He also got in a fight and was injured?

625
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,100
It seems to be true.

626
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,180
But having drunk guests causing trouble

627
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,150
is inevitable for a tavern.

628
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,070
Why is the kitchen so hot?

629
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,830
It’s hotter than the burning house.

630
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,280
What?

631
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
It’s not supposed to be so hot
when boiling water?

632
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,790
No.

633
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,430
My kitchen is smaller than this.

634
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,280
But boiling water doesn’t
make it heat up so badly.

635
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,310
Watch out.

636
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,830
Your hands were injured.

637
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,900
This wall is burning.

638
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Burning?

639
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,230
This wall is just like that.

640
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,040
Maybe it’s because the wall
was made out of bad materials.

641
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,310
When the other side
was boiling water,

642
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,920
this side will get hot easily.

643
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,040
Commandery Prince An, how’s it?

644
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,590
Fine.

645
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,630
Wu Jiang.

646
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,110
Yes.

647
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,040
Check it from the outside.

648
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,150
See if the chimney is
still venting smoke.

649
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,760
Yes.

650
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,590
Your Highness, you sent Wu Jiang
on a worthless mission.

651
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,980
The stove is empty.

652
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,110
How can there be any smoke?

653
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,550
Your Highness, it’s still venting smoke.

654
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,710
Still?

655
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,640
Hasn’t the fire been extinguished?

656
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,400
Where does the smoke come from?

657
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,710
Go fetch a bucket of water.

658
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,520
Pour it into the chimney vent.

659
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,590
Remember. Pour the whole bucket inside.

660
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,160
Yes.

661
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,920
Your Highness, I’m pouring now.

662
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,880
Okay.

663
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,230
Why’s the sound so big
while the stream is so little?

664
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,430
Your Highness, I’ve poured in
the whole bucket.

665
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,920
It’s all done. Not a drop is left.

666
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,160
Every drop is poured?
Not a drop is left?

667
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,510
How’s that possible?

668
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,960
The whole bucket has been emptied.

669
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,480
Why is there only a little bit
of water in the stove?

670
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,190
What?

671
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,950
The water didn’t run into the stove?

672
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,540
Set the fire on again.

673
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,010
Wu Jiang, cover the chimney vent.

674
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,490
Yes.

675
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,130
Cover the chimney vent?

676
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,370
Your Highness, you’re trying to...?

677
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,130
The wall behind the funnel is hollow.

678
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,700
There might be a dark chamber
underground where fire can be lit.

679
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,180
The funnel of the dark chamber’s stove

680
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,460
might be hidden inside this war.

681
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,530
Two tunnels converge in one

682
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,780
at the smoke vent
of the kitchen’s stove.

683
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,410
(The dark chamber)

684
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,540
(Kitchen The hollow wall)
When it’s not used,

685
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,130
(Partition)
it’s separated by the partition.

686
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,940
When it’s used,
the partition is removed.

687
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,880
So the smoke can be disguised as

688
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,010
the smoke vented by the kitchen’s stove.

689
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,730
That’s why this wall

690
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,540
gets heated up easily.

691
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,610
I see.

692
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,970
It’s like catching a rabbit
in the mountain.

693
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,010
You set fire on one cave entrance,

694
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,850
then the rabbit comes out
from the other entrance.

695
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,970
Your Highness, is that correct?

696
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,010
Sort of.

697
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,250
So it means that

698
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,970
Xu Rugui is indeed hidden
inside the underground chamber.

699
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,460
So, we can just wait for

700
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,330
him to come out?

701
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,740
Your Highness.

702
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,060
There’re movements
in Xu Rugui’s bedroom.

703
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,780
Your Highness.

704
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,010
There’s indeed smoke from rabbit hole.

705
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,610
It seems that here’s
the dark chamber’s entrance.

706
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,220
Wu Jiang.

707
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,800
Yes.

708
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,860
Go tell those in the kitchen.

709
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,120
Order them to distinguish the stove.

710
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,730
Yes.

711
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,780
Master, are you asleep?

712
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,210
What?

713
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,820
Everything’s taken care of
at Rugui House.

714
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,850
I see.

715
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,610
Chu Chu, stay here.

716
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,580
Don’t wander around.

717
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,820
I want to go with you, Your Highness.

718
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,540
We need you to guard the entrance

719
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,130
in case someone blocks it.

720
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,420
Then we’ll be in great danger.

721
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,060
I’ll do as you say, Your Highness.

722
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
Stay here too.

723
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,210
Yes.

724
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,100
(Hanbi Hall)

725
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,700
Master.

726
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,570
Master, Vice Minister went to
search Rugui House

727
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,090
with Commandery Prince An.

728
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,220
What? Search Rugui House?

729
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,110
Yes.

730
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,660
-Go and investigate the details.
-Yes, Master.

731
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,900
This is indeed a rabbit hole.

732
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,130
Your Highness, watch out.

733
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,900
Your Highness, what happened?

734
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,930
Your Highness.

735
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,700
Your Highness, what’s going on?

736
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,700
You must be too tired.

737
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,660
You worked nonstop without any sleep.

738
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,900
Go back and get some rest.

739
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,010
Wu Jiang,

740
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,460
investigate it with Jing Yi.

741
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,010
Yes.

742
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,700
Escort His Highness back.

743
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,730
Your Highness, slow down.

744
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,330
Be careful.

745
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,250
Your Highness.

746
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,770
Your Highness.

747
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,370
Watch out.

748
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,290
Slow down, Your Highness.

749
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:48,970
Your Highness,

750
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,370
what’s going on?

751
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,060
It’s fine. I’m just a bit tired.

752
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,090
Zhang Yun.

753
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,130
Yes.

754
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,180
Where’s that woman of Rugui House?

755
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,420
She’s waiting outside.

756
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,900
You two, go and guard her.

757
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,660
Don’t let her talk to any people.

758
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,850
In case they falsify their testimonies.

759
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,610
Yes.

760
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,900
Thanks.

761
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:27,980
Your Highness,

762
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,330
are you afraid of places
without windows?

763
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Why did you say so?

764
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,640
My brother and I

765
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,290
once saved an officer

766
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,770
in a mountain cave.

767
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,810
He had the same reactions

768
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,260
you have right now.

769
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,290
I heard people say that
this is an illness.

770
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,290
Once the patient is
in a windowless room,

771
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,220
the symptoms attack.

772
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,170
But no one knows

773
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,660
how to cure it yet.

774
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,940
It’s said that there are better
and worse episodes too.

775
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,020
Don’t worry.

776
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,220
I won’t tell anyone.

777
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,090
The officer we saved

778
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,980
told us that

779
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,370
if we let anyone know this,

780
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,660
he’d lose his job.

781
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,740
You’re so good at solving cases.

782
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,500
I don’t want to get you fired.

783
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,620
This is the handkerchief
I gave you yesterday.

784
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,370
I’ve washed it many times.
It’s clean.

785
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,770
You embroidered this?

786
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,740
If you don’t like it...

787
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,050
Your Highness,

788
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,530
Jing’s Mansion has sent someone here.

789
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,460
They say Senior Jing and
his madam are worried

790
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,250
because Vice Minister Jing
hasn’t returned home.

791
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,290
So they sent people to look for him.

792
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,820
They saw that the officers from
the Court of Judicial Review

793
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,770
are all heading this way.

794
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,220
So they came to inquire about it.

795
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,640
Tell them.

796
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,050
Jing Yi is handling cases
with me tonight.

797
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,660
He won’t go home.

798
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,370
Ask Senior Jing and his madam
to rest assured.

799
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,640
Ask them to rest please.

800
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,290
Yes.

801
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,490
(Xiao Jinli)
Shelves filled with files

802
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,890
(Princess Xiping)
that are categorized by names.

803
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:09,700
(Yan Ming)

804
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,380
(Xiao Heng)

805
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,050
These are monitoring records.

806
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,770
How daring!

807
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,810
This is... ?

808
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,940
Look.

809
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,020
This should be the partition
His Highness talked about.

810
