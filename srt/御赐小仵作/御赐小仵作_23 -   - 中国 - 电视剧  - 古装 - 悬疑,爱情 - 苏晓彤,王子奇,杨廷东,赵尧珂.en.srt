1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,390
(Summon Military Commissioner of Jiannan
to Chang’an to suppress the bandits)

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,880
Although Father left some evidence,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,310
it’s still not easy to redress
an old case.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,470
Qin Luan and his eunuchs buy
and sell information in Rugui House

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,550
and monitor the court.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,470
(The imperial stateliness is gone)

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,520
Chang’an is disturbed by Duke Chang.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,950
Qianzhou is even more perilous.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,600
Take her!

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,100
I don’t want to implicate
Commandery Prince An.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,910
-Minister Xue.
-I can only do my duty as a coroner.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,520
Tell me the truth.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,520
When did you have a crush on Chu Chu?

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,560
Sir…

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,470
It’s true that I haven’t married.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,990
But at my age,

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,840
do you think I can’t figure out

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,360
what is going on between you two?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
The way you protected Chu Chu.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,560
Jinyu, you lost your mind.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,110
I dare not justify myself
in front of you, sir.

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,970
In addition to
the complicated situation,

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,610
I did have a selfish motive

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,060
when I protected her today.

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,380
I know I was being unfair,

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,930
but it’s my own wishful thinking.

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,650
If you want to scold me,

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,330
I won’t have any complaint.

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,820
Well, well.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,500
I don’t know what you are thinking.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,860
There are so many
noble girls in Chang’an.

32
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,650
Why do you have to

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,330
fall for a coroner?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,910
If Princess Xiping knows it,

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,000
if the Emperor knows it,

36
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,470
do you think a scolding
is all you are going to get?

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,060
She’s not only a coroner.

38
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,500
I know what you want to say.

39
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,790
Her biological parents
were also officials.

40
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,530
But,

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,650
she was raised and educated

42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,000
by a family of coroners.

43
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,930
She even went to Chang’an

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,550
to take the Coroner Qualification Test
in the Three Judicial Offices.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
Her being a survivor
of the rebellious party

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,720
has been widely talked in the court.

47
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,420
Now everyone in Chang’an knows it.

48
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,980
You should know

49
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,010
these taints of her
are difficult to clean.

50
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,080
If you are going to make such a mistake,

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
I will have no choice
but to take her away.

52
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,170
I don’t mean to offend you.

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,300
But right now,
I won’t leave her to anyone.

54
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:12,940
You...

55
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,330
The so-called taints

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,610
are what made her

57
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,250
who she is today.

58
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,060
I cherish them and value them.

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
I don’t see them as taints.

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,940
Besides, you were also born in poverty.

61
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,370
Your achievements are
attributed to your own efforts.

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,300
I’ve been listening to
your teachings since childhood.

63
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,500
I know that one’s fate
is not decided by God.

64
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,090
I never judge people by their family.

65
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,370
What you said today

66
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,170
contradicts what you taught me before.

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,530
I’m confused. Please enlighten me.

68
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,610
Forget it.

69
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,250
You’ve got more articulate now.

70
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
Thank you for giving me a chance.

71
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,340
=The Imperial Coroner=

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,180
=Episode 23=

73
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,430
I mean,

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
I know you don’t like
drinking or socializing.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,790
But you can’t afford not to eat.

76
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,480
Come on, I brought something
you may like.

77
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,510
Have a little bit at least.

78
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
Isn’t this a spoon?

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,370
Don’t touch it.

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,480
Who is this? Why are you drawing her?

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
This is Chu Chu’s mother.

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,110
She restored her mother’s
original appearance

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
based on her mother’s skull.

84
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,440
I’m drawing her by her statue.

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,920
I remember it.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,110
She talked about it
when the coffin was opened that day.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,920
But I didn’t expect

88
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,440
that she can actually restore a person’s

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,440
original appearance based on the skull.

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,070
Miss Chu is not an
ordinary coroner indeed.

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,550
I wish she were.

92
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,840
If she were just an ordinary coroner,

93
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,430
she wouldn’t go through so many dangers.

94
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,320
Living a peaceful and happy life

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,270
can be a good thing.

96
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,390
I can’t believe

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,230
you actually said that.

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
Looks like Jing Yi is right about it.

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
Qianzhou is not a land of plenty,

100
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,920
but it nourishes humanity.

101
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,510
I can’t believe

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,160
I heard you agree with Jing Yi

103
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,110
during my lifetime.

104
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,670
It seems that it won’t take long

105
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,920
for you two to become
the same kind of people.

106
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,320
How can you compare him with me?

107
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,510
I’m much better than him.

108
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,580
Hurry up and eat.

109
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
If you don’t eat it, I’ll…

110
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,950
I’ll write a letter to Mother about it.

111
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,960
How is tomorrow’s search

112
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,010
for Xu Rugui in the mountain?

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,720
It’s arranged now. Don’t worry.

114
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,230
My boys didn’t

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,070
bring shame on General Leng.

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,160
They dressed up and have been searching
in the mountain these days.

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,270
Although they haven’t found Xu Rugui,

118
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,440
they do have found some traces.

119
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,950
Do you have to go to
the mountain in person tomorrow?

120
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,510
If you find Xu Rugui tomorrow,

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,480
you will go back to
Chang’an immediately?

122
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,600
I heard from Jing Yi

123
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,920
that Leng Yue has been keeping
an eye on you these days.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Since she knew

125
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,040
the Emperor wanted to
grant us a marriage,

126
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,160
she has been haunting me like a ghost.

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,160
I guess she is still
waiting outside right now.

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Why?

129
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,790
She said

130
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,880
if I dared to agree to marry her,

131
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,160
she would dare to kill me.

132
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,880
What about Jing Yi?

133
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,160
He is drinking with someone
in the front yard.

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Go get Leng Yue here.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,760
My Lord.

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
Come in.

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Leave us.

138
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,230
My Lord.

139
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,070
What’s the situation in Guanling County?

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Has the survivor of
the rebellious party been arrested?

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,640
Not yet.

142
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,200
Not yet?

143
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,640
Are they going to arrest her or not?

144
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I just want to take credit for it,

145
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,720
but I got nothing

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,550
except for all these injuries!

147
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,200
I made a fuss for what?

148
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,600
My Lord, don’t worry.

149
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,880
Minister Xue is still in
Guanling County.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,720
He hasn’t left.

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,830
I think he has other plans.

152
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,200
I also found out

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,720
that Commandery Prince An is going to
search Phoenix Mountain tomorrow

154
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,000
and capture Xu Rugui.

155
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,040
What do you think...?

156
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,270
What do I think?

157
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,320
I think...!

158
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,880
My Lord.

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,790
Send more people

160
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
to keep a close eye on them!

161
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,200
Go now!

162
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,320
Yes!

163
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,200
Hurry!

164
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,760
Yes!

165
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,880
Xiao Jinyu is a scourge.

166
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,160
I have to figure out a way
to get rid of him.

167
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,550
If you two don’t want to get married,

168
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,470
you need to answer
one question truthfully.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Not to mention one.
I can answer a bunch of questions.

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,150
In there anything unusual

171
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,200
in the Military Commissioner’s
army recently?

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,870
I haven’t been in touch with
that person for many years.

173
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,140
How would I know if there is
anything unusual?

174
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,560
Unusual? What king of unusual things?

175
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,350
Let me put it in this way.

176
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,830
During these days,

177
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,950
is there any news about General Leng?

178
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,440
Any news.

179
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,030
You mean

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,120
this marriage thing has something
to do with General Leng?

181
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,950
It’s him who wants me
to marry Xiao Jinli?

182
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,880
It’s still not very clear

183
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,470
why the Emperor wants to
grant you a marriage.

184
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,030
But I’m sure

185
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
it’s related to the interests

186
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,320
of the Military Commissioner
of Qianzhongdao.

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,270
How come?

188
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,830
Everything was fine
when I left the army.

189
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,150
There is no news from the army

190
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,680
during this time.

191
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,880
This doesn’t make sense.

192
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,970
That person and I are totally strangers.

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,150
I will never agree to this marriage.

194
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,440
If he wants to force me,

195
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,500
I’ll just give my life back to
the Leng family.

196
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,470
Nothing is settled yet.

197
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,470
Calm down and let Jinyu talk.

198
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,880
Leng Yue, you need to write a letter.

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,060
Write a letter?

200
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,080
To whom?

201
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,120
General Leng.

202
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,830
What do you want me to write?

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,710
Any homely greetings will work.

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Jinli, after Leng Yue finishes it,

205
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,350
you get someone to send the letter
to the barracks immediately

206
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,560
and present it to General Leng.

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,270
Homely greetings?

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,800
To sound out.

209
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,350
Leng Yue, I don’t mean to
intervene in your family affairs.

210
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,080
But it concerns the security
of the southwest border of Tang,

211
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,000
and also the safety of

212
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,800
tens of thousands of people
in the Southwest.

213
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,910
I hope you can help me,

214
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
also help Tang.

215
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,240
Don’t worry, I understand it.

216
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,760
But,

217
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,030
you need to write a draft first.

218
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:27,910
I will copy it.

219
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,320
I can’t write any

220
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,880
homely greetings to that person.

221
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,950
Okay.

222
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,550
Stop tidying up. Get me a cup of tea.

223
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,440
I’m about to be choked to death.

224
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,760
Every time you come back at this hour,

225
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
you would ask people to cook for you.

226
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,150
I will tell Commandery Prince An

227
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
if you do it again next time.

228
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,150
General Wu. There is news from
Pingkang Residence.

229
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Qin Luan is somehow investigating
the servants

230
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,350
in Princess Xiping’s Mansion
who were dismissed in the early years.

231
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,960
The servants who were
dismissed in the early years?

232
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,320
Yes.

233
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,880
And it’s the year

234
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,030
when Commandery Prince An
and General Xiao were born.

235
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,910
How is it going
in Princess Xiping’s Mansion now?

236
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,000
Everything is fine.

237
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,520
No one came to make trouble.

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Princess Xiping hasn’t noticed it.

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,280
Should we warn Princess Xiping?

240
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,880
Keep an eye on Zhou Han first.

241
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,520
Wait for my news after I tell

242
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Commandery Prince An about it.

243
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,030
Yes.

244
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,670
To see him.

245
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Not to see him.

246
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,440
To see him.

247
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,150
Not to see him.

248
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,800
To see him.

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,550
Not to see him.

250
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,030
To see her.

251
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,550
Not to see her.

252
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,960
To see her.

253
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,870
Not to see him.

254
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,080
Your Highness.

255
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,270
Chu Chu.

256
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,510
You Highness, this is the medicine
from Miss Leng.

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,950
She has something else to do.

258
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,800
I decocted it.

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,910
Take it while it’s hot.

260
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,800
Thank you.

261
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,150
You...

262
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,610
Come in first.

263
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,840
Your Highness, I...

264
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,700
I’m ready for your punishment.

265
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
Ready for my punishment?

266
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,510
I promised you on that day

267
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,640
that after we found Sir Witch Doctor,

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
I’d accept any punishment from you.

269
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,710
Get up first.

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,270
Okay, I need you to do three things

271
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
as my punishment for you.

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Whatever you want.

273
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,560
First, get up.

274
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,190
That simple?

275
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,960
That’s… one of the three things?

276
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,800
Second, forgive me.

277
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,880
Is that a punishment?

278
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,080
It was my fault when Chu He
fell in the water on that day.

279
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,510
It’s me...

280
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,290
Well...

281
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,170
That doesn’t count.

282
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,410
I lost my temper and made you angry.

283
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,440
I should be the one
to ask you for forgiveness.

284
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,350
Okay, then let’s forgive each other.

285
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,000
That’s your mother’s relic.

286
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,320
Do you want to see it?

287
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,040
Go ahead.

288
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,700
So, this is the color my mother liked.

289
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,180
I drew this based on
her appearance you restored

290
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
and these clothes.

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,350
I only finished the lines.

292
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,440
I haven’t colored it.

293
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,310
Don’t worry.

294
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,950
These things will be

295
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,680
returned to you later.

296
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,720
My mother is so pretty.

297
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,510
She’s smiling at me.

298
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,200
You are so smart.

299
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,230
If she were alive,

300
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,130
she would be proud of you.

301
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,150
I’ll send it to you

302
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,470
after I color it.

303
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

304
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,150
Chu Chu, as for the third thing…

305
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,350
I don’t know

306
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,150
what my father went through
over the years.

307
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,380
He was living here alone
and suffering from illness.

308
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,080
His life must’ve been hard.

309
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,080
As his son,

310
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,960
I couldn’t stay by his side
and take care of him.

311
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,230
It’s you

312
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,330
who were by his side
in his hardest days.

313
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,520
Chu Chu, thank you.

314
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,640
Your Highness, what are you doing?

315
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,670
I can’t take this.

316
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,450
I should be the one to thank
Sir Witch Doctor.

317
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,390
He didn’t despise me
like other people did.

318
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,850
He spent time with me, told me stories,

319
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,790
and encouraged me when I was a kid.

320
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
I’m really grateful to him.

321
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,050
I will never forget him.

322
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,720
And you.

323
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
Have you decided?

324
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,080
I...

325
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,280
I don’t know.

326
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,640
You don’t know

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,230
because the court wants to

328
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,150
arrest you back and convict you

329
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
and you are afraid
you would implicate me

330
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,080
and leave me
in a difficult place, right?

331
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,080
Your Highness, you can
give me up to them.

332
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,170
I believe

333
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,440
you will reveal the truth

334
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,570
to the world.

335
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,570
I’ll go back to Chang’an

336
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,280
and stay in jail for a while.

337
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,670
I’m not afraid.

338
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,030
Chu Chu, think about it.

339
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,350
I just found out your identity
a few days ago.

340
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,270
There are still many things
to be verified.

341
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,640
But the order
was already made in Chang’an

342
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,270
thousands of miles away to arrest you.

343
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
Do you know what this means?

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,830
Someone is on to you.

345
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,670
On to me? Who?

346
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,150
The Acting Chief Eunuch, Qin Luan.

347
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,320
He found your stone pendant

348
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,350
and concluded that you know my father.

349
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,590
Qin Luan is afraid that what happened
back then will be revealed.

350
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,680
He wants to find my father through you

351
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
and kill you both.

352
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,090
If you go back to Chang’an now,

353
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,700
you are going to die.

354
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,470
Right now,

355
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,040
there are many doubts in the case of
illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou.

356
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,660
A lot of people may be involved.

357
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,720
If I go back to Chang’an with you
to protect you,

358
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,600
I’ll fall for the trick
of the person behind it.

359
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,390
Therefore, Chu Chu,

360
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,800
if you insist on asking me to
give you up to them,

361
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,390
you are leaving me in a difficult place.

362
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,910
What should I do then?

363
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,130
If you trust me,

364
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,380
just stop worrying and stay by my side.

365
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,790
I know how to deal with my teacher.

366
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,320
What can we only do now

367
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,690
is advance and retreat together.

368
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,580
I’ll listen to you.

369
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,000
Are you willing to come back to me

370
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
and stay with me forever?

371
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,690
Of course I do.

372
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,040
I’m willing to be your coroner forever.

373
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,200
Not as a coroner.

374
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,560
Chu Chu, I want to spend
every day with you

375
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,560
and take care of you forever.

376
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,830
Will you marry me?

377
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,030
You want to marry me?

378
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,560
Yes.

379
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
♪The moment♪

The medicine is almost cold.

383
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,880
You should take the medicine first.

384
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,610
♪I care about my life♪

385
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,840

Chu Chu.

390
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,750
What’s wrong?

391
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,560
Didn’t you go to apologize to
Commandery Prince An?

392
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,560
He didn’t forgive you?

393
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,680
Or he scolded you?

394
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,400
Don’t cry.

395
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,160
Tell me about it.

396
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,190
Maybe I can help you.

397
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,160
How about this,

398
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,230
have some wine.

399
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,310
After a drink,

400
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,070
you will forget all the troubles

401
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,310
when you wake up tomorrow morning.

402
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,560
I’ll drink with you.

403
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,000
Commandery Prince An proposed to me.

404
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,710
Did you say yes?

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
I’m willing to stay by his side
as his coroner

406
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,370
and stick with him.

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,430
I can do whatever he asks me to do.

408
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,400
But I can’t marry him.

409
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,230
Why not?

410
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,470
Don’t you like him?

411
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
I know what kind of person

412
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,430
Commandery Prince An is.

413
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,590
Since he said that to you,

414
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,590
he is definitely not just
talking about it.

415
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,560
Marrying a man is not

416
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,640
the only important thing
in a woman’s life,

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,640
but if you miss the one you love,

418
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

419
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,350
Think about it carefully

420
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,560
before you make any decision.

421
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Your Highness.

422
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,430
Why did you ask me to come here
from Chu’s mansion

423
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,160
in the middle of the night?

424
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,430
I think I did something stupid today.

425
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,070
Then learn from it

426
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,830
and don’t do it again.

427
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,000
Your Highness.

428
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,470
I proposed to Chu Chu
and she rejected me.

429
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,880
You proposed to Chu Chu?

430
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,520
You said that I have someone in my heart

431
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,470
and I need to think it through.

432
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,800
I thought about it.

433
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,470
The person in my heart is Chu Chu.

434
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,190
But I didn’t ask you to propose to her.

435
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,640
How to be with her

436
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,430
if I don’t propose to her?

437
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,640
When? What did you say?

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,590
Tonight.

439
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,280
She came to apologize to me.

440
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,950
And I just confessed.

441
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,830
What are you doing?

442
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,640
I want to see
if you’re out of your mind.

443
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,800
Who would chase a girl in that way?

444
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,830
You proposed to her

445
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,920
and confessed to her too soon.

446
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,950
You scared her off.

447
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,040
How could she say yes?

448
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,830
It looked like
she really was scared off.

449
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,710
It’s my fault.

450
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,000
I should have taken you out
to enrich your experience.

451
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,040
Look what you did.

452
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,070
Come on.

453
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,560
Let me tell you...

454
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,040
Master, what are you burning?

455
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Aren’t these the files

456
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,430
we brought from Rugui House?

457
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Now we have got rid of Xu Rugui.

458
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,190
Do we need them no more?

459
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,950
You told me that Princess Xiping

460
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,920
gave birth to two sons in that year,

461
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,800
right?

462
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,430
I told Zhou Han about it.

463
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,110
Tell me about the rumors

464
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,310
in Chang’an again.

465
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,040
Normally, when a woman

466
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,680
bears two children,

467
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
it can be diagnosed by the doctor

468
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,520
after six or seven months.

469
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,070
But the doctor who felt
Princess Xiping’s pulse

470
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,040
reported the good news to the Palace

471
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,060
after Princess Xiping
gave birth to her two sons.

472
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,500
At that time,

473
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,900
Xiao Heng had left Chang’an
for quite a long time.

474
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,290
Think about it.

475
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,380
How could the rumors sound good?

476
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,020
Go

477
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,690
ask Zhou Han

478
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,860
to get some people to find them.

479
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:36,530
Make sure to bring them back
alive to me.

480
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,380
Here are the clues.

481
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,740
Master, rest assured.

482
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,410
I’ll ask Zhou Han to do it now.

483
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,260
Hurry up.

484
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,900
Why are you here?

485
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,020
I asked the Imperial Cook
to make some snacks.

486
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,980
I’m here to bring the snacks
to Eunuch Qin.

487
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,410
Jinbao, come here.

488
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,520
Yes.

489
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,760
What a bootlicker!

490
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,560
(Guanling Yamen)

491
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,830
Yesterday I contradicted you.

492
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,320
I was being reckless.

493
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,680
You must think it over carefully.

494
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,530
Yes, I understand.

495
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,030
It’s all ready.

496
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,520
Where is Vice Minister Jing?

497
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,240
Your Highness!

498
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,740
Your Highness.

499
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,000
Something happened.

500
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:27,910
What’s wrong?

501
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,070
It’s my brother. He is missing again.

502
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,110
What? What do you mean again?

503
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,710
I noticed that Chu Ping
didn’t look right

504
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
when I was picking Chu He up.

505
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,070
I asked him and knew

506
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
that Chu He went out yesterday afternoon

507
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,950
to find Xu Rugui.

508
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,310
But he didn’t come back last night.

509
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,680
Leng Yue has sent people to find him.

510
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,470
Ridiculous!

511
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
He almost lost his life last time

512
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,360
because of Xu Rugui.

513
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,790
He is not fully recovered yet
and he did it again.

514
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,360
Your Highness, my father said

515
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,510
my brother was determined to

516
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,310
get Xu Rugui back
to redeem his mistake.

517
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,480
Otherwise he would feel shameful

518
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,430
and unqualified to work
in the County Office.

519
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Don’t panic.

520
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,350
Only Chu He can find Xu Rugui

521
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,610
in this place.

522
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,870
I’ve sent a lot of people into
the mountain to search for Xu Rugui

523
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,070
and they didn’t find him.
Can Chu He find him on his own?

524
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,710
You mean

525
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
Chu He is more familiar with this area

526
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,800
than the soldiers of
the Military Commissioner.

527
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,190
It might be easier for him
to find Xu Rugui.

528
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,280
Jinli’s men didn’t find him,

529
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,430
but Chu He might be able to find him.

530
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,880
I’ve asked people to keep an eye

531
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,280
on the few roads into the mountain.

532
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,780
I should’ve known it if he went into

533
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,650
the mountain yesterday.

534
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,960
Unless there is another possibility.

535
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,520
Xu Rugui is not in Phoenix Mountain?

536
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,860
Not in Phoenix Mountain?

537
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,360
But Chu He said

538
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,000
that he saw Xu Rugui

539
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,670
going in the direction
of Phoenix Mountain.

540
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Xu Rugui is very familiar with
this area.

541
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,560
I’m afraid that going in the direction
of Phoenix Mountain

542
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,830
is just a smokescreen

543
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,640
for those who are chasing him.

544
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,560
Chu He should have thought about it,

545
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,520
and he figured out

546
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,310
where Xu Rugui might be hiding in,

547
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,430
that’s why he left alone.

548
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,040
Chu Chu, think about it carefully.

549
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,560
Is there any other hiding place

550
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,920
in the county

551
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,430
where Xu Rugui and Chu He both know?

552
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,760
The hiding place...

553
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,800
He was injured.

554
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,430
He won’t keep moving.

555
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,710
I think he should be hiding in a place.

556
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,760
He may think when we think
he has escaped from Guanling County,

557
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,470
we will give up searching this place

558
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,560
and head for somewhere else
to look for him.

559
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,140
The he will take the chance to escape.

560
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,950
So it should be a place

561
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,190
where he can get water and food easily.

562
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,830
Maybe it’s a secret place.

563
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,430
Maybe it’s in a busy area.

564
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,350
A secret place in a busy area?

565
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,520
I know it.

566
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,080
The letter has been sent out?

567
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,190
What did you write?

568
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,590
None of your business.

569
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,310
I...

570
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,110
Do you remember
what I told you yesterday?

571
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,560
But I still feel a little...

572
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,040
But what?

573
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,520
You must listen to me at this time.

574
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,190
Trust me.

575
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
Go ahead.

576
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,830
Your Highness, it’s over there
by the big tree.

577
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,190
Come on!

578
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,040
We found him! Hurry up!

579
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,800
Yes!

580
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,880
Brother.

581
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,040
Hurry up. Put him here.

582
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,590
Be careful.

583
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,230
Be careful.

584
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,040
Brother.

585
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,520
Come on. One, two.

586
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
Your Highness, mercy!

587
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Is my brother okay?

588
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,230
He’s fine. He was knocked out.

589
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,160
Greetings to Commandery Prince An.

590
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,040
I got drunk last night and overslept.

591
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,110
Cut it out. What’s this place?

592
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,190
Vice Minister.

593
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,920
This is a century-old tree,

594
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,950
also the legendary Tree of Love.

595
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,880
Those who pray for love here
will get what they want.

596
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,530
Your Highness, Xu Rugui lost
too much blood.

597
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
He must be sent back to
the County Office for treatment now.

598
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Brother, you are awake.

599
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,170
Xu Rugui is still in the tree hole!

600
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,800
We found him.

601
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,160
Brother, you found him.

602
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,190
You knocked him out.

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,580
I knew he must’ve been hiding here.

604
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,800
There is food and drink.

605
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
It’s also convenient to
ask for information.

606
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,010
It’s just that I was careless

607
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,750
and didn’t notice the moss by the tree.

608
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,030
You are not careless, you are lucky.

609
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,570
If he didn’t lose too much blood,

610
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,700
do you think you could talk about
being careless right here?

611
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,920
But it’s me who knocked him out.

612
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,110
All right, let’s get back first.

613
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,760
Your Highness.

614
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,840
About my brother
letting go of Xu Rugui...

615
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,000
He has redeemed his mistake.
He is reprieved.

616
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

617
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,590
Take Xu Rugui away.

618
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,680
Come on.

619
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,000
Go.

620
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Brother, get up.

621
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,660
Your Highness, I have something
to tell you.

622
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,710
What is it?

623
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,660
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

624
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,710
Your Grace.

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,590
How is it going?

626
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,520
The Imperial Astronomer
has matched the horoscopes

627
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,190
of General Xiao and Miss Leng,

628
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,040
saying they are

629
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:35,790
a good match.

630
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,400
I’m afraid after Mr. Xue comes back

631
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,040
and General Xiao is promoted,

632
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,800
the Emperor will
grant a marriage for them.

633
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,020
(Memorial)

634
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
Han Ji

635
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,860
is so greedy for credit.

636
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,330
He has been trying
different ways to ask me

637
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,570
to urge Xue Rucheng to return with
the survivor of the rebellious party.

638
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,500
He is not young anymore.

639
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,140
For such little credit,

640
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,260
his manner looks too bad.

641
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,740
Your Majesty, I think

642
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,780
Minister Han’s concerns

643
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,930
are not totally unreasonable.

644
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,860
This is strange.

645
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,690
It’s the first time
you speak for Han Ji.

646
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I’m not speaking for Minister Han.

647
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,260
I’m worried about you.

648
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Worried about me?

649
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,260
Then tell me

650
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,740
what you are worried about.

651
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,030
Your Majesty, Xue Rucheng
was born in a humble family.

652
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,840
He got good grades in the examination

653
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,910
and got Senior Jing’s appreciation.

654
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,030
Then he acquainted himself
with Princess Xiping

655
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,960
and became Commandery Prince An
and General Xiao’s teacher.

656
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,840
Without those things, how could he
become who he is today?

657
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,390
How do the things you said
have anything to do with me?

658
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,390
Your Majesty.

659
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,910
Xue Rucheng has a close
relationship with Princess Xiping.

660
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,600
It’s possible that he has feelings for

661
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
Princess Xiping.

662
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,310
Right now, he is in the Southwest
inspecting the military affairs

663
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,840
of Qianzhou for Your Majesty.

664
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,510
If he stays there for too long

665
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,030
and gets in touch with the Leng clan...

666
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,120
Your Majesty.

667
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,960
Commandery Prince An, General Xiao,
Vice Minister Jing

668
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,670
and Leng Peishan’s only granddaughter

669
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,270
are all in Qianzhou.

670
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,480
We have to guard against them.

671
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,240
You are even more prudent

672
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,150
than I am.

673
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,790
I just always bear Your Majesty in mind.

674
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,020
(Jing’s Mansion)

675
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,060
(Father)

676
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,950
Master, what you have done

677
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,830
is for avenging the Prince Consort.

678
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,000
If he knew it in the underworld...

679
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,430
I feel guilty for Xiao Heng.

680
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,310
I have to finish the things

681
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,920
he wanted to do when he was alive.

682
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,950
Master, if this matter is uncovered,

683
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,950
I’m afraid the Southwest will be
in a bigger mess.

684
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,560
Leng Peishan concealed his illness.

685
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,710
Now there is illegal minting of coins
in Qianzhou.

686
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,710
What he is plotting to have
is not just the military power.

687
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,190
If Leng Peishan is really
up to something bigger,

688
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,800
doesn’t that mean Young Master Jing Yi

689
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,540
is in great danger over there?

690
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,430
At this point,

691
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,520
I have to take a gamble.

692
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,110
Master, what are you going to bet on?

693
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,040
He has the favorable
geographical position.

694
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,400
I’ll bet on timing and people.

695
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,230
I have asked the Emperor
to give them more power

696
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,110
in the name of
dealing with the illegal minting.

697
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,310
I hope Commandery Prince An
can play to the score.

698
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,800
It should

699
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,830
not be too late.

700
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,470
I can only guarantee
that he won’t die for now.

701
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,920
As for if he can wake up and talk,

702
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
you need to find someone else
to treat him.

703
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,310
Thank you for today.

704
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,000
Go back and have some rest.

705
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,800
Okay.

706
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,680
You’ve found Xu Rugui.

707
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,030
Why are you still staying in Qianzhou?

708
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,310
There is something
unfinished in Qianzhou.

709
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,350
I must stay here and find it out.

710
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,310
Jinyu, did you forget what I told you?

711
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,950
The longer you stay here,
the greater the danger will be.

712
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,600
If anything happens to you,

713
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,760
how should I explain to Princess Xiping?

714
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,350
Sir, if I don’t solve it,

715
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,440
I can’t explain to the court,

716
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,000
and I can’t explain to my father.

717
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,890
Leng Peishan’s affairs
are military affairs.

718
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,760
It should be the Ministry of War
that investigates it.

719
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,070
If there is anything special, they will
ask Three Judicial Offices for support.

720
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,340
Even you are in charge of
the Three Judicial Offices,

721
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,230
you can’t intervene in military affairs.

722
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,840
What I want to investigate
is not military affairs.

723
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,150
Then what do you want to investigate?

724
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,190
When Jinli’s men went into

725
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,230
the mountain to search for
Xu Rugui a few days ago,

726
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,600
they found some sneaky people

727
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
who don’t look like villagers.

728
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,230
I thought it was Xu Rugui
trapped in the mountain.

729
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,000
But now, it seems

730
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,190
that there should be someone else.

731
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,080
What are you suspecting?

732
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,840
Sir, do you still remember

733
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,160
the copper coins
sent to you and Senior Jing

734
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,860
by Wu Jiang?

735
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,320
Of course.

736
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,110
I found some

737
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,490
illegally minted coins in Qianzhou

738
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,800
and asked the Prefect of Qianzhou,
Li Zhang to handle the case.

739
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,430
I suspect

740
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,330
that those sneaky people in the mountain

741
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,190
are related to the case of
illegally minted coins.

742
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,870
Military Commissioner’s soldiers
dressed up and went into the mountain,

743
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,850
which made them panic.

744
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,120
Maybe there is an important clue

745
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,630
in the Phoenix Mountain
about this illegal minting of coins.

746
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,710
You do have to investigate it.

747
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,280
There is another strange thing.

748
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,250
When Li Zhang caught me on that day,

749
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
I saw his hands.

750
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,120
Li Zhang’s hands?

751
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,000
There are a lot of

752
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,030
new and old small cuts on his hands.

753
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,900
Cuts?

754
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,280
According to Chu Chu,

755
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,800
those cuts should be caused
by small flat sharp tools.

756
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,950
Such wounds

757
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,910
are often found
on the hands of sculptors.

758
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,080
That’s not strange.

759
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,760
I heard about it.

760
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,470
Li Zhang was born in a poor family.

761
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,360
When he was a child
studying in the temple,

762
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,020
he learned some carving skills
to support his life.

763
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,150
As far as I know,

764
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,950
he hasn’t given up carving till now.

765
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,800
I’ve also heard about it.

766
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,600
But I’ve been having a question

767
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,080
about the minting of the coins.

768
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,990
You also saw that the fake coins

769
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,180
minted in Qianzhou are nearly
the same as the real coins.

770
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,520
The coin mould is copied really well.

771
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,390
However, the official coin mould
is so important

772
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,360
that even a prefect
can’t reach it at will.

773
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,580
But if someone who can carve stuff

774
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,390
and have access to
the official coin mould,

775
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,290
he can memorize

776
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,730
its details and size,

777
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,020
and then copy it.

778
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,390
That makes sense.

779
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,640
You suspect that Li Zhang is involved

780
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,120
in the case of minted coins?

781
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,840
It’s only my speculation now.

782
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,950
After we find their mint,

783
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,520
everything will be clear.

784
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
I can’t intervene in the affairs
of the Three Judicial Offices.

785
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,840
You can decide it by yourself.

786
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,710
But it’s the Emperor’s order

787
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,670
to bring Chu Chu back to Chang’an.

788
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,950
Either I take her back,

789
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,710
or I take back the truth of
the Prince Consort’s case.

790
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Please forgive me.

791
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,950
Neither Chu Chu nor the evidence
about my father’s case

792
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,760
can be taken away by you.
