00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,030
No wonder Rugui House’s Manager Xu

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,150
looks so odd.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,820
He knows how to disguise his look

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,260
(Map of Chang’an)

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,820
(East Market)

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,470
and also has a secret residence.

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,100
(Ruyi Pawnshop)

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,070
His Highness led us on
an all-night pursuit,

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,550
but we were always one step behind him.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,070
We just can’t catch him.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,390
Moreover, he seems to be
investigating His Highness.

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,620
(Princess Xiping)

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,790
(Jing Yi)
That manager Xu.

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,550
(Xiao Jinyu)

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,620
Who on earth is he?

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,060
(Xiao Jinyu)

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,940

=Episode 7=

19
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,830
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)

20
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,880
(Princess Xiping’s Mansion)
Your father’s conferment decree was ordered.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,910
Leng Family, from the Southwest,
supports me.

22
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,190
But if I insisted to seek justice
from the Imperial Court,

23
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,000
considering the situation,

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,830
I would’ve already brought calamities
on you and your brother

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,190
before the justice could be upheld.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,110
Mother,

27
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,830
it seems that

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,470
father might still be alive.

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,470
This isn’t as simple as you think it is.

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,470
In all these years,

31
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,000
there wasn’t any news about your father,

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,240
whether it’s from Chang’an
or the Southwest.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,630
Suddenly, when you were
selecting coroners,

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
a coroner who has the pendant

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,800
came out of nowhere.

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,630
And you happened to find the pendant.

37
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,880
In a few days,

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,520
someone left you

39
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,110
these investigation records
about your father.

40
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,000
This whole thing is too suspicious.

41
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,960
Beware of traps.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,110
The one who left these investigation
records behind

43
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,670
is the suspect of several murder cases.

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,880
His whereabouts are now unclear.

45
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,830
In order to catch this suspect,

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,440
we also need to investigate
my father’s case.

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Even if I don’t handle it,

48
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,630
the other ministers from
Three Judicial Offices will take over.

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,600
Mother, don’t worry.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,800
Just like you’ve said,

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
the current situation is different,

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,240
as long as I can find
father’s whereabouts,

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,960
father can return to the capital safely.

54
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,470
Trust me.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,270
No matter what kind of circumstance
father is in,

56
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,270
I’ll return home safely

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,160
with him.

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,520
I knew it.

59
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,000
Once you know what happened
to your father,

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
I just can’t stop you.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,830
Mother,

62
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,110
who do you think are the people

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,110
that care so much about
father’s whereabouts?

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,520
Is it because the remaining rebels
want revenge?

65
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,240
Or... ?

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
What remaining rebels?

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,000
How can there be remaining rebels
in the realm of His Majesty?

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,600
Don’t cook up nonsense without evidence!

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,320
Aren’t you afraid that
those with evil intentions

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,070
might hear you

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,510
and make a fuss about it.

72
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,200
They’d criticize you for
fabricating rumors,

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,790
scaremongering, and
threatening His Majesty’s rule.

74
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,920
Yes.

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Mother, you’re right.

76
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,550
I don’t know who they are.

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,480
But there’s one thing

78
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,720
you must remember.

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,550
Whatever you do,

80
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,790
beware of the eunuchs.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
Don’t let your guard down.

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Yes, I’ve taken note of that.

83
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,880
Mother, don’t worry.

84
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,640
Mother, I have one more question.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,230
Does father have

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,350
any recognizable feature on him?

87
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,390
For example,

88
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,790
a birth mark, or a scar.

89
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,950
Why do you ask this?

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I’ve only seen father’s portrait
drawn when he was young.

91
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,070
After all these years,

92
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,350
his look must have changed.

93
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,920
If I find father,

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
it’s hard to verify his identity
based on his look.

95
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,550
He does have a scar.

96
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Master, look at this.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,320
This is tribute to you from

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,070
the eunuch who made a mistake
at Jiangshan Hall.

99
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,390
Tribute to me?

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes.

101
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,000
Where’s his tribute to you then?

102
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,440
Master, please be observant.

103
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,950
How dare I?

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,670
Listen up!

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,350
The wall of this palace is high,

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,440
but they’re not airtight.

107
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,110
Before doing whatever you want,

108
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,440
think about your butt first.

109
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,160
Go.

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,270
Don’t forget the pain
once the scar is healed.

111
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,070
Don’t cause me any trouble

112
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,720
when you’re caught in excitement.

113
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,720
If so, I’ll have no mercy on you.

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
Master, don’t be mad.

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,200
Xu Rugui said that he’s
taken care of everything.

116
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,550
Has he?

117
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,040
How about the family of the killer?

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
He’s also taken care of them.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Xiao Jinyu’s reaction is vital in

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,390
deciding the status
of Xiao Heng’s matter.

121
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,070
Keep an eye on him.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,350
Go.

123
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,270
And make me another
hot Huzhou Zisun tea.

124
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,920
Yes.

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,760
One sugar-roasted chestnuts.

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,320
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,390
Here you go.

128
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,140
(Ruyi Pawnshop)

129
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,390
Sir, you’re so early.

130
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,160
We haven’t...

131
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,950
I’m in a hurry.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Please do me a favor.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,950
Okay. Okay.

134
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,070
This way, please.

135
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,600
Sir, please be kind.

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,270
Spare me some food.

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
Sir, please.

138
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,670
Give me some food.

139
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,600
Thank you.

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,230
There’s a fight.

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,040
Don’t move.

142
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,350
Go.

143
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,390
Freeze.

144
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
What’s going on?

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,000
(Steamed Bun)

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
You haven’t had breakfast, right?

147
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,910
Here. Let me give you a bun

148
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
in case you take poison
and commit suicide.

149
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,760
Come. Don’t fight back.

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,790
Behave.

151
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,030
Go.

152
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,790
-Go.
-Go.

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,710
Let’s go.

154
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,520
Madam.

155
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,840
Why did you come home alone?

156
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,110
Where’s our son?

157
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,960
Something went wrong last night?

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
No.

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Madam, don’t worry.

160
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,960
Everything has been
reported to be all right.

161
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,280
We just can’t stop worrying.

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes.

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
But there’s one more thing

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
that need your attention.

165
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,400
Leng Yue will return to Chang’an today.

166
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,440
It’s so obvious that

167
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,550
Jing Yi has feelings for Leng Yue.

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,150
You must keep an eye on him.

169
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,400
Jing Yi likes to follow Leng Yue
everywhere since he was a kid.

170
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,760
Even Her Grace said that she’s willing

171
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,030
to let Leng Yue marry Jing Yi.

172
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,790
But you insisted that I fix Leng Yue
and Commandery Prince An up.

173
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,440
Why?

174
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,030
Madam, just don’t ask.

175
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,400
Well.

176
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,550
Commandery Prince An always
refuses to get married.

177
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,150
Does he also have a crush on Leng Yue?

178
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,590
How can I know?

179
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,590
I just know that

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I have a crush on you, madam.

181
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,400
So cheesy.

182
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,860
(Poetry of Autumn Breeze
Painting of Summer Lotus in Rain...)

183
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,840
Look.

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,670
This.

185
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,320
In the last month,

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,200
you’ve bought so many
good stuff at Antique Store.

187
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,230
Is any of those for me?

188
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,590
Madam, don’t be angry.

189
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,000
Miss Chu.

190
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,710
Lord Jing.

191
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,590
I’ve got a question for you.

192
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
Has His Highness told you

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,960
the result of coroner selection test?

194
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,710
Not yet.

195
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,710
You already knew?

196
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,000
Did I pass?

197
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,080
Listen.

198
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,590
Even if you aren’t selected

199
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,710
when the result comes out,

200
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,590
as long as His Highness doesn’t
tell you to leave himself,

201
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
the test isn’t over yet.

202
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,470
You still get a chance to be selected.

203
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,910
The test isn’t over yet.

204
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Every moment you spend here,
every word and every action of yours

205
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,080
are part of the test.

206
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,790
You must do you best to win his favor.

207
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,520
But you mustn’t do it too painstakingly.

208
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,880
What does it mean?

209
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Actually, you already did so well.

210
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,550
But you’re directing your work
toward the right place.

211
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,960
You have to hit the right spot.

212
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,520
But you can’t do it so obviously

213
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,910
like giving a gift.

214
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,790
He’s hard to please.

215
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,910
But he can’t resist
the temptations of a mystery.

216
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,470
You have to give him leads

217
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,000
and let him explore on his own.

218
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,470
Once he finds the things
he likes on you,

219
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,520
he’ll definitely keep you by his side.

220
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,760
The things he likes?

221
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,080
Your Highness, this is
how far I can help you.

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,000
I’ve apologized to Academician Xue

223
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,590
for you.

224
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,080
He took accountability for you.

225
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,030
That’s your fault.

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,350
Though you’re an important minister
in the Imperial Court now,

227
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,760
you’re still inexperienced.

228
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,670
From now on, you should listen to

229
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Academician Xue’s opinions more often.

230
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,910
Yes.

231
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,760
I got it.

232
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,910
Yesterday, Madam Jing came to me

233
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,470
and told me that Leng Yue will return.

234
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,320
Do you know that?

235
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,840
Greetings, Your Grace.

236
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,840
Rise.

237
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes.

238
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,110
Your Highness,
Vice Minister Jing’s men just reported.

239
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,550
He’s handled the things as you ordered.

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
He’ll report to Three Judicial Offices
after freshening up.

241
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

242
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,910
I’m too busy with work.

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
Mother, I’ll visit you another day.

244
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,030
Go ahead.

245
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,060
(Three Judicial Offices)

246
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,470
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,640
Take this beggar to eat something first.

248
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,230
Interrogate him later.

249
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,520
Did you hear it?

250
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,520
You’re lucky that you’re
in the hands of His Highness.

251
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,760
Come with me.

252
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Yes.

253
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,590
Rise.

254
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,840
You?

255
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,910
What do you kidnap me for?

256
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,470
He’s the one who robbed me.

257
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,440
His Highness has many rules.

258
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,520
No one is allowed to eat

259
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,400
in any of those rooms.

260
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,760
You have to make do with this spot.

261
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,550
Thanks.

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,350
What? You need chopsticks?

263
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
No. No.

264
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,960
Beggars like us are satisfied
as long as we have food.

265
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,110
We’re not that fussy.

266
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,670
Look at the way you’re dressed,

267
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,550
you seem to be a scholar.

268
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,590
Yes.

269
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,520
These were left by my ancestors.

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
I just retrieved them from the pawnshop.

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,910
I met that beggar the moment
I stepped out of the door.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
I gave him food out of kindness.

273
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
But he tried to rob me.

274
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,710
Recite the chapter, Moral Cultivation

275
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,320
from The Great Learning.

276
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:38,910
Er...

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,000
Well.

278
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,910
You’ve been learning for years,

279
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,550
you can’t even recite The Four Books?

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,280
I... I’ve quit learning for a while.

281
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,910
How do you make a living then?

282
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,230
I’m an accountant now.

283
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,110
For which shop?

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,230
For a foreign caravan.

285
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,150
A foreign caravan.

286
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,550
They left Chang’an a while ago.

287
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,030
They sell fur pelts?

288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,790
Yes.

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
What are the market prices
of goat fur, dear fur, and fox fur?

290
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,080
Which is the most popular kind
in Chang’an?

291
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,670
Well.

292
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,550
I’m not in the mood for chitchat.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,640
And you’re not smart enough to fool me.

294
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,520
You killed Liu Yue,
Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

295
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,230
Lu Chuansheng, Capital Liaison
Representative of Qianzhou,

296
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,880
and Feng Jie, Minister of War.

297
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,440
The case has been solved.

298
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,230
What are you talking about?

299
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,880
I can’t understand any of it.

300
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,520
Then, let me tell you something
you can understand.

301
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,710
Now, Xu Rugui wants to
silence you forever.

302
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,840
Will he spare your wife and kid?

303
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,590
You... How... ?

304
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,710
How do I know?

305
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,880
Your wife and kid are now
held hostage by Xu Rugui.

306
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,670
On your wrist, there are two strands
of colored braids.

307
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,400
Women and kids wear those
during the Dragon Boat Festival

308
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,230
to ward off evil spirits and disasters.

309
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,400
Judging from their color,

310
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,150
they might be from two years ago.

311
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,030
You went to withdraw gold
from the pawnshop

312
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,550
because you were prepared to flee.

313
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,080
But you still carried those with you.

314
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,710
It shows that they’re as important

315
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,520
as your life to you.

316
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,150
Even if you die,

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,550
you’d die with them.

318
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,880
Where do you beg?

319
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,150
In the streets.

320
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,400
Anywhere I go.

321
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,640
I made a bad choice today.

322
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,790
I wished to rob a fortune so
I can live an abundant life.

323
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,760
I’ll never do it again.

324
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,030
Don’t rush. Just eat.

325
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
Haven’t you heard His Highness?

326
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,230
Let’s talk after you’re full.

327
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
I’m just curious.

328
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,880
What do you often eat?

329
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,520
We live off the scraps of every tavern.

330
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,000
We eat everything we can find.

331
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,670
So, you’ve had food

332
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,790
from every tavern in the city, right?

333
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,030
Which is the best?

334
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
Guangtai House, of course.

335
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,110
Then, how about Rugui House?

336
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,030
Last night, Xu Rugui fled in a hurry.

337
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,200
He may haven’t had the chance to

338
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,880
kill your wife and kid.

339
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,160
Now, it’s up to you
to decide their fate.

340
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,520
You can keep on wasting time with me.

341
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,280
Or you can tell everything honestly.

342
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
It’s your decision.

343
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,760
You can really find them?

344
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,000
It depends on whether
you tell the truth or not.

345
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,640
I’ll tell you everything.

346
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,160
Vice Minister Jing.

347
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,920
General Wu.

348
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,190
Vice Minister Jing,
thanks for the hard work.

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
You too.

350
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,310
He knows where the killer’s
wife and kid are.

351
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,160
His Highness is so miraculous.

352
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
He’s done with the interrogation
before we can finish the meal.

353
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,000
Hurry up.

354
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,710
I’m waiting for you to
have a drink tonight.

355
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,430
Enjoy your meal.

356
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,040
Your next meal will be your last one
before execution.

357
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,000
What do you mean?

358
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,710
I was just being too hotheaded.

359
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,800
The robbery was unsuccessful either.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,680
Master, please spare my life.

361
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,800
I’ll never do it again.

362
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,760
What robbery?

363
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,070
You’re so tricky.

364
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,520
Don’t try to cover up the true crime.

365
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,760
Listen.

366
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,640
You’ll be executed because
you committed murder.

367
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,230
The other man has confessed everything.

368
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,040
You plotted against his wealth and life.

369
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,110
You want to kill him and his family.

370
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,040
You just saw it, didn’t you?

371
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,190
He has confessed everything
under His Highness’s interrogation.

372
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Fine. Take him back.

373
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,110
Yes.

374
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,000
Master, please be observant.

375
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,590
I didn’t kill his family.

376
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
He’s the killer.

377
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,110
Trust me.

378
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,590
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

379
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,520
Whether he’s the murderer or not

380
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,680
has nothing to do with
your killing his family.

381
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,190
I’m only responsible for your case.

382
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,350
Tonight, I’ll stay up late

383
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,430
and archive your case

384
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,950
so they can execute you
tomorrow at noon.

385
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,000
Master.

386
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Vice Minister Jing.
Please be observant.

387
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,880
I really didn’t kill his family.

388
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,950
His wife and kid are still alive.

389
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,160
Let him go.

390
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes.

391
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,560
It’s real?

392
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,520
Yes, it’s true.

393
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,110
Two years ago, on the day
of the Dragon Boat Festival,

394
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,520
Xu Rugui suddenly kidnapped
my wife and son,

395
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,230
and he came to me

396
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,640
with these two braids my wife made.

397
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
He said he found me a job
where I could earn a fortune.

398
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,110
If I refuse,

399
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,920
I can never see them again.

400
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,470
Besides Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng,

401
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,160
and Feng Jie,

402
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
who else have you killed?

403
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,640
I kill one or two people
from time to time.

404
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,230
I didn’t dare to inquire about

405
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,590
the victims’ identities.

406
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,800
Did Xu Rugui ever tell you

407
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,760
the reason for killing them?

408
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,430
He never told me.

409
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,640
He never allowed me to ask either.

410
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,710
Have you seen Xu Rugui interact with

411
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,680
people from Shence Army?

412
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,800
Sometimes, I saw Shence Army members

413
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,110
drink at Rugui House.

414
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,000
I know nothing beyond that.

415
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,560
The Dancing Service’s dancer,

416
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,560
Lady Liu.

417
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,000
Is she with on this side?

418
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,110
No, I’ve never heard of her.

419
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,590
I just follow Xu Rugui’s orders.

420
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,920
I really don’t know the rest.

421
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,040
Oh.

422
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,640
As for the most recent murder case,

423
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
it should be carried out by me

424
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,160
and another guy together.

425
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,880
It’s more secretive if
it’s conducted by both of us.

426
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
But that guy was missing

427
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,520
half a month ago.

428
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,470
So I committed the recent three murders

429
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,040
all on my own.

430
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,920
Can you describe this person’s look?

431
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,070
Yes.

432
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,230
Tell me.

433
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,230
Yes.

434
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,880
Miss Chu, what are you doing?

435
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,640
I’m making a mirror.

436
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,310
Make a mirror with this?

437
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,110
There are many bronze mirrors
in the mansion.

438
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,000
I can get you the ones you want.

439
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,040
No. No need.

440
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,830
Three Judicial Offices definitely
doesn’t have a mirror like this.

441
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,190
Miss Leng, you’re back?

442
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,640
(Leng Yue)
You’re the coroner who probed His Highness’s body

443
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,520
(Leng Yue)
and even tried to take off his clothes?

444
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,520
Who are you?

445
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,070
Miss Chu, this is...

446
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,400
Don’t mind who I am.

447
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,310
Answer me first. Is that you?

448
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,350
Yes, it’s me.

449
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,760
But I did it because of the test...

450
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,710
So, it’s real.

451
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,880
I thought Wu Jiang and Jing Yi

452
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,920
made that up to fool me.

453
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,590
You look quite handsome.

454
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,830
But aren’t you a coroner?

455
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,110
Why are you here polishing a spoon?

456
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,350
I’m not polishing a spoon.

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,470
Who on earth are you?

458
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,070
Guess.

459
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,190
You’re so pretty.

460
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,230
You can’t be an average person.

461
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,070
I haven’t washed my face or
changed my clothes in three days.

462
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,040
How can you say I’m pretty?

463
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,710
I’ve never seen a woman
as beautiful as you.

464
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,070
Can you elaborate?

465
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,800
You features are in neat positions.

466
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,470
You have clear shapes,

467
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,830
perfectly shaped jawlines,

468
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,400
and sleek neck bones.

469
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,950
You have broad shoulders, slim waist,

470
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,830
powerfully-built thighs
and fit lower legs.

471
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,070
You have the strength

472
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,350
that’s rarely seen on other women.

473
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,000
If I were a man,

474
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,520
I would wish to marry you.

475
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,040
Your Highness.

476
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,640
You’re forgetting your manners.

477
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,590
No, I’m not.

478
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,310
Your coroner just said that

479
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,430
she would marry me.

480
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,040
I...

481
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,590
Don’t even try to take it back.

482
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,520
I have an eye-witness.

483
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,560
Fine.

484
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,280
Lian Qiao, take her to freshen up

485
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
and wait for me at Ten-Commandment Hall.

486
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,640
Yes.

487
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
I’m waiting for you to marry me.

488
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,040
Your Highness, who is she?

489
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,000
She’s the granddaughter of Leng Peishan,
the Military Commissioner of Qianzhou.

490
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,830
Her name is Leng Yue.

491
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,110
She’s always like this.

492
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,000
She doesn’t really mean what she says.

493
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,470
I’m sorry

494
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
if she offended you.

495
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,430
Why are you polishing a spoon here?

496
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
No, I’m not.

497
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,520
I just...

498
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
Are you here for me?

499
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,680
Can you write autopsy sheets?

500
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,880
Yes, my grandfather taught me.

501
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,800
Although writing autopsy sheets
are the job of clerks,

502
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,950
coroners have to know it too.

503
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,930
Otherwise, if clerks write nonsense

504
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,760
and put coroners’ names on it,

505
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,680
coroners will be the ones blamed.

506
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,280
Do you still remember

507
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,280
the findings of the autopsies

508
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,350
on Feng Jie, Liu Yue,
and Lu Chuansheng?

509
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,310
Yes.

510
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,110
As long as I’m the one
who inspected the bodies,

511
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,400
I won’t forget.

512
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:06,920
Okay.

513
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,430
I’ll send someone to give you
the autopsy sheets later.

514
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
Fill those sheets

515
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,760
and hand them in to me.

516
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,070
Oh.

517
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,430
Don’t fill in the blanks for

518
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,040
the names of the recorder
and the coroner.

519
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,880
I get it.

520
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,230
Don’t worry. Don’t rush.

521
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,590
I can fill in my name

522
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,950
when I become the official coroner.

523
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,000
I’ll definitely become
the official coroner.

524
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,040
Senior Jing.

525
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,110
As for His Majesty’s conferment decree
for Minister Feng,

526
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,560
I’ve come up with a few
posthumous names.

527
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,190
Are these appropriate?

528
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,310
Last night, the mourning hall of
Feng’s Mansion caught fire.

529
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,830
I heard you were at the scene.

530
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,110
Yes.

531
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I was afraid that things might go wrong.

532
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,830
So, I took a look.

533
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,190
I happened to meet
Commandery Prince An.

534
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,000
He was there to apologize
at the behest of His Majesty.

535
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,950
He had some misunderstanding
with Feng’s Family.

536
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,430
I was worried someone might
take advantage of that situation.

537
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,680
So I stayed and handled it.

538
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,470
There was another incident last night.

539
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,280
I don’t know if you’ve heard of it.

540
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,430
Are you referring to
the close-down of Rugui House?

541
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,350
Yes.

542
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,430
I only heard the rumors.

543
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,920
His Majesty summoned royal members
and beloved ministers

544
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,110
to palace for the tea gathering today.

545
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,110
Bring up Feng Jie’s conferment decree
at a later date.

546
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,230
Don’t spoil His Majesty’s good mood.

547
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,380
(Memorial)

548
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,160
Yes.

549
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,800
Stand up.

550
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,590
Chief.

551
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,190
It seems that your skills

552
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,400
are improved a lot during the last year.

553
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,430
You’ve made so many delicate gadgets.

554
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,830
This is the Three Judicial Offices.

555
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,160
Address me properly.

556
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,680
Don’t be a bad influence for my men.

557
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,230
I’ve been calling you that
since I was little.

558
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,640
It’s hard to change.

559
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,560
Moreover,

560
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
there’s nobody else here anyway.

561
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,070
Alright.

562
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:20,880
Your Highness.

563
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,350
Where’s Jing Yi?

564
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
Why isn’t he here?

565
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,520
Without him being a reference object,

566
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
you can’t really see how sweet I am.

567
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,040
Thank you. Thank you very much.

568
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,040
Honey!

569
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,350
Good to see you’re OK.

570
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,430
Yes, I’m fine.

571
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,230
Why did you come back suddenly?

572
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,800
You are fed up with the colorful world?

573
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,520
Not really.

574
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,350
Chang’an is also
part of the colorful world.

575
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,230
And there are always new stuff to see

576
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,280
out there. How can I be fed up?

577
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,590
But the news about you
was more interesting.

578
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,000
Wu Jiang told me in the letter that

579
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,590
you were almost striped by a girl.

580
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,470
Of course I had to come back.

581
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,920
I asked him to ask you about
the Handsome Judge in the letter.

582
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,310
And he told you those irrelevant stuff.

583
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,640
You can’t blame him for that.

584
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,430
If he hadn’t told me,

585
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,070
I wouldn’t have known if what I got

586
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,280
were the things you wanted to know.

587
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
What information did you get then?

588
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,560
I’ve asked all my friends,

589
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,920
but nobody has heard of

590
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,830
somebody called Handsome Judge.

591
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,520
So I asked them to investigate
something else.

592
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,160
What?

593
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,430
Recently,

594
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,760
I’ve been thinking about
the girl’s background.

595
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,280
Although locals say that

596
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,280
she was a sideslip of his father.

597
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
But according to my friends in Qianzhou,

598
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,430
her father, Chu Ping,

599
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,560
is definitely not
such an indecent person.

600
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,310
Are you sure?

601
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,470
Chu family members are all honest.

602
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,280
And people tend to
avoid contact with coroners.

603
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
So normally,

604
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,830
they don’t deal with other people much

605
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,950
other than doing their works.

606
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,110
Earlier,

607
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,640
when that girl left her home

608
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,640
for Chang’an for the
Coroner Qualification Test,

609
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,310
her family asked a trade caravan
to take care of her.

610
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,040
And Chu He, her big brother,

611
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,920
escorted her all the way out of Qianzhou

612
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,230
before he headed back home.

613
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,430
If you ask me,

614
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,950
judging by the way they treated her,

615
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,360
it didn’t look like she was a sideslip.

616
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,430
That doesn’t make sense then.

617
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,920
If she’s the daughter
of Chu Ping and his wife,

618
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,830
and they treasure her that much,

619
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,430
why didn’t they come out

620
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,590
and make clarifications for her,

621
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,710
rather than letting the rumors spread?

622
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Maybe they are just magnanimous

623
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,680
and don’t care about it at all.

624
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,110
During your year out there,

625
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,040
have you ever been to Qianzhou?

626
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,160
You know clearly that

627
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
Qianzhou is the last place I would go.

628
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
Your Highness, Miss Chu is here.

629
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,280
And she has something for you.

630
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Let her wait for a minute.

631
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,430
Yes.

632
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,590
Who did you tell about
coming back to Chang’an?

633
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,430
I only told you in the letter.

634
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,900
(Breathing Clear Air Makes You Calm)

635
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,560
Please.

636
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,710
Please wait here for a minute.

637
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,230
What is this?

638
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,950
I told you not to touch anything.

639
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,190
That’s paint.

640
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,430
Use this.

641
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,400
Go wash your hand with some alcohol.

642
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,880
You’ve finished the autopsy sheet?

643
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,000
I… I…

644
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,310
I didn’t mean it.

645
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,400
I’ll go fill another one.

646
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,640
Come back.

647
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,470
It’s OK. Give it to me.

648
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,040
It’s fine as long as I can read it.

649
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,060
(Autopsy Sheet)

650
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,430
OK.

651
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,520
Come with me.

652
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,760
This is your remuneration
for examining those three bodies.

653
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,040
Remuneration? No, no, no.

654
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,110
This is too much.

655
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,950
I didn’t get this much the last time

656
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,160
when I examined Mr. Yan Ming’s body.

657
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,520
To examine Feng Jie’s body,

658
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
you almost lost your life to the fire.

659
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,110
That was hard for you.

660
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,040
And you provided many clues
for arresting Xu Rugui.

661
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,560
You earned this.

662
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,920
Those were all my duties.

663
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,350
This is also my duty.

664
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

665
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,160
Your Highness,

666
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,070
can I ask you a question?

667
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,310
Ask away.

668
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,350
Do you like beautiful girls?

669
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,000
Of course.

670
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,830
So this must be what Lord Jing meant

671
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,760
when he said “cater to his pleasure”.

672
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,640
The so-called beautiful girls

673
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
are those who make you feel pleased.

674
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,430
Otherwise,

675
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,000
they would not be deemed beautiful.

676
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,070
Of course I like girls

677
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,760
that make me feel pleased.

678
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,190
Your question is pretty weird.

679
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,350
What do you want to ask really?

680
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,000
I…

681
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,190
Nothing.

682
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,920
I also want to know

683
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,680
if the results of the qualification test

684
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,230
and the selecting test

685
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,070
are out.

686
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,160
Now that you paid me,

687
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,350
does that mean I’m already selected?

688
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,760
I paid you because you did your work.

689
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,920
It has nothing to do with the tests.

690
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,190
Nobody’s selected yet
through the selecting test.

691
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,070
What about the qualification test?

692
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,560
Your place of domicile is in Qianzhou.

693
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,520
Chang’an can’t verify your background

694
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,640
in a short while.

695
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,520
According to the rules,

696
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
whatever your result may be,

697
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,040
you can’t get a qualification right now.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
How come?

699
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,400
Your Highness.

700
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,880
Come in.

701
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,110
Your Highness.

702
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,560
Jing Yi drafted this wanted notice

703
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,800
according to the portrait you drew.

704
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,760
He’s in a hurry to go to the palace,

705
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,280
so he asked me to send it to you.

706
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,070
Isn’t this the man
who was struck by lightning

707
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,470
and then burned to death?

708
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,760
He’s already dead.

709
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,950
How can he still be wanted?

710
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,070
The corpse is totally burned,

711
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,880
how can you recognize his face?

712
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,110
Even if his face was burnt,

713
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,710
the bones are still intact.

714
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,590
What a person’s face looks like

715
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,560
(Brow ridge Skull)
has a lot to do with the brow ridges.

716
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,230
His eyebrows are different from yours,

717
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,350
(Different eyebrow shapes)
General Wu’s,

718
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,350
(Different eyebrow shapes)
and mine.

719
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
It’s because the shapes
of our brow ridges are different.

720
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,800
The brow ridge is an arch-shaped
bony ridge above the eye socket.

721
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,230
This is that person.

722
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,280
I’m sure of it.

723
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,760
That explains all.

724
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,190
He was badly burned,

725
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,710
but I could feel that

726
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,110
he had fractures

727
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,310
in his ribs, arms and shanks.

728
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,310
No matter what a bad temper he had,

729
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,640
he wouldn’t fight people desperately

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,230
almost every day,

731
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,640
unless that was his job!

732
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,040
You were right.

733
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,160
This man had a life-risking job.

734
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,560
He’s a killer.

735
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,310
A killer?

736
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,950
Wu Jiang.

737
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,590
Your Highness.

738
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,190
Replace this wanted notice
with a missing person notice

739
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,640
and send it to Jingzhao Yamen.

740
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,310
Let them post it

741
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
and see if he had any family.

742
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,920
Yes, Your Highness.

743
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,470
Your Highness, what’s going on here?

744
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,710
Half a month ago,

745
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,190
he disguised himself as a drunk

746
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,680
and slipped me a note

747
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,520
while I was out on an errand,

748
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,000
He said he’d reveal to me
a murder of a court official

749
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,800
that had not happened yet.

750
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,160
In exchange,

751
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,830
he wanted me to guarantee his safety.

752
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,000
In that note,

753
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,040
he asked me
to meet him at a sesame oil shop

754
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,830
in the West Market.

755
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,430
On that day,
I waited until the market closed,

756
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,470
but he never showed up.

757
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,430
Sesame oil?

758
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,000
I remember,

759
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,080
before he died,

760
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,630
he was carrying some sesame oil, right?

761
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,910
Yes, maybe he was there that day.

762
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,600
But before I arrived,

763
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,280
he was found by the people who hired.

764
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,230
So he ran into
the woods outside the city,

765
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,120
trying to hide.

766
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,760
But he was struck by lightning

767
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,280
and his lantern
accidentally ignited the sesame oil.

768
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,080
Just like what you’ve figured out.

769
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,430
Chu Chu,

770
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,430
what else can we find out

771
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,710
from a badly burned corpse?

772
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,390
It’s hard to say.

773
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,320
Before the death of each victim,

774
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,910
what they were thinking and doing

775
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,040
are different,

776
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,870
so each corpse is also different.

777
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,630
I can only tell when I see the corpse.

778
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,800
Your Highness?

779
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,320
I have something.

780
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,560
I’d like you to take a look at it.

781
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,760
What is it?

782
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,910
This is...

783
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,800
Do you recognize this man?

784
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,470
On his left arm,

785
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,080
is there a burn like this?

786
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,520
I...

787
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
This is the person who
gave you the pendant, isn’t it?

788
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:27,870
Yes...

789
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,670
No, no, I...

790
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,280
Tell me!

791
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,430
Where is he now?

792
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
I don’t know who you’re talking about.

793
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,360
Your Highness.

794
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,390
What is it?

795
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,520
Someone is here from the palace.

796
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,040
The palace?

797
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,190
Why did I tell him that?

798
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,320
I’m so stupid. So stupid!

799
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,840
How did he know?

800
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,670
How does he know everything?

801
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,190
Is he the Handsome Judge or not?

802
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,710
What if he’s not?

803
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,280
Greetings, Commandery Prince An.

804
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,120
Eunuch Qin, as you were. What is it?

805
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,760
I’m here to deliver
a message from His Majesty

806
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,950
that you’re invited
to the banquet today.

807
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,320
Please report to His Majesty

808
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,430
that I’m quite engaged
in Three Judicial Offices,

809
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,600
and I’m afraid I couldn’t attend today.

810
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,670
Commandery Prince An,

811
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,390
His Majesty
has specifically instructed that

812
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,150
I have to take you to the palace

813
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,870
even if I have to force you.

814
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,800
But of course,

815
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,390
if you don’t want to go,

816
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,600
I wouldn’t dare to offend you.

817
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,910
It’ll be my honor

818
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,150
if I’m punished because of this.

819
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,190
But if you don’t go today,

820
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,560
His Majesty is worried
that someone will eat you.

821
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,360
I don’t know

822
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,150
what that means.

823
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,630
If anyone is confident
that they can take it,

824
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,000
just come and eat.

825
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,470
By the way,

826
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Princess Xiping and Academician Xue

827
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,840
are summoned to the palace, too.

828
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,840
Commandery Prince An,

829
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,520
if His Majesty hears this reply from you

830
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,760
and gets furious,

831
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,150
I’m afraid
it’s not going to be easy for you.

832
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,840
Thank you for reminding me.

833
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,470
Please, Eunuch Qin.

834
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,520
I’ll take my leave now.
