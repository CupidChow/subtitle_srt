1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:04,621
(Between them, De and Yi)

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,140
Damn.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,508
Can't believe I have to meet you

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,777
even when I'm drinking after work.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,717
Can't you just leave me alone?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,010
Be gentle.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,590
You're showing off to me on purpose, aren't you?

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
To introduce to you

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,160
your future cousin in law.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Zhou Shu Yi.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,702
He is my cousin, Pei Shou Yi.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,430
You are his cousin?

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,270
Why did you pretend to chase him?

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,100
It made me...

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,140
What?

16
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,377
Jealous?

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,110
He's annoying.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,115
Stop it, don't mess with him.

19
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,640
So protective of him.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,617
Yes.

21
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,850
Whatever.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,490
I'm tired of looking after you kids.

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,360
It's time for me to do something for myself.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,160
Hey.

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,599
My treat today.

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,199
Don't bother.

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,660
The usual.

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,100
What?

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,340
Check that couple over that.

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,110
Do you feel yourself a lonely elder?

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,012
So nice.

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,248
I wanna be in love too.

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,110
What?

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,055
Not everybody has to be like you,

35
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,100
so disconnecting with affections.

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,024
Love is so beautiful.

37
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,592
I looked it up on the internet the other day.

38
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,228
I think you are now

39
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,190
in a high risk period for schizophrenia.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,866
First, it's emotional apathy,

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,969
and then emotional retardation.

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,330
When it becomes emotional decline,

43
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,373
you're not far from depression.

44
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,008
Who hurt you

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,410
and made you so cold?

46
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,810
Come on.

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,690
Are you done with being a pub owner

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,490
and trying to be a shrink?

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,400
People always forget about the bad

50
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,920
when they are in the good state.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,720
When in love,

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,850
the brains are flooded with dopamine,

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,490
which would stop you from thinking reasonably.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Until you have to

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,770
face the bloody reality.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sometimes it's harder to let go than break up.

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,480
One breaks up for not love the other anymore.

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,380
But if love is still there,

59
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,250
the other one can't let go easily.

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,470
You have nothing to do.

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,140
Why don't you take up another career?

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,210
To open a pub and compete with you?

63
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:45,475
(America, 101 days in love)

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,400
(There was a delay when I got off the plane.)

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
(I just got home.)

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,610
(You must be in soundly asleep.)

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,600
(When I entered the room, I suddenly felt a little...)

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,560
(lonely.)

69
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,060
(This is the first letter for you.)

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,100
(Hospital Services and Charges)
(You might forget to check the inbox)

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,103
(Hospital Services and Charges)
(because you don't use e-mails often.)

72
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,070
(Hospital Services and Charges)
(It's OK if you do.)

73
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,600
(Remember to charge you phone,
take it with you and stay online)

74
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,510
(so I can stay in touch with you. )

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,780
(I really miss you.)

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,020
Hi, baby.

77
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,360
Do you want some cake?

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Oh, sure.

79
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,930
Try it.

80
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,839
Is it good?

81
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:41,875
Try it.

82
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,440
Nice.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,850
Oscar.

84
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,680
Do you want a drink or a juice?

85
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:54,850
No thanks.

86
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,350
Oscar.

87
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,525
Is there any place you wanna go?

88
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,420
I wanna just stay here,

89
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,490
playing with Oscar.

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,163
OK.

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,100
(So you've been basking in the sun with your love)

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,430
(in America.)

93
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,170
(Some things don't have to be said in person.)

94
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,230
(Seeing it is enough.)

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,240
Oscar.

96
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,950
Give me the help.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,490
Oscar.

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,390
(I miss you.)

99
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,365
(There are something)

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,900
(that I want to tell you in person.)

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,260
(Please give me some time.)

102
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,697
(From Gao Shi De: I miss you. There are something
that I want to tell you in person.)

103
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:49,400
(Please give me some time.)

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,530
(Gao Shi De.)

105
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,680
(You don't have to be afraid that I'll cling to you.)

106
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,625
(Since we've known each other so long,)

107
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,120
(you have my blessing.)

108
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,028
(Be happy.)

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,630
(From today,)

110
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,560
(let's not see each other anymore.)

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,140
(Let's just be strangers.)

112
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,260
(I didn't tell you)

113
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,110
(because I'm afraid I might complain to you.)

114
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,251
(I didn't see you)

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,450
(because I'm afraid I would want to keep you)

116
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,450
(from leaving.)

117
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,990
(Zhou Shu Yi.)

118
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,327
(I really)

119
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,763
(miss you.)

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,960
(Shu Yi.)

121
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,600
(Did you see my text?)

122
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,970
(Shu Yi.)

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,007
(Please reply to me.)

124
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,940
(Shu Yi.)

125
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:32,812
(I miss you.)

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,933
(Why don't you text me back?)

127
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,018
(Where have you been?)

128
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,020
(It's been two years since I left Tai Wan.)

129

(Zhou Shu Yi.)

130
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,490
(My messages,)

131
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,695
(you didn't reply but now you don't even read them.)

132
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,960
(I didn't receive anything)

133
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,134
(from the first mail.)

134
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,202
(I know)

135
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,130
(you are angry.)

136
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,977
(I told you I would be back in two months.)

137
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,845
(But now it has been two years.)

138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,930
(Can you hear my explanation?)

139
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,620
(I will be back tomorrow.)

140
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,591
(Shu Yi.)

141
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,320
(I will take the earliest flight)

142
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,396
(and will arrive in two days.)

143
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:24,898
(At least,)

144
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
(meet me once.)

145
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,402
(Okay?)

146
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,680
