3
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,870
Hurry!

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,950
Father!

5
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,120
Father!

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,200
Mr. Gu,

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,560
you're awake.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
I just removed the arrow for you.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,150
It had barbs,

10
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,280
but luckily it didn't hit the bone.

11
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,120
Water.

12
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,840
Yu'er.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,350
Okay.

14
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,310
My father said you can't drink water.

15
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,680
Here,

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,880
take in some moisture;
it'll make you feel better.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
Why am I here?

18
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,520
Yu'er,

19
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,329
go outside and keep watch.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,540
Mr. Gu,

21
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,610
you took such a big risk

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
to help me get through this trouble.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
Please accept my bow.

24
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,440
We were

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,030
originally waiting for you
at the entrance of Shuangjia Mountain,

26
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,760
but Yu'er

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
insisted on meeting you
at the foot of the mountain.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,630
Thankfully we listened to her,

29
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,630
otherwise we would have missed you.

30
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,510
You're incredibly lucky.

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,770
In this heavy snow,

32
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,430
you turned into a popsicle

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,590
in just half an hour.

34
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,580
Mr. Chang,

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
I know you mean well,

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,120
but have you thought about the fact that

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
if they catch up and find out,

38
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,760
it won't just be you—

39
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,940
all your men below

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,190
will be dragged down because of me too.

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,960
I, Chang Si, have spent my whole life
roaming the world.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,680
Not to mention someone who's saved me,

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,150
even if we just met by chance,

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,810
I can't leave them on the road.

45
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,760
Don't worry.

46
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,780
We'll leave at dawn

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,590
and travel without stopping.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,590
We should reach Songshan

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,520
before dark.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They won't be able to
catch up with us now.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
They have elite cavalry.

52
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,110
Even if we leave a night earlier,

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,120
within four hours,

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,720
they could catch up.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
In this snow,

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,040
the tracks from the cart

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,910
can't be erased.

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,010
Hurry, hurry!

59
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,870
Don't move!

60
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,510
Mr. Chang,

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,580
I have a way

62
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,640
that we can escape alive.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,830
Those behind, keep up!

64
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,600
Hurry up!

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
Those in front, stop!

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
Stop!

67
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,920
-Stop!
-Stop!

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000

69

Stop! Stop!

70
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360

71
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,920

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,310

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
Stop! Stop!

74
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,040

76
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,070
Commander Xu.

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
What's wrong?

78
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,940
Commander Xu.

79
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,630
Get out of the way!

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,430
Move aside!

81
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,400
Make way!

82
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,350
There's nothing in here.

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,750
Nothing here either.

84
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't have anything here either.

85
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,480
Old man,

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,420
what's on the cart?

87
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,310
It's big fish.

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Where's the salt?

89
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,410
There's no salt.

90
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:26,830
Go down and check.

91
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,830
That's not right.

92
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Could it be that you've colluded

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,290
to help the exiles escape?

94
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,159
In my entire life,

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
I've never eaten anything bad

96
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
or done anything illegal.

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,870
People like us who navigate the world
fear getting into trouble with the authorities.

98
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,530
Who would dare help with this?

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,460
-I'm telling the truth.
-Have you found him?

100
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,560
No!

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,240
No!

102
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,560
Impossible!

103
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,770

104
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,120
We haven't seen anyone else

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
along the way.

106
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
He must be in the cart.

107
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,770
Sir.

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,720

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,950
the consequences of harboring exiles?

110
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,000
How many lives do I have

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,390
that I'd dare do such a thing?

112
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,920
I'm telling you the truth.

113
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,430
Sir,

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,720
we were supposed to

115
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
go to Jilin today.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,390
How about we wait until you return

117
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,920
and then search carefully?

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,130
Everyone, mount up!

119
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
Old man,

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
if we don't find this person,

121
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,250
I'll hold you responsible.

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,270
Don't think you can escape.

123
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm telling the truth, sir.

124
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,330

125
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,670

Heizi,

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,820
go to the top of the mountain ahead

129

and keep watch.

130
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,250
If those people come back,

131
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,670
send a signal immediately.

132
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,600
Be careful.

133
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,320

134
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,940
Got it.

135

Mr. Chang,

136
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,350
to be on the safe side,

137
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,670
let the cart
that is filled with salt go first.

138
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,630
Brothers,

139
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,870

break the ice,

142
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,960
and pour the ice pieces
into those three carts.

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,480
Take your flatbreads,

144

tear them up, and put them in the baskets.

146

Tie the ropes
and put the baskets in the water.

147
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,320
After half an hour, pull the baskets up.

148
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,240
Catch the fish

149
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,850
and load them into the cart.

150
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,530
The terrain here is flat and open.

151

We have no choice but to take a risk.

153
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,090
How did it go?

154
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,030
Did you fool them?

155
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
Did you send out

156
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,910
what I asked you to send?

157
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,630
Don't worry.

158
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,890

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,670
Each one was shot clean through the eyes
with a single arrow,

193
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,930
leaving not a single scratch on the hide.

194
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,160
What is this?

195
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,360
This is ginseng wine.

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,790
It's all wild mountain ginseng.

197
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,390
I picked the best ones to soak

198
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,010

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,840

200
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
There's more inside.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,240
Quite a good haul.

202
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,840

those accusations

211

were made by the prisoners.

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,870
It's all fabricated nonsense.

It says you're corrupt
and are abusing your power.

217
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,750
You've treated imperial prisoners

218

you of supplying horses
to the southern rebels.

234
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,080
That's

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,740
a crime punishable

00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,830

339
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,310
Let me tell you a joke.

340
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,680
There was a man

341
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,270
who did many good deeds in his life.

342
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,850
After he died,

343
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,000
he met the King of Hell.

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,410
The King of Hell told him,

345
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,400
"You can

346
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,510
choose whichever family
you want to be reborn into;

347
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,960
just pick whichever you like."

348
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,920
So he said,

349
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,440
"I want to be reborn into
a family that's filthy rich,

350
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,610
no parents,

351
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
a sweet wife, pretty concubines,

352
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,400
a lifetime of peace and good fortune,

353
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,000
and a long,

354
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,530
happy life at the end."

355
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,860
The King of Hell then said,

356
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,070
"Buddy,

357
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,590
if a place like that existed,

358
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,410
I'd go myself

359
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,500
and let you take over as King of Hell.
How's that sound?"

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
Not funny, is it?

361
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
If I get another life,

362
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,590
I want to be like you—

363
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,240
ride with a band of horsemen,

364
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,180
skip all the studying.

365
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,740
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

366
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,550
You won't die.

367
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,670
Is that so?

368
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,580
Look at you,

369
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,460
always calling yourself a tough guy,

370
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,840
and now you're scared to death of dying.

371
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,720
I've spent my life

372
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,880
traveling around with my father.

373
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,310
I've slept on cliff edges,

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,350
run into wolf packs on the plains,

375
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,610
but I was never scared.

376
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,920
Well… Maybe just a little at first,

377
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,780
but then I wasn't afraid anymore.

378
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,310
If I really die,

379
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,680
at least I've got you guys to cry for me,

380
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,920
to bury me.

381
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,830
I'm not afraid.

382
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,170
I'm not afraid.

383
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,410
Let Gu Pingyuan die for all I care.

384
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,110
Haven't we gotten into
enough trouble already?

385
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,590
Keeping an exile with us

386
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,380
is grounds for being confiscated
and beheaded.

387
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
How could you be so reckless?

388
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
If it were up to me,

389
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,430
when we get to Shanhai Pass,

390
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,110
we should find a village,

391
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,910
find a family,

392
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,720
give them some money

393
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,680
and let them take care of him.

394
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,790
Whether he survives or not

395
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,190
is no longer our concern.

396
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,350
Right now,

397
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
he's seriously sick.

398
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,260
If we leave him,

399
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,960
he'll be doomed.

400
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,440
Then why must we take him with us?

401
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,040
Why are you so angry?

402
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,710
Heizi,

403
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,810
I'm getting old.

404
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,810
In the future,

405
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,900
gather the brothers

406
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,790
continue running the horse caravan.

407
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,920
Remember one thing:

408
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,510
No matter how vast the sky and earth,

409
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,970
nothing is more important
than a human life.

410
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,400
Heaven has the virtue of preserving life,

411
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,550
so even if you encounter a stranger
who needs help,

412
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,960
you should still help.

413
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,350
Moreover,

414
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
he has done us a favor.

415
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,590
If you're scared,

416
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,920
you can leave first.

417
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,550
[Capital]

418
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,200
It's dry today.

419
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,350
The Young Master is back!

420
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,760
The Young Master is back!

421
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,960
Hurry up; go to the main room

422
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,790
and report to the Master!

423
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,320
Let's go!

424
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,060
There will surely be a reward.

425
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,000
Young Master.

426
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,040
Young Master.

427
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,690
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

428
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,550
Young Master!

429
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,350
Young Master.

430
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,730
Last month, the butler came back

431
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,510
and said that

432
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,480
you had made a big deal

433
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,490
by yourself.

434
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,440
[Li Mansion]

435
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,750
Seeing you so full of confidence,

436
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,400
I guess the deal was done.

437
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,240
Young Master, the Master requests
your presence.

438
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,110
Go directly to the study to meet him.

439
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,880
It looks so good!

440
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Young Master Li Qin,

441
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,740
the Master is waiting for you inside.

442
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,090
I have returned, Father.

443
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,890
I pay my respects to you, Father.

444
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,700
Come in.

445
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,680
Father.

446
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,440
I have returned.

447
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
I pay my respects to you, Father.

448
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,570
Is everything settled?

449
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,160
Yes.

450
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,750
Once the horse reaches Liaoyang,
someone will take over.

451
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,070
Ms. Su is returning south.

452
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,750
I rushed back overnight

453
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,860
this time.

454
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,020
I know all about it.

455
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,050
Ms. Su sent a letter through someone.

456
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,520
The journey has been smooth so far.

457
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,660
Ms. Su wrote a letter?

458
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,090
What did she say about me?

459
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,490
What do you want to know?

460
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,170
This time, I probably

461
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,340
didn't do anything wrong.

462
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,700
It seems you did everything right.

463
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,660
Father,

464
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,910
what's wrong?

465
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,400
[Merchant of the Capital, Li Wantang]

466
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
Why are you dealing with

467
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,930
runaway exiles?

468
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,270
Do you know

469
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,310
the Qing Dynasty's law regarding exiles?

470
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,770
Harboring or concealing an exile
is a crime equal to their own.

471
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,920
Our family is prosperous and powerful.

472
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,270
Many people are watching us,

473
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,030
just waiting for us to get into trouble

474
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,830
so they can attack us all at once.

475
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,880
Father,

476
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,580
it's not as serious as you say.

477
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,880
Zhang Guangfa

478
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
bought a ginseng doll

479
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,540
and even brought back a child.

480
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,790
I placed the mother and child,

481
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,720
who were entrusted by my brother,

482
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,920
in our pharmacy,

483
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,880
changed their names,

484
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
and let them work as apprentices
while supporting them.

485
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
I wasn't talking about them.

486
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,550
You mean Gu Pingyuan?

487
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,920
Without that fellow,

488
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
we wouldn't have made it back at all.

489
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,620
Father,

490
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,560
you haven't met that person,

491
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,340
but I think he's

492
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,200
a righteous

493
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
and responsible man.

494
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,830
I just don't know

495
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,680
whether he made it out alive this time.

496
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
If he did survive,

497
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,070
I would like to be friends with him.

498
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,330
You want to be friends?

499
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,980
Why do you want to be friends with him?

500
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,060
He brought two people out at once.

501
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,440
If the authorities investigate us,

502
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
our whole family
could be ruined because of you!

503
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,270
But Ms. Su...

504
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,640
Ms. Su does her thing,

505
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
and you should mind your own.

506
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,790
If she wants to rebel,

507
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,760
do you want to get involved too?

508
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,160
She went to buy warhorses,

509
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,690
and I told you to assist her.

510
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,400
Whether she can bring them in or not

511
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,350
is none of your concern.

512
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,240
Why are you acting like
you're so important,

513
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
even getting others to help?

514
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,950
Father,

515
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,920
whatever I do is wrong anyway.

516
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,680
You're the wisest man under the heavens.

517
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,480
But it wasn't my idea to go there.

518
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,460
It was you who told me

519
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,480
to wait for Ms. Su.

520
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,030
If Ms. Su is a rebel,

521
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,780
what are you?

522
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,860
And now you're blaming me?

523
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,900
What do you think of Ms. Su?

524
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,370
She's a beauty,

525
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,440
sure—

526
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,030
but a cold, venomous one,

527
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,760
like a snake.

528
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,480
And her methods

529
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,190
are ruthless enough to scare people.

530
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,280
I've traveled through half of the country.

531
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,200
I've met all kinds of businesspeople.

532
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
She should be considered

533
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
the smartest one of them all.

534
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,770
I dare not refuse to help,

535
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,880
nor do I dare to provoke her.

536
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,370
She is the calamity in my fate.

537
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,240
Father,

538
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,080
how did you come to know her?

539
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are you

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,460
trying so hard to help her?

541
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,330
She is doing nothing
more than enticing me with profit.

542
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,020
Businessmen crave money,

543
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,400
scholars crave fame,

544
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,070
and officials crave power.

545
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,930
As long as someone wants something,

546
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,590
it's like jumping off a cliff.

547
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,750
Heaven really lent a hand this time.

548
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,690
The heat toxins

549
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,180
have all been reduced.

550
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,720
Come.

551
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,150
I've become as fragile as paper,

552
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,680
and even drinking a mouthful of porridge
takes effort.

553
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,070
You're just recovering from
a major injury.

554
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,730
You'll gradually get better.

555
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,550
To survive a great disaster

556
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,080
is to be blessed afterward.

557
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,370
Mr. Chang,

558
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,510
My life

559
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,590
was saved by you.

560
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,190
I'll never forget that
for as long as I live.

561
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,700
I don't know if I'll ever get the chance

562
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,540
to repay you.

563
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,540
Don't talk about repayment.

564
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,880
I have spent my whole life
navigating the world.

565
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,180
This is the last time

566
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,640
I'll get to save you.

567
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,710
It's a perfect ending for me.

568
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,370
Where is Ms. Chang?

569
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,310
These past few days, I've been in a daze.

570
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,740
But every time I woke up,

571
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,160
she was either brewing medicine

572
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,420
or fetching water, wringing out cloths.

573
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,320
For this worthless life of mine

574
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,990
to receive such blessings is a miracle.

575
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,040
I want to thank her properly.

576
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,550
Let's not talk about her.

577
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,720
Let's talk about you.

578
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,650
What are your plans for the future?

579
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,310
I don't know.

580
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,680
Everyone in my hometown

581
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,520
knows I was stripped of my title

582
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,420
and exiled.

583
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,970
I'm afraid if I suddenly show up,

584
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,830
I'll draw the attention
of the authorities.

585
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,090
You should come with me

586
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,040
back to Pingyao.

587
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,190
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

588
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,720
Fine,

589
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,030
just listen to me.

590
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,080
Who else is in your family?

591
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,840
I have an elderly mother

592
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,700
and a younger brother.

593
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,690
There's also Teacher, Mr. Bai.

594
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,150
Mr. Bai?

595
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,210
Mr. Bai was very kind to me.

596
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,680
He even promised his own daughter

597
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
to me in marriage.

598
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,350
Mr. Gu,

599
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,940
didn't you say

600
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,490
you weren't married?

601
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,120
Indeed.

602
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,230
We had agreed to

603
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,400
wait until after the imperial exam
before discussing marriage.

604
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,350
I don't know

605
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,810
what they're up to now.

606
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,080
You should rest well

607
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,240
and talk less.

608
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,840
It's bad for your health.

609
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,240
Where are you going?

610
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
To deliver medicine.

611
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,820
Sit down there.

612
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,320
I have something to tell you.

613
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,150
Yu'er,

614
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,550
from now on,

615
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,520
you don't need to

616
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,490
take care of Mr. Gu anymore.

617
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,360
Alright.

618
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,620
I'll go wash the medicine pot.

619
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,590
We don't need to find a doctor anymore.

620
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,590
We can just throw him out on the street

621
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,480
and we'll even save on rent.

622
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,810
Stop talking nonsense!

623
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,410
Sit down!

624
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,640
Aren't you the one
who wants him to survive?

625
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,770
You risked your life to bring him here.

626
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,650
What I mean is,

627
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,640
your body may be there,

628
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,840
but your heart isn't.

629
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,300
These days,

630
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,750
you've been looking after him
day and night.

631
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,000
I've seen it all.

632
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,060
I'm reminding you,

633
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,960
you're still a young lady,

634
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,990
and haven't found a marriage match yet.

635
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm old now,

636
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,240
and I can't navigate the world anymore.

637
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,040
In the future,

638
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,580
you need to marry properly.

639
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,250
I don't have a son;

640
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,170
I can only live with you.

641
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
You can't

642
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,870
marry an exiled criminal.

643
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,500
Father,

644
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,350
I saved him

645
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,030
not because I want to marry him,

646
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,719
but because Mr. Gu is a good man

647
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,130
and has helped us.

648
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,360
I can't just

649
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,830
watch him die like this.

650
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,480
Let alone he's an exiled criminal,

651
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,409
even if he were a demon or a monster,

652
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
I'd still save him today.

653
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,820
It's hot.

654
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,570
[Yanmen Pass of Shanxi]

655
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,770
We're almost home!

656
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,300
Everyone, cheer up!

657
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,900
Look.

658
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,420
That's Yanmen Pass.

659
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
The storyteller used to mention

660
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,070
Lord Yang with his golden blade,

661
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,070
leading 7 wolves and 8 tigers

662
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,960
to defend here.

663
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,760
If it weren't for
that treacherous official Pan Renmei

664
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,550
deceiving the Double Dragon Society,

665
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,400
how could a

666
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,510
hero of such caliber

667
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,550
have been driven to
his death on this mountain?

668
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,610
I really regret it.

669
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,690
He died;

670
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,090
why are you regretting?

671
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,760
I've been following my father around,

672
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,000
always traveling here and there.

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,260
I used to complain that

674
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,030
when we listened to stories,
we would only hear half of them.

675
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,480
No matter how much we cared,

676
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,540
we'd always leave.

677
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,480
When we came back,

678
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,190
either the storyteller had changed

679
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,390
or they were telling a different story.

680
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,880
Only that year, when the heavy rain

681
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,190
and the horse gang couldn't move on

682
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,400
was I able to listen to the entire story

683
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,880
of "Legend of the Yang Family."

684
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,020
Unfortunately,

685
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,430
all the characters I liked died.

686
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,670
But now, looking back,

687
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,600
those were rare good times.

688
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,840
Look,

689
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
these past few days,

690
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,900
my father's been so happy,

691
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,970
and you've been here
with me, talking and laughing.

692
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,720
I wonder,

693
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,030
when I look back on these days
in the future,

694
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,560
will I feel especially sad?

695
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,400
You probably think I'm just rambling.

696
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,230
My father always says I'm a daydreamer

697
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,290
and never serious.

698
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,170
I think what you're saying is quite right.

699
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,710
The ancients often said,

700
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,110
"Cherish the spring blossoms

701
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,370
and never forget the joy in happy times."

702
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,960
There aren't many

703
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,210
moments of true happiness in life.

704
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,110
The next time your father
goes with the horse gang,

705
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,230
I want to follow him,

706
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,630
and learn a bit about business.

707
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,690
My father said that

708
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
you're a scholar,

709
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,590
meant to take the imperial exams
and become an official.

710
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,050
Business is a lowly trade.

711
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,880
Me, becoming a top scholar?

712
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,800
I've already been stripped of my title.

713
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,440
I'll never have the qualifications

714
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,240
to be a scholar in this lifetime.

715
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,880
In this world, there are scholars,
farmers, artisans, and merchants.

716
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,840
But who says a merchant

717
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,300
is any less than a scholar?

718
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,510
Do you think that if I beg your father

719
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,590
to take me as his student

720
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,760
and teach me about business,

721
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,620
he would agree?

722
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,000
My father would surely be delighted.

723
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,070
If he won't teach you,

724
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,780
I can!

725
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,700
Brother Gu.

726
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,960
Let me ask you something.

727
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,490
Go ahead.

728
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,020
You escaped and traveled so far

729
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,730
just to

730
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,490
learn business from my father?

731
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,400
If I said yes,

732
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,890
I would be lying to you.

733
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,740
The truth is

734
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,590
that all these hardships I've been through

735
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,640
are too strange.

736
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
I still can't figure out
why they happened.

737
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,080
But in this lifetime,

738
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,610
even if it costs me my life,

739
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,070
I must find out the truth.

740
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,190
What?

741
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,120
When I was a child,

742
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,880
my father left
for the imperial examination

743
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,010
and never returned.

744
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,760
When it was my turn to go to the capital

745
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
for the examination,

746
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,190
my mother repeatedly urged me

747
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,110
to do whatever it takes

748
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,240
to find out what happened to my father.

749
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,150
I went to the capital

750
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,710
and searched everywhere without success.

751
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,370
After that,

752
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,520
something went wrong
in the examination hall.

753
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,030
I always feel
there's a hand behind all this,

754
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,110
an invisible hand

755
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,480
striking deadly blows
at both my father and me.

756
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,190
As for the rights and wrongs

757
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,520
of what truly happened,

758
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,480
if I hadn't escaped

759
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,570
and remained in Ningguta,

760
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,000
I could have racked my brains
forever to no avail.

761
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,130
Then where will you uncover the truth?

762
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,510
At first, I only thought of

763
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,070
escaping first
and worrying about the rest later.

764
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,400
But now, truly an exile,

765
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,650
I find the world vast
yet there's nowhere to run.

766
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,370
I'm truly caught between a rock

767
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,300
and a hard place.

768
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,840
Gu,

769
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,190
you're a good man.

770
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,230
There are paths everywhere
for people to travel.

771
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,800
Perhaps you should settle here for now.

772
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,960
and learn some business?

773
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,400
Wait until the imperial court
grants amnesty,

774
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,740
then it won't be too late to move on.

775
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,270
Why sigh and lament so much?

776
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,120
You're right.

777
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,150
My scholarly bitterness

778
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,230
is showing again.

779
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,310
Prepare to go down the mountain!

780
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,460
We're almost home.

781
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,500
[Yingxun Pavilion]

782
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,460
[Pingyao, Shanxi]

783
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,010
[Yingxun Pavilion]

784
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,900
Long time no see, Mr. Chang.

785
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,230
Where have you been making your fortune?

786
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,830
Making money, making money.

787
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,840
Heizi, you're back!

788
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,880
Hello, Mr. Chang!

789
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,490
Hello.

790
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,280
Happy early New Year, Mr. Chang.

791
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,080
Wish you prosperity, Mr. Chang.

792
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,960
May you prosper, Mr. Chang.

793
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,150
Wishing you prosperity!

794
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,550
Mr. Chang, wish you wealth and prosperity.

795
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,960
Mr. Chang, you're back!

796
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,800
Mr. Chang,

797
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,810
it's been a while since we last met.

798
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,270
[Bandit's Bane]

799
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Haven't you seen silver before?

800
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,240
My goodness,
look at that mountain of silver!

801
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,450
It must weigh thousands of catties.

802
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,000
[Proprietor of Taiyufeng, Wang Tiangui]

803
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,670
No wonder it's called Bandit's Bane.

804
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,470
Who on earth could move all that?

805
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,500
This is Wang Tiangui's draft bank.

806
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,320
The most heartless bastard

807
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,840
in all of Pingyao.

808
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,140
If it weren't for him,

809
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,070
my father wouldn't have ended up

810
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,630
exiled to that freezing wasteland.

811
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,160
Let's go.

812
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,440
What happened to Mr. Chang?

813
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,370
What's going on?

814
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,760
Two years ago, my father

815
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,920
had already decided to
stop traveling around.

816
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,210
He bought a house

817
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,000
and leased two acres
of government salt fields.

818
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,630
Wang Tiangui

819
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,950
heard it form someone

820
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,670
that

821
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,040
our house

822
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,070
was built on the dragon's head
of Pingyao County,

823
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,190
the most prosperous location.

824
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,030
He tried to buy it several times,

825
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,320
but my father refused to sell.

826
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,550
So he instigated that scoundrel Li

827
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,730
to file a complaint
at the government office.

828
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,360
The county magistrate

829
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,620
was also bribed by him.

830
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,880
The case was shelved
without ever being heard,

831
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,140
and they sealed off our salt fields.

832
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,030
They said we couldn't sell any salt
until the case was settled.

833
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,030
It nearly ruined our entire family.

834
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,880
Butler,

835
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,290
Mr. Chang has returned?

836
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,260
Four salt carts returned first yesterday.

837
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,070
[Butler of Prince Pingyao's Mansion]

838
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,540
He just went over there.

839
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,740
I saw a

840
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,250
young man

841
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,710
among the horse gang,

842
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,150
who looked unfamiliar.

843
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,830
Go check it out.

844
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,570
Mr. Gu!

845
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,830
Take a look at my courtyard house.

846
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,410
It's the best quadrangle

847
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,110
in all of Pingyao.

848
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,420
Great feng shui,

849
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,620
gathers good energy.

850
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
Show off your skills.

851
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,550
This is the reception hall.

852
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:04,880
Go.

853
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,800
Let me take you inside for a look.

854
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,670
Mr. Gu.

855
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,600
This is the back courtyard.

856
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,530
Mr. Chang.

857
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,080
Please try

858
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,970
this freshly opened aged wine.

859
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,760
Good wine.

860
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,580
Come, smell it.

861
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,030
In our Shanxi tradition,
when a daughter is born,

862
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,920
we bury fifty pounds of wine.

863
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,480
We dig it up and drink it
on her wedding day—

864
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,270
it's called "Daughter's Red."

865
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,430
For a son, it's "Scholar's Red."

866
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,490
These jars here

867
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,960
are the finest goods,

868
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
brewed from the top distillery in Pingyao.

869
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,130
Let's enjoy it tonight.

870
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,070
I want to see you all under the table
by the end of it!

871
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,940
Yes, Mr. Chang.

872
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,030
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

873
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,920
[Chang]

874
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,670
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

875
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,110
Come.

876
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,120
Come, brothers.

877
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,200
This is the back courtyard.

878
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,200
This is the main house,

879
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,560
the master's position,

880
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,800
where the male owner lives.

881
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,070
This is the west wing,

882
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,770
where Yu'er lives.

883
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,400
And this east side

884
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,460
is the raised area,

885
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,810
a place for drinking tea and socializing.

886
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,510
Heizi.

887
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,880
Did you pay for the salt?

888
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,610
Don't worry,

889
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,280
I've settled all payments
and brought back the money.

890
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,800
Quickly prepare the red envelopes.

891
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,630
Early tomorrow morning,

892
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,890
everyone will be going home for New Year.

893
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,030
Add one more measure.

894
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,840
Everyone

895
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,360
gets an extra 10 percent.

896
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,090
But I'm afraid

897
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,840
it's still not enough

898
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
to repay Wang Tiangui's bank money.

899
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,710
Where there are people, there is money.

900
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,440
Everyone has followed us
through ice and snow,

901
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,900
living in fear for so long.

902
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,090
It doesn't matter
if we get less ourselves.

903
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,890
Alright.

904
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,760
Don't stop me!

905
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,870
Is old Chang here?

906
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,890
I'm telling you,

907
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,110
tell him to come out right now

908
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,400
and return my salt field!

909
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,330
What's going on?

910
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,600
Mr. Chang,

911
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,480
it's Li Laizi and...

912
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,030
Wang Tiangui's bank butler.

913
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,760
I'll drive them away right now.

914
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,510
New Year is coming soon.

915
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,770
How can we drive people away at this time?

916
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,510
Be polite

917
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,670
and invite them in.

918
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,070
Alright.
