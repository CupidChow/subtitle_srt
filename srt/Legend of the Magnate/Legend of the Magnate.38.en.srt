00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,800
There's one month left

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,360
to the half-year bet

5
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,830
you made with Mr. Gu.

6
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,120
I said you will head over

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,050
after the seventh day of mourning.

8
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,000
Is Gu Pingyuan ready

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,259
to give up what he owes?

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Why aren't you saying anything?

11
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,490
Say something.

12
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,310
Young Master.

13
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,310
I have failed you.

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,180
Impossible!

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Absolutely impossible!

16
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,500
I invested so much money!

17
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,390
Two hundred shops!

18
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,829
I should have crushed him easily!

19
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,280
Young Master, it was not quite 200—

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,700
it was 188 shops.

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,470
Counting wages and rent,

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,710
we've been losing money.

23
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,150
No one would open

24
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,430
-two salt shops in each town.
-That's none of your business!

25
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,940
I'll bear the losses.

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,570
The losses are mine.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
But the profit

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,290
must have exceeded his, right?

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Why aren't you saying anything?

30
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,329
Young Master.

31
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,920
Mr. Gu made an unexpected move.

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,750
He opened

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,240
231 shops.

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,710
For Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi,
and Shaanxi,

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,240
he used canal transport and horse caravans

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,400
to transport salt
from Changlu's salt farms,

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
well salt from Sichuan,

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
and salt from Lianghuai

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,450
to be sold there.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
The profits are enormous.

41
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
He cannot win.

42
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,910
He cannot win.

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
This isn't right.

44
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,630
This isn't right.

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,150
He's openly defying

46
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,630
the imperial court's salt administration.

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,320
I'm going to the capital to report him.

You're really something.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
How did you manage this?

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,800
We found a route

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,630
from Sichuan that allows us

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,000
to transport salt here.

59
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,520
The Changlu salt region

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
has been peaceful for many years.

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,630
Their salt reserves are abundant

62
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,690
and prices are low.

63
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,300
As for the salt regions in Shandong,

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,710
they can't sell outside the province,

65
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,560
but the province itself
doesn't consume nearly enough.

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,190
But if you look at places like Jiangxi,

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,910
Guangdong and Guangxi,

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,240
and Shanxi and Shaanxi,

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,950
they have insufficient
natural salt reserves

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,120
and have high salt prices.

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,579
But their food

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,510
consists mostly of preserved

73
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,630
and smoked food,

74
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,360
requiring large amounts of salt.

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,700
Since we're opening a salt shop,

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,480
why not

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,330
open in these places?

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
That makes sense.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,830
The salt licenses from Lianghuai

80
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,790
also bear the Qing seal.

81
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,830
Moreover,

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,600

As the saying goes,
businessmen should travel the world.

85

Staying in one province

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,940
is being too restrictive.

87
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,600
I understand now.

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
Are you taking us

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,360
to do transprovincial business?

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,970
If Li Wantang can cross the Yangtze River

91
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,800
to acquire our Lianghuai salt fields,

92
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,630
what's so special

93
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,830
about what I'm doing?

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,690
If we had thought of this earlier,

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,410
why would we have been at odds

96
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,540

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,190
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

99
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,470
has been there all along.

101

to the edge,

102
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,890
I wouldn't want to deal with him this way.

103

please let me go home.

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,650
How could you be like this?

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,690
It's fine, it's fine.

112
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,830
If not now,

113
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,960
I'll go back with you

to pay respects to Old Madam Gu.

115
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,920
What could she possibly say about me?

116
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,520
You're just taking advantage
of my abilities.

117
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,690
Is Gu in there?

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,560
All the filial sons in the world

Young Master Li,

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,630
weren't you going to come
only after the seventh day of mourning?

122
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,120
Sir,

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,530
I'm here to check the accounts.

124
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,800
Sure.

125
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,590
Go ahead.

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,980
Take your time.

127
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,370
You stay right here.

128
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,310
Guards!

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
-Yes!
-Yes!

130
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,830
Guard the door carefully.

131
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,290
Sharpen your blades well.

132
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,690
No one can leave today.

133
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,690
They can leave,

134
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,830
but not alive.

135
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,030
Yes, sir!

136
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,159
Your idea

137
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,600
is excellent.

138
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,870
Some days ago,

139
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,240
I also submitted
a memorial to the imperial court

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,970
requesting to build railways.

141
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,120
Once goods can circulate freely,

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
and merchants can trade everywhere,

143
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,290
our people will become wealthy

144
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,520
and commoners will live better lives.

145
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,550
The imperial court is planning to establish
a Ministry of Commerce.

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,710
I think

147
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
the Minister of Commerce...

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Sir, if you continue this talk,

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
I'll bash my head
against the wall right now.

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,430
Being such a minor official

151
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,140
has already exhausted me

152
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,360
to the point of vomiting and diarrhea.

153
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,430
And now you want me
to go serve as an official in the capital?

154
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,030
You might as well kill me now.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,260
Didn't we agree

156
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
that once I help you
accomplish this matter,

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
you would let me return to Anhui?

158
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,990
How can you...

159
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,950
How can you have no ambition

160
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,870
at all?

161
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,870
This regime

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,330
is not one for business.

163
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,760
We're different from foreigners.

164
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,210
That's insightful.

165
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,070
To be honest with you,

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,950
I've been telling the imperial court
the same thing.

167
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,510
I said we can't keep clinging to

168
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,190
Mencius's old doctrines anymore.

169
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,550
Always going on about

170
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,920
righteousness versus profit,

171
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
and gentlemen versus petty men.

172
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,720
People are doing business with us

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
holding guns

174
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,580
and cannons.

175
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,120
Yet here we are, still talking to them

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,070
about Confucius and Mencius foolishly.

177
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,730
Do you think this makes sense?

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
The Minister of Commerce

179
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,350
is a high-ranking official.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,480
If you're lucky,

181
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
in just a few years,

182
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,980
you'll be my equal.

183
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
What's good about

184
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,360
being in a position like yours?

185
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,390
Aren't you just worried every day

186
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,720
about your own fortune?

187
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,380
I don't have that confidence.

188
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,240
Sir.

189
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm just a man with no ambition.

190
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,669
No,

191
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,789

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,750
I went to inspect the salt fields.

383
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,880
I've just returned from Xiaguan Dock.

384
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,900
Did you see the British ships?

385
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,000
Last time they came

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
it was when Commissioner Lin

387
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,480
fought a battle with them

388
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,270
in Guangzhou over opium.

389
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
What should we do now?

390
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,640
We've brought trouble upon ourselves.

391
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,590
I

392
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,460
should have arrested Li Qin earlier.

393
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,700
I was too soft-hearted,

394
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,960
waiting for his mourning period to be over.

395
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
I didn't expect

396
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,740
he was so agitated

397
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,920
he became a traitor.

398
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,110
Sir.

399
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,150
The situation is different now.

400
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,100
If it were just Li Million,

401
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,520
no matter how hard he tried

402
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,240
to monopolize the salt industry

403
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,310
in Lianghuai,

404
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,790
you're the governor.

405
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,330
You could simply refuse

406
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,240
and he would have no grounds to object.

407
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,480
But now we're dealing with

408
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,400
the British.

409
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
We need to come up with an explanation.

410
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,920
Yes.

411
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,650
I had someone look into

412
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,550
the Elements of International Law.

413
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,260
A country

414
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,720
can declare important commodities

415
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,520
as state monopolies.

416
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,270
I've sent someone with the book

417
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,750
to ride quickly to the capital

418
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,330
and deliver it
to the Office of General Management.

419
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,480
Now we'll see

420
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,680
if they can help me

421
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
stop this mess.

422
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,310
What should we do?

423
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,790
We really screwed up this time.

424
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
Why aren't you saying anything?

425
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,440
You're the Viceroy of Liangjiang,
a high official,

426
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,350
and you have no ideas.

427
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,350
Yet you ask me to think of something?

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,930
I was trying to

429
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,290
protect your business.

430
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,160
Sir.

431
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,820
Let me be honest.

432
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,990
This is not

433
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,530
how merchants should act.

434
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,550
Either you're

435
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
relying on your official position

436
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,780
to pressure others

437
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,750
and do whatever you want,

438
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,680
or you're constantly giving in—

439
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
always backing down.

440
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
If you want to do business
with the British,

441
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,750
this approach

442
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,810
simply won't work.

443
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,900
We're just too weak.

444
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,960
Do you believe

445
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,910
if I had 10 ironclad warships

446
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,750
like those,

447
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,480
no one would dare speak to me like this?

448
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,480
You...

449
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,110
Mr. Li,

450
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,370
why are you sitting in the shadows?

451
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
It's more comfortable this way.

453
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
Much better.

454
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,550
There you go, Sir.

455
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,750
Thank you.

456
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,880
Cheers.

457
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,510
That sneaky old man

458
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
has given in.

459
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,710
That sly old fox

460
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,680
has backed down.

461
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
He's backed down?

462
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,330
Not surrendering—

463
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
probably just being polite.

464
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,020
This is just the beginning.

465
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,850
He'll get increasingly cooperative.

466
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
It's just the beginning.

467
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,030
Surely he will be more and more compliant.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,550
Best do.

469
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
More whiskey!

470
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,310
The talks actually didn't go so well.

471
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,030
That old bastard was acting like
he was playing Taichi with me.

472
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,110
He just won't admit.

the negotiations didn't go well.

at dodging issues

476

and refuses to admit to anything.

477
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
He insists on meeting you in person.

478
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,090
But even if he meets you,

479
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,240
he will still consult with the Emperor

480
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,770
and the Empress Dowager.

481
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,440
Didn't your consul

482
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,350
already go to the capital

483
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
to see the Emperor and Empress Dowager

484
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,660
to resolve this issue?

485
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,240

from the Office of General Management

487
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,350
are even better at stalling.

488
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,420
But they still

489
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
have many ways

490
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,720
to break their promises.

491
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,500
For example, the signing date

492
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,680
is being postponed indefinitely.

with.

497

This isn't exactly profiteering.

with so many people consuming salt.

502

to gain control of only one-fifth

504
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,970
of Qing's salt industry.

505
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,770
You're telling me this isn't profiteering?

506
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,210

this is not a highly profitable industry?

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,130
I'll come ashore immediately.

765
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,750
This is human nature—

766
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,920
truly despicable.

767
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,310
What do you plan to do?

768
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,900
Look.

769
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,920
You've done so much

770
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,320
for Liangjiang.

771
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,280
How could I agree to his demand?

772
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,830
But now

773
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,710
this problem isn't mine anymore.

774
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,270
It's yours.

775
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,070
I know.

776
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,820
Then exile me.

777
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,200
I'm tired of staying

778
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,460
in Liangjiang anyway.

779
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,820
Look at you,

780
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,920
getting upset after just a few words.

781
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,640
Your temper

782
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,790
is worse than mine,

783
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,310
the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

784
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,240
Even if I had

785
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,960
extraordinary abilities now,

786
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,220
they would be useless.

787
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,440
They have their cannons pointed at me.

788
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,490
I absolutely cannot watch

789
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,150
the salt industry fall into foreign hands.

790
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,640
What if

791
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,900
it still isn't settled

792
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,350
after you exile me?

793
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,350
You need to tell me the truth

794
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,610
so I know where I stand.

795
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,530
Well...

796
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,720
Your brother can die, then.

797
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,960
What if we still don't succeed

798
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,290
even after killing him?

799
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,710
Then I'll start a war!

800
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,390
If our salt

801
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,680
is controlled by foreigners,

802
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,400
when I die,

803
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,960
I won't be able to face my ancestors.

804
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,890
This is from the bottom of my heart.

805
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,820
Sir,

806
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,440
I'll help you with this matter,

807
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,770
but you must help me too.

808
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,310
If I can't handle it,

809
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,890
how can you?

810
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,230
If I can't resolve it,

811
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,420
I'll pack my things

812
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,370
and return to Ningguta myself.

813
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,070
Come, sit.

814
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,560
Tell me

815
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,990
how I should help you.

816
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,590
Whether you agree to his demands or not,

817
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,550
he will come ashore sooner or later.

818
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,120
The key to this matter

819
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,270
is that we can't proceed without him.

820
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,680
After he gets off the ship,

821
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,910
whether you kill him,

822
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,620
confiscate his property,

823
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,890
or offer him titles and promises,

824
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,640
I think none of it will work.

825
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,489
It's better to just honestly
take responsibility.

826
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,760
I

827
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,409
take responsibility?

828
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Have you lost your mind?

829
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,840
How about I serve
as the Viceroy of Liangjiang

830
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,639
for a few days?

831
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,480
I'll be your proxy
and handle all negotiations.

832
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,679
After it's done, let me return to Anhui.

833
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,409
For the rest of my life,

834
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,620
leave me alone.

835
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,239
For the rest of your life?

836
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,480
That's too long.

837
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,510
Is that a yes or no?

838
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,710
You're the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

839
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,190
a leader among court officials.

840
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,840
Can't you say something

841
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,900
that I can believe?

842
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,260
Fine.

843
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,000
If you can make this happen,

844
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,460
you'll have freedom to come and go
in Liangjiang as you please.

845
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,060
Are you tired?

846
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,370
If you are, go inside and take a nap.

847
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm not tired.

848
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,630
It's so rare

849
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,930
to have a meal with you.

850
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,180
Who says so?

851
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,110
Then I'll come back
to eat every day from now on.

852
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,000
Please don't.

853
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,970
If you don't find it annoying,
I certainly do.

854
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,190
Where's Pingwen?

855
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,980
What's wrong with you lately?

856
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,000
Didn't Pingwen escort Mother's coffin

857
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,880
back to Anhui?

858
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,370
He won't be back to help until next month.

859
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Recently, things

860
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
have been coming one after another.

861
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,720
My head is about to explode.

862
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,080
It's always been like this.

863
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,370
Yet here you are,
talking about coming home for meals everyday.

864
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,510
Li Qin has

865
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,420
caused a huge mess.

866
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,190
He mortgaged the Lianghuai salt fields

867
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,280
to the British.

868
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,920
Now the British have brought

869
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,980
their gunboats to the Yangtze River.

870
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,880
The work at the salt fields

871
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,810
seems impossible to continue now.

872
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,110
I think we don't need to wait for

873
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,170
Pingwen to return.

874
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,440
We should just go back to Anhui

875
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
and grow tea instead.

876
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
Not just the two of us,

877
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,980
but also the little one in your belly.

878
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,190
You're all talk.

879
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,570
If there are gunboats on the Yangtze,

880
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,770
shouldn't we find somewhere to hide?

881
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,190
Let them be there.

882
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
They won't fight.

883
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,130
It's just that business

884
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,850
will be difficult from now on.

885
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,030
They keep

886
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,760
bringing their gunboats here.

887
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,120
How can we negotiate?

888
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
It's truly infuriating.

889
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,710
Mr. Gu.

890
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,710
Yes?

891
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,780
Someone's here

892
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,510
asking you to meet him at the door.

893
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,770
Why doesn't he come in?

894
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,730
He insists you meet him at the door.

895
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,090
Who is it with such an attitude?

896
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,360
Bastard.

897
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,930
How dare you show up!

898
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,320
Heizi.

899
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,560
Who is this?

900
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,820
What are you doing?

901
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,060
Don't hold me back!

902
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,070
Have you gone crazy?

903
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't hold me back, I said!

904
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,150
How dare you come here!

905
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,030
Alright, alright.

906
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,690
You rascal!

907
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,070
Here.

908
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,320
Hey!

909
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,780
Put this on your eye.

910
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,300
The bruise will heal soon.

911
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,630
You're just lazy.

912
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,530
If I taught you a few moves,
he'd be dead by now.

913
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,290
Don't you dare help.

914
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,030
If I helped,

915
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,110
your body

916
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,410
would already be cold.

917
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,480
Even better.

918
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,070
You should go back first.

919
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,360
Talk things out properly.

920
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,560
Don't fight anymore.

921
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,240
You have the nerve to come here?

922
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,670
I can't enter

923
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,710
Nanjing now.

924
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,760
I don't know what kind of

925
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,280
vicious tactics

926
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,340
that old bastard will use against me.

927
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,550
Did you just come to see

928
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,680
if I'm still around?

929
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,670
I've packed my bags,

930
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,870
ready to go to Ningguta anytime.

931
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,000
Isn't you going to Ningguta

932
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
a good thing?

933
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,230
You should have stayed there

934
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,150
to start with, no?

935
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,080
Is something wrong with your head?

936
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,280
Why did you do that?

937
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,070
I can't help you now

938
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,000
even if I want to, you know?

939
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
I don't need your help!

940
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,150
You can't help me either!

941
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,130
I'm just

942
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,510
a useless, incompetent person,

943
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,580
a child you all make fun of,

944
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,170
a worm, a traitor—

945
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,500
but so what?

946
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,000
You should've just

947
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,920
rotted and died in Ningguta!

948
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
I've lost my entire family.

949
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,960
I have nowhere to go.

950
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,000
After I'm gone,

951
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,030
I hope you and Li Qin
