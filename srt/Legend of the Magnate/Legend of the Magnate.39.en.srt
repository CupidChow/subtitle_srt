Mr. Richard

5
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,920
needs to discuss

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,710
the specific details of the cooperation
with you.

7
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,000
You need to send someone out

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
to sign on behalf of Liangjiang.

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,700
I assure you

10
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,120
it'll be quick

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,050
and won't take up much of your time.

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,630
You little brat.

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,410
When you bite someone,
it goes straight to the bone, huh?

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,130
Gu Pingyuan.

15
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,310
Yes, Your Excellency.

16
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,680
Since things cannot be undone now,

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,510
I now grant you full authority

as well as financial and grain matters.

All the manpower and resources
of Liangjiang

are at your disposal,

What qualifications?

33
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,360
We've been accustomed to

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,770
dealing with the Qing Dynasty's officials,

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,570
the ones with peacock feathers
behind their hats.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,960
I'd like to ask

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,240
if Xianghe Trade House

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,360
is a government institution
of your country?

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,740
If not,

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
and if

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,750
what we are negotiating now

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,470
is purely a commercial matter,

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,080
then what right do they have

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,920
to demand that
our imperial court officials

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,100
attend?

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,240
Do you have the authority
to sign a contract

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,640
on behalf of Liangjiang?

48
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,790
Of course.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,050
I believe that before I arrived,

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,360
the official documents
from the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,680
had already been delivered to you.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,430
Alright.

53
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,030
Chinese people are not that trustworthy.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,079
He said Chinese people
are not trustworthy.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,360
But our country would never

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,440
go to war to protect opium.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,829
That's the difference
between our two countries.

all the salt fields and salt shops

And then?

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,510
He said he wants to acquire

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,750
all the shares of

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,830
our Lianghuai salt industry.

66
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,430
Is there a problem with that?

67
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,390
The salt industry has always been
a state monopoly under the imperial court.

68
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,580
In your country,

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,370
do they allow merchants

70
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,630

translate your country's commercial law.

According to your law,

for any industry that is

77
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
exclusively operated and sold
by the government,

78
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,800
the government naturally

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,690
holds a certain share.

80
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,870
If he has any disagreement

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,920
on this point,

82
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,950
we can resolve it

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,550
through official channels.

84
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,390
Isn't that ironic?

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,620
He said

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,680
isn't that ironic,
talking about commercial laws

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,160
Then let's take this to their country.

89
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,360
I believe if we pursue this lawsuit,

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,090
spending 4 or 5 years on it

91
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,420
shouldn't be a problem.

92
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,240
It's just I'm afraid that by that time,

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
whether Mr. Richard

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
at Xianghe Trade House

96
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,490
is hard to say.

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,120
By that time, if Li Qin's account

98
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,360
cannot be settled for too long

99
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,620
and becomes a bad debt,

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,730
I'll feel concerned on his behalf.

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,790
He said

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,360
our Xianghe Trade House believes

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,070
that we have the right to claim

104
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,730
ownership of our collateral.

105
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,900
There's no dispute about that, right?

106
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,870
No.

107
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,800
But I want to remind him

108
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,510
from a merchant's perspective

109
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,310
that all business transactions

110
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,030
should be based on freedom

111
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,240
and voluntary participation.

112
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,070
If he enters

113
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,240
the Qing Dynasty's commercial market

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,600
with this attitude,

115
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,040
it would be a complete mistake.

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
The title deeds

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,520
he currently holds for those salt fields—

118
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,650
I can guarantee

119
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,680
that once he sees them, he'll realize

120
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,600
they're nothing

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,460
but flat rocks.

122
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,570
No one will be willing to work for him,

123
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,920
and the so-called deeds
to those salt shops

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,780
are nothing but empty buildings.

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,010
No one will be willing to
run a store for him,

126
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,770
and he'll

127
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,510
gain absolutely nothing.

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,950
Oh, I have many ways

129
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,040
to make my collateral profitable.

130
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,120
He said

131
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,659
they have many ways

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,310
to make

133
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,040
their collateral profitable.

134
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,040
They can sell it to other countries

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,560
or

136
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,820
sell it to our imperial court.

137
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,270
In short,

138
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,630
in this world,

139
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,120
we Chinese care too much about dignity.

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,700
They don't believe we can

141
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,240
achieve our business goals

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,120
through patience and delay.

143
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,750
If there's a cannon

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,150
pointing at my doorstep,

145
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,140
then whatever means I use

146
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,970
would be beyond reproach.

147
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,510
If a cannon faces our home,

148
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,510
I cannot be blamed

149
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,750
for anything I do.

150
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,030
Until the goal is achieved,

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
the cannons shall not be withdrawn.

152
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,460
Until the goal is achieved,

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
the cannons shall not be withdrawn.

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,159
But maybe

155
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,390
we can

156
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,360
continue our negotiations in one month.

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,950
He said perhaps we can come again

158
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,510
to continue our negotiations in one month.

159
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,640
Because he knows

160
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,620
the Emperor and Empress Dowager

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,690
have set you a deadline.

162
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Maybe in one month,

163
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,950
I shall be seeing

164
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,480
your head on the city wall.

165
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,159
Maybe in one month...

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
He'll see

167
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,380
your head on the city wall.

168
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,360
Li Qin,

169
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,720
how could you say such things?

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,430
He's right.

171
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,170
Perhaps we should both take a step back.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,390
If Li Qin wants to mortgage

173
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,430
all the title deeds of
the salt fields and shops

174
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,510
that he currently holds,

175
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,040
I believe you're also aware

176
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,880
that in principle, he's not qualified.

177
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,140
To gain complete control,

178
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,850
he has to wait a bit longer.

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,530
We

180
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,210
made a bet before,

181
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,909
about which one would be more profitable,

182
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,070
the Lianghuai Salt Industry Guild

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,120
or his Li family.

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
I remember that this bet

185
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,059
has less than a month left,

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,350
and its outcome

187
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,490
will determine the ownership
of the salt industry.

188
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,190
You're telling me

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,080
that you wanna compete

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,030
with an international trade company?

191
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,760
Are you sure?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,600

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,270
[Pine and Bamboo Contain Charm]

381
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,750
I thought you were

382
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,750
doing some big business in Nanjing.

383
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,690
Now that you're back, how come

384
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,550
you're eating like
a starving ghost reincarnated?

385
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't know why,

386
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,350
but as soon as I saw you guys,

387
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,480
I got really hungry.

388
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,240
I was too worried to eat

389
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,700
back in Jinling, you know?

390
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,990
You've eaten so many noodles—

391
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,030
so when do you plan to tell me

392
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,690
that Chang Yu'er's pregnant?

393
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,510
Right.

394
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,920
What do you mean "right"?

395
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
Are you planning to wait

396
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,640
until after the child is born

397
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,040
to thank the matchmaker?

398
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,200
Madam, I was wrong.

399
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,600
I even told Yu'er

400
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,720
that once the child is born,

401
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,310
we'll have him recognize you
as Godmother.

402
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,790
If it weren't for you

403
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,920
giving me those few hints,

404
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,480
who knows

405
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,960
how long I would have remained confused?

406
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,920
That's absolutely true.

407
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,940
Of course it is.

408
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off.

409
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,690
Come on, sit.

410
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,960
But

411
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,370
how did you find out?

412
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,030
We sent someone to deliver some medicine.

413
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,620
He doesn't know anything.

414
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,830
Since your mother passed away,

415
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,960
you've been having a hard time, right?

416
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,040
Alright.

417
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,000
Buddy,

418
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,160
let's get down to business.

419
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,820
What big deal have you brought?

420
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,550
You have no idea

421
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,720
how exhausted I've been
these past 10 days.

422
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,400
First,

423
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
I visited all the silk factories

424
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
in the Huzhou and Jinling area.

425
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,510
Then

426
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,350
I went to visit

427
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,030
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

428
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,360
After leaving here,

429
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,030
I still have to go to Hangzhou
to meet with Wu Caishen.

430
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,550
He's been in the silk business for years,

431
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,160
so he must have plenty in stock.

432
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,350
After that, I also need to
go to the capital

433
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,110
and pay a visit to
the Office of General Management.

434
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,750
Why?

435
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,550
Recently,

436
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,790
I've been studying
the "Elements of International Law."

437
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,270
It states that

438
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,080
trade is free in all countries.

439
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,010
Our country's exports

440
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,160
[Pine and Bamboo Contain Charm]

441
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,560
to India fall mainly into

442
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,750
4 categories:

443
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,880
tea, silk, medicine, and porcelain.

444
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,400
I don't know much about porcelain,

445
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,350
but I have some connections
for the other three.

446
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,200
I plan to follow my previous plan:

447
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,400
I want to bypass the East India Company.

448
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,310
You want to transport

449
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,270
the goods directly to India?

450
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,640
If possible,

451
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
I want to go even further.

452
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,680
All the way west across the Indian Ocean

453
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,440
to sell to the British

454
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,500
and Americans.

455
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,830
Since they can come to our country,

456
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,760
why can't we go to their countries?

457
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,350
Come on, let's have a drink.

458
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,810
That's a bit frightening.

459
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,280
I'll drink too.

460
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,150
I heard you have a 6-month bet

461
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,350
with Xianghe Trade House

462
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,310
over the salt field property rights.

463
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,270
How could you still have time

464
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,330
to deal with all these other matters?

465
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,070
Madam, do you think I can win?

466
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,950
You can't?

467
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,110
Given the current situation,

468
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,440
I definitely can't win.

469
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,880
If you want your business to grow,

470
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,960
the market has to be big.

471
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,720
Our market

472
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,680
is limited to 13 provinces,
7 in the south and 6 in the north.

473
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,880
Except for the 5 salt-producing regions,

474
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,830
in the remaining provinces,

475
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,700
the scale and profits of salt shops

476
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,160
are basically saturated.

477
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,240
So where does Xianghe Trade House's profit

478
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,630
come from?

479
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,350
From hand to hand, basically.

480
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,550
They sell directly to
the East India Company.

481
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,480
They want to get capital into
the salt industry,

482
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,830
and they're willing to spend more money
to do so.

483
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,920
As for who the East India Company

484
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,770
plans to sell to next—

485
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,830
only heaven knows.

486
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,950
But with their market scale,

487
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
this amount of salt

488
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,640
is still manageable for them.

489
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,270
Buddy.

490
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,030
You're trying to take on

491
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,030
the East India Company by yourself—

492
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,170
do you think that's possible?

493
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,720
You're trying to use one man's power

494
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
against a whole country.

495
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,780
Your ambition is admirable,

496
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,520
but it's simply impossible.

497
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,920
You know that when I went abroad before,

498
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,490
I also sold to local agents.

499
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,510
The profit was indeed a bit higher.

500
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,480
But since we still rely on
the foreigners' ships,

501
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,510
opportunities to go abroad
still aren't frequent.

502
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,480
If you want to establish

503
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,540
your own business foundation there,

504
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,250
even 10 or 20 years wouldn't be enough.

505
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,010
I don't have 10 or 20 years.

506
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,160
It can't be done.

507
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,090
It's just impossible.

508
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,300
Human capability has its limits.

509
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,670
Besides, in this era,

510
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,120
this kind of business

511
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,960
can no longer be considered
ordinary commerce—

512
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,690
it's more like a competition
between countries.

513
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,170
You're being too unrealistic.

514
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,370
The raw silk,

515
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,970
tea,

516
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,200
and other goods you bring in—

517
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,920
how much capital do you need to tie up?

518
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,240
The Qing Dynasty explicitly prohibits

519
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,160
merchants from

520
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,350
doing business abroad freely,

521
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,750
right?

522
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,770
You'd be breaking the imperial law.

523
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,030
And you even want to charter
British merchant ships.

524
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,360
Would customs approve?

525
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,250
Would the merchant ships agree?

526
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,170
As far as I know,

527
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,270
the merchant ships in Shanghai

528
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,670
are mostly owned by
the East India Company.

529
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,170
And one last thing.

530
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,680
Even if you overcome

531
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,790
all these difficulties

532
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,790
and get the goods transported to India,

533
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,590
let me ask you:

534
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,030
where will be your warehouse?

535
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,590
Where will be your headquarters?

536
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,590
Where will be your branch stores?

537
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,480
Who will be the manager
and who will be the staff?

538
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,140
You'll be completely in the dark.

539
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,040
Who will you sell to, buddy?

540
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,080
Also, tea and silk

541
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,510
are both perishable.

542
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,640
At most, you'd have

543
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,320
only 2 or 3 months to sell them.

544
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,370
Tea ages, and silk deteriorates.

545
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,480
One small mistake

546
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,210
and you could lose everything.

547
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Madam.

548
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,070
You don't understand.

549
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,830
Of course I understand.

550
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,290
Well...

551
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,240
His plan is to send a warning shot,

552
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,480
forcing the East India Company

553
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,830
to return the salt field ownership

554
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,350
they took.

555
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,160
But the question is,

556
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
can you really achieve that
by following the same method?

557
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,870
This place

558
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,440
doesn't look like a merchant's residence.

559
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,270
Before my father became a businessman,

560
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,610
he used to be a scholar.

561
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,200
So why didn't he become an official?

562
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,070
Don't all Chinese people

563
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,070
want to take the imperial exams
and become officials?

564
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,110
It was because he felt that

565
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,510
holding an official position was useless.

566
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,810
Because the once-proud Qing Dynasty

567
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,380
had already come to an end.

568
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,750
Young Master,

569
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,550
they're here.

570
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,080
My respects, Your Excellency.

571
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,350
Li Qin.

572
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm here on imperial order to
raid your house.

573
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,030
Are you aware of that?

574
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,310
Please elaborate, Your Excellency.

575
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,510
You mortgaged the salt field title deeds

576
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,160
to Xianghe Trade House,

577
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,880
severely damaging Liangjiang's economy.

578
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,520
I went to the capital
to offer a humble apology,

579
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,950
but the Empress Dowager was furious.

580
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,830
In my opinion,
although you and your father

581
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,960
both bought your official positions,

582
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,960
you're after all
subjects of the Qing Dynasty.

583
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,640
If you repent now,

584
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,330
we can still negotiate.

585
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,590
Otherwise,

586
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,200
don't blame me for being ruthless.

587
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,880
You've wanted to raid my house

588
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
for a long time, haven't you?

589
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,590
Ever since my father died,

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,930
countless people have been eyeing

591
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
our Li family's fortune.

592
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,790
According to
the "Great Qing Legal Code,"

593
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,960
I'm also going to have you arrested.

594
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,510
Stand up.

595
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,510
Mr. Li Qin

596
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,830
is now

597
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,110
a partner of Xianghe Trade House.

598
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,350
You have no authority to arrest him.

599
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,200
This

600
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,510
is the identity certificate

601
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,480
our envoy issued for him.

602
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,510
Li Qin.

603
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,010
Are you even abandoning
your ancestors now?

604
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,530
I have no ancestors.

605
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,520
Nonsense!

606
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,640
Did you spring from a rock?

607
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,110
What do you mean you have no ancestors?

608
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,040
Utter nonsense!

609
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Do you expect me to acknowledge

610
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,490
those people surnamed Gu as my ancestors?

611
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,400
I don't even know if my father's surname

612
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
was Li or Gu.

613
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,270
No one ever told me

614
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,600
where they were buried,

615
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,330
and I have no idea who they actually were.

616
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,590
After my father died,

617
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,440
I suddenly realized that in this world,

618
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,070
I'm actually completely alone.

619
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,790
So save your breath.

620
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,350
Are you sure

621
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,300
you don't want to reconsider?

622
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,880
You've said everything you needed to say.

623
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,510
Let's go.

624
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,730
Confiscate everything!

625
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,590
What a fine and virtuous person
you once were—

626
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,310
how did you end up a traitor?

627
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,250
Such a wonderful home,

628
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,550
gone like that.

629
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,750
My home was long gone—

630
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,920
back when my father

631
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,550
lied to me.

632
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
For the rest of my life...

633
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,400
For the rest of my life,

634
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,130
I want to be a different person.

635
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,350
Li,

636
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
come and join the East India Company.

637
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,960
In 6 months,

638
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,560
you'll be able to control

639
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,350
the Qing Dynasty's
most important industry.

640
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
You can buy a even better house then.

641
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,780
Can you really win?

642
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,720
That buddy of mine

643
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,700
is extremely cunning.

644
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,240
It's useless to be cunning.

645
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,000
In business, we don't rely on
cunning—

646
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,570
we rely on strength,

647
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,400
and on cannons.

648
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
Could your buddy

649
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,720
be even more powerful than

650
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,050
the East India Company?

651
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,900
[Hangzhou]

652
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,920
Mr. Gu!

653
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,510
Here.

654
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,750
I've been hearing so much about you lately

655
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,950
that my ears are nearly deaf from it all.

656
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,790
Well, we businessmen

657
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,200
pray to the God of Wealth every day.

658
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,270
If that caused deafness,
I'd be deaf long ago.

659
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,130
Come on, let me show you the goods.

660
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,900
Please come in, Mr. Gu.

661
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Open it.

662
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,030
Let's take a look at the goods first.

663
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,410
This is simply...

664
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
What do you think?

665
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,790
I've always considered myself

666
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,920
someone who has seen fine embroidery.

667
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,510
But after seeing your goods, I realized

668
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,510
everything I'd seen before

669
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,510
was just garbage.

670
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,520
The embroidery from Huizhou

671
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,320
is certainly quite good.

672
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,200
However,

673
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,640
compared to the embroidery
from Hangzhou and Suzhou,

674
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,440
it definitely

675
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,440
can't match up.

676
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,740
Also, check out our embroiderers.

677
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,360
They've all served in the imperial palace.

678
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,030
Since childhood,

679
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,080
apart from using chopsticks,

680
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,880
they've never done any other manual work

681
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
with their hands.

682
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,960
Why is that?

683
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,110
You see, these hands of ours,

684
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,930
if they do even a bit of rough work,

685
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,570
they lose their smoothness and softness.

686
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,690
Our embroiderers here

687
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,310
have learned embroidery since childhood

688
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,270
and have been waited on hand and foot.

689
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,470
To be honest with you,

690
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,840
they use the finest wax
to take care of their hands every day.

691
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,250
Only this way can they work on silk

692
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,960
with thousands upon thousands of stitches

693
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,470
without leaving any trace

694
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,470
or causing

695
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,350
any pilling on the silk surface.

696
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,270
These are all

697
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,800
big secrets of our silk industry.

698
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,550
I'm only telling you this

699
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,750
because you aren't in this line of work.

700
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,630
God of Wealth,

701
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,880
you've truly mastered

702
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,010
the art of business.

703
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,840
Unlike me,

704
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,880
biting off more than I can chew.

705
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,280
Come on, sit.

706
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
You may leave now.

707
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,310
I heard

708
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,770
something big happened in Jiangning,

709
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,360
that you've gotten into a conflict
with Xianghe Trade House?

710
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,920
I heard that you, God of Wealth,

711
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,120
have business dealings
with Xianghe Trade House, right?

712
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,530
In the silk business,

713
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,720
Xianghe Trade House

714
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,880
is indeed my

715
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,200
biggest competitor.

716
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,210
That Richard is a cunning old fox.

717
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,110
You may not be able to outwit him.

718
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,310
Even if I can't, I still have to fight.

719
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,640
Those foreigners are trying

720
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,200
to monopolize the entire salt industry
of Lianghuai.

721
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
God of Wealth,

722
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,410
no matter what,

723
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,080
you must lend me a hand.

724
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Our two families
have been competing for decades.

725
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,020
Tell me,

726
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,920
what good strategy do you have in mind?

727
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,160
If it's truly workable,

728
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,690
I'd certainly be happy to
enjoy the benefits.

729
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,710
I want to know

730
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,400
if the Xianghe Trade House

731
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,830
is the East India Company's

732
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,510
only institution

733
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,240
stationed in our Qing Dynasty?

734
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,110
Of course not.

735
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,240
So is the East India Company

736
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
the only

737
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,570
British commercial company in India?

738
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,480
No, this East India Company

739
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,720
is just one of them.

740
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,590
But in terms of scale,

741
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,470
it is indeed the largest.

742
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,030
I don't need the scale to be very large.

743
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,290
Actually, this method

744
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,790
is something I learned from
the "Strategies of the Warring States."

745
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,080
It can help you, Mr. Wu,

746
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,760
sweep away your competitor.

747
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,880
What do you mean by that?

748
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,290
I need the finest goods

749
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,610
you have in your stock.

750
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,920
That's easy.

751
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
Just tell me what you want

752
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,000
and where you want it shipped.

753
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,060
I'll hire a ship to deliver it for you.

754
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
We can't use ordinary ships.

755
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
I want to contact a British company

756
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,750
and use the foreigners' ships

757
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,790
to transport the goods to India,

758
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,390
or even directly to Britain.

759
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,550
I also need you

760
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,010
to come with me to Shanghai

761
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,920
to meet Mr. Hart from the Customs Office.

762
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,790
I plan to set sail westward

763
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,590
and use
the "Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao" strategy.

764
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm afraid I won't be able to
rent such ships.

765
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,590
Someone else will help me rent them.

766
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:48,960
I know

767
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
you're on good terms with Mr. Hart,

768
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,240
so I must

769
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,510
take you with me.

770
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,590
Buddy.

771
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Do you really mean

772
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,030
your words?

773
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,380
I've made a solemn pledge.

774
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,800
This is no joking matter.

775
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,510
[Hart's Residence, Shanghai]

776
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,190
I expected you'd come,

777
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,920
but I didn't expect it to be this late.

778
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,520
Is that so?

779
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,110
I wasn't referring to you.

780
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,639
I didn't expect you to come.

781
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,969
But it was only right

782
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,840
that he came.

783
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm taking the blame for someone else.

784
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,659
I had to come.

785
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,420
This mess has gotten serious.

786
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,840
I've received an imperial edict
these past days.

787
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,150
The Empress Dowager

788
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,550
has strictly ordered
the Viceroy of Liangjiang

789
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,110
to reclaim the salt fields.

790
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,550
What on earth is going on with you guys?

791
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,810
You've provoked the East India Company?

792
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,889
I'll put in a good word for you.

793
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,610
Business like this

794
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,550
can't be done

795
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,010
through personal favors.

796
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,949
If I were the East India Company,

797
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,210
it wouldn't matter who came begging.

798
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,400
Did you receive the information,

799
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,480
or did you figure this out on your own?

800
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,440
Sir, you've already
gone to negotiate with them, haven't you?

801
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,710
As soon as I received the edict,

802
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,630
I went to negotiate,

803
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,690
but it didn't work.

804
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,510
Apart from opium,

805
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,350
it seems that the Chinese market

806
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,110
isn't welcoming to British goods.

807
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,070
Your Excellency.

808
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,150
Greetings, Your Excellency.

809
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,750
Come sit here and let's talk.

810
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,680
Let me ask you:

811
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,590
how many salt shops

812
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,760
does your

813
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,510
Salt Industry Guild currently control?

814
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,480
In response to your question,
Your Excellency,

815
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,630
including the newly opened

816
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,040
117 shops,

817
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,550
there's a total of 305.

818
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,650
With these 305 shops,

819
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,670
not counting

820
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,360
the money you've invested in
newly opened shops,

821
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
at your most profitable time,

822
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,490
could you make 10 million taels a year?

823
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,990
Not that much, I suppose.

824
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,600
By my estimate, it's only about

825
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,640
9 million taels,

826
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,460
with little fluctuation.

827
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,230
The point is this is just gross profit.

828
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,550
It's...

829
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,880
That's not right.

830
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,030
What's not right?

831
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,690
Your boss Mr. Gu

832
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,150
has been making big moves recently.

833
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,680
Didn't you know about that?

834
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,490
Are you referring to

835
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,590
Mr. Gu going to Anhui to collect tea?

836
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,680
It's far more than just tea collection.

837
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,360
Silk, medicine—

838
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,960
he's dealing in everything now.

839
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Besides,

840
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,190
he's now openly saying

841
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,720
he's going to ship a batch of goods
to Britain.

842
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,320
I want to contact a British company

843
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,440
that competes with

844
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,000
the East India Company

845
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,280
and partner with them

846
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
in tea, silk, medicine

847
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,880
and other businesses.

848
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,230
I'll have this British company

849
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,190
handle my sales,

850
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,760
and I'll be the supplier
allocating the goods.

851
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,620
I can guarantee

852
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,420
that all goods from my side

853
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,150
are of the highest quality,

854
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,150
and I can guarantee to
procure it at the lowest price.

855
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,800
If we can

856
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
carve out a market of our own

857
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
within every commercial sector

858
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,090
the East India Company covers,

859
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,110
we can force them

860
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,440
to come and negotiate with us.

861
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400
With a monster like this—

862
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,530
a commercial giant—

863
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,760
gentle persuasion is useless.

864
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,000
You have to make them scared,

865
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
make them feel threatened.

866
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,090
I've made a rough calculation.

867
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,320
The cost of this shipment of goods

868
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,250
is equivalent to

869
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,400
what your Salt Industry Guild

870
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,480
makes in 3 years.

871
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Where is he getting that money from?

872
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,520
You're producing salt,

873
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,550
not mining gold.

874
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Your Excellency.

875
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,440
I've also

876
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,170
caught some rumors out there.

877
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,320
Some friends of his

878
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,940
gave him the goods

879
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,850
but didn't collect the money—

880
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,190
said they'd settle it
after the goods are sold...

881
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,920
If this batch of goods
were to be transported

882
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,480
from Shanxi to Shandong,

883
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,290
I could understand delaying the payment.

884
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,320
With Mr. Gu reputation,

885
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,800
it wouldn't be a problem.

886
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,300
But this is going overseas
across the ocean.

887
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,710
This is a completely different matter.

888
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I have something to instruct you on.

889
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,150
Your Excellency,

890
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,230
please give your instructions.

891
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,160
I did ask him to compete with Li Qin,

892
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,840
but I never expected

893
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,320
he would go this far.

894
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,590
Our Qing Dynasty has its
official factories

895
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,280
and the Office of General Management.

896
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,590
Who does he think he is,

897
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,970
selling goods abroad?

898
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,200
If we let him set this precedent,

899
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,840
will the laws of the Qing Dynasty

900
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,320
have to be rewritten?

901
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,710
You're all experienced and mature.

902
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,830
Don't follow his reckless path.

903
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,480
Keep the Salt Industry Guild

904
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,610
in good order for me.

905
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,750
Do you know

906
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,920
why the East India Company

907
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,030
has become

908
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,800
so powerful?

909
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,030
Look down there.

910
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,550
All the merchant ships on this river

911
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,410
belong to them.

912
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,590
May I ask how you plan

913
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,190
to transport your goods to India,

914
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,360
or even to Britain?

915
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,460
I'll use warships.

916
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,230
British warships?

917
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,760
I have my way.

918
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,400
My transportation costs

919
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
will be lower than all of theirs.

920
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,800
Then let me ask you another question.

921
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
The East India Company
has been doing business

922
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,190
with the Qing Dynasty for years.

923
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,360
I believe the goods they acquire

924
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,630
come at

925
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,510
extremely low prices.

926
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,510
So what advantage do you have
against them?

927
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,020
I have contact with

928
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,670
all the tea merchants in Anhui,

929
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,480
the finest silk

930
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,510
and raw silk in the Liangjiang region,

931
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,230
and medicinal herbs from Shanxi,

932
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,360
things like rhubarb and goji berries.

933
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,710
I can procure all of these goods

934
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,110
at the lowest prices,

935
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,730
ensuring ample profit.

936
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,110
The lowest prices?

937
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,800
Can you really guarantee that?

938
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,120
Merchants do seek profit, that's true.

939
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,150
But this time,

940
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,880
I don't want any profit,

941
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,440
nor do my friends.

942
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,280
Though our Qing Dynasty is weak,

943
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,400
we must never let others

944
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,730
control our lifelines.

945
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
It simply means that this year,

946
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,590
our silk business in Jiangnan

947
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,800
will operate without profit.

948
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,110
I can guarantee this.

949
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,100
What about the others?

950
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,630
Do the tea and medicine merchants

951
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,960
also think the same way?

952
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,110
Mr. Hart.

953
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,920
Don't underestimate us

954
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,670
unarmed merchants.

955
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,700
In the way of commerce,

956
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,510
petty schemes serve oneself,

957
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,420
but great strategies serve the nation.

958
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,880
Even in business battles,

959
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,040
one can still serve their country.

960
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,760
What does this mean?

961
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,370
Are these merchants really going to

962
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,110
join forces

963
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,740
t-to defeat that guy?

964
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,070
Whether they'll defeat him or not

965
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,200
is still uncertain.

966
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,090
But at the very least,
we must let them know

967
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,570
that we Chinese merchants

968
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,230
can make money

969
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,540
even without using gunboats.

970
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,070
Thank goodness we got out.

971
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,670
It felt like hell

972
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,840
in there.

973
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Those foreigners

974
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,000
aren't used to our opera.

975
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
All that clang clang clang—

976
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,370
they think the gongs are too noisy.

977
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,350
Let me ask you.

978
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,280
Are you doing this out of spite,

979
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,370
or are you serious?

980
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,880
What do you mean by that?

981
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,920
If you're just doing this out of spite,

982
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,360
we can work together

983
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,320
to scare this East India Company

984
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,120
into retreating, and that's it.

985
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,630
People travel far for profit.

986
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,840
No one truly wants to make enemies.

987
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,250
But if you're serious,

988
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,160
then it's dangerous.

989
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,360
This is something that's never happened

990
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,590
in 3,000 years.

991
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,150
What if I tell you

992
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
that I am serious?

993
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,110
Stop joking.

994
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,320
You're not actually
planning to do this, are you?

995
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,230
This is the Qing Dynasty,

996
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,190
not England.

997
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,320
If you really get a ship

998
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,360
and transport the goods overseas,

999
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,710
where does that leave the imperial court?

1000
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,480
The "Great Qing Legal Code"

1001
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,940
has no provision for this.

1002
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,710
Mr. Wu.

1003
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,000
I have something I want to say,

1004
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,530
but I'm not sure if I should.

1005
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,590
Go on.

1006
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,590
I'm all ears.

1007
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,840
I think the problem is that our country

1008
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,500
has had emperors for too long.

1009
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,540
Don't talk nonsense.

1010
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,040
This kind of talk

1011
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,160
could cost you your head.

1012
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,390
Look at the ships on the river.

1013
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,070
These foreigners

1014
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,230
brought cannons and gunpowder here

1015
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,650
to protect their country's business

1016
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,190
and mobilized their entire national army

1017
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,790
to protect their merchants,

1018
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,190
determined to sell their goods

1019
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,400
to our country

1020
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,150
and seize our domestic market.

1021
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,920
I believe that
when these merchants come in,

1022
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,380
the influence behind them

1023
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,710
far surpasses

1024
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,840
the power of an army.

1025
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,290
In the way of commerce,

1026
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
great strategies serve the nation.

1027
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,060
We have to find a way
to compete with them.

1028
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,400
It would be best to go to their countries

1029
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,480
and do business there.

1030
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,740
Let people make full use of
their abilities,

1031
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,590
and let goods flow to
where they're needed.

1032
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,050
Perhaps only by doing this

1033
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,320
can we find

1034
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,110
a way out.
