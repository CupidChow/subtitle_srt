189
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
so of course he had to send me here
to keep an eye on it.

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,040
I believe you.

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,570
Do you want to see it?

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,720
No need.

193
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,080
When you make the transaction,

194
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,280
I'll take a look then.

195
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,630
I'm just curious.

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,260
Why are you willing

197
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,010
to risk your life this time?

198
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
My life is pretty much over.

199
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,450
But I can't let my son

200
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,330
spend his whole life in exile.

201
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,840
I've found a way

202
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,330
to help him escape,

203
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,010
then he can change his name

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
and find a place to study.

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
He's already 9 years old now.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,150
He brandishes weapons with me every day,

207
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,350
insisting on going up the mountain
with me to dig ginseng.

208
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,840
It's my fault.

209
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,360
If you can

210
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,090
really get your son out of here,

211
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,060
this deal will be worth it.

212
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,270
Is the channel reliable?

213
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,930
It's solid.

214
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,880
Once that thing is sold,

215
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,560
I won't owe Commander Xu

216
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,790
a single cent.

217
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
The rest will be split
between me and Si.

218
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
What price do you want to sell it for?

219
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
At least

220
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,910
100,000.

221
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,300
That's too low.

222
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,360
Mr. Gu,

223
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,250
you're here.

224
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,160
Si.

225
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Had a few drinks. Sorry I'm late.

226
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
I was just

227
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,950
discussing with Su.

228
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,200
This thing,

229
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,870
what price do you plan to sell it for?

230
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,070
We can sell it for 80,000,

231
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,440
or 100,000.

232
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,040
Even 800,000 will do.

233
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,360
Four young men from our settlement
have died.

234
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Their parents

235
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
[Exile Liu Si]

236
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,700
are all demanding compensation from us.

237
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,080
Alright,

238
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll go talk to them.

239
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,280
Thank you for your trouble.

240
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,800
Everyone,

241
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,390
-I'm Gu Pingyuan. My respects.
-Mr. Gu.

242
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,890
Mr. Gu.

243
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,650
We have both

244
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,870
old acquaintances
and new friends here today.

245
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,390
Although it's said that
the roads of the world are open to all,

246
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,490
there's an unshakable law

247
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,620
of the Qing Dynasty:

248
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,600
Han people are not allowed
to enter the borders for even a step.

249
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,860
We're all in a business

250
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,960
that could cost us our heads.

251
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm here only to make sure

252
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,840
everyone can

253
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,150
get their deal done

254
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,560
and to keep anyone from

255
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,760
being picked apart by the authorities.

256
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,910
Please, go ahead.

257
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,770
Where's Liu Si?

258
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,150
He went home to check on his son.

259
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,080
He said that with you handling things,
Mr. Gu,

260
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,010
he can rest easy.

261
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,760
He really trusts me, huh?

262
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,120
Everyone,

263
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,480
let's start the open bidding.

264
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,880
The highest bidder wins.

265
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,220
10,000, calling once.

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,390
50,000.

267
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,510
80,000.

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,390
100,000.

269
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,690
190,000 taels.

270
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,200
We haven't even seen the item yet,

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,390
and the bidding has already gone
this high.

272
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,270
220,000.

273
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,750
250,000.

274
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,550
270,000.

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Who was it?

276
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,040
Who called 270,000?

277
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,600
280,000.

278
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,070
290,000.

279
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,590
300,000.

280
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,080
Hey,

281
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,240
your butler hasn't even returned yet.

282
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,770
Do you even have that money?

283
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,940
There's money on the ship.

284
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,610
There's money on the ship?

285
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,550
Kid.

286
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,960
Today, I, Old Man,

287
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,270
will teach you a lesson.

288
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,270
Your father sent you out

289
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,360
to gain experience,

290
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,030
not to

291
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
come here and cause trouble.

292
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,240
-Stop it.
-Stop fooling around.

293
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,750
If your Li family

294
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,080
were serious about doing business,

295
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,360
your father wouldn't have sent you here.

296
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,560
Stop fooling around.

297
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,610
Listen to that.

298
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Stop messing around.

299
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,940
What nonsense.

300
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,610
Alright.

301
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,580
It's yours then.

302
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
Thanks then.

303
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,470
These are notes from the Four Major Banks.

304
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,750
Please verify them.

305
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,870
Looks solid to me.

306
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,750
You check.

307
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,590
This ginseng doll

308
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,790
is now yours.

309
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,270
Thank you.

310
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,330
Bring out that treasure

311
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,940
and let us have a look too.

312
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,550
Show us.

313
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,820
I want to see it.

314
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
Let us have a look.

315
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,510
Where's the item?

316
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,640
There's no ginseng.

317
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
There's nothing in there.

318
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,970
Where is it?

319
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,530
-It's empty.
-What's going on?

320
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,190
It's empty.

321
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,580
There's nothing in it.

322
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Where's the item?

323
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,870
Exactly.

324
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,330
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

325
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,850
How did this happen?

326
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,710
Isn't this a scam?

327
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,270
Exactly.

328
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,870
You, Su!

329
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,470
Where's that thing I bought?

330
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,150
Is it on you?

331
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,150
Right, right.

332
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,880
-Open up your coat.
-Open it up.

333
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Open up your coat and show us.

334
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,600
I've walked on the edge of the blade

335
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,000
for my entire life,

336
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,150
and I've never uttered a single lie.

337
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,360
Su.

338
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,000
Are you sure that when Si left,

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,860
that ginseng was still in the box?

340
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,120
I never saw him

341
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,670
take it out of the box.

342
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,890
It must be there.

343
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
How could it just disappear?

344
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,560
I really should have checked the almanac
before going out today.

345
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,580
You, Su.

346
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,500
I, Old Man,

347
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
have been in this business
for so many years,

348
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,750
and I've never seen anyone as

349
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,750
dishonest as you!

350
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,120
All that nonsense about the ginseng doll

351
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,910
and the Mountain God—

352
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,750
you guys are just making things up

353
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,150
and openly deceiving me!

354
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,530
I didn't take it.

355
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,940
If I were to believe you,

356
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,870
once I leave this place,

357
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,270
would you still admit it?

358
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
My entire family would end up

359
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,370
having to jump in the river, right?

360
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,140
You liars! So despicable!

361
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,610
They are all cheats!

362
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,990
Ningguta has always been a den of bandits!

363
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,270
Let's go! Come on.

364
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,030
Let's go!

365
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,960
I didn't take it!

366
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,330
Stop! Nobody leave!

367
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,750
Everyone,

368
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I've never told a single lie.

369
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,390
This afternoon I saw with my own eyes

370
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,990
that the item was in this box.

371
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,470
I can't really explain what's going on.

372
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,630
Mr. Gu.

373
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,640
Please vouch for me.

374
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,080

To prove his innocence,

397
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,510
this is too extreme.

Even if he had been ranked up

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,680
in Ningguta, he was nothing
but a notorious criminal.

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,940
Liu Si was behind this.

However,

that Liu Si never opened the box.

all this truth and falsehood,

for the time being, either.

748
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,070
Su, throughout his life,

749
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,130
was the most loyal.

750
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,370
He cared for his men.

751
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,550
If he knew from the afterlife

752
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,590
and saw how you're acting now,

753
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,050
acting purely on emotion,

754
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,410
do you think he would rest in peace?

755
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,690
How about this?

756
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,150
You set some conditions.

757
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,920
If there's anything
I can help you achieve,

758
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,070
I'll definitely do it.

759
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,800
Is that okay?

760
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,690
You're determined to meddle in this,
aren't you?

761
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,320
Yes, I am.

762
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,110
Since we're all in Ningguta,

763
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,010
we're all unfortunate souls.

764
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,200
Please, take a step back.

765
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,860
You must promise me one thing,

766
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,350
and I'll leave immediately.

767
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,550
As for Liu Si,

768
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,110
I'll get his body ready for burial

769
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,710
and return it respectfully.

770
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,640
Go ahead.

771
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,150
On the day you leave,

772
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,280
I'll entrust my son's future

773
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,500
to you.

774
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,440
You can't let him

775
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,830
stay here for the rest of his life.

776
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,350
Take him out of here with you.

777
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,350
You can have him do anything for you.

778
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,700
Anything, really.

779
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,800
Alright.

780
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,810
Then make an oath

781
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,360
to put my mind at ease.

782
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,370
I, Gu Pingyuan, swear

783
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,790
that if I ever return to
the Central Plains in this lifetime,

784
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,110
I will definitely take this child with me.

785
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,040
Any food I have will go to him first.

786
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,830
Any clothes I have

787
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,150
will be for him to wear first.

788
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,350
I promise I'll

789
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
raise him well to adulthood.

790
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,400
If I break this oath,

791
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,360
may I be struck by lightning

792
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,510
and die young.

793
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,150
Darling!

794
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,630
How could you just die like that?

795
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,760
You didn't even think about me
and our child!

796
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,139
Who gave you permission to get up?

797
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,690
Do you know what mistake you've made?

798
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,840
I don't.

799
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,400
You just

800
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,750
took my seal like that

801
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,920
and used it casually like a toy.

802
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,710
How do you expect me,

803
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,230
the garrison general,

804
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,430
to sleep at night?

805
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,340
I wish to help ease your worries, Sir.

806
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,590
The dead can't be brought back,

807
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,010
but what about that ginseng doll?

808
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,560
Did you bring it back for me?

809
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,760
What?

810
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,510
In broad daylight,

811
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,790
do you think you're that blessed

812
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,920
to get to keep such a precious thing?

813
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,780
I certainly aren't that blessed.

814
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,170
But that doll,

815
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,540
I really don't have it.

816
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,590
I heard from the elders that

817
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,990
it's a spiritual object.

818
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,740
Only the virtuous can possess it.

819
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,390
To sell it,

820
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,250
Liu Si and Su Shuhe

821
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,960
removed the red string tied to it

822
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,150
and the needles on it.

823
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,590
It then turned into a spirit

824
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,360
and ran away.

825
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,070
Sir!

826
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,760
Do you even believe it yourself?

827
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,220
Please spare my life, Sir!

828
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,200
I don't know.

829
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,230
Even if you cut off my head,

830
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,490
I still wouldn't know.

831
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,630
Please, Sir!

832
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,400
Give me some more time

833
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,800
to investigate thoroughly. I really will.

834
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,710
Do you know who you are?

835
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,510
I'm not human.

836
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,260
I'm a ghost.

837
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,330
You're the Mountain God, Sir.

838
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,160
And I'm your servant ghost.

839
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,890
I'm starving.

840
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,110
Go find me food.

841
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,710
Get lost.

842
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,960
Put the carts against the wall

843
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,880
after unloading the goods!

844
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,150
Feed the mules in the back!

845
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,590
Got it!

846
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,670
Stack the boxes according to
the "Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow" code.

847
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,670
Don't mix them up!

848
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Got it!

849
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,880
Stack them properly.

850
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
Check them up.

851
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,760
You've never learned
how to heat a brick bed.

852
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
Why do you have to try?

853
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,630
Which of you is Mr. Chang?

854
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,190
I am.

855
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,190
May I have your name, Sir?

856
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,360
I am Gu Pingyuan.

857
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,730
I work for Commander Xu.

858
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,060
I came here for a visit.

859
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,040
Alright.

860
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,630
This way, please.

861
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,960
Miss.

862
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,630
The brick bed and the brick stove
are connected.

863
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,510
When you're cooking on the stove,

864
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,550
the room will be warmed up as well.

865
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,550
Careful, the smoke could choke you.

866
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,820
Come on in, please.

867
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,080
Have some tea.

868
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,800
What kind of business

869
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,760
do you do, Mr. Chang?

870
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,840
The New Year is approaching,

871
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,800
yet you went on this trip
with so many people.

872
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,480
I make a living by running the horse gang,
so it's a four-season business.

873
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
My wife died early.

874
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,280
I had to raise my daughter
while operating the caravans.

875
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,080
As I got older,

876
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,190
I bought a house and some land.

877
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,320
I didn't expect that

878
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
since I traveled around my whole life,

879
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,070
I never learned how to manage farms,

880
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,110
and there was a famine.

881
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,630
So I gathered my old employees

882
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,690
to come beyond the pass
to transport some sea salt back.

883
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,550
My creditors are stressing me,
and I think we can make it back

884
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,810
before the New Year
if we push up the pace.

885
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,360
When you're away from home,

886
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,890
you have to rely on friends.

887
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,960
Mr. Gu,

888
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,320
any advice or guidance you can give me,

889
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,120
I'd be deeply grateful for.

890
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,840
You're an experienced businessman,
Mr. Chang.

891
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,320
I can hardly offer you
any guidance or advice,

892
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,880
and I'm not worthy of being called "Sir."

893
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm just an exile.

894
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,440
Knowing that I'm literate
and good at accounting,

895
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
Commander Xu asked me

896
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,600
to help receive the travelling merchants
for him.

897
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,480
Mr. Chang, do you know

898
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,130
what place this is?

899
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,440
Ningguta.

900
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,510
That's right.

901
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,550
The exiles

902
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,070
are sent all the way here,

903
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,400
and only by sheer luck could they survive.

904
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,480
On the way here,

905
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
did you see the settlements outside?

906
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,880
They're all military settlements.

907
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,510
That's where they are assigned.

908
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,730
The strong ones

909
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,440
go hunting in the mountains,

910
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,190
hunting wolves,

911
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,880
tigers,

912
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
and bears.

913
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,710
Whether they live or die doesn't matter.

914
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,590
What matters is that
the wild animals stay alive,

915
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,520
to be put in cages

916
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,410
and taken to Mulan Hunting Ground

917
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,370
for the Emperor

918
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,440
and princes to hunt.

919
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,980
Others dig for ginseng.

920
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,630
They forage in the mountains
all year round.

921
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,920
With the slightest carelessness,

922
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,670
they become

923
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,630
food for wild beasts.

924
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,320
This is truly no place for humans.

925
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
But here in Ningguta,

926
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,400
there are people even more cruel than God.

927
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,320
You've got to

928
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,290
show some respect.

929
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,050
Thanks a lot, Mr. Gu.

930
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,610
Miss, did you ask for me?

931
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,740
Drop the pleasantries.

932
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,500
