[Episode 37]

3
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,950
I thought to myself back then

4
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,390
even if it meant falling into hell
and never getting out,

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,640
I couldn't stay poor.

6
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,680
Father!

7
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
You told me...

8
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,910
your mother has forgiven me.

9
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,660
What about you?

10
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,079
I pity you.

11
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,000
Father.

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,960
Father.

13
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,280
Father.

14
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
If you don't want to stay here,

15
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,390
you can go down the mountain too.

Let's go down the mountain together.

18
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,920
You don't need to care about these things.

19
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,590
Father.

20
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,000
Look.

21
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,680
You and I—

22
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,190
aren't we doing just fine?

23
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,630
That bastard Gu

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,720
and that crazy woman—

25
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,420
we don't even know them.

26
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,630
He's just

27
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,490
an exile from Ningguta,

28
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,150
a dirt‑poor tea farmer.

29
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,480
But you're Li Million.

32
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,159
You're the wealthiest man

33
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,659
in the capital's business world,

34
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,060
a businessman with a red official's hat

35
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,120
who is trusted by the imperial court.

Father.

37
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,950
Forget all of this.

38
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
Just be my father, and mine alone.

39
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,390
Alright, Father?

40
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,450
Let's go down the mountain.

41
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
A mistake this big
is too much to make even once,

42
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
let alone twice.

43
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,310
Now do you see

44
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,000
why I didn't let you

45
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,630
associate with that Gu?

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Child,

47
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,070
you truly are clever,

48
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,600
but far too competitive.

49
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,780
The family wealth I'm leaving you

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,200
is enough for you
to live a lifetime in comfort.

51
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,890
Don't go into business.

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Go back to the capital

53
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,690
and do whatever you want except that.

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Father...

55
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,160
You want me to go back alone?

56

I don't have the strength

57
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,800

63
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,480

in the imperial examination back then

69
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
was you.

70

I knew you came to the capital.

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,930
I was afraid
if you really passed the exam,

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
the show couldn't go on.

73
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,270
You just think I can't

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,260
You underestimate me.

76
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830
Let me make a bet with you.

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll compete with him fairly

78

in business.

How dare I do business with you?

88
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,510
You must be joking.

89
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,820
Am I joking with you,

90
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,910
or are you joking with me?

91
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,240
I heard your father

92
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,480
became a monk
and is now living in seclusion.

93

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
However much your family

96
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
spent on the salt fields,

was also opened at your request.

103
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
The Li family invested so much money

104
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,550
in Liangjiang region.

105
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,120
Do you expect us

106
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,280
to just obediently go back
because you say so?

107
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,480
The Li family's business

108
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,240
doesn't belong solely to us.

109
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,440
If you want to get your hands on it,

110
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,770
you should first ask the others involved.

111

Stop trying to intimidate me
with big names.

112
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,080
Indeed.

I know your Li family

114
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,600
has the Sixth Prince's capital behind it.

115
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
But when it comes to the livelihood
of Liangjiang region

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,390
and the imperial court's tax revenue,

117
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,120
even if His Highness were here,

118
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,910
I doubt he could protect you.

119
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
Let me remind you of something:

120
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,300
the one I invited was your father,

121
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,510
not you, a little nobody.

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,820
Everyone abandons a sinking ship.

123
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,020
Without your father,

124
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,320
do you think
the Sixth Prince will still shield you?

125
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
As for the business in Liangjiang,

126
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,030
it has nothing to do with your Li family.

127
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,080
Since your father has retired,

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,260
you should go back now.

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,530
our Lianghuai Salt Region,

193
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,270
and finally the well salt region

194
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,400
in Fushun, Sichuan.

195
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,150
The salt we sell

196
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,390
in our store today

197
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,600
is a mix

198
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,550
of Lianghuai salt and well salt.

199
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,510
In terms of taste,

200
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,740
well salt

201
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,750
is slightly superior.

202
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,740
Actually, I have some

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
rough ideas

204
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,780
and would like to hear your thoughts.

205
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,040
I've been thinking,

206
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,520
people consume salt

207
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,480
in limited quantities, right?

208
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,320
You can't possibly eat salt

209
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,120
as your main food for every meal.

210
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,240
We already have enough

211
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,200
salt shops now.

212
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,680
Opening another one

213
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,690
would at most

214
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,480
take a bigger slice
of the market's profits.

215
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,390
It's not a wise move

216
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,850
and not worth doing.

217
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,960
The problem is Li

218
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,550
has already come knocking.

219
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,920
With his abundant capital,

220
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,870
if we open one new shop,

221
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,270
he can open two next door.

222
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
What should we do?

223
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,450
Do we have to

224
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,930
lower our prices again?

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
-Yeah.
-We can't do that.

226
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
A price war

227
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,790
is just a desperate measure.

228
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,720
If we continue this war like this,

229
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,980
everyone will end up losing everything.

230
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,610
That's no longer business.

231
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,210
It's just being stubborn.

232
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,790
Besides,

233
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,250
I can't keep this up much longer.

234
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,710
[Tranquility of Autumn]

235
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,490
It got stained.

236
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,000
It's okay, Mother.

237
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,140
I'll have your son buy me another one.

238
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,480
Yu'er.

239
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,870
Let me.

240
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,010
Mother still refuses to drink it.

241
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Mother,

242
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,750
I had someone bring

243
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,480
goose‑fat cakes for you from Jiangning.

244
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,910
Take your medicine first,

245
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,550
and then you can have the cakes.

246
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm not a child.

247
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,720
Why bother coaxing me?

248
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,460
If something is bothering you,

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,910
just tell me.

250
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,550
But you must

251
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,780
take the medicine.

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,270
Pingyuan,

253
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,510
help me up.

254
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,070
Let me sit for a while.

255
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,550
Why do you look so pale?

256
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,240
Are you stunned?

257
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,200
There's been too much going on lately.

258
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,090
Pingwen scolded me,

259
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,320
saying I never should have

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
taken you away from home,

261
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
and that I've only harmed you
by doing this.

262
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,750
I think he had a point.

263
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,240
If I hadn't insisted
on going to the capital

264
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,470
for the imperial examination back then,

265
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,330
none of this would have happened.

266
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Were you ever in control?

267
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,720
There's no immortal

268
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,980
who tells us

269
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,660
what we're supposed to do.

270
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,320
If I had known

271
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,840
he would never return,

272
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,480
I wouldn't have let him go.

273
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,710
Wouldn't that have solved everything?

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
But what's the point

275
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
of saying this now?

276
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,910
It's all fate.

277
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Even if fate really exists,

278
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm going to fight it.

279
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,200
Mother,

280
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,109
you must stay well.

281
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,589
One day you'll have

282
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,170
grandchildren.

283
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,050
You still have
a long, long life ahead of you.

284
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,069
You can't just let go.

285
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,510
Be honest with me.

286
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,830
Do you want

287
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,400
that man to come back

288
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,920
to see you?

289
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
If you do,

290
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,560
no matter how I feel about it,

291
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,830
I can go beg him—

292
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,470
I can go kneel to him

293
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,070
and kowtow to him—

294
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,550
as long as it makes you happy,

295
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,550
I'll do anything.

296
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,540
What would I want him back for?

297
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,690
All my life,

298
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,350
I've been holding on

299
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,550
to this one thing—

300
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,140
I never knew if he was dead or alive,

301
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,090
where he died,

302
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,350
and whether his remains

303
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,920
were left out

304
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,350
in the wind and rain.

305
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,110
But as you've seen,

306
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,030
he's living just fine,

307
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,770
even changed his surname.

308
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,480
Isn't that

309
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,510
the biggest joke on me?

310
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,920
Pingyuan,

311
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,560
now that I've finally
let go of this burden,

312
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,480
I feel empty inside.

313
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,480
No medicine can fix that.

314
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,200
Just let me be.

315
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,400
No.

316
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
You can't think that way.

317
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,700
That man changed his name,

318
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,010
and his heart changed too.

319
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,090
The person you've been waiting for

320
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,350
died on his way

321
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,790
to the imperial examination.

322
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,070
He is a dead man now.

323
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,680
But we are still alive.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
We can't let a dead man

325
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,310
trample over us,

326
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,160
can we?

327
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,880
Pingwen.

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,860
Why do you have to be angry with me?

329
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,590
Take good care of Mother

330
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,720
these next few days.

331
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,370
I'm going on a trip.

332
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,440
Where are you going?

333
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm going to Jinshan Temple.

334
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,010
Are you going to bring him back

335
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,280
or acknowledge him as your father?

336
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
It's too late.

337
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,510
He has a son now.

338
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,750
And you, Gu Pingyuan,

339
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,000
are nothing to him.

340
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,770
You think hiding away solves everything?

341
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,440
I've seen enough of the past,

342
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,750
and I don't want to look at what's ahead.

343
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,440
Kid...

344
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,550
Don't call me kid!

345
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,250
Your kid is down the mountain.

346
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,540
Seeing how devoted you are to your mother

347
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,310
makes me feel gratified.

348
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,790
When I saw her that day,

349
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,960
I knew

350
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,260
the dream had to end.

351
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,830
I couldn't keep pretending anymore.

352
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,440
What do you mean by that?

353
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,120
You don't want to deal with anything
anymore?

354
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,700
I won't hold it against you

355
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
how you wronged me back then.

356
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,710
But now my mother's life
is hanging by a thread,

357
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,940
and she won't even take her medicine.

358
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,160
As her son,

359
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,960
I don't know how to persuade her.

360
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,960
I just hope

361
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,920
you can go see her

362
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,820
and say something, anything,

363
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,990
to ease her heart

364
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,570
so she can keep living.

365
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,120
What did your mother say?

366
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,140
She said now that she's finally seen you,

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
her wish has been fulfilled,

368
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,580
and she doesn't have the strength

369
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
to hold on.

370
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,110
What should I say to her?

371
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,590
How should I say it?

372
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,880
Indeed.

373
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,000
It seem

374
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,590
you've never regretted

375
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,850
a single thing you did.

376
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,110
You really are shameless.

377
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,570
I told my mother,

378
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,180
"You don't need to wait for him anymore."

379
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,000
"He died long ago,"

380
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,850

What happened to him?

396

Suicide.

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,150
How did he die?

398
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,360
Poison.

399
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,450
He carried his medicine with him.

400
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,670
Did he ask you to call me?

401

Are you feeling better now?

407
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
I dreamed about him last night.

408
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,880
He was standing at the door,

409
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
right there,

410
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,240
just like the day

411
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,350
he left,

412
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,380
with his backpack on his back,

413
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,000
his basket in hand,

414
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,880
and inside were brush, ink, inkstone,

415
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,110
and the rice balls I made for him.

416
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,880
He said to me...

417
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,270
He said,

418
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,240
"I failed the exam."

419
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,270
I told him,

420
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,880
"So what?"

421
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,350
"Our son has made something of himself."

422
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,750
"Isn't that even happier news"

423
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,400
"than you passing the exam?"

424
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,070
He said he was tired

425
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
and wanted to sleep a little,

426
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,930
and that's when I knew he was dead.

427
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,830
He regretted it after all.

428
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,030
Yes.

429
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,790
He regretted it.

430
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,350
He said

431
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,060
he really wanted to come back.

432
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,070
So I didn't wait for nothing.

433
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
There's so much temptation

434
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480

438
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,640

He...

440
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000

441

442
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,270

when I went to get my medicine,

449
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,550
he told me...

450
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,540
I'm pregnant.

You can run it however you like.

546

But the Old Master's spirit
hasn't left yet,

547
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,970
and I can't ignore my responsibility.

548
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,020
I worked for him my whole life,

549
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,130
and I don't want to leave things
unfinished.

00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,020

it's not my place to say that—

556
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,480
but he did

557
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,010
feel regret before he died.

558
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,770
Sending something over

559
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
would fulfill his last wish.

560
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,260
You're quite thoughtful.

561
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,480
So tell me,

562
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,160
do you think my father was wrong?

563
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,230
If he was wrong,

564
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,800
that means he shouldn't have married

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,880
into our Li family.

566
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,190

568
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,150
What did I do wrong?

00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,190
Why do all of you

570
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,230
hate me so much?

571
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,990
Do you have anything else to say?

572
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,730
The Salt Industry Guild

573
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,110
asked you to go for the account review.

574
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,040
Account review?

575
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,990
What account?

576
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,370
Back then you and Mr. Gu

577
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,160
made a wager for 6 months.

578
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,400
There's one month left.

579
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,670
I told them you'd go

580
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,800
after the seven-day mourning period.

581
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,440
Is Gu Pingyuan ready

582
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,630
to hand it over?
