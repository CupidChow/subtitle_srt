00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,930
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,370
Have you figured it out?

4
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,680
No, I haven't.

5
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,960
Then go back and keep kneeling.

6
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,760
Father.

7
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,760
If you

8
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,870
don't make this clear

9
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,590
to me today,

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,940
I won't yield,

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
no matter how long you make me kneel.

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,480
You're demanding an explanation from me?

13
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,710
I told you to keep an eye on
the salt fields in Lianghuai,

14
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,970
but what have you done?

15
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,350
Once you hand the salt fields over to me,

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,060
I should get to call the shots.

17
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,240
If anything happens,

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,680
I'll deal with it on the spot.

19
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,000
You shouldn't interfere.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,710
Wasn't that what we agreed upon

21
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,280
before I left?

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,160
So why are you pulling this on me again?

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,700
You have to be the wisest in the world

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,360
and do everything yourself, is that it?

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Then why did you send me there at all?

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Then you tell me—

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,720
what have you accomplished in Nanjing?

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
-That Viceroy...
-He wants to restore the economy of

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,079
the Lianghuai region, so he won't

30
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,470
hand over the salt fields—
his golden goose—

31
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,070
so easily.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
Everyone is asking him for money.

33
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,510
He won't cooperate, and what did you do?

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Have you racked your brain

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,210
trying to figure out

36
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,910
how to persuade him

37
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,510
to hand over the salt fields?

38
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,390
You let others

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,330
lead you by the nose in everything.

40
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,360
When they tell you to print books,
you do it.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,280
When they tell you to repair
the coastal embankment, you repair it.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,410
And the salt fields?

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
I've strained my eyes

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
until they're bloodshot,

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
and I still don't see any progress, son.

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,460
And another thing—

47
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,150
you and Gu Pingyuan

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,870
have teamed up

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,880
to offend Yang Ten-Million.

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,280
Fine, offend him if you must,

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,610
but why did you have to
keep bringing it up?

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,870
You shouldn't have humiliated him
like that.

53
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,430
Father.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,030
That Yang Ten-Million is
a crooked merchant.

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,710
He preys on the common people!

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,360
Honestly speaking,

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,420
you're neglecting your real duties.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,750
I don't want to waste time
arguing with you.

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,870
I can't outwit

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,360
the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,870
If you want to fight, go do it yourself.

62
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,710
But aside from that,

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,710
I believe

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
I did nothing wrong.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,630
Gu Pingyuan—

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,380
you think he's someone easy to deal with?

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,750
The Viceroy of Liangjiang
pulled some strings with an official

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,560
from the Ministry of Rites to get him

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,090
an Associate Jinshi title.

70
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,190
From now on, when you meet him—a Jinshi—

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,630
no matter how big a merchant you are,

72
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,430
you must kneel and kowtow to him!

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
See?

74
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,240
Elevate one while crushing the other—

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,370
look at his tactics.

76
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,850
It's one thing
if you can't see through this,

77
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,750
but you're still

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,270
sticking your neck out.

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,950
Father, that's impossible.

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,070
He's just a convict.

81
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,159
At most, they'd restore
his household registry.

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,750
How could he possibly

83
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,080
be given Jinshi status?

84
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,159
Changing someone's credentials
isn't that difficult.

85
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,290
What's the big deal?

86
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,380
And I'll tell you straight—

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
I bought

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
an official post for Gu Pingyuan.

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,430
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,800
used his connections and got it done.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,310
Father.

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
Have you lost your mind?

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,270
Well...

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,659
Why would you spend money on that?

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,610
To send him away.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,600
He can take up his post
somewhere far from here.

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
It's better if you two never see

98
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
each other again.

99
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,310
So I won't have to worry every day

100
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,630
about him poisoning your mind.

101
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,510
The two of us, father and son,

102
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,350
should work together properly

103
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,890
to deal with that Viceroy.

104
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,000
So the Viceroy can't

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
keep using Gu Pingyuan against us.

106
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,830
I don't understand at all.

107
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,230
It doesn't matter if you don't understand.

108
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,360
Leave Gu Pingyuan to handle
the coastal embankment repair work.

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
You just stay at home
and attend to things here.

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
Once we secure the salt fields,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,660
I'll put you in charge of them.

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
Be good and do as I say, child.

113
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,630
Kowtow to your father.

114
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,560
When he left for the capital back then,

115
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,480
we never heard from him again—

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
whether he was alive or dead.

118
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,960
You were still little then.

119
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,470
I was still pregnant with your brother.

120
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,720
And he just

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,270
left and never returned.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,750
Some said he was still alive.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,730
Others said he died of illness.

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,570
You've been thinking about him
all this time.

125
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,780
I actually hope he's still alive.

126
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,310
If he's alive,

127
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,630
I'd be happy even if he never comes back.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,720
It's better than being weighed down

129
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
by this uncertainty about
whether he's alive or dead.

130
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,480
Then, I...

131
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,800
Kowtow now.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
I know your father.

[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

134
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,960
As long as there's still breath in him,

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,190
he'll crawl back if he has to.

136
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,950
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

137
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,800
As for me...

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
I just assume he's already dead.

139
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,980
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
At that time,

141
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,520
someone was delivering tea to the capital

142
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,070
and met someone on the road

143
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,130
who looked exactly like your father.

144
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,100
So they called out to him.

145
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,770
Your father responded

146
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,760
and even turned around.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,090
But then he flatly denied it.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,320
The villager wouldn't let it go
just like that.

149
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,909
They grabbed his sleeve,

150
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,950
and after some tugging and pulling,

151
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,120
they came to a fortune-teller's stall.

152
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,720
The man borrowed a brush,

153
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,750
wrote something on a piece of paper,

154
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
and asked the villager to bring it back.

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
The villager couldn't read,

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,780
and as soon as they took the paper,

157
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,600
the man seized the opportunity
to run away.

158
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
So the villager brought the paper back.

159
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,380
Such beautiful handwriting.

167
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,840
this poem...

168
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,630
Mr. Bai read it

169
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,250
and said it was a ghost poem.

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,080
A ghost poem?

If that isn't a ghost speaking, what is?

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,490

177
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,960
he told me,

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
I never even knew

182
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,250
such a thing had happened.

183
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,870
What difference would it have made
if you'd known?

184
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,400
Neither your father nor you

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,100
had the fate
for scholarly or official careers.

186
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,390
He's dead.

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,150
You left.

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,240
We were separated

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,840
for so many years.

190
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
If you ask me...

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
we should just stay home peacefully

192
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,840
and grow tea. That's best.

193
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:10,290
[Tranquility of Autumn]

194
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,670
Wifey?

195
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,170
Wifey,

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,390
my mother lectured me again.

197
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,870
My mind is in such turmoil.

198
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
What's wrong?

199
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,270
Are you not feeling well?

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,910
No.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,180
This time, no matter what,

202
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,070
you must help me make a decision.

203
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,250
Just tell me,

204
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
should I take
the official position or not?

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,390
You're not one to chase after
official positions.

206
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,670
Whether to take it or not—

207
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,730
don't you already know in your heart?

208
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,960
I really don't know,

209
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,620
and that's why I'm asking you.

210
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,000
Come here, let me hold you.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,060
Don't come near me.

212
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,200
Just a hug.

213
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,910
Wifey, I'm so tired.

214
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,790
See?

215
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,630
I warned you.

216
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,360
Gentlemen.

217
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,160
We can talk things through.

218
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,230
Please don't hurt my family.

219
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,630
Master Gu.

220
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,670
We've come to congratulate you.

221
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
Why are you so afraid?

222
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,870
Oh, it's you, Ms. Su.

223
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,190
I trust you've been well.

224
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,670
Tell your man to lower his blade.

225
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,220
If my family gets hurt,

226
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,550
don't blame me for losing my temper.

227
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,200
You two really are a loving couple.

228
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
I've brought you an old acquaintance.

229
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,120
I wonder if you're willing to meet her.

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,030
An old acquaintance?

231
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,360
What old acquaintance?

232
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,510
Yimei.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,510
Bai...

234
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,600
Bai Yimei?

235
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,870
Gu,

236
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,360
Chang,

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,870
I apologize for the offense.

238
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,670
I offer my sincerest apologies.

239
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,500
Yimei,

240
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,210
what are you doing?

241
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,870
I beg you to save

242
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,000
thousands of my men.

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,530
They were all my late husband's soldiers.

244
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
If you could lend a hand,

245
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,420
I would be eternally grateful

246
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,020
and repay your kindness
in every possible way.

247
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,120
Ms. Su is so capable.

248
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
Why don't you ask her?

249
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,600
If even she can't help,

250
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,330
then I certainly can't either.

251
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,330
Besides,

252
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,520
thousands of men?

253
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,080
Where did you get thousands of men from?

254
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Those thousands of prisoners of war

255
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,030
that Jiu sent to your construction site.

256
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,390
They were General Li Cheng's

257
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,550
loyal comrades.

258
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,520
They were captured after Nanjing fell.

259
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,030
Jiu has been keeping them alive.

260
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,390
He doesn't want to
waste food on them anymore

261
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,840
and fears public criticism
if he kills them.

262
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,030
He's afraid the history books

263
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,240
will record him as someone
who killed prisoners.

264
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
That old fox

265
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,550
never takes a loss.

266
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,240
Once those men finish repairing
the coastal embankment,

267
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,480
they'll no longer be of any use.

268
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,410
Marshal Jiu will surely kill them.

269
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,630
Later,

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,000
he'll just claim they died

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,530
at your construction site.

272
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,450
Those men can't die like that.

273
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
If they do, when I die,

274
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,510
I won't be able to face him.

275
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah,

276
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,110
you can't face him like that.

277
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,480
Let's set aside whether we can rescue

278
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,880
those thousands for now.

279
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,490
Let's say you do save them—

280
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,150
where would you settle them?

281
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,550
Don't tell me you want to be
a local warlord,

282
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,810
planning a rebellion.

283
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,080
You don't need to concern yourself with

284
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,030
how these people will be sent out.

285
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,030
All you need to do

286
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,670
is rescue them.

287
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,240
Ms. Su, you are so resourceful.

288
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,470
Why don't you teach me

289
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,660
how to rescue them?

290
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,610
Two firearms units

291
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
with rows of Western muskets.

292
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,720
They're watching those thousands of men

293
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,050
without even blinking.

294
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm barehanded.

295
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,390
I-I'm a scholar—utterly defenseless.

296
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,670
I'm not the Monkey King.

297
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,070
You think I can use magic?

298
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,240
Wifey,

299
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,670
do I look like the Monkey King to you?

300
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,930
You look like a tea farmer.

301
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Chang,

302
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,480
I can't just sit by and watch those men

303
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,880
being tortured to death.

304
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,720
I simply cannot bear it.

305
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,400
Please, I'm begging you to help me too.

306
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,840
You... Please.

307
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Get up.

308
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,240
You...

309
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,240
Ms. Bai,

310
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,630
will those thousands of men

311
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,200
really die?

312
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,670
They really will.

313
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,200
They were all Li Cheng's former soldiers.

314
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
Before they became soldiers,

315
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,100
they were just farmers

316
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,320
and merchants.

317
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,240
Well...

318
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,550
Aren't they just ordinary people then?

319
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,200
Exactly.

320
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,910
Then I...

321
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,970
Alright, alright.

322
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,560
Let's stop here.

323
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Yimei,

324
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,670
I'm afraid we can't help you

325
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,750
with this favor.

326
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,080
Please understand.

327
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,000
We really can't help.

328
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
There's more.

329
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,670
I've rented boats

330
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,720
to take them away

331
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,410
and send them back home.

332
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
You'd be that kind-hearted?

333
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,810
You, sending these people home?

334
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
More likely you'll ship them off
somewhere else

335
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,600
and round them up again

336
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,120
to start another rebellion.

337
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,320
When the imperial court investigates,

338
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,320
my ancestors' graves will be dug up

339
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,080
before I even know what's happening.

340
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,940
Well, you can't

341
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,090
fool your partners.

342
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,000
As long as you can
get those people onto the boats,

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,720
I'll arrange everything properly.

344
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,390
Those who want to farm can farm,

345
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,120
and those who want to do business
will get capital.

346
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
This war

347
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,200
has claimed enough lives already.

348
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,080
To rescue thousands of people

349
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,390
in front of two firearms units,

350
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,150
without giving Jiu

351
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,410
any excuse to catch us—

352
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,250
that's simply impossible.

353
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,790
Do those prisoners

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,550
know they're going to be killed?

355
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,550
Of course they do.

356
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,510
Ms. Su spending money to save people
is a noble act.

357
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,910
You know better than I do.

358
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,550
Now,

359
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,600
if the prisoners know they'll be killed

360
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
and cause trouble on the way,

361
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,240
we'll lose our heads all the same.

362
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
I think...

363
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,120
you must do it.

364
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,790
-You...
-Chang.

365
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,200
You're right.

366
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,260
Madam Gu sees things clearly.

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,670
-Wifey...
-Hurry. Get up.

368
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,410
D-Don't kneel anymore.

369
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:26,990
Thank you.

370
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,720
Come on, man,

371
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,960
cut me.

372
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
My head really hurts.

373
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,380
Guys, please rise!

374
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,120
-My Lord.
-Those rebels—

375
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,390
are they working efficiently?

376
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,840
At first, they were lazy and slacking off.

377
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,360
We picked out a few

378
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,390
and beat them half to death.

379
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,750
Now they're much more obedient.

380
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,880
Let's go take a look!

381
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,510
How's their food?

382
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,510
Well, no complaints.

383
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,510
Better than what they got in prison.

384
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,270
Is that so?

385
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,730
Don't pocket too much silver.

386
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,170
After all, we still need them to work.

387
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
We wouldn't dare.

388
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,000
What's this?

389
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,369
My Lord, this is vegetable porridge.

390
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,950
Is this meat?

391
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,160
This is a worm from the vegetables.

392
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,960
How could we give them real meat?

393
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,660
You can't be like this!

394
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
They're doing heavy labor every day—

395
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,690
and you feed them just this?

396
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,640
They won't have any strength, you know?

397
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,160
My Lord,

398
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,750
if they had any more strength,

399
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,750
they would rebel.

400
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
This humble servant remembers
your lordship's instructions.

401
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,590
Keeping these people alive

402
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,680
is just trouble anyway.

403
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,480
Feed them less and beat them more—

404
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,070
in just a few months,

405
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,680
half of them will be worn down to death.

406
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,740
Do this gradually,

407
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,770
and they won't even resist.

408
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,550
Come on, let's go. Turn around.

409
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,680
You're quite sharp.

410
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,840
Come back!

411
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,060
Put it down.

412
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,500
What are you carrying?

413
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,720
Sir,

414
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,160
while we were constructing
the coastal embankment just now,

415
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
we found two jars of gold.

416
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,880
We were just trying to find a chance

417
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
to bring them over to you.

418
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,720
Two jars of gold?

419
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,260
What are you doing?

420
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Stop right there!

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Don't run!

422
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,880
No, no, no!

423
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,070
One missed shot,

424
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,560
and I'm as good as dead!

425
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Surround them!

426
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,000
Hurry!

427
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,680
Quick! Quick! Quick!

428
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,830
You bastards!

429
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Don't you dare...

430
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,550
Let me...

431
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,160
out!

432
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,570
Please, let me out!

433
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,140
Stay still!

434
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,840
Or I'll stab you to death!

435
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,110
Mr. Gu!

436
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,880
Mr. Gu!

437
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,480
What's wrong?

438
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,160
Something's happened
at the coastal embankment.

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
Something...

440
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
something terrible has happened!

441
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,720
What terrible thing has happened?

442
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,580
Marshal Jiu...

443
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,130
has been captured by those rebels.

444
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,000
Nonsense!

445
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,880
Marshal Jiu is a legendary hero.

446
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,160
How could he be captured so easily?

447
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,640
How would I know?

448
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,560
Marshal Jiu is a titled lord.

449
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,070
If anything happens to him

450
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,030
in my jurisdiction,

451
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,640
I can't bear that responsibility.

452
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,960
Please come with me to check it out.

453
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
This is terrible!

454
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,160
My family is making braised ribs today!

455
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,350
Let's have a bite first,

456
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,550
then I'll go with you.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
You still think about ribs?

458
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,750
If anything happens to Marshal Jiu,

459
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,040
they'll tie me up at Caishikou
and flay me alive.

460
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,920
I'll be the ribs then!

461
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,260
You know?

462
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,830
Just come with me!

463
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
Release Marshal Jiu now!

464
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,530
Let Marshal Jiu go!

465
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,680
Release him now!

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,720
Release Marshal Jiu immediately!

467
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,790
Let Marshal Jiu go!

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,750
Release him!

469
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,010
-Hurry, hurry!
-Hurry!

470
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,350
Mr. Gu!

471
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Come on.

472
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,070
Duck!

473
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,550
Hurry!

474
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,310
Mr. Gu,

475
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,730
we can't go any further.

476
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
Stray bullets are flying!

477
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,450
What happened?

478
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,970
How could this happen?

479
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,260
They tricked Marshal Jiu

480
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,310
by claiming they'd dug up gold.

481
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,350
Marshal Jiu was off his guard,

482
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,310
and they got him into a large barrel

483
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,270
and carried him away!

484
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,750
Got him into a large barrel?

485
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,880
What kind of barrel?

486
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,430
Well...

487
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm asking you, what kind of barrel?

488
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
A rice barrel!

489
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,040
A rice barrel?

490
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,830
Heizi!

491
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,440
Be careful!

492
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,510
Over here! Here! Over here!

493
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,720
I was only gone for one day.

494
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,660
How did such a major incident happen?

495
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,060
Where did you get the hat?

496
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,750
Marshal Jiu gave it to me.

497
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,490
He said,

498
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,120
"Heizi,

499
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,620
you're really something.

500
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Why not stay here

501
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
and serve as a battalion commander
or higher,

502
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,310
earning glory with your sword and gun?"

503
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,160
I haven't even had the chance

504
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
to thank him yet...

505
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm not joking with you!

506
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,680
Be serious!

507
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
What do they want?

508
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,830
They want to get out of here, of course.

509
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,690
Get out of here?

510
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,310
They're locked

511
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,750
underground all day with no human dignity.

512
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,070
They'll die sooner or later anyway.

513
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,890
Then they said

514
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
they would only stop if Marshal Jiu agreed

515
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,870
to let them go.

516
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,210
T-That's impossible.

517
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,160
If an entire battalion

518
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
of people escape,

519
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,130
our whole family will be executed!

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,050
Let us go!

521
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,900
Let us go,

522
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,220
and we'll release him!

523
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,790
Mr. Gu?

524
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,240
Mr. Gu?

525
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,550
Mr. Su,

526
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
hurry and ask the Viceroy of Liangjiang

527
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,680
to bring troops here!

528
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,790
I can't handle this anymore!

529
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,720
Well, I can't...

530
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,110
But Marshal Jiu has given strict orders

531
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,880
that no one is allowed to speak of this.

532
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
He's afraid of losing face!

533
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,720
He's not afraid of
losing his life, though.

534
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,100
Among all of us here, the only person

535
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,850
they'll actually listen to is you.

536
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,720
Please think of something.

537
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,750
My life and my family's lives

538
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,430
are all depending on you!

539
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Braised lamb kidneys, fried combo,

540
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
braised sea cucumber with scallions,

541
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,530
and smoked venison,

542
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,550
ready to serve!

543
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,850
I'm here to deliver food!

544
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Stop right there!

545
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,720
It's me,

546
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,800
Gu Pingyuan!

547
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,100
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

548
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,240
sent me to supervise the repair work here!

549
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,640
I need to see Marshal Jiu!

550
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,540
Whatever you want,

551
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,440
you can negotiate with me!

552
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Stop right there!

553
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,400
Take off your robe!

554
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,590
Go in!

555
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,830
Move.

556
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,920
Who are you?

557
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,710
You're their leader?

558
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,600
It's me, Gu Pingyuan,

559
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
the one overseeing the repair work.

560
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,880
I want to see Marshal Jiu.

561
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,140
I'm here to see

562
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,030
if there's a way I can help you all.

563
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,780
Jiu

564
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,720
killed so many of us.

565
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,110
Today we'll

566
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,350
slice him up and drink to it!

567
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,920
What help could we need from you?

568
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,910
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

569
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,680
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

570
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,080
-Kill Jiu!
-Kill him!

571
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,490
If you wanted to kill him,
wouldn't you have done it already?

572
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,960
Why wait until now, right?

573
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,600
Kill Jiu!

574
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,920
Whatever you want,

575
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,620
it's open to negotiation.

576
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,980
What do we want?

577
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,060
We want to rebel. How about that?

578
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,270
Don't do it!

579
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,590
The war has already killed
too many people.

580
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,920
No more should die!

581
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,290
If that's how you want to negotiate,

582
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,890
you might as well kill me now.

583
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,070
What do you suggest then?

584
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,490
If you ask me—

585
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,020
I'll sacrifice my career

586
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,880
to plead with the Viceroy

587
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,030
and Marshal Jiu on your behalf!

588
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,360
I'll ask for their mercy

589
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,710
to let you all go home!

590
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,920
From now on,

591
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,110
you can all be law-abiding citizens!

592
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,240
How does that sound?

593
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,770
Law-abiding citizens?

594
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,260
Gu Pingyuan, oh, Gu Pingyuan.

595
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,570
Back then in Hefei,

596
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
you also promised
those surrendered soldiers

597
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,330
they could live as law-abiding citizens.

598
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,200
You know me?

599
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,270
Guys,

600
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,210
do you know who this man is?

601
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,880
He's the Gu Pingyuan

602
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
who drove our General Li Cheng
to his death!

603
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,440
Guys,

604
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,840
I didn't kill General Li!

605
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,000
Are you for real?

606
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,430
I want to see Marshal Jiu!

607
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,130
Don't beat him to death! Don't kill him!

608
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,340
What if Jiu actually wants to

609
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,140
see him later?

610
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,020
Carry him away!

611
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,430
Get up!

612
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,590
You've beaten me badly.

613
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,000
Hurry up!

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,800
I can't get up.

615
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Cut the nonsense! Get up!

616
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Alright, alright.

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,030
I can walk, I can walk.

618
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,090
You can let go of me.

619
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,030
Yu'er.

620
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,130
Why are you here?

621
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,850
If I hadn't come,

622
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,440
were you really planning to
make me a widow?

623
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,840
You...

624
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,820
You recognized me even like this?

625
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,550
Well,

626
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,310
when I was being

627
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,960
beaten up earlier,

628
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,620
why didn't you come to save me?

629
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,610
There were so many people.

630
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,940
I'm not stupid like you.

631
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,550
You think you're made of iron?

632
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,070
Come on, put your arm over me.

633
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,070
Come on, let's go.

634
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,720
Don't mess things up here for me.

635
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,650
I still need to talk to Marshal Jiu.

636
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,880
You're biting the hand that feeds you,

637
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,550
aren't you?

638
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,950
Without me, you would've died long ago.

639
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,160
Why haven't you gone over yet?

640
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,420
Jiu has been urging us!

641
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,100
Got it!

642
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,270
Coming right away!

643
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:13,960
I'll shoot him with one arrow,

644
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
and we'll escape.

645
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
Stop messing around.

646
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,710
Put down your weapon.

647
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,270
Let's walk out with our heads held high.

648
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,330
I'll show you how your man

649
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,060
pulls off a miraculous escape.

650
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,520
Marshal Jiu.

651
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,280
Gu, you're a man of honor.

652
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,790
Just now, when I heard someone barge in,

653
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,720
I knew it was you.

654
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,350
No one else

655
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
has such loyalty.

656
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:57,830
You've won

657
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,090
battles all your life.

658
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,680
How did you end up

659
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,210
stuffed into a rice barrel?

660
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:01,750
And I got

661
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,080
beaten up for no reason.

662
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,370
Who arranged all this?

663
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,890
Who's laughing?

664
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,540
M-Marshal Jiu.

665
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,750
Come on.

666
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,820
This is my wife.

667
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,960
She was worried about me,

668
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,360
so she came to protect me.

669
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,960
We're going to release
the imperial court's prisoners—

670
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,960
our families could lose their heads,
yet you still...

671
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,440
We've already staked everything on this.

672
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,310
We should've avoided complicated things.

673
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,960
You officials all

674
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,640
deceive your superiors
and cover for each other.

675
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,350
Well, how to spin a story

676
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,930
about releasing prisoners

677
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,160
is all up to your silver tongues,

678
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,640
right?

679
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
Just leave me out of this.

680
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,070
Well, if something goes wrong,
it's your problem.

681
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
How is it just my problem?

682
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
You're in this with them.

683
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,830
I...

684
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,760
M-Marshal Jiu,

685
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,770
a word in private.

686
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,190
Come on, wifey.

687
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,160
Take a look. It's eye-opening.

688
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,130
Y-You...

689
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,830
Have a look.

690
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,340
This...

691
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,400
We're about to leave.

692
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,060
Do you want to come out and see?

693
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,310
Marshal Jiu, you too.

694
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,010
Let's go.

695
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,010
Guys,

696
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,390
board the ships by squad and unit.
No rushing.

697
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,700
Gu,

698
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,040
this is my child.

699
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,010
Come on.

700
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,590
Thank you, Gu,
for making this possible.

701
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,440
From here on,

702
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,220
we'll be worlds apart,

703
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,160
unlikely to meet again.

704
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,570
Take care of yourself.

705
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,640
Ms. Yu'er,

706
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,570
take care of yourself.

707
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,700
Marshal Jiu.

708
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Well...

709
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
It's been a pleasure working with you.

710
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,180
Earlier, Ms. Su mentioned

711
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,900
wanting to buy those prisoners from you.

712
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
She was afraid
you wouldn't have the courage

713
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,300
to accept the deal.

714
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,550
I laughed out loud when I heard that.

715
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,880
You and "timid" don't belong
in the same sentence,

716
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,350
right?

717
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,860
However...

718
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,160
you really pulled off

719
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,290
the self-sacrifice act brilliantly.

720
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,970
You acted better than I did.

721
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,730
As I should.

722
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,480
Let me ask you.

723
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,650
I took their gold

724
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,980
to handle this matter.

725
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,330
What did they offer you?

726
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,610
I want the truth.

727
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,000
Actually, all I wanted was

728
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,330
to save whoever I could.

729
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,190
The war is over.

730
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
I don't want to see any more deaths.

731
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,300
That's all.

732
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,030
This chest of gold

733
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,960
will help me demobilize
my 50,000 veterans.

734
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,420
If they can't afford food,

735
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,170
they'll become rebels too.

736
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,260
We've both bought ourselves some peace.

737
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,350
That old fox Rui Lin

738
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,350
actually dared to double-cross me.

739
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,270
Master, please calm down.

740
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,960
-It's not the time to get angry.
-Father.

741
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,090
Where have you been?

742
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,790
I just came back from

743
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,790
the coastal embankment in Nantong.

744
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,250
The Viceroy and Marshal Jiu
also went, right?

745
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,640
Marshal Jiu went, but not the  Viceroy.

746
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,480
I heard Marshal Jiu was fine,

747
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,030
so I came back.

748
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,270
Good boy, good boy.

749
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
What's wrong?

750
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,000
The Master was just about to ask you that.

751
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,720
Ask me?

752
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,930
How would I know?

753
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,960
They say

754
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,030
Rui Lin has gone back

755
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,270
on his promise about the salt fields.

756
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,480
Jiu.

757
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,280
Why haven't you gone back yet?

758
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Out having fun with your troops?

759
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,510
Your camp is having
a malaria outbreak right now.

760
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,239
I've already sent physicians.

761
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,050
Go back and check immediately.

762
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,880
Move the soldiers and the prisoners

763
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
who haven't caught malaria

764
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
to another camp.

765
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,400
Yes, sir.

766
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,190
The sedan chair for your wife

767
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,550
awaits at the foot of the mountain.

768
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,480
I'll have someone escort her back.

769
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,400
The winds and waves here are treacherous.

770
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,960
A lady of your standing shouldn't be
in such a dangerous place.

771
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,710
When your husband's merits
bring you an imperial title,

772
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,840
I'll come to offer my congratulations.

773
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,320
Please.

774
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,980
The coastal embankment repairs
are going well.

775
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,630
Yes.

776
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
After the repair work is completed,

777
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,240
I'll still need your help.

778
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Walk with me for a bit.

779
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,240
This malaria came on really fiercely.

780
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,780
However,

781
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,690
those who died were all rebels.

782
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,320
Several thousand people died
in just one night.

783
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,720
It's truly frightening.

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
Fortunately,

785
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,110
not a single soldier

786
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,110
of the imperial court was infected.

787
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,780
Heaven is watching over us,

788
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,290
and the Emperor and Empress Dowager
are blessed with boundless fortune.

789
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,890
You're right.

790
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,420
They are all blessed
with heavenly fortune.

791
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,150
Long live the Emperor
and the Empress Dowager.

792
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,590
Those who have been infected

793
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,830
must be careful.

794
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,520
Carrying the disease

795
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,320
and running around everywhere—

796
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,030
if the court finds out,

797
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,110
they'll show no mercy.

798
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,590
Please rest assured.

799
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,760
They've all returned to their hometowns.

800
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,070
Those who farm will farm,

801
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,800
and those who trade will trade.

802
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,320
The war is over.

803
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,340
No more people should die.

804
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,230
I agree.

805
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,440
Tell me,

806
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,230
what if I let you

807
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,090
run the salt fields in Lianghuai?

808
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,400
That is the most profitable business
in Jiangnan.

809
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,860
Do you have such ambition?

810
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,510
The salt fields in the Lianghuai region

811
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,570
are Jiangnan's primary livelihood.

812
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,400
Millions of people depend on them
for their living.

813
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,230
How could we really

814
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,070
hand them over to that father and son?

815
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,800
They'd burst from greed alone.

816
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,990
If they mismanage them,

817
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,050
something terrible will happen
sooner or later.

818
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,510
Is the imperial court's management
any better?

819
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,510
I doubt it.

820
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,230
It's just

821
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,760
that money that should have been earned
by merchants

822
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,360
has ended up in the hands of
corrupt officials.

823
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,480
It's really rare to find someone
who talks back

824
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,760
as much as you do.

825
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,880
The imperial court's salt administration

826
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,360
has long been a mess.

827
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
What I want

828
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,670
is for the people of Lianghuai

829
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,730
to be freed from the imperial court's

830
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,630
oppression

831
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
without falling into

832
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,580
the clutches of the Li family.

833
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,840
I want the Salt Industry Guild
to take the lead,

834
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,400
and as long as they pay taxes uniformly,

835
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,000
I'll let them manage
the salt fields monopoly.

836
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,480
This is confidential.

837
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,030
I've only told you.

838
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,460
Well...

839
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,490
True benevolence can seem cruel.

840
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
If you care so much about

841
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,370
your friendship with him,

842
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
I'll replace you.

843
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,630
If I find out

844
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
you've leaked a word of this,

845
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
I'll find some charge

846
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,260
and have you exiled again.

847
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,630
Your personal loyalties,

848
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,710
compared to the livelihood
of Lianghuai's people,

849
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,360
are

850
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,280
worthless.

851
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,170
Don't blame me for being heartless
when the time comes—

852
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,630
remember this.

853
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,320
Look at

854
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,630
what this letter says.

855
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,790
The letter says that the Viceroy

856
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,920
wants to rebuild the salt fields
in Lianghuai,

857
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,320
but change them from state-operated

858
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
to a system where the Salt Industry Guild

859
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,100
pays fixed rent and taxes to the court!

860
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,110
While the Salt Industry Guild

861
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,000
will be controlled
by the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office,

862
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,060
which will appoint

863
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,960
a representative later,

864
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,690
Gu Pingyuan.

865
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,710
That way, our family's private salt fields

866
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,230
will cleverly become

867
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,540
"state-run"!

868
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,630
It's just

869
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,960
that they will operate
under a mixed state-private model.

870
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,760
That's right.

871
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,070
Exactly!

872
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,550
I think since
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

873
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,110
wants to get involved,

874
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,450
we might as well openly

875
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,110
make our move

876
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,910
and let him in!

877
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,280
They may come in,

878
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,650
but we won't necessarily

879
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,510
let them leave.

880
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,630
It says here

881
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,110
that the operating rights will
belong to the guild.

882
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,150
And who is the guild?

883
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,190
Isn't it us

884
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,070
and Gu Pingyuan?

885
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,670
Then we should seize the initiative

886
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,680
and choose first

887
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,030
which salt-administered provinces
our family will manage.

888
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,670
Jiangsu and Jiangxi—

889
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,630
they are major salt-administered provinces

890
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,110
and places where merchants

891
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,970
from all over the country gather.

892
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,230
Jingdezhen

893
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,400
and the Weaving Bureau

894
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,320
are where

895
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,090
the biggest merchants gather.

896
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,170
Father,

897
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,800
let's take those two provinces

898
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,110
and leave the rest to Gu Pingyuan.

899
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,150
We'll operate independently.

900
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,030
At year's end, just like the Westerners,

901
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,150
we will set up a Board of Directors

902
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,280
based on profits
to make the final decision—

903
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,630
according to the scale of operations

904
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,830
and amount of profit,

905
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,480
the losers will have to withdraw.

906
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,790
Let's use this method

907
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,230
to squeeze
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office out.

908
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,110
Then everything else

909
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,970
will be under our control, right?

910
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,000
Is this

911
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,840
someone else's analysis

912
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,280
or your own thinking?

913
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,360
I figured it out myself.

914
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,890
Just now.

915
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,800
Just now?

916
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,740
How confident are you?

917
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,590
I don't want to lose again.

918
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,590
I want to win once.

919
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,880
One, two!

920
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,730
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

921
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,530
One, two!

922
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,040
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

923
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,510
One, two!

924
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,330
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

925
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,750
One, two!

926
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,520
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

927
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,960
One, two!

928
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,650
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

929
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,280
One, two!

930
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,940
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

931
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,190
One, two!

932
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,960
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

933
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,250
One, two!

934
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,000
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

935
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,520
One, two!

936
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,000
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

937

Loosen the rope!

951
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,320
Loosen the rope!

952
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,550
Loosen it more!

953
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,190

954
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,550

Everyone!

957
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,550
Today marks the completion
of the Nantong coastal embankment.

958
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,680
A weight has been lifted from my heart.

959
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,360
Mr. Li Qin,

960
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,300
Mr. Gu,

961
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,570
on behalf of the people of Liangjiang,

962
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,090
I offer you both a toast.

963
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,710
You're too kind.

964
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,640
You're too kind.

965
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,650
Cheers.

966
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,730
-Sit.
-Sit.

967
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,110
Our Li family from the capital

968
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,840
is honored to

969
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,920
do something practical for the people

970
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,070
of Liangjiang.

971
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,000
The coastal embankment is well built!

972
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,530
With the keystone in place,

973
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,230
barring any unforeseen circumstances,

974
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,880
it will stand for 200 to 300 years!

975
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,800
The people of Nantong

976
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,630
will no longer need to flee.

977
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,880
The salt industry in Lianghuai

978
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,710
will no longer fear
being ruined by floods too!

979
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,010
These are all thanks to
Your Excellency's efforts.

980
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,190
I drink to you.

981
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,200
Li Million, you never change,

982
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,570
always talking business.

983
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,020
As a businessman,

984
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,730
what else would he talk about?

985
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,280
Your Excellency,
a distinguished guest has arrived!

986
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,610
Quickly invite them in.

987
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,170
Come on.

988
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
A distinguished guest.
