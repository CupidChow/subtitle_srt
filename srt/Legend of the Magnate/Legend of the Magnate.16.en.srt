00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,870
Pingyuan, what kind of business

4
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,200
is this shop going to be?

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,789
You're the head manager now.

6
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,440
You tell me.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,560
I'll decide?

8
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,520
Well then...

9
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,789
[Ping]

10
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,850
I think we can sell boating supplies.

11
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,610
Pingyuan,

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,789
the entrance to Huizhou Prefecture

13
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,789
is right by a dock.

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,930
Most of the people

15
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,310
coming and going are boatmen.

16
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,039
If we sell boating supplies,

17
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,560
we could make a fortune.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,310
Actually, that's not ideal.

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,790
There are already
too many boating suppliers.

20
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,950
Let's sell general merchandise instead.

21
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,680
Like premium items,

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,740
such as Jinhua Ham,

23
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,990
Osmanthus Duck,

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,170
wind-dried chicken, wind-dried fish,

25
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,770
and jerky.

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,630
But these items
are a bit difficult to store.

27
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,610
If you ask me,

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,470
you should put everything on the line

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,870
and open a grocery store.

30
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,160
Don't count on making money from the shop.

31
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,030
The main purpose is for you to learn

32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,360
how to deal with people.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,710
You need to learn to use your eyes

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,650
and your ears to make money.

35
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,960
Pingyuan, you're teasing me again.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,290
How can ears make money?

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Let me ask you,

38
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,400
what do you think

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
is the most important thing in business?

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,690
I've heard a saying before.

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,710
Have what others lack;
excel at what others have.

42
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,890
That's an old saying.

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,910
But how do you know

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,990
what others don't have?

45
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,890
How do you know

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,370
what others need the most?

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,560
Just now

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,480
on our way here,

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,470
there was a business opportunity.

50
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,630
You could earn

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,530
thousands of taels of silver.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
Thousands of taels?

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,050
Are you interested?

54
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,800
[Ping]

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,470
Pingyuan.

56
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,050
Even the Governor

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,720
can't earn that much.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,310
Forget thousands of taels.

59
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,510
Even for 1,000 taels,

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,390
I'd kneel down and kowtow to you.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,020
Manager, Boss.

62
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,240
I didn't dare to buy you alcohol.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
This fruit wine is very light.

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Perfect for quenching your thirst.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Thank you.

66
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,320
Oh, right.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,470
I need to trouble you two.

68
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,310
Please help me buy

69
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,570
1,000 chi of hemp rope.

70
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,200
About as thick as a finger will do.

71
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,400
[Ping]

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
And 100 meters of fishing line,

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,170
100 meters of silk ribbons for tying hair,

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,170
and 5 water vats.

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,280
Then go to the stationery store

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
and buy some adhesive clay for making ink.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,760
Soak it

78
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,910
in the water vats.

79
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,890
Hurry and do it.

80
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,440
Alright.

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,210
Let's go.

82
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
What are you buying all these things for?

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
To make money, of course.

84
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,750
Make money? These things

85
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,480
don't make any sense together.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,470
Stop keeping me in suspense.

87
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,200
My brain is slow,

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,130
as you well know.

89
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,960
If you make me figure it out,

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,420
my head will explode soon.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,750
Soon, you'll use a chopper

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,050
to cut the 1,000-chi hemp rope

93
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,490
into sections of 4 chi each,

94
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,410
one by one,

95
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,150
and put them in the vats.

96
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,470
When they turn black,

97
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,200
take them out

98
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,050
and tie them with fishing line

99
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,240
before adding silk ribbons.

100
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
What do you think they look like?

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,610
Braided queues?

102
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,700
Over 1,000 chi of hemp rope

103
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,060
should be enough

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
to make more than 200 braided queues.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,920
We don't need to charge much.

106
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,519
Just 10 taels of silver each.

107
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,630
Just some hemp rope?

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
Would you buy it from me?

109
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,089
Of course, I don't want it.

110
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,870
The key is where you're going to sell it.

111
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,090
Hefei has just been

112
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,000
occupied by the Southern Army.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,190
Soldiers are coming

114
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,430
from all directions to surround them.

115
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,490
They can't escape.

116
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,130
They're finished.

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,440
If you sell them

118
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,390
near Hefei at this time,

119
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,370
I guarantee you

120
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,490
within 2 hours,

121
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
all the braided queues will be sold out.

122
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,950
Sell them to those people?

123
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,270
When they first entered Huizhou,

124
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,380
how many people were there?

125
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,110
Over 30,000.

126
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,270
And now?

127
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,720
They claim to have an army of 100,000.

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
So where did those

129
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,070
tens of thousands come from?

130
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,310
Just ruffians and scoundrels

131
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,270
who joined on their own.

132
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,950
They're not

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
truly committed to rebellion

134
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,470
or fighting.

135
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,680
Once the tide of war turns against them,

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,630
they'll be quick to flee

137
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,870
at the first opportunity.

138
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,670
But they have no braided queues.

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
If they're caught
by the imperial court's army,

140
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,140
it's still a capital offense.

141
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,830
Hair is easy to shave off,

142
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,450
but not so easy to grow back.

143
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,160
Never mind 10 taels.

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,010
Even if you charge more,

145
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,040
they'll still have to buy them.

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,060
Really?

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,780
But I warn you.

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,310
This business can only be done once.

149
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,510
The second time will cost you your head.

150
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,600
Even once might be a close call.

151
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,440
Pingyuan, what about the tea plantation?

152
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,570
I didn't ask you to watch it all the time.

153
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,750
There are 2 assistants here

171
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,600
You should make a decision.

Can you guarantee
she won't run away again?

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,890
Aren't you usually so capable?

571
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,600
Now you want me to save you?

572
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,680
Look at the state I'm in!

573
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,880
How can I save anyone?

574
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,030
Pingyuan, you always have a way!

575
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,880
You always figure something out!

576
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,080
Interrogation time!

577
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,300
Move!

578
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,930
Pingyuan!

579
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,490
We're dead! We're dead!

580
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,110
This time we're really done for!

581
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:16,590
♪ Brilliant blooms spread everywhere ♪

582
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,590
Yimei.

583
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,310
Gu.

584
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,570
[Happy]

585
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,850
Princess Consort.

586
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,500
My father...

587
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,480
[Happy]

588
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,000
You've come a long way.
It must have been tiring.

589
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,850
This wine is made
from wild fruits from Guangxi.

590
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,090
It's a bit spicy.

591
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,510
Takes some getting used to at first.

592
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,060
You dared to come at this time.

593
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,890
You're indeed bold.

594
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,070
A toast to you.

595
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,280
Excellent.

596
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,560
Wine helps forget sorrows.

597
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,610
Have another glass.

598
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,850
You had Gu tied up all day.

599
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,240
He hasn't eaten all day.

600
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,350
Don't let him drink too much.

601
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,610
You don't understand.

602
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,100
In battle,

603
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,730
I can go 3 days without food.

604
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,770
But not letting me have a drink

605
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,340
would be a true injustice.

606
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,930
Come on. Come on.

607
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Let's sit down, the three of us,

608
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,530
and have a good talk.

609
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,130
Please, sit.

610
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,240
During my patrol of the city today,

611
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,100
someone startled your carriage.

612
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,000
I knew it must be you, Gu.

613
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,210
I put you in jail just to avoid suspicion.

614
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,730
Sorry for the inconvenience.

615
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,070
This drink is my apology.

616
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,280
These days,

617
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,400
the Princess Consort has often

618
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,530
mentioned you to me.

619
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
The kindness you've shown to Yimei—

620
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,910
we

621
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,240
can never repay in this lifetime.

622
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,870
I understand.

623
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,880
Good.

624
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,640
Let's get down to business.

625
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,140
What brings you here,

626
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,220
Gu?

627
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,890
I was

628
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,000
sent by Mr. Bai.

629
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,480
His life is hanging by a thread now.

630
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,220
He wants to see her one last time.

631
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,380
I hope you can go back.

632
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,750
Go back?

633
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,600
Who among you would accept her there?

634
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,700
If Yimei can be safe

635
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,810
after she returns,

636
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
I'll take her back right now.

637
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,030
Gu,

638
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,480
you need to come up with

639
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,010
a more practical solution.

640
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,170
You have to go back, no matter what.

641
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,490
This might be the last time

642
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,330
you see your father.

643
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,200
If necessary, we'll sneak in at night.

644
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,160
Fine.

645
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,880
I'll go back with Yimei.

646
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,950
I'll pay my respects to the old man,

647
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,480
so he can pass away in peace.

648
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,680
That's absolutely impossible.

649
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,080
You can't take this risk.

650
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,070
You are a prince.

651
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,400
To hell with that title.

652
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,460
I am your husband now.

653
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,640
Besides,

654
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,350
I trust Gu.

655
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,160
Even if something goes wrong,

656
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,070
we, as husband and wife,

657
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,400
will die together.

658
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,980
Gu,

659
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,570
I'll go get changed,

660
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,380
and we'll leave immediately.

661
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,000
Pingwen and 2 other assistants

662
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,100
are still locked up in prison.

663
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,710
Did they beat him?

664
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,410
How come I didn't know that?

665
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,790
Please find someone quickly

666
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,780
to release them.

667
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,940
I'll wait for you outside.

668
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,380
[Desheng Gate]

669
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,590
Mr. Bai.

670
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,160
I thought you were asleep.

671
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,170
I haven't been able to sleep or eat
these past few days.

672
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,540
I sit by the door, exhausted,

673
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,430
but as soon as I lie down, I'm wide awake.

674
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,630
Yesterday,

675
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,070
I suddenly dreamed of Yimei's mother.

676
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,020
I believe the time for our reunion

677
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,389
is not far away.

678
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,500
I just don't know

679
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,960
how to tell her about our daughter.

680
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,000
Mr. Bai,

681
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,679
please don't hate Yimei.

682
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,550
She can be childish sometimes,

683
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,960
but—

684
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,420
She's not a child anymore.

685
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,050
She's grown up.

686
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,110
I don't hate her.

687
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,630
Come in.

688
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,020
Mr. Bai.

689
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,420
This is General Li Cheng,

690
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,340
Yimei's current husband.

691
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,140
Don't be upset.

692
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,140
Don't be upset.

693
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,170
I'm not upset.

694
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,130
Though we've never met before,

695
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,320
I should still show some courtesy.

696
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,410
Please rise.

697
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,860
Father,

698
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,680
please forgive my unfilial behavior.

699
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,130
I truly and sincerely

700
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,740
want to be with him.

701
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,300
Please forgive me, Father.

702
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,510
When you two got together,

703
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,050
you never informed me.

704
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,150
Why would you need my forgiveness?

705
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,610
Father.

706
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,330
I will take good care of Yimei.

707
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,620
I will honor my vow for all my days.

708
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,290
Should I defy this oath,

709
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,970
let me be pierced through
by a hail of arrows.

710
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,270
Father, please rest assured

711
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,260
and take care of yourself.

712
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,180
Please rise, General Li.

713
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,510
I don't serve in the imperial court.

714
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,340
We are not enemies.

715
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
Both of you, please stand up.

716
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,860
Thank you, Father.

717
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,550
Mr. Bai.

718
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,800
Rise.

719
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
I'll keep watch in the courtyard

720
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,060
to prevent any disturbances.

721
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,510
Thank you.

722
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,450
How is Mr. Bai doing?

723
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,880
I just made him a fresh decoction.

724
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,800
He drank it

725
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,110
and went to sleep.

726
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,250
What do you mean by this?

727
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,730
Gu.

728
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,890
It's easy to kill, but hard to save.

729
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,090
It's easier for us

730
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,550
to rush here day and night.

731
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,160
But taking care of the elderly
day after day

732
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
is harder for you.

733
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,950
Please receive our kowtow in gratitude.

734
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,250
Let's go.

735
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,480
How can you not tell left from right?

736
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,340
Manager.

737
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,740
You're the one
who can't tell left from right.

738
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,510
I am the manager.

739
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,360
How could I not know left from right?

740
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,910
Boss!

741
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,840
Pingyuan!

742
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,810
Pingyuan! Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

743
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,320
Pingyuan! Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

744
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,920
Think of a way

745
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,200
to get us up there.

746
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,150
Why should I get you up there?

747
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,780
To go home?

748
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm injured like this.

749
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
Where else would I go?

750
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,670
Look at the state you're in.

751
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,070
What would you do at home?

752
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,070
Besides scaring our mother,

753
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,070
what else can you do?

754
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,860
Do we have wound medicine at home?

755
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,260
Or a doctor for injuries?

756
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,150
Go back and stay at the shop.

757
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,610
Let me tell you something.

758
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,450
Just move slowly like this.

759
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,050
It's so damp.

760
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,610
Don't lie on the ground.

761
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,060
Once you lie down, you won't get up again.

762
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,290
Words of wisdom.

763
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,760
Don't take them lightly.

764
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,390
But it's dozens of li down there.

765
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,960
Then what do you want?

766
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,760
Should I carry you up there? Is that it?

767
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,350
Manager, Manager.

768
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,510
Let's listen to Boss.

769
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,510
Let's walk back.

770
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,400
You...

771
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,410
Go.

772
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,820
Follow my command.

773
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,880
One, two, three.

774
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,410
Left leg.

775
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,720
One, two, three. Right leg.

776
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,550
One, two, three. Left leg!

777
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,310
You two jerks.

778
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,240
One, two, three. Right leg!

779
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,410
Left leg!

780
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,380
Go!

781
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,140
Why are you shouting so loudly?

782
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,190
Right leg! Go!

783
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,020
Why are you so clumsy?

784
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,790
Get up now!

785
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,630
I'll call out the slogan. I'll do it.

786
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,560
Come on. Come on.

787
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,620
One, two, three.

788
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,670
Left leg.

789
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,960
One, two, three.

790
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,150
Right leg.

791
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,730
Is Mr. Liao here?

792
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,120
I'm Gu Pingyuan from Shanjian Village.

793
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,230
Is Mr. Liao here?

794
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,230
There's no Mr. Liao here.

795
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,430
Don't be so annoying.

796
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,920
Miss!

797
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,960
Bai Shi'an in Shanjian Village,

798
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,550
Mr. Bai,

799
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,730
sent me to find him.

800
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,080
[Miss Liao]

801
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,400
Are you really not here to collect debts?

802
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,150
Come in.

803
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,760
Hurry up.

804
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,700
Father, come out.

805
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,620
It's not a debt collector.

806
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,850
If you're not here to collect debts,

807
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,910
then you must be here to deliver money.
