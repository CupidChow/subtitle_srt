00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,479
Gods, deities,

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,229
I prey for good luck.

5
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,920
Let me win this game.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,220
Bring me a fortune.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,330
You'll all lose!

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,920
Seven.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,310
Seven?

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,509
The Player takes the first tile,
and the Banker the third.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,920
Can't see it.

12
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,850
Do you see it now?

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,280
Were you just

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,560
tricked by that man?

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,680
Yes.

16
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,200
He's a notorious bully in the local area.

17
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,560
You lost.

18
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,160
I got two same tiles.

19
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,840
What does it matter?

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,310
Look carefully.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,020
This is 10,

22
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,340
and this is 11.

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,960
You're the one who lost.

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,840
That's not fair!

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,170
-That's not the rule!
-Just admit defeat!

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,160
The money...

27
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,079
The higher score wins,

28
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,410
and the lower one loses.

29
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,230
No other restrictions, right?

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,850
Who dares to refute it?

31
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,470
Mister,

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,840
is this

33
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,600
how you play it beyond the pass?

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,620
I've never heard of such rules.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Rules?

36
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,190
There is only one rule beyond the pass.

37
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,240
That is, the locals always win!

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You'd better get your hands off.

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,340
Otherwise,

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll break your fingers!

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,560
Look.

42
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,480
It's a real gun, isn't it?

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,480
According to the rules beyond the pass,

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,170
would you say my bullets

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,610
can crush your cranium?

46
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:31,910
What now?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm fearless.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
Shoot me, I dare you.

49
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,030
Pull the trigger!

50
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,079
That's a real gun!

51
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,360
Guess if I dare to shoot.

52
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,370
Fancy a bet?

53
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,670
I-I bet you wouldn't dare!

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,810
You wouldn't dare!

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,960
Guys,

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,000
are you
on the Banker's side or the Player's?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,030
Place your bets

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
before I pull the trigger.

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,600
The Player!

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
All in!

61
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,390
Shoot! Shoot him!

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,430
Do it now!

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,680
One.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Two.

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,220
Don't move!

66
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,730
Mr. Li,

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,820
I've been waiting for you.

68
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,730
They told me you were here.

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,830
Yes. I'm here.

70
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,270
Move!

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,360
Get a move on!

72
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,070
Commander Xu,

73
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,890
we couldn't find anything.

74
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,800
You mean to keep

75
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,800
that large sum of money to yourselves,

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,430
right?

77
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,630
Everything beyond the pass

78
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,960
belongs to the Emperor.

79
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,000
You want to steal?

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
That severe crime

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,720
gives enough grounds

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,120
to execute both of you.

83
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,850
Where is the money?

84
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,830
Mom!

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,360
I don't know.

86
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,050
I've never seen any!

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,250
Commander Xu, Commander Xu!

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,850
Her husband was just buried.

89
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,480
Please show some mercy...

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,740
You're against me too?

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,790
Do you want to die or what?

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,950
Listen up!

93
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,630
This whole settlement will suffer

94
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
if you don't hand in the money!

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,390
I have many ways to make

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,940
a living person tell the truth.

97
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
Tie them up and take them away.

98
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,050
A long interrogation awaits them.

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,320
Hands off!

100
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,510
Hu!

101
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,950
Hu!

102
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,750
Dig in the ground the house is on.

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Dig up Su's grave too.

104
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,160
See if anything is hidden there.

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,820
-Yes!
-Yes!

106
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,220
Ms. Su,

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,650
let me know if there's anything

108
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,610
I can help with.

109
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,760
Please meet my good friend,

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,770
Mr. Gu, here.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,460
As a local, he is very familiar

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,340
with Ningguta.

113
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,750
I bought 300 horses

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,150
from a local horse ranch.

115
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,430
I need to transport them
to the Central Plains.

116
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,690
Mr. Gu, do you have any good suggestions?

117
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,510
Why would you

118
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,720
buy horses from this place?

119
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,430
Those in Sichuan

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,480
and Yunnan have better stamina.

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,200
Did you buy these horses

122
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,600
for warfare?

123
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,900
I wonder who you are.

124
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,390
Are you sure

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,730
you want to know?

126
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,910
Well...

127
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,480
You can hire a large ship

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,940
and transport them by sea.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
The horses will be brought to the south.

130
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,310
A sea journey will send them

131
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,240
to the opposite direction, right?

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
You're sending horses to the south...

133
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,159
Are you...

134
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,800
What?

135
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,150
Mr. Gu, you can leave now
if you feel scared.

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,950
You're a rebel.

137
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,190
I'm an exile.

138
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm not afraid of anything.

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,240
Mr. Gu,

140
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't you want to
help that mother and child?

141
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,390
That kid and you

142
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,120
could take the same route as Ms. Su.

143
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,430
Helping Ms. Su is helping yourself.

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,190
Ms. Su, where exactly are you

145
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,070
sending these horses

146
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,600
to?

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
Your job is to get them out of the city.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,860
The rest is none of your business.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,210
Fine.

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,830
Well,

151
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll come up with something.

152
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,720
Hold on.

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,240
Thank you so much, Mr. Gu.

154
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,870
Ms. Su,

155
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,560
aren't you worried
that he may leak the secret?

156
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,440
He would've been shot many times

157
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,370
if I hadn't opened the door for him.

158
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,120
This man

159
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
is very intelligent.

160
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,390
[Commander Xu's Mansion]

161
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,750
I extend my best regards to you,
Commander Xu.

162
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,360
I'm humbly

163
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,270
kowtowing to you.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,670
It's freezing cold.

165
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,240
What are you doing here?

166
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
At a friend's request,

167
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,490
I need to transport some sea salt.

168
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,500
Where are you from?

169
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,770
Commander Xu,

170
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm from Pingyao, Shanxi Province.

171
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,030
I've heard
that Shanxi is the wealthiest province

172
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,140
in the country.

173
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,090
People there

174
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
are filthy rich.

175
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
If this "gate gift"

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,120
was presented by others,
I'd gladly accept it.

177
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
But you...

178
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
Gu Pingyuan has been away for a long time.

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,020
Is he back yet?

180
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
He just came back.

181
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,800
Then why didn't you tell me?

182
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
Get him here now!

183
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,030
Yes!

184
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,470
Commander Xu,

185
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,840
I shall take my leave.

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,860
Sir...

187
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,930
Where were you running off to?

188
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,130
I wouldn't dare to run off.

189
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,080
I threw Su's wife

190
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,740
and her kid

191
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,170
to the dungeon.

192
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
I even had Su's dead body

193
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,270
dug up from the ground

194
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,870
and searched several times.

195
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,330
Where on earth did he hide the money?

196
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,950
I want you

197
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,370
to dispose of this matter.

198
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,170
I'll talk to Su's widow.

199
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,250
However,

200
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,180
she has lost her husband for good.

201
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,270
How much shall we take

202
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,000
from the money to be retrieved?

203
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,630
Before the New Year,
I need to make a trip to Jilin

204
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,080
to pay tribute to the brass.

205
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,670
I need a lot of money.

206
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,390
Solve this problem in 3 days.

207
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,810
If you can't, next year,

208
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll send you to the mountain

209
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,570
to catch wild bears.

210
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,270
Yes.

211
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,960
About that Shanxi man
who just talked to me,

212
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,020
go to his place and trick a few hundred

213
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,100
more silver taels out of his pocket.

214
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,560
Otherwise, I won't let him

215
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,630
take a single grain of sea salt away.

216
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Got it.

217
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Father.

218
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,200
Make me some tea.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,440
I'll get that.

220
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,100
Patriarch.

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
It's getting colder and colder.

222
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,870
We've been stuck here

223
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,000
for a couple of days.

224
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,060
Seems like a waste of time.

225
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,990
You think I'm not anxious?

226
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,160
Commander Xu

227
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,380
is very greedy

228
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,250
for money.

229
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Mr. Gu told me

230
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,290
200 to 300 taels of silver would do.

231
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,440
To get Commander Xu's approval sooner,

232
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,170
I added one more hundred taels.

233
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,380
Unexpectedly, he declined my offer.

234
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,910
What does he want then?

235
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,370
Shall we

236
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,130
give him an extra hundred?

237
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,210
No.

238
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,960
We can't keep offering him more

239
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,550
like adding oil to a lamp nonstop.

240
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,440
Raising the amount

241
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
again and again

242
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,960
will only make him force us to stay.

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,510
I made

244
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,400
a hasty move on this matter.

245
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,570
We'll have to wait.

246
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,890
When Mr. Gu comes here,

247
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,410
I'll ask him for advice.

248
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,080
Father,

249
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,270
didn't we already meet

250
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,320
Mr. Gu once,

251
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
when we entered

252
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,080
the city?

253
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,120
How come I didn't know that?

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
He looked imposing.

255
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,870
Last time he was here,

256
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,270
he taught me how to heat up a brick stove.

257
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,150
His image just popped up in my head.

258
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,790
Oh,

259
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,510
you have such a great memory, don't you?

260
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,750
But you should reflect on your behavior.

261
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,910
you're a young lady.

262
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,430
Talking to strangers eagerly

263
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,470
is not exactly good manners.

264
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,030
I'll go check on the horses.

265
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,080
It's too cold now.

266
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,850
They might need more food.

267
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,670
I'm going to bed, Father.

268
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,510
Refill my cup before you leave!

269
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,600
I wouldn't dare

270
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,390
to do so without your order.

271
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,550
I'd hate to look ill-mannered,

272
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,400
disrespectful, and annoying.

273
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,740
My precious daughter,

274
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,550
do you know

275
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,610
what this place is?

276
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,790
Ningguta.

277
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,240
Who would stay here other than exiles?

278
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,330
We must never drop our guard.

279
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Let's

280
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,590
just finish our business

281
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,890
go home for New Year's.

282
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,200
Why so nosy?

283
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,550
Father.

284
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,750
Tell me...

285
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,550
Is Mr. Gu

286
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,120
a bandit

287
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,200
who kills without mercy
and eats human organs?

288
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,780
Like a gang leader?

289
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,750
You've been listening to
too many stories.

290
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,880
Why don't you ask around for an answer?

291
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm having trouble dealing

292
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,440
with urgent matters.

293
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,960
How do I have time

294
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
to ask others about such trivial stuff?

295
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,790
Go to bed.

296
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,030
Mr. Gu.

297
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,390
Hu,

298
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,080
hurry.

299
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,600
Mrs. Su,

300
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,100
I've got Su's body

301
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,120
back

302
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,160
and buried it.

303
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,450
Don't worry.

304
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,970
When spring comes,

305
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,020
I'll have his grave fixed,

306
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,560
and hire a stonemason

307
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,600
to carve a proper stele for him.

308
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,560
Thank you for your kindness.

309
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
Mr. Gu,

310
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,850
Commander Xu promised me

311
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,810
that if I told the truth,

312
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,440
he would give my son

313
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,000
a job as a soldier,

314
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,870
and buy me a house in the city.

315
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,210
Did you agree to it?

316
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,350
If a tiger told you

317
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,410
it'd only eat your arms

318
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,440
and leave your legs intact,

319
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,590
would you believe it?

320
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,570
Commander Xu wishes

321
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,120
he could eat us

322
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,440
alive.

323
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
You're insightful, Mrs. Su.

324
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
He has set a deadline.

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,690
How many days till that?

326
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,440
Three.

327
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,630
I'll get you out as soon as possible.

328
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,930
You must hang in there.

329
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,600
Mr. Gu,

330
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm begging you—just this once.

331
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,620
Please take my child with you.

332
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,480
-I'm begging you. Please.
-Mom!

333
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,790
Please!

334
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,660
Please!

335
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm not going anywhere.

336
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,150
Quiet down.

337
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,050
I just want to stay by your side!

338
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,840
I just want to stay by your side!

339
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm begging you.

340
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,320
I'll kowtow to you, Mr. Gu!

341
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,120
I only...

342
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,320
I only ask for this one thing—

343
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,790
please take my child with you.

344
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Mr. Chang!

345
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,900
Mr. Gu,

346
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,720
thank heavens you're finally here.

347
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,380
Come, come.

348
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,130
Please come in!

349
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,510
Were you exiled to Ningguta

350
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,640
because you were a notorious bandit

351
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,750
or because you were
a scholar who rebelled?

352
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,920
Stop talking nonsense.

353
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,579
Pour the tea and step outside.

354
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,160
Mr. Gu.

355
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,960
Mr. Chang, how much
did you offer Commander Xu

356
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
as a "gate gift"
when you visited him last time?

357
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,310
Since I was desperate to get home,

358
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,680
I offered him 400 taels.

359
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,510
But Commander Xu insisted

360
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,070
Shanxi is the wealthiest province
under heaven,

361
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,110
and that amount just wouldn't cut it.

362
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,110
The more you give,
the worse it gets.

363
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,110
It'll only make him think
you're drowning in silver.

364
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,370
Just tell me straight.

365
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,000
If you're willing to help,

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
how much will it take?

367
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,150
Sorry for the bluntness.

368
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,540
How about this?

369
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,880
In 3 days,

370
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,490
I'll have

371
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,000
the salt license
stamped with the city's defense seal

372
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
delivered to you.

373
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,680
As for the money,

374
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,030
it's no use to me here

375
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,160
in Ningguta anyway.

376
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,390
But I do have one matter

377
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,900
that I need your help with.

378
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,130
I'll tell you about it in a few days.

379
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,390
Mr. Gu,

380
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,730
if you can help me

381
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,290
through this rough patch,

382
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,960
then

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,550
whatever you ask of me in the future,

384
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,410
I'll give it everything I've got.

385
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Gu.

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,720
What is it?

387
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,380
Does Mr. Chang still have instructions
to give?

388
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,800
He has nothing more to say,

389
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,050
but I'd like

390
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,950
to ask you something—if that's alright?

391
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,480
Go ahead.

392
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
How long have you been exiled?

393
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,360
This coming New Year

394
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,080
will make it five full years.

395
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
I've heard this place

396
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,660
is full of outlaws and rebels,

397
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,720
but you don't really seem like one.

398
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
I am an outlaw and a rebel.

399
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
I killed many people in the past.

400
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,720
Wherever I went,

401
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,680
nothing was left alive.

402
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,050
I didn't just kill them,

403
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,940
I tore out their sinews

404
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,010
and drank their blood.

405
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,730
You must be lying.

406
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,350
You look like a scholar.

407
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,720
If I were a thief or a rebel,

408
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,550
it would be better.

409
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,350
Just kill me

410
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,480
so I don't have to

411
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,140
be stuck here
in this useless, miserable state.

412
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,110
A scholar is good for nothing.

413
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,000
If possible,

414
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,290
never come to this dreadful place again.

415
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,110
You think I'm afraid?

416
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,440
I went with my father to deliver medicinal
herbs to the western Mongolia.

417
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
It was spring when we got there.

418
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,350
Wolves were everywhere.

419
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,550
We had to light torches

420
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,550
and circle ourselves with fire to sleep,

421
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,680
but I wasn't afraid.

422
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,720
Sure, wolves were vicious,

423
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,110
but still better than
most people by a long shot.

424
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,910
The cruelest thing under the sky

425
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,650
is the human heart.

426
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,210
Young though you are,

427
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,090
you talk like some old man.

428
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,030
Do I?

429
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,400
What crime did you commit
to end up here?

430
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,350
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

431
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,550
It's fine to tell you.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,550
Back when I took the imperial exam...

433
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,610
You mean the exam for the top scholar?

434
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,590
Yes,

435
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,310
the exam for the top scholar.

436
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,590
Back when I took the imperial exam,

437
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,160
someone outside the hall
suddenly called my name,

438
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,030
saying my mother
was seriously ill at home.

439
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,110
How could I possibly concentrate

440
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,240
after hearing that?

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
I turned in my paper in a rush,

442
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
ready to leave,

443
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
but there were strict rules
in the examination hall.

444
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
I got into an argument with the officials.

445
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,240
They

446
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,000
accused me of disrupting the exam hall,

447
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,750
arrested me,

448
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,260
and exiled me here.

449
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,640
So

450
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,430
you were framed?

451
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,650
I even asked around afterward.

452
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,810
My mother was perfectly fine in Anhui.

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,110
It's obvious that someone

454
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,240
set me up during the examination hall.

455
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,920
These past five years,

456
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,310
I've thought about it day and night,

457
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,240
but I still haven't figured it out.

458
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,140
You're a good man.

459
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,790
May heaven bless you.

460
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,920
You'll get to the bottom of this.

461
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
You won't stay wrongly accused

462
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,310
your whole life without answers.

463
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,960
Girl,

464
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,440
where did you run off to?

465
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,410
I'm coming!

466
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,440
Let me ask you again:

467
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,730
you must've suffered a lot

468
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
these five years, right?

469
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,330
Compared to others, I've had it okay.

470
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,270
That first year,

471
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,160
I worked in the salt fields by the sea—

472
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,370
almost went blind.

473
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,680
Later, I met someone who knew medicine

474
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,920
and helped nurse me back

475
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,960
to health.

476
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,010
Is there anything else

477
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,270
you want to ask?

478
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,590
I...

479
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,810
I... I have no more questions.

480
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,090
My father was right.

481
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,710
I'm terrible with words.

482
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Whatever I say seems to hit a nerve.

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Please don't be angry.

484
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,310
I...

485
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,440
When will you be back
in the Central Plains?

486
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,700
Come find us in Shanxi.

487
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,160
[Military Horse Camp, Ningguta]

488
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,880
These Russians

489
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,280
really know how to make weapons.

490
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,370
If we could bring them over
to the Great Qing

491
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,170
to build guns and cannons for us,

492
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
we'd make a fortune.

493
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,400
The southern war is intense right now.

494
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,350
It's hard enough to buy weapons,

495
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,730
let alone manufacture them.

496
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,950
After all,

497
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,030
your Li family are still merchants.

498
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,420
You're not afraid to follow the rebels?

499
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,510
Of course I'm scared.

500
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
Good thing my dad told me

501
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,830
who you were before I came.

502
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,960
Otherwise, I'd never have guessed

503
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,310
someone as stunning as you

504
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,040
would be part of the rebellion.

505
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,490
There's another thing I'm puzzled about.

506
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,640
My father's the type

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,550
who'd panic

508
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,990
if a leaf fell on his head.

509
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,240
How on earth did he end up
knowing someone like Ms. Su?

510
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,380
That's because

511
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,350
your family's business network

512
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,510
spans the entire Yangtze River,
from north to south,

513
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,240
all thanks to me protecting it.

514
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,270
Maybe your family does business

515
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,800
south of the Yangtze River,

516
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,560
but you think he's timid?

517
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,220
When it comes to money,

518
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,570
even the most cautious merchants
grow bolder than the sky.

519
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,960
I

520
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,860
Your friend should be here by now.

521
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,440
Is Ms. Su here?

522
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,030
Gu!

523
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,920
Come in!

524
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,330
Come in, come in.

525
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,770
Have a seat.

526
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Do you have a plan?

527
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,400
I do have a plan.

528
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,940
However,

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,930
we need to settle something first.

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,030
Go ahead.

531
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,610
I'll naturally agree to what I can.

532
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,320
Getting out of Ningguta might be possible,

533
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,450
but after leaving the city,

534
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,550
what's your plan for getting away?

535
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,810
I naturally have a way.

536
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,240
That won't do.

537
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,440
You need to point me

538
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,550
to a reliable path.

539
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,070
With these 300 warhorses of yours,

540
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,150
it won't be easy

541
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
to get past any checkpoint
once we leave the city.

542
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,790
Besides,

543
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm still carrying a child with me.

544
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,110
I can't just recklessly

545
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,400
risk my life, can I?

546
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,400
Gu,

547
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,120
I think you're just afraid.

548
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
I risked my life to come to Ningguta.

549
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,640
I'm not afraid of death.

550
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
It's just that

551
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,680
I still have an elderly mother
and brothers at home.

552
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,340
I can't drag them into trouble

553
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
because of my association with you.

554
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,710
You need to make me trust you.

555
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,550
Give it to him.

556
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
The defender of Liaoyang Fortress

557
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,070
are ours.

558
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,550
He has already prepared

559
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,080
the official passes for us.

560
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,550
We will pass through
Shanhai Pass, enter Zhili,

561
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,750
proceed to Shandong,

562
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,220
and then take a ship back to the south.

563
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,310
Good.

564
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,070
That's fine then.

565
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,480
Mr. Gu, it would be much better for you

566
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,740
to return south with me

567
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,880
than to stay in the Central Plains.

568
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,280
I won't be...

569
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
Rebel?

570
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,070
Is the word that scary?

571
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,170
You'd rather stay here as a servant

572
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,880
than serve me.

573
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,270
Everyone has their own ambitions.

574
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,980
Gu,

575
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,390
you're now an exile.

576
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,080
Who would dare take you in

577
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,600
or offer you protection?

578
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
You want to study for the imperial exams,
but you're ineligible.

579
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,270
You want to go into business,

580
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,570
but you don't even
have a registered household.

581
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,830
Do you dare go home in your current state?

582
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Though heaven and earth are vast,

583
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,820
there's no place for you to stand.

584
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,260
If you're being honest with yourself,

585
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,200
is it worth

586
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,140
living in the Central Plains

587
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,130
like a fugitive, constantly in fear?

588
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,350
To be honest,

589
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,210
my elderly mother is weak and ill.

590
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,200
If I stay here any longer,

591
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,070
I may never get the chance

592
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,400
to see her one last time.

593
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,750
I was humiliated at
the examination hall back then.

594
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,480
My grievance

595
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,320
must also be investigated.

596
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,960
How can a real man grow old here in vain?

597
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,450
If Ms. Su can help this time,

598
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,110
I, Gu Pingyuan,

599
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,200
will certainly repay you
with eternal gratitude.

600
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,310
Alright.

601
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
I'll hold you to that, Mr. Gu.

602
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,110
A small gift for our meeting.

603
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,570
Keep it for self-defense.

604
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,070
Li Qin,

605
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,440
you're not married yet, are you?

606
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,440
Of course not.

607
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,830
That's good then.

608
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,670
The girls in our Ningguta

609
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,360
are quite something.

610
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,830
It would be a pity

611
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,310
if you didn't find a wife.

612
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,040
What nonsense are you talking?

613
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,300
What a brilliant plan!

614
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,450
-Come on.
-Great!

615
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,430
Follow me into the city,

616
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,790
and I'll pick the best one for you.

617
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,240
Wait,

618
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,810
why does it have to be me?

619
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,110
Who else could carry

620
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,200
such a grand spectacle but you,

621
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,150
Young Master Li Qin
of the Five Provinces Association?

622
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,760
Wait,

623
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,170
does it really have to be me?

624
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,510
Ladies!

625
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,200
Ladies, come quickly!

626
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,400
Consort Yang, Xishi, Little Zhaojun!

627
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,720
Come quickly!

628
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,270
They're coming!

629
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,590
Coming, coming!

630
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,310
He's so handsome!

631
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
He's so handsome!

632
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,740
He's so handsome!

633
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,880
Ladies, please calm down.

634
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,610
Listen to me,

635
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,310
this is

636
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,330
Young Master Li Qin,

637
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,660
the heir of the Five Provinces Association
in the capital.

638
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,400
Last night, he had a dream

639
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
and insisted on choosing one of you

640
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,110
to be his wife,

641
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,310
and even wants to
take her back to the capital

642
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,710
to be the young mistress.

643
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,400
Pick me!

644
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,560
Calm down!

645
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,620
Calm down! Well...

646
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,270
And me!

647
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,240
Pick me!

648
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,720
I, I, I... pick...

649
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,830
Pick me!

650
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,140
Pick me!

651
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,880
Choose me! He's chosen!

652
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,400
Great, this early in the morning,

653
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,960
a good man is rushing in.

654
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
You really have no taste!

655
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,150
Why didn't you choose me?

656
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Just go away.

657
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,460
Go.

658
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,550
Go!

659
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Miss, could you please get down first?

660
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,930
I won't get down.

661
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,960
Zhaojun,

662
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,130
why don't you go back

663
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,430
and freshen up?

664
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,880
I'll be taking you
to the capital tomorrow.

665
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm not getting down.

666
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,170
I...

667
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,920
That's more like it.

668
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,260
Let me tell you,

669
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,510
you're really lucky.

670
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,610
When I leave,

671
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,510
half the men in Ningguta

672
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,510
will be

673
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,680
crying their eyes out.

674
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,410
I suppose so.

675
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,520
Mr. Li,

676
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll go prepare the bridal chamber.

677
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Excuse me.

678
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,110
See you later.

679
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,030
I'll return the contract
of indenture to her.

680
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,560
Goodbye.

681
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,500
Thank you both.

682
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
Please get up.

683
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,540
I might as well die.

684
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,360
Ah, a paradise of tenderness.

685
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
It seems you're reluctant to leave.

686
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,640
Get lost!

687
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
[Happiness]

688
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,830
Congratulations!

689
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,310
Here comes the bride!

690
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Here comes the bride!

691
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,350
The bride is here!

692
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,600
Congratulations!

693
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,480
Let the newlyweds
enter the bridal chamber.

694
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,920
Enter the chamber.

695
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,880
Good!

696
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,720
-Come.
-Please.

697
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,330
Congratulations!

698
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,750
Congratulations!

699
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
Let me tell you some news.

700
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,960
The young master of the
Five Provinces Association in the capital

701
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,760
is getting married in a brothel.

702
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,350
And half the city's people

703
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,480
are going to join in the fun.

704
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,340
Anyone who goes

705
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,730
gets silver as a reward.

706
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
It's a banquet

707
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,160
with four plates and eight bowls,

708
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,360
all-you-can-drink.

709
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,480
I just came back.

710
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,010
I'm going in now

711
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,830
to have a drink with him.

712
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,660
You know,

713
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
he lies down when he drinks too much.

714
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
So, do you need...

715
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,920
Sir.

716
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
I think you're tired of

717
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,680
your own life.

718
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,690
No need to wait until next spring.

719
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,510
I'll throw you into
the mountains right now

720
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,510
to feed the bears.

721
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,260
Please calm down, Sir.

722
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
Why are you so angry?

723
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,350
I assigned you two tasks.

724
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,750
Have you completed them?

725
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,090
Speak.

726
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,190
Sir,

727
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,520
I've completed

728
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
the two tasks you assigned me.

729
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Where's the money?

730
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I've spoken with the mother and son.

731
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,830
They said

732
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,730
They said you're very merciful

733
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,000
for asking only 50,000 taels.

734
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,070
They even said that

735
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,160
if they could be
returned to the Central Plains,

736
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,390
they'd be willing to

737
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,280
dutifully hand over 10,000.

738
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,170
Did you promise

739
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,460
to actually set them free?

740
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,070
How many years remain

741
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,400
on your sentence?

742
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,780
Ten more years.

743
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,760
Get me the silver notes,

744
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,250
and I'll reduce it by five.

745
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,880
Really?

746
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,480
You'll send me back to the Central Plains,

747
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,140
just like that mother and son?

748
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,270
You'll return alive.

749
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440
I understand.

750
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,160
Sir,

751
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,910
please enjoy your drink.

752
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,930
Before you finish this pot of wine,

753
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,070
I'll bring you the silver notes.

754
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,750
He trusts you.

755
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,050
You must accept the child's respect.

756
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,580
Every last one of us in Ningguta

757
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,270
is greedy.

758
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,090
We covet wealth,

759
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,960
but more than that, we covet life itself.

760
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,270
Every one of us
dreams of escaping this place.

761
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,830
It's pathetic, and laughable.

762
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,400
Gu,

763
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,060
what about you?

764
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,260
How did you end up here?

765
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,160
Do you want to go back?

766
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,410
[Happiness]

767
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,250
Move again and I'll shoot you dead.

768
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,440
I'm determined to save them.

769
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,620
Xu,

770
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,510
I've been patient for five years

771
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,560
just for this day.

772
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,420
I was framed in the imperial examination.

773
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,990
I must find out the truth.

774
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,080
What's wrong?

775
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,360
Are you going to cry?

776
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,190
Do you have something to say?

777
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,640
Alright,

778
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,050
don't shout.

779
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,030
My life is worthless.

780
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,690
At worst, we'll die together.

781
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,190
Gu,

782
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,960
let them go.

783
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
I don't want the money anymore.

784
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,710
You've made more than
enough over the years.

785
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,850
You've driven so many people
to their deaths.

786
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,630
If you're planning to settle scores

787
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,090
over what happened today,

788
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,680
come after me alone.

789
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,620
Remember that?

790
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,150
Gu,

791
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,560
fine.

792
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,630
In over 200 years in Ningguta,

793
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,150
I've never seen a convict
dare to tie up an official.

794
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,370
You won't escape.

795
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,410
The next time we meet,

796
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,990
I'll skin you alive!

797
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,460
Come on.

798
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,440
Heizi,

799
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,840
tell the others to hurry up!

800
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,400
Hurry up!

801
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,010
Hurry up!

802
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,680
Hurry up!

803
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,410
Hurry up!

804
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,480
Here, there's one more package.

805
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,960
Father,

806
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:09,630
[Ningyuan Salt Merchant]

807
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,090
I've checked all the salt.

808
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,760
Good.

809
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,370
Alright.

810
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,130
Get ready to go home.

811
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Tie it up; we're going home!

812
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,480
Mount up.

813
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,220
Hurry up!

814
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,890
[A Tranquil Nation, A Contented People.]

815
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Congratulations on your marriage.

816
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,160
Congratulations.

817
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,670
You said you'd only take two people.

818
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,360
I have to take both the mother and child.

819
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,420
Whoever stays behind won't survive.

820
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,130
[Ningguta]

821
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,760
Someone!

822
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,290
Someone!

823
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,440
Someone!

824
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,650
I'm going to kill him!

825
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,280
I'll chop him into pieces!

826
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm going to kill him!

827
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,800
Kill him!

828
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,600
From here,

829
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
if you keep going,

830
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,090
you'll reach Liaoyang.

831
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
This is where we part.

832
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,820
You're not coming with us?

833
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,670
Yesterday I gave that bastard Xu

834
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,630
a real beating;

835
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,690
he's not going to let it slide.

836
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,430
If we stick together,

837
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,550
none of us will make it out in the end.

838
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,070
Gu.

839
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,070
Mr. Li.

840
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,050
If we manage to

841
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,920
survive this by some stroke of luck,

842
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,850
I'll see you in the Central Plains.

843
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,320
Mr. Li.

844
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,480
I'll leave

845
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,280
Mrs. Su and her child in your care.

846
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,010
Don't worry.

847
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,010
I've arranged everything.

848
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,320
I'll place the mother and child

849
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
in a pharmacy in the capital.

850
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,590
I'll buy them identities

851
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,520
and let the child be an apprentice.

852
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
The Li family has tens of
thousands of workers

853
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,630
across the north and south.

854
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,760
What's two more people to worry about?

855
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,790
Gu,

856
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,720
I promise you.

857
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,010
Don't go.

858
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,510
Say something, will you?

859
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,370
If Commander Xu catches up,

860
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,630
you can protect him.

861
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,900
If he goes off on his own now,
he'll be killed.

862
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,730
A debt repaid is a debt cleared.

863
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,440
I'm taking these two with me—

864
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,770
that settles what I owe.

865
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,920
If you want to protect him,

866
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,580
then come with me to the South.

867
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,330
I'll be on my way.

868
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,880
Ms. Su.

869
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,310
Mr. Gu, wait a moment.

870
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,880
When I first arrived in Ningguta,

871
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,410
I couldn't help but wonder—

872
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,920
how could so many exiled prisoners

873
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
be living out in the open

874
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,650
with no one watching over them?

875
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,670
Later, I figured it out.

876
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,710
For hundreds of miles around,

877
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,280
there's not a sign of human habitation.

878
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,680
There's no way to escape.

879
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,380
Where else could you possibly run to?

880
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,930
Let fate decide.

881
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,400
But if you agree to come South with me,

882
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,460
I have a way to keep you safe and sound.

883
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,800
If I stay in Ningguta,

884
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,530
I still have a chance to go back.

885
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,190
But if I become a rebel,

886
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,550
then there's really no chance

887
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,280
at all.

888
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,130
Ms. Su, I appreciate

889
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,040
the kindness, truly.

890
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,180
Our debt is settled.

891
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,050
Report!

892
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,080
General,

893
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,630
General, someone saw that Gu.

894
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,070
He ran towards Shuangjia Mountain.

895
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,200
Still trying to run?

896
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,110
He's just a scholar; he won't get far.

897
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,550
Everyone pick up the pace!

898
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,890
I'm going to grind that bastard

899
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,070
into the dirt.

900
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,990
Search carefully!

901
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,290
How far can he run with an arrow in him?

902
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,520
Keep searching!

903
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,230
Everyone search carefully!

904
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,250
There's blood.

905
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,430
Nobody move!
