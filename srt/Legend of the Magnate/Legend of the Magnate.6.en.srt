00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,950
[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,960
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,990
Your Highness.

4
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,039
The Junior Khan
of western Mongolia is here.

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,080
Let him in.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,150
[The Junior Khan of western Mongolia]

7
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,010
Your Highness.

8
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,350
My Lady.

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,650
You used guns

10
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
to kill so many of my brothers.

11
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,230
How dare you still come here?

12
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,870
Your Highness.

13
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,620
You are the master of Horqin land.

14
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,870
My father

15
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,650
owns half of the grasslands
in western Mongolia.

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,220
He sent me to talk with you,

17
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,230
hoping we can resolve this issue

18
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,890
without bloodshed.

19
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,880
What do you want?

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,030
The Qing emperor is finished.

21
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,430
They can barely help themselves.

22
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,960
This is a good opportunity.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Someone is willing to help us

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,120
break away from the Qing Empire.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,190
When we marched, my father said

26
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,560
if you agree, Your Highness,

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,360
we will cease fire immediately.

28
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,140
In the days of Genghis Khan,

29
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,460
brothers never

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,350
spilled each other's blood.

31
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,790
Nor did they conspire with outsiders

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,290
to attack their own kin.

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,320
Back then, at the meeting at Dolon Nor,

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,660
your father and I

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,860
swore an oath to the Eternal Heaven

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,540
that those within and beyond the pass

37
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,810
would be as one family

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,140
and never betray the imperial court.

39
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,930
I…

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,200
will not go with you!

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,530
Uncle Jelme.

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,100
How about this?

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,590
I will give you

44
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,710
half of my guns.

45
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,970
We march west together

46
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,790
to seize more grasslands

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,350
and reclaim all the tribes there.

48
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,209
It is a good deal.

49
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,250
I want nothing from you.

50
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,560
I won't kill you.

51
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,730
Leave now!

52
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,430
Your Highness.

53
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,100
It seems...

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,159
you truly know nothing

55
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,370
about guns.

56
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,680
Guns

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
come in all sizes.

58
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,830
When I came in just now,

59
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,890
your men searched me

60
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,710
thoroughly.

61
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,720
But they have

62
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,750
never seen a real gun.

63
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,610
Your Highness.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,950
Is this your idea of benevolence?

65
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,730
I hope

66
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,910
you will be wise.

67
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,120
Your Highness,

68
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,690
don't agree to his terms.

69
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,620
Don't be afraid.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,350
Of course.

71
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,750
If I agreed,

72
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,730
even the lambs on the grasslands

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,890
would curse my name.

74
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,630
If I agreed,

75
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,030
the Eternal Heaven

76
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,080
would reject my soul!

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,770
Shoot!

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,270
Your Highness.

79
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,400
What's so great about the Qing Empire?

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
If you remain this stubborn,

81
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,040
don't blame me for what happens next.

82
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,730
You two could die here today,

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,010
and no one would know.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,659
Someone knows.

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,690
Good girl.

86
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,710
Kill him!

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,940
Little girl,

88
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,390
this knife

89
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,800
is fine for cutting cheese.

90
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
But if you can't kill me with one cut,

91
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,210
you'll be the one who suffers.

92
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,310
Listen to me.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,430
In the pocket of my leather coat,

94
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,030
there is a pouch of fine gems.

95
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,140
I swear to the Eternal Heaven,

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
every one of them is worth a fortune.

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,590
Take them.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Leave this place.

99
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,930
Whatever happens here

100
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,560
has nothing to do with you.

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,220
Bastard!

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,659
Your Highness.

103
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,600
Eat up. Go on.

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,730
It tastes great.

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,280
You think you deserve to eat?

106
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,820
Heizi.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,920
Sing us a song to kill the boredom.

108
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,870
Alright!

109
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,160
Eat up.

110
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,870
Eat up.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,060
The red sun lights up the dam.

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,190
Wind and sand lift the red bridal veil.

113
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,050
I'd feed the dog before I feed you!

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,350
My girl sways in the sedan chair.

115
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,360
Here, eat.

116
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,120
I raise my head from below the chair.

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,800
Take a bite.

118
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,480
-I mean it this time.
-Wine scent fills the room as I look back.

119
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,409
-The wind blows the candle out again.
-You want meat?

120
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,390
Do you even have any meat?

121
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,120
When I see my girl,

122
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,630
I just wave my hand.

123
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,100
Send it out.

124
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,450
Look at your hand.

125
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
Lower it down.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,050
Turn around.

127
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,250
Yes, just like that.

128
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,050
Press down lower.

129
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,240
Look at it.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,470
Be graceful.

131
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,270
Good.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,130
Walk.

133
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,840
Thank you.

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,550
Thank you for saving me, madam.

135
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,790
I need to go to Horqin,

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,570
where the battle is.

137
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,700
You're already there.

138
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,280
This girl

139
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,200
is my daughter now.

140
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,570
Do you want to marry her?

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
His Highness said

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
we'll withdraw our troops today

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,370
and hold the wedding ceremony.

144
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,270
I...

145
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,900
Just heal up nicely.

146
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,150
Watch your neck.

147
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,550
What is going on here?

148
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,050
His Highness is back!

149
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,360
His Highness…

150
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,200
His Highness is back!

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,550
His Highness is back!

152
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
His Highness is back!

153
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,520
His Highness is back!

154
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,590
His Highness is back!

155
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,840
His Highness is back!

156
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,720
His Highness is back!

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,620
His Highness is back!

158
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,440
His Highness is back!

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
His Highness is back!

160
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,910
The princess
and her consort have returned.

161
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,620
Which one of you is Mr. Chang?

162
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,330
What are you saying?

163
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,120
The princess
and her consort have returned.

164
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
Which one of you is Mr. Chang?

165
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,530
At one year old, it is tethered.

166
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,260
At two years old, it gallops freely.

167
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,080
In a gathering as vast as the sea,

168
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,780
it takes first place time and again.

169
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,710
It comes from a fertile homeland.

170
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,390
It drinks from the western springs.

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,170
The herd rushes like white waves.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,890
Mares give birth to new foals.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Mr. Chang.

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,290
Stop staring. Drink up.

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Mr. Gu,

176
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,900
how did my daughter

177
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,580
become a princess?

178
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,080
What on earth happened?

179
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,750
Don't ask me.

180
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm confused too.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,210
It drinks from the western springs.

182
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,000
The herd rushes like white waves.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,780
Mares give birth to new foals.

184
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,580
At one year old, it is tethered.

185
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,600
At two years old, it gallops freely.

186
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
It takes first place time and again.

187
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,320
This time,

188
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,670
the enemy retreated without a fight.

189
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,360
We're drinking this cup

190
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,980
not because we won.

191
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,740
From Ujimqin to the Great Wall,

192
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
we are all one family.

193
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
Fighting between brothers

194
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,880
is nothing serious.

195
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,000
But now,

196
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,670
some people have charged in with guns.

197
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,880
The grasslands will no longer be peaceful.

198
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,510
The world is falling into chaos.

199
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,910
I have resolved

200
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,600
never to bow to the enemy.

201
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
If you stand with me,

202
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,370
drink this wine!

203
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
Cheers!

204
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,580
From this day on, the Horqin tribe

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,790
has a new princess.

206
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,550
Princess!

207
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,960
Princess!

208
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,080
Princess! Princess!

209
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,840
You have all seen the princess.

210
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,480
But you haven't met her consort.

211
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,050
I'll have him come out

212
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,930
to drink with everyone.

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,340
Yes! Yes!

214
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,630
Consort!

215
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,410
Consort!

216
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,200
Consort!

217
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,870
Consort!

218
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,290
Consort!

219
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,870
Consort!

220
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,100
Your Highness.

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,500
The princess's consort

222
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,080
has brought us

223
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,540
the medicine we desperately needed.

224
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,700
That bastard Hanlong

225
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,680
nearly ruined everything.

226
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,870
This young man here
has done a great service.

227
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,550
So I am happy

228
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,410
to marry the princess to him.

229
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,000
Consort.

230
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
What reward do you desire?

231
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,480
Land?

232
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,110
Herdsmen?

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,720
Or to be a great general

234
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,080
and lead troops into battle?

235
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,010
Your Highness.

236
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,120
I have a request.

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,390
Those captured with me,

238
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,920
the herdsmen and captives—

239
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
they are Mongols too.

240
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,930
I heard that after capture,

241
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,210
they'll be made slaves

242
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,330
and live worse than livestock.

243
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,470
I want to ask you to give the order

244
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,040
to set them all free.

245
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
Then,

246
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,360
I gift them all to you as slaves.

247
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,360
-Great!
-Great!

248
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,600
Slaves!

249
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,150
Slaves!

250
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,250
I have been a slave myself.

251
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,240
I know the feeling.

252
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
It is unbearable.

253
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,030
So I do not want anyone

254
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,900
to be my slave.

255
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,970
What I mean is...

256
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,090
Please, Your Highness,
give them their freedom.

257
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,650
Are you

258
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,970
trying to change my rules?

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
As you said yourself,

260
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,040
the world is in chaos.

261
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,800
There is no peace anywhere.

262
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,120
Why can't those old rules

263
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,080
be changed?

264
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,930
If Your Highness can

265
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,120
show kindness
to the herdsmen from other tribes,

266
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,920
in the future,

267
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,000
when resisting foreign enemies,

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,550
you may find more allies.

269
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,880
Please consider it carefully.

270
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,960
Without captives as slaves,

271
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,050
how shall I reward those

272
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,810
who distinguish themselves?

273
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,930
Who do you think you are

274
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
to dare break my rules?

275
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,470
Open the door!

276
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,710
By order of the Horqin Consort,

277
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,630
all prisoners shall be released!

278
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,480
Those with homes may return.

279
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,960
Those with nowhere to go

280
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
may stay in the tribe.

281
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
You will be given weapons,

282
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,300
cattle, sheep,

283
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,120
and tents.

284
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,110
You may go.

285
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,590
Everyone says

286
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,050
my consort

287
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,000
is as merciful as a god.

288
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,080
He released so many

289
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,200
captives and slaves.

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,000
You really should go out and see.

291
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,080
However,

292
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,120
I never expected you to say that

293
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,160
back there.

294
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,790
Even Her Highness said

295
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,630
it's the first time she's seen

296
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,720
someone contradict His Highness like that.

297
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,030
You're really something.

298
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,450
I just spoke my mind.

299
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,270
So what?

300
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,430
Worst case, he'd chop off my head

301
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,609
and find you a new consort.

302
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Who wants that?

303
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,680
His Highness said

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,920
if you stay here,

305
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,750
he will keep you safe.

306
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,920
I...

307
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,589
I can stay too.

308
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,170
If not for you, Chang Yu'er,

309
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,530
I'd be dead ten times over.

310
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,150
If I were a free man,

311
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,630
I'd stay here on the grasslands.

312
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,640
Riding horses and herding sheep

313
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
every day.

314
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,610
That would be nice.

315
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,000
But I'm not.

316
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,030
What's the big deal?

317
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,830
First time seeing you like this.

318
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,630
You're not even afraid of death,

319
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
yet you're beating around the bush.

320
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,140
It's just exile, isn't it?

321
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,110
The imperial court hasn't caught you.

322
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,480
Let's say...

323
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,550
Let's say...

324
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
I caught you.

325
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,590
You, the princess,

326
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,770
are a real princess.

327
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,200
But I, the consort,

328
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,750
am a fake.

329
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,970
I am engaged back home.

330
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,750
You…

331
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,680
You never mentioned that.

332
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,570
Before,

333
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,320
I told you about my father.

334
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,790
We were very poor then.

335
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Couldn't afford school.

336
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,750
The village schoolteacher,

337
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,800
Mr. Bai,

338
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,790
took pity on me

339
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,440
and taught me to read for free.

340
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,960
He had a daughter

341
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,000
named Bai Yimei.

342
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,030
Before I went to the capital for exams,

343
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,690
we exchanged betrothal gifts

344
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,580
and were officially engaged.

345
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,480
I planned that after the exams,

346
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,320
I'd go back and marry her.

347
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,200
So...

348
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,240
so where is she now?

349
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,790
Now?

350
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,760
I don't know.

351
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,520
I have no idea.

352
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,840
Anyway,

353
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,400
I think

354
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,020
since we have

355
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,070
faced death together,

356
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,480
I owe you the truth.

357
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,130
I am an exile,

358
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,270
and I am engaged.

359
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,370
I'm not worthy of you.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,960
I think...

361
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,580
I've really had too much to drink.

362
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,750
Wearing this outfit...

363
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,600
made me forget reality.

364
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,260
This whole thing
about the princess and her consort...

365
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,610
was just play-acting.

366
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,860
Your Highness.

367
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,400
Don't walk further.

368
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,420
Alright.

369
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Get up, sweetie.

370
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,130
Your Highness.

371
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,830
I am so fond of this girl.

372
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
You don't care for gold or jewels,

373
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,640
so I'm giving you this jade pendant.

374
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,960
If one day

375
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,350
you are in trouble,

376
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,520
send someone

377
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,060
to bring this pendant to me.

378
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,580
No matter how far,

379
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,630
Horqin warriors will come

380
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,970
to solve your problems.

381
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,380
Especially the problem next to you.

382
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,560
I can see that this guy

383
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,350
doesn't truly want to marry you.

384
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,330
I don't want him anyway.

385
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,380
You really won't stay?

386
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,080
No matter what mistake you made,

387
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
I'd protect you.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,930
Thank you for your great kindness.

389
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,190
But I miss my home dearly.

390
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,250
My elderly mother is there.

391
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,570
I cannot travel far.

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,330
The matter with Hanlong

393
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,930
has been taken care of.

394
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,070
You suffered a great injustice

395
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,670
during your visit this time.

396
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,270
Thank you, Your Highness.

397
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,150
Thank you for your hospitality.

398
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,720
We shall meet again.

399
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,240
Good.

400
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,720
Until we meet again.

401
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,160
Please.

402
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,350
Take care.

403
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,680
Take care, sweetie.

404
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,570
Take care, sweetie.

405
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,960
Let's depart.

406
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,510
[Li Wantang's Mansion in the capital]

407
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,160
Here are the land deeds

408
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,610
and the reserve funds.

409
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,800
Keep the silver cash on you.

410
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,900
You'll manage
the Pingyao draft bank yourself.

411
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,530
Don't worry about that.

412
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,840
The banking business

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,730
relies on financial strength.

414
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,400
Surely the Li family's wealth

415
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,750
can match theirs.

416
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,560
It'd be ridiculous otherwise.

417
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,090
You can't say that.

418
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,390
In business,

419
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,400
unity is the most important thing.

420
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,070
I hear the Shanxi merchants

421
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,330
are extremely united.

422
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,200
That's crucial.

423
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,030
Master.

424
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,540
There is something

425
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,530
I don't know if I should say.

426
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,600
Go ahead.

427
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,170
Some in the family say

428
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,830
investing so much

429
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,990
to open a draft bank in Shanxi

430
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,280
might not be worth the risk.

431
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,740
Is it written that

432
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,160
only Shanxi people

433
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,930
are allowed to run draft banks?

434
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,830
That is exactly what I told them.

435
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,750
I'm just worried that you are

436
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,880
getting too close to the southerners.

437
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,970
Is it too risky?

438
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,370
I have my plans.

439
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,210
Father.

440
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,040
I've packed everything.

441
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,790
Good.

442
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,900
Before you go,

443
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
I have a few words for you.

444
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm all ears.

445
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,000
This is our first time

446
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,640
entering the lion's den in Shanxi

447
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
to compete for our share.

448
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,960
Who knows how many people

449
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,420
are waiting to see us fail.

450
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
Do not be careless.

451
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,400
Yes. I certainly won't

452
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,040
disgrace the Li family name.

453
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,710
What name do we have?

454
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,120
Business is like war.

455
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,200
You just have to fight a few battles.

456
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,460
Don't be arrogant because of our wealth.

457
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,670
And don't secretly look down on others.

458
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,130
That's a land full of rich merchants.

459
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,710
Learn and ask questions
when you get there.

460
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,680
Sure.

461
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,700
Pawnshops and banks

462
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
run on a cycle of inflow and outflow.

463
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Money shouldn't flow too fast,

464
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,520
nor too slow.

465
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,830
The stakes involved...

466
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,160
Enough.

467
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,720
When you do it yourself there,

468
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,920
you will understand.

469
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,150
I'm telling you now.

470
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,400
You are the vanguard this time.

471
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,390
If you fail, I will step in.

472
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,890
But don't blame me then

473
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
if I show you no mercy.

474
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
Understood!

475
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,900
[Shanxi]

476
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,640
You have to leave after all.

477
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,450
I'm a fugitive.

478
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,370
I have no right to say such things.

479
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,620
Don't overthink it.

480
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Go back and take care of your father.

481
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,460
Will...

482
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,920
Will you...

483
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
w-will you come see me?

484
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,850
I mean...

485
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,280
after you marry Miss Bai.

486
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,480
I hope so.

487
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,270
I have an elderly mother

488
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,400
and a younger brother at home.

489
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,440
Often in my dreams,

490
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,300
I think of them.

491
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I've burdened them all these years.

492
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,030
If my family

493
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,660
suffers any more misfortune,

494
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't know if Heaven

495
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,600
will ever forgive me.

496
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
You haven't wronged anyone.

497
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,050
Take care.

498
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,720
Fugitive Gu Pingyuan!

499
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,110
Dismount and surrender!

500
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,680
Chang Si is to be arrested as well.

501
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,790
Harboring a fugitive

502
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,250
carries the same penalty!

503
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,980
Fugitive Gu Pingyuan!

504
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,400
Dismount and surrender!

505
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,920
Chang Si is to be arrested as well.

506
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,030
Harboring a fugitive

507
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,490
carries the same penalty!

508
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,590
Master,

509
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,480
the county magistrate is here.

510
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
Let me ask you something.

511
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,710
These pawnshop accounts...

512
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,200
How were they kept?

513
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,350
Who kept them?

514
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,880
They rushed to finish them
before the Spring Festival.

515
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,610
The head and second managers
have reviewed them.

516
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,270
So small?

517
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,550
So thin?

518
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,480
The pawnshop accounts
for the past five years

519
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,790
are getting increasingly simplified.

520
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,040
Do they

521
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,400
have no respect for me?

522
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,130
The two managers are getting old.

523
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,140
They lack energy.

524
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,720
Is it a lack of energy?

525
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,830
I think they just

526
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,160
don't respect me!

527
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,720
Isn't it just because

528
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,010
I have no son?

529
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,110
Because I have no heir?

530
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,070
[Magistrate of Pingyao]

531
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,660
[Auspicious Clouds]

532
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,000
I've been waiting for you for ages.

533
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,560
Your Worship, you're here.

534
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
Forgive me for not greeting you sooner.

535
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
What happened

536
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,960
with Chang Si caused quite a stir.

537
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,510
I can't suppress it anymore.

538
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,660
I can't explain it to my superiors.

539
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,690
Who do you need to explain it to?

540
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,880
The prefecture has its governor;
the circuit has its intendant.

541
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,570
A lowly seventh-rank official like me

542
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,440
has to report to them.

543
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,720
Besides,

544
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,190
the convict with Chang Si

545
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,080
is an exile

546
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,460
who escaped from Ningguta.

547
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,000
Handing him over

548
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,200
would earn us major credit.

549
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,640
They've even sent a guerrilla general

550
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
with troops to catch him.

551
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,630
You want me to cover this up now,

552
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,790
but I don't have that kind of power.

553
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,900
I can't do it.

554
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
You have to show me a way out.

555
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,550
I heard that convict

556
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,790
is quite capable.

557
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,020
When Chang Si went beyond the pass
to buy salt,

558
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,070
it was because of

559
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,440
his help

560
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,920
that the deal succeeded.

561
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,410
And on the Horqin Grasslands,

562
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,540
this guy helped him again.

563
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,570
Surrounded by troops,

564
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,490
he charged straight into
the prince's tent.

565
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,830
Interesting.

566
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,580
Very interesting.

567
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,680
Soon

568
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,890
it will be time

569
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,550
for officials' performance reviews.

570
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,840
I want to move up the ladder.

571
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,630
I need achievements.

572
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,630
We've been looking out
for each other these years.

573
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,680
Do me a favor

574
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,580
and give me this credit, will you?

575
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,660
I've been looking out for you.

576
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,400

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,700
Set up the flags.

768
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,690
Unload the silver carts.

769
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,880
We are setting up our shop

770
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,260
right here in Pingyao.

771
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

772
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,810
[Yixiu Shop]

773
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,880
Patriarch!

774
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,090
Where is the patriarch?

775
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,750
Wang Tiangui is holding him.

776
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,600
Wang Tiangui

777
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,470
wants me to work in his pawnshop.

778
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,760
Only if I do well

779
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,780
will he release Mr. Chang.

780
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,040
What do you mean?

781
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,380
Anyway, for now,

782
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,110
I'll sleep and eat at the pawnshop.

783
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,170
When you have time,

784
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,230
go look after him.

785
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
Did I say you could leave?

786
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,090
Gu Pingyuan.

787
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,760
Mr. Gu.

788
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,500
What about the patriarch?

789
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,590
You know

790
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,670
he is getting old.

791
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,360
He can't survive

792
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,090
the damp and cold of the prison.

793
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,320
The house...

794
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,700
w-we don't want it.

795
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,360
Okay?

796
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,190
We'll give all the money to Wang Tiangui.

797
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,050
Is that enough?

798
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,360
If money could solve this,

799
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,290
it would be easy.

800
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,360
Under the Law of the Qing Empire,

801
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,510
harboring an exile
shares the exile's guilt.

802
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,900
It's all your fault!

803
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,960
Heizi!

804
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,440
Heizi, what are you doing?

805
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,430
Let go!

806
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,320
Gu.

807
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,150
What do we do now?

808
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,310
We have to agree to his terms.

809
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,700
Within a month,

810
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,730
I must bring

811
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,400
the head and second managers
under control.

812
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,110
They are

813
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,210
wily old foxes.

814
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,790
How is a month enough?

815
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,430
Gu.
