00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,990
[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,930
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
Mr. Chang.

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,770
You've worked hard.

5
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,350
I had heard before coming

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,710
that the matters you handled
beyond the pass

7
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,770
went smoothly.

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,840
Please allow me to express my respects.

9
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
Thank you for asking.

10
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,920
Finally made it back before the New Year.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,729
Tonight,

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
I'll treat everyone.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,350
We have matters of great importance,

14
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,080
but no need to bring them up now.

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
The government offices are already closed.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,460
After the Lantern Festival,
I'll have Heizi

17
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,630
go to the draft bank
to settle the accounts.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,430
If you have anything else to ask,

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,940
go ahead and say it all.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,150
You're a respected senior.

22
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,000
If there's anything you need,
just give the word.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,730
I'll come to your residence anytime
to serve you.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,520
Old Chang.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,470
When are you going to return

26
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,520
the two acres of salt fields

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
you stole from my ancestors?

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
You old coffin stuffing,

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,590
I'm talking to you!

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,530
You mean
those two acres of salt fields

31
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,590
belong to your family?

32
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,210
Yeah!

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,630
They belong to my family,

34
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,590
to my ancestors,

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,770
to my forefathers!

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,190
They've been ours since the Ming Dynasty.

37
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,079
You stole them!

38
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,470
You robbed them!

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,290
Hey, what are you smirking at?

40
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm smirking because...

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,270
Buddy, you're so smart.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,150
So those two acres of salt fields
really belong to your family?

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,630
Do you think I, Li Laizi,

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,880
would lie about this?

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,380
So who did Mr. Chang buy

46
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,560
those two acres of salt fields from?

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,150
From the government, of course.

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,240
Well, in that case.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,470
even if they need to be returned,

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,910
Mr. Chang should return them
to the government,

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,030
and you should then claim them
from the government.

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,190
That's the proper way to handle it.

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,300
Since when

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,410
does this concern you?

55
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,890
Mind your own business!

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,630
Tell me.

57
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,970
If someone surnamed Zhu

58
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,840
suddenly appears,

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,730
claiming everything under heaven
belongs to his family,

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,800
would His Majesty give it to him

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,070
or not?

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,260
You keep

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,620
demanding your ancestral property
from the Ming Dynasty.

64
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,970
So enthusiastic about
the previous dynasty—

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,650
Mr. Chang,

66
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,370
I think this person

67
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,730
looks like a rebel.

68
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,850
W-Who are you calling a rebel?

69
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,110
You've got some nerve.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,050
You're trying to restore the old order

71
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,710
and overthrow the current one.

72
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Mr. Chang,

73
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,490
let's write a petition

74
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,140
and send it to the magistrate.

75
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,150
Let's make it an imperial case,

76
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,360
have him escorted to the capital

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,030
and flayed alive at Caishikou.

78
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,700
Wait.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Y-You're talking nonsense.

80
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,310
W-Why should I be flayed alive?

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
You dare to sue over goods

82
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,380
sold by the government,

83
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,570
claiming they were stolen or robbed
from you.

84
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,490
That equals calling

85
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,820
the government a thief.

86
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
Good heavens.

87
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,860
With that one remark,

88
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,560
you've insulted all the emperors
of the Qing Dynasty

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,610
since they entered the pass

90
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,100
and established their rule.

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,160
Who should be flayed alive if not you?

92
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,730
No, no.

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,540
T-There's something so serious

94
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,660
behind this?

95
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,270
Wang Tiangui is setting me up!

96
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,290
Don't talk nonsense.

97
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,970
What does this have to do

98
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,900
with our master?

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,430
Hey.

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,990
You had me do you a favor,

101
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,280
paid me a few lousy coins,

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,340
and nearly got me flayed alive for it.

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,370
You heartless lot!

104
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,560
J-Just you wait!

105
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,970
This isn't over!

106
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,070
And the magistrate

107
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,820
is backing this kind of rebel?

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,900
After the Lantern Festival,

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,890
I think it's best
to file a formal complaint

110
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,090
and get some answers.

111
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,810
Young man,

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,690
may I ask who you are?

113
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,160
He's my distant nephew.

114
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,430
On this trip beyond the pass,

115
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,620
he knew the way well,

116
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,240
so I brought him back with me.

117
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,190
From now on, he'll be

118
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,270
more involved in our family affairs.

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,880
Sir, you don't sound like

120
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,430
a local.

121
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,510
You have a bit of a Huaiyang accent.

122
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Yes.

123
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,730
I'm from Huizhou.

124
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,400
I wasn't any good at studying,

125
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,260
so I'm now learning business
from Mr. Chang.

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Please kindly offer your guidance.

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,190
Certainly.

128
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,540
With pleasure.

129
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,300
I came here today

130
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,990
specially for this agreement.

131
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,909
You should know

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,670
the rules of draft banks, Mr. Chang.

133
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,310
Money is like an iron threshold,

134
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,180
and people are like the filling in a bun.

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,210
Doesn't matter whether it's the New Year
or not—

136
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,250
when it's due,

137
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,710
it must be paid.

138
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,320
I just arrived,

139
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,950
and you're already here collecting debts.

140
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,630
Even the King of Hell

141
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,960
doesn't rush like this.

142
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,240
Heizi has already

143
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,310
settled the accounts today.

144
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,120
The silver ingots are sitting right there.

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Tell Wang Tiangui

146
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
to come get the money himself
with his cart.

147
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm off to have a drink

148
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,340
with my men.

149
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,950
Mr. Chang. Mr. Chang.

150
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,720
Mr. Chang!

151
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,670
Hold on a moment.

152
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,190
Mr. Chang.

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,450
Please take a good look.

154
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,160
[Borrowed 1,000 taels in full
under Wang Tiangui's name by agreement]

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,120
That money

156
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,630
is not enough.

157
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,020
How much short?

158
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,580
I'll run a couple extra loads
after the New Year to cover it.

159
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,090
[Loan Agreement]
[Borrower: Chang Si, Lender: Wang Tiangui]

160
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,620
Just charge interest on it.

161
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,950
Giving me trouble at a time like this,

162
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,370
do you think it's fun?

163
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:33,920
[Loan Agreement]
[Borrower: Chang Si, Lender: Wang Tiangui]

164
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,770
Mr. Chang.

165
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
I wouldn't dare cause you trouble.

166
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,159
Please look carefully.

167
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,510
This agreement states

168
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,030
it was established at
the magistrate office last October.

169
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,100
[5% interest, interest compounds,
repayment due within this year][Stated]

170
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,990
His Worship vouched for it himself.

171
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,270
The interest is 5%,

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,630
and it compounds.

173
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,560
Besides,

174
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,310
if it isn't repaid in full
within this year,

175
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,159
your house will be mortgaged to Master.

176
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,600
Even if it's short by the slightest bit,

177
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,830
it will still be considered unsettled.

178
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,700
[If not repaid in full within this year,
ancestral house mortgaged to Wang Tiangui]

179
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,430
Mr. Chang.

180
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,410
I'm only here to get your clear answer.

181
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,600
If you agree,

182
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll have someone come by tomorrow
to clear out your house for you.

183
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,980
Master

184
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,930
wants to spend the New Year here.

185
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,020
If you don't agree,

186
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,310
I'll leave right away.

187
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,750
Tomorrow, His Worship

188
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,950
will send people here to seal your door.

189
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,220
So,

190
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,110
what would you like me

191
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,220
to tell Master?

192
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,480
In this freezing weather

193
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,960
and during the New Year period,

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,310
where do you expect me to stay?

195
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,310
Out on the street?

196
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,770
Mr. Chang, well,

197
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,350
I can't think of any solution for you.

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,610
What's the rush?

199
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,820
It's not due yet.

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,990
What do you mean it isn't due?

201
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,480
It's stated right here,

202
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,230
"within this year."

203
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,430
It's only New Year's Eve tomorrow.

204
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,190
Any day before the first day
of the New Year

205
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,650
still counts as this year.

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
So what?

207
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,040
The shops are all boarded up

208
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,490
and the government offices are all sealed.

209
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,490
What, do you shit gold or piss silver

210
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,600
so you can just produce money
out of nowhere?

211
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,630
Do we have to throw you out
onto the street

212
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,750
on New Year's Eve?

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Is that what you want?

214
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,730
That's how the agreement was made.

215
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,450
It's written in black and white on paper.

216
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,990
Butler.

217
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,510
Just do as it says.

218
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,150
Please leave now.

219
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,750
You...

220
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,270
Fine.

221
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,190
Fine.

222
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,320
I'll give you one more day.

223
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,710
I'd like to see

224
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,880
how this money

225
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,050
will fall from the sky!

226
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,700
I'm so useless.

227
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,640
I fell into Wang Tiangui's trap.

228
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm such a fool.

229
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm probably the dumbest person

230
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
in this world.

231
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Mr. Chang,

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,370
now is not the time for self-blame.

233
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,770
Let's discuss what to do.

234
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,440
What's there to discuss?

235
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,310
Distant nephew my foot.

236
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
Chang Si's family

237
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,670
has always been small.

238
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,770
I've never heard of

239
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
any young members.

240
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,840
That Old Chang

241
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,180
was quick to explain.

242
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,450
It's obvious he was hiding something.

243
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,870
He said this youngster

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,620
knew the way beyond the pass,

245
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,270
and he's teaching him how to do business.

246
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,570
If you ask me, that person

247
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,400
doesn't seem like a scholar,

248
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,390
but he doesn't

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,660
look like a merchant either.

250
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,490
70% scholarly, 30% rogue.

251
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,380
He has a Huaiyang accent,

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
but it will take some time

253
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,990
to verify.

254
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,270
Keep investigating.

255
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,120
Anyway,

256
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,060
whoever dares to ruin my plans,

257
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,590
I'll expose those monsters

258
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,050
for what they truly are!

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,370
Before the New Year,

260
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,320
all our men

261
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,660
returned safely.

262
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,010
A toast to that!

263
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,790
Cheers!

264
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,750
Bottoms up!

265
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,480
To Mr. Chang.

266
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,270
Come on, to Mr. Chang!

267
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,260
-To Mr. Chang.
-To Mr. Chang!

268
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,520
Cheers! A toast to you.

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,510
We'd like to toast you.

270
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:22,970
Cheers.

271
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,910
Bottoms up.

272
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,910
Thank you for your hard work.

273
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,840
Drink up.

274
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,750
-Alright.
-Alright.

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,980
Patriarch.

276
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,790
Alright.

277
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,910
Enjoy your drink.

278
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,600
Father,

279
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,620
take it easy with the drinking.

280
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,290
Why are you trying to outdrink everyone?

281
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,150
It's alright.

282
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,220
Come on, Heizi.

283
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,900
Come on.

284
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,010
Let's go toast our men.

285
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,310
Come on, fill it up.

286
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,810
Come on, guys!

287
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,270
-Mr. Chang.
-Mr. Chang.

288
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,370
Mr. Chang is coming to toast us.

289
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,420
-Come on.
-Guys!

290
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,510
Time for a toast!

291
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,810
Alright!

292
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,510
See?

293
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,400
It's the same every year.

294
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,630
He always gets hammered on New Year's Eve.

295
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,750
You've been with me for most of your life.

296
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,810
In past years, he drank to celebrate.

297
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,010
But this year...

298
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,430
I'm afraid he'll get drunk a bit sooner.

299
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,760
Those who joined later,

300
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,910
working in the horse gang...

301
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,770
What happened?

302
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,090
Wang Tiangui's butler

303
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,880
was here with an agreement,

304
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,570
asking Mr. Chang to give up his house.

305
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,150
Didn't we already pay him?

306
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,800
We still owe 718 taels.

307
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,390
I'll get Father back here.

308
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,630
What's the use of
drowning his sorrows in alcohol?

309
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,240
Sit.

310
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,740
Do you have a solution?

311
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,660
-No.
-Then why add to the trouble?

312
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,750
Let's drink up together!

313
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,210
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

314
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,270
Come on, Heizi.

315
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,890
Look.

316
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,390
If Mr. Chang had any solution,

317
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,440
why would he

318
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,420
drink so much?

319
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,730
Thank you all for your hard work, guys.

320
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,730
I'll drink first to show my respect.

321
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,870
Come on, drink up.

322
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,750
Let's all drink up together!

323
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,200
Let's drink up together! Cheers!

324
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
Bottoms up!

325
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,530
Come on, Heizi.

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,460
Come on.

327
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,220
Fill it up. Fill it up.

328
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,120
One more.

329
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,720
Getting kicked out of our home

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
on New Year's Eve...

331
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll figure something out
tomorrow morning

332
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,630
and find us a place to stay,

333
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,230
so Father won't feel too bad.

334
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,240
Gu.

335
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,030
Sorry about this.

336
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,640
You guys saved my life.

337
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,480
Don't worry.

338
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,010
I'll think of something.

339
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,390
What if there's no solution?

340
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,240
Then we'll sleep on the street.

341
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,910
I've already left Ningguta.

342
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,630
For me,

343
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,180
anywhere is a better place.

344
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,870
Good wine should be enjoyed properly.

345
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,320
Guys,

346
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,270
drink up, drink up!

347
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,790
Alright.

348
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll help Patriarch

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,270
inside to rest for a while.

350
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,450
D-Drink to your heart's content.

351
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,260
I-I'm not drunk.

352
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
Let's have a drink together.

353
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,610
Scooch over.

354
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,170
Come on, don't cry.

355
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,190
How can I think of a solution
when you're like this?

356
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,800
Then...

357
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,030
Then I'll go somewhere else.

358
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,360
That's not what I meant.

359
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,740
Come take a walk with me.

360
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,540
Get some fresh air.

361
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,870
Show me around a bit.

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,650
Let's go.

363
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,750
Time to grab the gold ingots!

364
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,940
Hurry up and grab some!

365
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,750
You got some!

366
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,060
I want some too!

367
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,830
Come on, over here!

368
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,150
When did you start
traveling with the horse gang

369
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,440
alongside Mr. Chang?

370
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,600
Around the age a little younger
than this kid,

371
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,870
about 3 or 4.

372
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,930
My mother passed away early.

373
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,200
I kind of grew up

374
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,280
swaying back and forth in carriages.

375
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,430
That sounds nice.

376
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
When I was little,

377
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,060
I just studied in my village.

378
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,550
The first time I traveled far

379
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,200
was to the provincial capital
for the provincial exam.

380
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,910
After that,

381
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I went to the capital
for the imperial exam,

382
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
and then, I went to Ningguta.

383
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,410
I really wish I could be like you,

384
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,740
traveling everywhere.

385
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,570
After being on the road for so long,

386
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,830
you really start to miss staying at home.

387
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,460
My father also said

388
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,550
that sooner or later
he'll hang up his whip,

389
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,550
sell the caravan,

390
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,650
and enjoy his retirement at home.

391
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,090
Does it snow often where you're from?

392
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,170
Very rarely.

393
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,930
My family are tea farmers.

394
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,200
There's a tea mountain over there.

395
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,390
If someday

396
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,320
I can go back,

397
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll definitely treat you to

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,660
the best tea from our Huizhou.

399
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,910
That sounds wonderful,

400
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,280
but I'm afraid I won't have such luck.

401
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,670
You...

402
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,650
Just consider me babbling.

403
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,480

404
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,120
you're a lucky man blessed by heaven.

405
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,790
You'll definitely make it back.

406
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm certainly blessed.

407
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,150
It's thanks to the care
your family gave me

408
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,680
that I've lived to this day.

409
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,410
Don't worry.

410
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,610
The house matter will turn out fine too.

411
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,000
There's an outbreak of equine disease
on the Horqin Grasslands.

Who's willing to go?

423
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,000
I've long heard that

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,349
Pingyao is the wealthiest in the region.

425
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:22,920
It's so late,

426
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,400
yet there are still so many people
doing business.

427
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,589
Those in front, make way!

428
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,030
That's just how Pingyao is.

429
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,130
Lots of horse gangs, draft banks,

430
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,180
and pawnshops.

431
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,430

434

It's a pity I'm not a boy.

435
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,920
Otherwise, I could also

436
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240

443
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,720
Move aside! Don't block the way.

444
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,180
I've thought of a solution

445
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,720
to our current predicament.

446
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,850
Are you interested?

have started fighting.

449
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,440
I heard they're fighting over pastures.

450
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,400
They've sent people specifically
to buy medicine.

451
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,740
They've already paid

452
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,250

Tomorrow?

454
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,830
Even if I agreed to go tomorrow,

455
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,690
my gang wouldn't go along with it.

456
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,930
That's right.

457
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,340
With all this chaos,

458
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,140

speak their language.

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It wasn't me.

564
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,090
It was Gu.

565
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,790
He...

566
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,790
He...

567
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,070
He...

568
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,440
He...

569
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,720
He's never even worked with a horse gang!

570
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
He's just a scholar.

571
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,950
How could you agree to his plan?

572
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,660
If I didn't agree,

573
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,760
what, should we just wait

574
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,340
to be kicked out tonight?

575
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,770
Where are we going to get that much money?

576
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,330
I've never been to western Mongolia,

577
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,930
and I don't know much about that place.

578
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,660
But there's a saying from my hometown.

579
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,110
It goes "1,000 miles or 10,000 miles,

580
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,240
as long as you start walking,
you'll eventually reach your destination."

581
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,150
It means

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,110
no matter how far the journey is,

583
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,430
as long as you take the first step,

584
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,270
you'll definitely reach your destination!

585
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,230
This money is like a hot potato!

586
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,770
There's a war going on in Horqin.

587
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,610
It's too dangerous to go there!

588
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,970
Didn't you say it yourself

589
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,640
that fortune favors the brave?

590
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,370
You must be lying to me.

591
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,330
He doesn't know business at all.

592
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,000
How could he possibly
have closed this deal?

593
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,210
I taught him.

594
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,550
This won't do.

595
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,680
60 days at most.

596
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,580
Well...

597
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,190
When I traveled with my father in summer,

598
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,480
it took at least two and a half months.

599
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,230
Exactly.

600
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,740
And that was in summer.

601
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,540
This time,

602
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,170
with snow and wind,

603
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,650
plus climbing the Duozhe Mountains

604
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,650
and crossing the Black Water Marsh,

605
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,740
and on the road,

606
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
we may not even be able to find an inn.

607
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,730
I'd say it's impossible.

608
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,110
What do you mean by that?

609
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,030
This deadline was set by His Highness.

610
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,360
Let alone His Highness,

611
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,590
even if it's God himself demanding it,

612
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,400
what can we do?

613
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,190
We're not deities after all.

614
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,150
Please find someone else.

615
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,880
I'm leaving.

616
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,400
Bro, bro, wait!

617
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,960
Since we're talking business,

618
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,160
we need to negotiate, right?

619
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,180
Sit, sit.

620
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,400
Since you've drunk

621
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,590
the Mongols' wine,

622
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,220
that makes you a brother of the Mongols.

623
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,510
Let's settle this matter quickly

624
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,040
so I can report back sooner,

625
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,940
right?

626
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,180
As for the timing,

627
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,480
at most I can give you
an extension of 10 more days.

628
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,690
Just travel faster.

629
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,000
As for the horse gang's travel fee,

630
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,060
I can pay a bit more.

631
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,000
Well...

632
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,160
Since

633
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,920
you can pay higher travel fees,

634
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,680
I think God

635
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,300
will also show us some favor.

636
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,750
If this medicine

637
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,590
can't be delivered

638
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,310
before the hot weather sets in

639
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,650
and we lose the battle,

640
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,880
the pastures

641
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,900
and the women

642
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,960
will all be gone.

643
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,850
When that happens, His Highness

644
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,790
will surely have my head.

645
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
So you're saying

646
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,960
whether you get to keep your head

647
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,020
depends on whether

648
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,030
our horse gang travels fast enough.

649
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Here's the thing.

650
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,360
Those in our gang

651
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,780
will be hard to convince.

652
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,190
It's the New Year after all.

653
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,540
Nobody wants to risk

654
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,830
their lives out there.

655
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,310
Unless...

656
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,030
Before they leave,

657
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,000
we give them an advance payment.

658
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,600
No, no, no.

659
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,040
To put their minds at ease.

660
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,280
And you'll be the one to pay this money.

661
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,510
Bro,

662
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,990
your way of negotiation is improper.

663
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,590
Improper?

664
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,660
Improper.

665
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,830
If you're dead,

666
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,850
who are you going to talk rules with?

667
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Let me tell you what the real rule is:

668
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,310
get the medicine delivered
as quickly as possible,

669
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,690
your people stay safe,

670
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,070
my people stay safe—

671
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,330
first make sure

672
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,320
your head stays on your shoulders.

673
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,250
Only then will you have a life to spend
whatever money you earn.

674
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,220
That is the greatest rule

675
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,120
under heaven.

676
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,360
You two

677
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,210
are quite the negotiators.

678
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,860
Add 20% to the travel fee,

679
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,990
and I'll go with you.

680
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,110
That's right!

681
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,330
I'm not married anyway.

682
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,130
I'll just make some money
so I can get myself a wife.

683
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,160
What are you laughing at?

684
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,380
Mr. Chang makes the call on this matter.

685
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,830
You have no say in this!

686
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,790
Mr. Chang.

687
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,700
-Mr. Chang.
-Mr. Chang.

688
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,130
Mr. Gu's decision

689
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,130
is my decision.

690
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,910
Come here.

691
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,980
Today, I, Chang Si,

692
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,140
am facing some difficulties.

693
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,320
Let me just say one thing:

694
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,330
whether you help me or not,

695
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
I'll be grateful either way.

696
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,230
In our circle, we value

697
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,740
keeping our word

698
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,420
and standing by our promises.

699
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,220
Today,

700
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,010
I'm asking for your help.

701
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,290
I'm not backing down.

702
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,280
Mr. Chang, we'll go too.

703
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,410
-Mr. Chang, we'll go too.
-I'll go too.

704
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,740
After the meal,

705
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,190
everyone go home

706
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,540
and talk to your families.

707
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,570
I won't believe promises made now.

708
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,580
Come back after your families

709
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,790
have given their approval.

710
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,720
Your travel fees

711
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,670
will all be increased by 20%.

712
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,510
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

713
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,630
Mr. Chang, you're so generous!

714
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,480
-Thank you, Mr. Chang.
-Thank you, Mr. Chang.

715
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,140
Please sit.

716
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,890
Liuzi.

717
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,090
Mr. Chang.

718
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,850
You're getting married after we come back.

719
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,630
I'm waiting to have a drink
at your wedding.

720
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,040
No problem. No problem.

721
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,590
Come on, let's eat.

722
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,830
Come on.

723
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,720
Let's eat.

724
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,270
Mr. Chang.

725
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,640
My dear Mr. Chang.

726
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,720
You've honored us with your presence.

727
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,590
I apologize for not greeting you properly.

728
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,650
I should have been the one to visit you

729
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,630
and pay my respects in person.

730
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,130
Waiting for you to kick me
out of my own home?

731
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,190
Mr. Chang.

732
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,140
That phrase "kick out"

733
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,300
is not appropriate.

734
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,580
Everyone knows that you, Mr. Chang,

735
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,770
are a respected elder

736
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,200
here in Pingyao.

737
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,070
Besides,

738
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,200
we've been doing business
for so many years.

739
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm a man

740
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,480
who always abides by the rules.

741
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,980
I just didn't want to break the rules

742
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,540
and make you unhappy, Mr. Chang.

743
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,830
Mr. Chang,

744
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,230
about tonight's matter,

745
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,110
I've made a decision.

746
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,050
How about our two families get together

747
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,140
and celebrate the New Year joyfully?

748
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,230
After the Lantern Festival,

749
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,380

00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,800
but each time, they managed to

939
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,560
rebuild their army immediately.

940
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,820
Why could they do that?

941
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,480
It's because they have taxes,

942
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,470
draft banks,

943
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,660
and pawnshops.

944
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,850
Money

945
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,460
is completely useless

946
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,860
if it doesn't circulate.

947
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,590
I've been tasked

948
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,670
to reorganize the financial circulation
in Jiangnan.

949
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,290
Running draft banks and pawnshops

950
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,950
requires skilled personnel.

951
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,960
In that case,

952
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,040
I really need to make a trip to Shanxi.

953
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,070
That place

954
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,870
is the treasury of the Qing Dynasty.

955
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,400
The Eight Major Shanxi Merchant Families
have been

956
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,150
prospering there
since the previous dynasty.

957
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,610
For 300 years, they've accumulated wealth.

958
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,640
And now,

959
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
they've even monopolized
the draft banking business.

960
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,900
After the New Year,

961
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,030
you'll open your own
draft banks and pawnshops

962
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,360
in the Pingyao area

963
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,520
under the Li family name,

964
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,150
mainly to recruit talent.

965
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,740
Didn't I say

966
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,920
no one is allowed to come in
even if the sky falls?

967
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Father.

968
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,320
Ms. Su is here too, right?

969
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,320
Ms. Su.

970
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,530
Father.

971
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,060
What are you doing here?

972
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,230
How did you know

973
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,330
Ms. Su was here?

974
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,400
Zhang Guangfa is cleaning up the back door
with some people.

975
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,880
Tonight,

976
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,040
he's guarding it himself.

977
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,730
So I knew

978
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,550
there must be an important guest

979
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,730
visiting our family tonight.

980
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,730
Is execution and confiscation
coming too slowly

981
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,200
for you?

982
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,760
I...

983
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,690
Young Master Li.

984
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
She's calling me.

985
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Ms. Su.

986
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,550
Where are you planning to go?

987
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,480
I'll go with you.

988
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,460
I'm going to the Pingyao area.

989
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,480
Your Li family is going to establish

990
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,920
your own draft banks and pawnshops,

991
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,390
and your father will
personally accompany me.

992
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,250
There's no need

993
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,320
to trouble my father with this.

994
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,450
I'll go in his place.

995
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,380
Father,

996
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,030
I'll pave a way for you,

997
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,050
so as to prevent any potential damage

998
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,080
to your reputation.

999
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,880
What do you know, you little kid?

1000
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,120
In this world,

1001
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,000
who would ever make way for others?

1002
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,400
I...

1003
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,880
If you can really

1004
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,860
hold on for a year

1005
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
in Shanxi,

1006
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,710
that would be quite an achievement.

1007
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,240
Do you dare to go, young man?

1008
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,320
If I'm allowed to go,

1009
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,910
I'll definitely put down roots there.

1010
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,500
Children of Shanxi merchants

1011
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,180
learn business from childhood.

1012
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,340
They start as errand boys,
sweeping floors and pouring water.

1013
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,590
Without decades of experience,

1014
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,570
how could anyone possibly

1015
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,520
take the position of a shopkeeper there?

1016
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,460
Just look at you.

1017
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,620
Anyone can tell you're just

1018
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,520
a spoiled rich kid

1019
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,570
playing around.

1020
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
No, Father, I...

1021
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,180
I actually think

1022
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,110
it would be good for Young Master Li
to go.

1023
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,960
The renowned

1024
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,430
Li Wantang making a move

1025
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,260
would stir up too much attention.

1026
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,250
Many things

1027
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,400
would become difficult to handle.

1028
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,130
Thanks a lot.

1029
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,870
Father,

1030
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,350
this time, I'll definitely control

1031
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,100
my bad habits

1032
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,320
and work diligently

1033
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,450
to make something of myself in Shanxi.

1034
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,980
If you can get my business done,

1035
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,640
I'll give you the heads of
Shanxi's Eight Families

1036
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,850
as a reward.

1037
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,600
Just a few shops

1038
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,130
won't cause any major embarrassment.

1039
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,180
Young Master Li,

1040
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,610
there's another interesting matter

1041
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,710
I should tell you about.

1042
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,630
Your old friend

1043
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,050
is currently in Pingyao.

1044
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,380
Who?

1045
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,890
That scholar from Ningguta,

1046
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,690
Gu Pingyuan.

1047
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,980
Gu Pingyuan escaped to Shanxi?

1048
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,250
How did you know?

1049
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,080
I have plenty of informants.

1050
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,680
That Gu guy,

1051
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,640
I need to find a way

1052
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,900
to bring him over here.

1053
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,490
Heaven created

1054
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,520
such a talented person,

1055
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,110
yet he's fallen to such a state.

1056
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,670
If this imperial court doesn't fall,

1057
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,130
there truly is no justice.

1058
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,290
There are plenty of talented people
in this world.

1059
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,590
That guy

1060
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,950
is nothing but

1061
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,210
a fugitive exile.

1062
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,690
What kind of talent is that?

1063
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,070
Ms. Su, you're exaggerating.

1064
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,390
You know him?

1065
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,190
I don't.

1066
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,790
My son mentioned him once.

1067
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,830
How could he possibly

1068
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,020
have escaped alive?

1069
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,990
Yes, I'm puzzled too.

1070
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,230
When I get to Shanxi,

1071
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,960
I'll ask him.

1072
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,150
Your status is noble.

1073
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,380
How could you associate with an exile?

1074
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,110
Well, Ms. Su herself is a reb...

1075
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,480
You mean rebel?
