[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,950
[Episode 5]

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,400
Gu.

4
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,030
I've been watching you for a while

5
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,630
but didn't dare to say hello.

6
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,800
Why?

7
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,100
Afraid I'd jump?

8
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,800
If you wanted to jump,
you would've done it back in Ningguta.

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,860
You wouldn't have waited till today.

10
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,280
I couldn't sleep,

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,430
so I came out to think about
something on my mind—

12
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,890
to think about the future.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,310
I know.

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,590
You must be thinking about your mother

15
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,790
and feeling sad on your own, aren't you?

16
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,400
Sometimes, when the road
is blocked by snow and wind,

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,870
I'd sit alone outside,

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,040
and I'd often think of my mother.

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,150
My memories of her

20
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,430
are very vague.

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,470
I only remember that when she was buried,

22
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,870
her hair was still black.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,910
As for what kind of person she was

24
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,430
and what her temperament was like,

25
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,520
I've asked my father,

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,850
but he wouldn't tell me.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,660
You're the same as me, aren't you?

28
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,900
You miss your mother.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,180
But as for me, my mother is
still in Huizhou,

30
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,360
yet I can't go back to her

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
or fulfill my filial duties.

32
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,400
She raised my brother and me
all by herself,

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
hoping I would succeed
in the imperial examinations.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
Who would have thought
I'd end up like this?

35
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,840
In Ningguta, everyone dreams

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,870
of escaping.

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,720
But once you really escape, then what?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
The world is vast,

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,300
yet there's nowhere to settle.

40
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,560
Only a home I cannot return to,
and a country I cannot serve.

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,300
I remember when I was young
in the private school,

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,870
the teacher would start singing opera

43
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,130
whenever he got drunk,

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,000
sometimes it was
"Lin Chong's Night Escape."

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
The lance instructor
of 800,000 imperial guards

46
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,120
fleeing in haste,

47
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,550
forced to abandon
both loyalty and filial duty.

48
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,470
Thinking about it now,

49
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,250
it truly makes me
want to weep together with him.

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,910
Is that why

51
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,680
you were so determined to

52
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,010
take this deal?

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm worried.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,800
About what?

55
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,890
I'm worried that when we get to Horqin,

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,360
you'll stay there.

57
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,070
Why would you think that?

58
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,910
You can't hide it from me.

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,670
If I stay by Mr. Chang's side,

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,270
I would only bring

61
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,000
greater trouble upon you guys.

62
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,710
I can't just think of myself.

63
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,950
If you guys can

64
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,350
return safely this time,

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,720
it will be my way

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,520
of repaying his great kindness.

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,270
Who asked you to repay any kindness?

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,730
You're truly ridiculous.

69
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,200
What's wrong with you?

70
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,460
I'm going to bed.

71
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,630
Go ahead and jump!

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,960
Father.

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,390
This...

74
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,920
Where is this?

75
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,630
How come I never knew

76
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,690
we had such a large space in our house?

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
These gold and silver ingots

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,430
were just taken out

79
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,960
from the official furnace.

80
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,159
Most of the items against this wall

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,409
are freshwater pearls from Goryeo

82
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,440
and Hotan fine jade.

83
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,760
These are all medicinal herbs.

84
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,630
And this is the ginseng

85
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,450
you brought back from Ningguta.

86
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,120
Father.

87
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you have something

88
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,960
you want to tell me?

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,950
The ancients say

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,920
it's easier to start a business
than to maintain it.

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,240
All these years, I've been telling you

92
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,480
to find a shop

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
and learn business properly

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,880
instead of rushing into starting your own.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,180
As long as you run the business steadily,

96
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,870
preserve our family wealth,

97
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,830
and pass it down to the next generation,

98
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,830
that's already remarkable enough.

99
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,720
Can you not go to Shanxi?

100
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,310
Father.

101
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
You've already promised me.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,060
I must go to Shanxi.

103
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,090
I'm taking back my promise now.

104
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,800
I shouldn't have

105
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,950
let you go to Ningguta

106
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,560
to see all that commotion
in the first place.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,270
If anyone found out

108
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,070
you've been associating

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,790
with that escaped exile

110
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,470
and reported it to the imperial censor,

111
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,390
it would instantly
bring unimaginable disaster upon us.

112
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,920
Father.

113
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,270
You yourself dare

114
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,270
to defy the imperial court's regulations

115
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,120
by sending ships beyond the pass
for contraband.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Now you blame me

117
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,620
for befriending an exile?

118
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
That's why I'm regretting it.

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,630
If I hadn't been so greedy back then,

120
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,250
how much better it would've been.

121
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,920
Son.

122
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,970
As long as you listen to me

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
and stay in the capital,

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
you can do whatever you want.

125
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,710
I'll go to Shanxi myself.

126
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,510
Father.

127
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,040
If I really wanted

128
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,770
to be like those rich young men,

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,630
carrying bird cages around all day,

130
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,480
hanging out in teahouses,

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,270
gambling and visiting brothels,

132
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,720
I would have done so long ago.

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,630
But all this money

134
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,760
wasn't earned by me.

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,310
Keep it for yourself.

136
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm definitely going to Shanxi.

137
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Stop right there!

138
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,159
Why can't you just stay home
and enjoy life?

139
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,270
The bigger your business gets,

140
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,870
the more attention you attract.

141
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,920
Once they've fattened you up,

142
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,360
they'll put a knife to your neck,

143
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,390
cut your throat open,

144
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,360
and feast on your flesh and blood!

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,270
I'm a person,

146
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,010
not some pet you've raised!

147
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,240
Do you know how those managers

148
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
under you see me now?

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
They think I'm a spoiled heir.

150
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,690
They think I'm useless!

151
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,190
You're Li Baiwan,

152
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,480
the greatest merchant
north of the Yangtze River.

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
How can you raise

154
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,750
your own child as a good-for-nothing?

155
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,680
Shanxi is not a good place to go.

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,500
There's no good place in this world!

157
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,530
You always tell me yourself

158
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,720
that no one will ever give way to anyone.

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Did all this money

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,040
grow legs

161
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,070
and walk into our house by itself?

162
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,560
Father.

163
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,380
All my life I've wanted to learn from you,

164
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,480
but why do you

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,870
keep pushing me away?

166
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,390
Kid.

167
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,870
You're not cut out for business.

168
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,870
You won't make it.

169
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,190
Unless you break my legs,

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,080
sew my mouth shut,

171
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,740
and brick me inside that wall.

172
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,780
Otherwise, there's no way you can stop me
from going to Shanxi.

173
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,460
[Black Water Marsh]

174
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,550
Keep up, everyone!

175
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,070
There's a place to rest up ahead.

176
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
Patriarch.

177
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
Everything's ready.

178
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,720
Guys.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,150
Taking the Black Water Marsh route

180
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,330
is us gambling our lives

181
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,190
with Heaven in exchange for food.

182
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,650
Let's go!

183
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,930
Everyone remember this:

184
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,670
6 people go ahead to scout.

185
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,560
Strike the ground with wooden sticks—

186
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,820
if you can pass, move forward;

187
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,800
if not,

188
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,650

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,030
Mr. Gu!

379
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,590
My good friend.

380
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,010
Long time no see.

381
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,050
You're late!

382
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,000
We had a narrow escape from death.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Just being able to meet you again

384
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,480
is already a blessing from the heavens.

385
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,160
Mr. Chang,

386
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,550
we meet again.

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,240
Didn't he just say?

388
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,000
We had a narrow escape from death.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,660
Thanks to the heaven's mercy,

390
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,000
we only lost one cart of goods.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,480
Everything else is intact.

392
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,070
Alright.

393
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,270
Let's head back to the camp now.

394
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,310
Tonight, there's good wine and meat
waiting for us.

395
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,480
Is His Highness here?

396
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,590
I need to pay

397
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,040
my respects to him first.

398
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,570
That's unfortunate.

399
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,660
His Highness has just led his troops

400
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,880
out to fight against

401
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,940
the Junior Khan of western Mongolia.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Let's go.

403
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,460
Let's go home first!

404
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,970
Let's go!

405
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,030
Come on, good friends of the horse gang!

406
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,200
Have some food and drinks
to fill your stomachs first.

407
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,750
We've got 10 lambs roasting.

408
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,000
We'll continue drinking tonight.

409
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,750
Thank you for your hospitality,
Head Butler Hanlong.

410
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,350
Cheers!

411
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,240
Bottoms up!

412
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,000
Heizi.

413
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,960
Take a few of our men

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,440
and get the tents set up.

415
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,680
Mr. Gu and I will share one.

416
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,920
Got it.

417
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,730
Come on, you three, follow me.

418
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,660
-Got it.
-Got it.

419
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,760
Head Butler.

420
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,120
Here's to you.

421
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,350
Maybe we should

422
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,110
hold off on the drinking for now.

423
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,960
I think

424
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
we should distribute the medicine

425
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,750
as soon as possible.

426
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,490
If this disease spreads,

427
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,010
it would be disastrous.

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
Mr. Chang, you're right.

429
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,440
If this disease acts up,

430
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,920
we won't even be able to ride a horse.

431
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,070
That's why His Highness was in a hurry

432
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,160
for you to arrive on time.

433
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,750
Well, we've arrived as requested.

434
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,350
Let's first count the medicine

435
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,310
and settle the accounts and money,

436
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,280
then I'll drink with you
for three days and nights.

437
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,830
How does that sound?

438
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,490
This way, you'll feel at ease,

439
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,300
and so will all my men.

440
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,270
About this matter,

441
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,090
I need to consult with His Highness.

442
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,070
Mr. Hanlong.

443
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,880
When His Highness left,

444
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,920
didn't he leave any instructions?

445
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,610
Wasn't he urgently demanding

446
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,940
these medicinal herbs?

447
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,880
Mr. Gu, listen to me.

448
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,530
These worms are in our stomachs,

449
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,620
not in yours.

450
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,160
I just spoke with His Highness

451
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,920
only a few days ago.

452
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,380
Why are you in such a hurry?

453
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,030
Is the wine on our grasslands
not good,

454
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,360
or is the lamb not tasty?

455
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,710
Just have a good rest
and enjoy yourselves.

456
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,200
"Anyway, these worms are in our stomachs,

457
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,240
not in yours."

458
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,910
What kind of talk is that?

459
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,180
So this Hanlong doesn't care about others

460
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
just because he isn't sick himself?

461
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,900
He was as urgent as a blazing fire
when he hurried us.

462
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,270
We rushed here as fast as we could,

463
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,310
and now he's saying there's no hurry.

464
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,030
Dealing with this Hanlong

465
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,640
really takes some effort.

466
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,590
He's a fraud.

467
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
He's not even Mongolian.

468
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,920
If you've dealt with Mongolians before,

469
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,640
you'd know.

470
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,620
They don't have so many tricks
up their sleeves.

471
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,520
Mr. Chang.

472
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,160
Now that His Highness is away

473
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,240
and Hanlong is in charge,

474
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,880
with goods worth
tens of thousands of taels,

475
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,110
he might get greedy.

476
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,460
Nice shot!

477
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,280
Anyone who hits the coin
gets two sheep as a reward!

478
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,680
Mr. Gu.

479
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,680
Let's drink.

480
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,190
By the way, Mr. Hanlong,

481
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,620
has His Highness replied yet?

482
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,830
No rush.

483
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Let's drink first. Drink up.

484
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,020
Come on, Mr. Chang.

485
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,490
You may not be in a hurry,

486
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,310
but what about the worms
in your people's stomachs?

487
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,840
Are they also that patient?

488
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,490
Mr. Gu.

489
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,420
You're a good man.

490
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,470
I'm a good man too.

491
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,200
Let me make a deal with you.

492
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,750
Would you do me

493
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,920
a favor?

494
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,970
Hey.

495
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,550
What kind of talk is that?

496
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,290
In front of you, Sir,

497
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
how dare I talk about favors?

498
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,190
Whatever you need us to do,

499
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,390
just give the order.

500
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,200
Cheers!

501
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,160
Come on.

502
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Well then.

503
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,920
His Highness has been fighting
at the front line,

504
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,110
and things haven't been

505
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,120
going well.

506
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,110
He keeps pushing for the medicine.

507
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,640
He never mentioned anything

508
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,730
about the payment,

509
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,960
and since he's in a bad mood,

510
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,240
it's not the right time to ask.

511
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,900
Since we're all friends here,

512
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,420
just give us the medicine first.

513
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,400
Let our soldiers take it

514
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,550
and get their strength back.

515
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,750
If we win this battle

516
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,900
and His Highness is pleased, who knows,

517
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,410
he might even reward you
with a little extra.

518
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,100
Well,

519
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,760
that does sound good.

520
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,660
It's just I...

521
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,270
It's just the members of our horse gang

522
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,400
all come from poor backgrounds.

523
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
They all have families to feed.

524
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
If we stay too long

525
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,790
on the grasslands,

526
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,590
waiting for His Highness

527
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,650
to win the battle before we could go back,

528
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,160
their families will have starved to death.

529
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,290
How about this?

530
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,160
Pay our men's travel fees

531
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,030
and the cost of the medicine

532
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,850
in full,

533
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,680
and let Mr. Chang return to Pingyao.

534
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,340
When the weather gets warmer,

535
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,370
we'll come back to Horqin

536
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,920
to thank His Highness properly.

537
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll stay here

538
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,920
and drink with you.

539
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,190
Mr. Gu.

540
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,760
For this small amount of money,

541
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,440
you don't even care about

542
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,750
the lives of our Mongolians

543
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,510
at all.

544
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,440
No, that's not true.

545
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,270
Then I can't

546
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,310
consider you my friend anymore.

547
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,290
I'll immediately send someone

548
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,480
to inquire about it.

549
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,750
Even if we have to take a beating,

550
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,610
I'll settle the payment with you.

551
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,770
Thank you very much then, Mr. Hanlong.

552
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
At the end of the day,

553
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,350
Hanlong just doesn't want to pay.

554
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,610
So the noble prince's people
are actually trying to rob us?

555
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,410
Keep it down.

556
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,000
We're on their territory.

557
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,070
They have strong forces.

558
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,640
Even if they really want to take it
by force, what can you do?

559
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
We can't fight them,

560
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,610
and we can't escape.

561
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,220
Over the past few days,

562
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,870
Hanlong has been gradually

563
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,040
bringing in about 100 cavalry.

564
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,110
At first I thought

565
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,170
he was sending them to the front line.

566
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,940
But it turns out

567
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,540
they're here to surround us.

568
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,010
Are we going to die here?

569
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
If we really go back

570
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,280
empty-handed like this,

571
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,200
not to mention our men's travel fees,

572
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,590
how are we going to pay

573
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,000
for all those carts of medicine?

574
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,130
They're really pushing us to the edge.

575
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,300
If there's no other way,

576
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,980
we'll have to give them the medicine.

577
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,830
These men

578
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
all came with me from home.

579
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,480
I must bring every single one of them back

580
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,560
safe and sound.

581
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,590
They absolutely cannot die here.

582
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,190
Mr. Chang.

583
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,550
If you leave the medicine

584
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,480
here for them,

585
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,910
we'll only die faster.

586
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,270
Hanlong will definitely

587
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,530
send a cavalry unit to chase us,

588
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,790
intercept us on the way,

589
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,090
and slaughter us all.

590
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,850
We can't back down on this.

591
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,900
We need to fight them head-on.

592
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,110
I've come up with an idea,

593
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
but we need to act immediately.

594
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,560
It has to be done tonight.

595
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
We Mongolians

596
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,270
are all sick like this,

597
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,510
yet they refuse to give us the medicine

598
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,240
and even want to charge us more.

599
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,550
Today,

600
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,640
we're going to

601
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,300
teach them a lesson properly.

602
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,880
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

603
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,240
Mr. Hanlong.

604
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,300
What's this about?

605
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,790
You...

606
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,780
Mr. Gu.

607
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,440
Ms. Chang.

608
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,590
Why are you here?

609
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,550
I found two horses.

610
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,130
They're right outside.

611
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,850
Let's go now.

612
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,840
You're being ridiculous.

613
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Go back right now!

614
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,000
Where to?

615
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,360
Back to let him tie me up?

616
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,260
Let's go.

617
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,610
Where's the medicine?

618
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,960
Go find it!

619
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,930
Yes!

620
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,070
Let's go find the medicine!

621
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,260
My father told me

622
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,590
that in recent years,
outsiders have been raiding this area,

623
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,310
and the Mongol tribes
have been in constant turmoil.

624
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,550
They fight over rivers, over pasturelands,

625
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,310
and they even seize each other's children.

626
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,040
Such beautiful grasslands...

627
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,890
Yet now they're
consumed by war and conflict.

628
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,720
Shoot!

629
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,790
Chang Si!

630
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,200
My medicine!

631
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,270
-Don't touch him!
-Don't move!

632
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,140
Go away!

633
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,750
Where's my medicine?

634
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,160
See that pit over there?

635
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,030
I do.

636
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,120
That's where you'll all be buried.

637
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,440
There are only a few of us.

638
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Why did you dig such a big pit?

639
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,310
Laughing, huh?

640
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Laughing, huh?

641
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,000
Laughing, huh?

642
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,060
Clueless fools!

643
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,310
Keep laughing, huh?

644
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,850
Where did you hide the medicine?

645
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,380
Hanlong!

646
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,950
Do you really think

647
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,110
there's no one in this world

648
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,200
who can control you anymore?

649
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,720
Do you?

650
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,670
In broad daylight,

651
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,100
with everyone watching,

652
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,070
you plan to rob us outright?

653
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,360
You're even worse than bandits!

654
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,010
His Highness won't spare you
when he returns!

655
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,640
When His Highness returns?

656
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,710
When His Highness returns, I'll tell him

657
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,910
that your goods were never delivered.

658
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,210
Delaying military affairs is punishable
by death.

659
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,070
Fine.

660
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,680
Come on.

661
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,920
A real man keeps

662
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,310
his word.

663
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,030
If you don't bury us alive today,

664
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,270
right here,

665
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,150
then you're nothing but a darn coward!

666
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,960
That's right!

667
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,350
A darn coward!

668
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Lead the way!

669
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,160
Do you see that

670
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,200
purple-red battle flag?

671
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,430
[Jasagh]

672
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,510
That should be

673
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,110
Prince Horqin's territory.

674
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,960
That bluish-green one over there

675
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,620
should be the western Mongolian
Senior Khan's.

676
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,200
Look at that one behind,

677
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,640
that tent without a top.

678
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,110
That should be

679
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,440
where Prince Horqin is.

680
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,530
It's so far away.

681
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,280
There might be another way.

682
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,050
I can cut straight across the battlefield.

683
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,070
Shoot!

684
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,210
You can't go.

685
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
Be good and listen to me.

686
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
Why should I listen to you?

687
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,110
You should be the one listening to me.

688
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,720
There are tens of thousands of people
on that battlefield,

689
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,880
firing cannons nonstop.

690
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,160
How many heads do you have
to make it through alive?

691
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,090
So what are you suggesting?

692
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,240
Take time to go around it?

693
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,400
We already spent so much time

694
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,960
coming around this way.

695
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,070
If you die on the battlefield,

696
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,480
you'll be no better than a worm.

697
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,640
This camp isn't that big.

698
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
If they search thoroughly,

699
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,310
they'll quickly find out

700
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,570
where the medicine is.

701
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,200
Since we got out of there

702
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,000
together,

703
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,750
we absolutely can't die together.

704
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,210
I have to take this gamble.

705
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,570
Get in!

706
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,480
Get in!

707
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,160
Are you okay?

708
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,690
I'm okay.

709
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,680
Chang Si.

710
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,380
Who's the darn coward now, huh?

711
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,330
Where's the medicine?

712
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,370
That Mr. Gu

713
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,790
and your daughter

714
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,490
also stole two of my horses.

715
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,030
That I didn't know.

716
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,920
You think I'm a three-year-old
or something?

717
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,260
There are hundreds of cannons over there

718
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,920
and 40,000 to 50,000 cavalry.

719
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,110
If those two try to petition His Majesty,

720
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,070
I'm afraid there won't even be

721
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,670
bone fragments left of them.

722
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm actually giving you a chance now

723
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,320
by asking you questions.

724
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,110
You're giving me a chance?

725
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,960
Since I, Chang Si,
dared to take my daughter

726
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,020
and my men through Black Water Marsh,

727
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,800
I've already placed my life
in heaven's hands.

728
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,350
Now that the medicine's gone,

729
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,880
I'd like to see how you'll explain this
to His Highness.

730
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,590
Bury us!

731
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,010
You think I don't dare?

732
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,180
Just wait and see whether His Highness
will believe me

733
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,510
or them when he comes back!

734
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,270
Found it!

735
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,630
Old Chang.

736
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,070
Quite cunning, aren't you?

737
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,920
Hiding the goods under the stable,

738
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,650
thinking I wouldn't find them.

739
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,400
In your next life,

740
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,340
you'd better pray to the Bodhisattva

741
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,150
for a better fate.

742
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,110
Bury them!

743
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,720
Why are you here?

744
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,880
I'm here to collect your corpse!

745
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,400
Let's go!

746
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,010
Attack!

747
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,060
Nobody move!

748
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,210
Put your guns down!

749
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,640
-Put your guns down!
-Or I'll kill him!

750
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,840
Chang Si,

751
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,940
you wouldn't dare!

752
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,960
Hanlong.

753
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,830
Do you think I, Chang Si,

754
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,540
am just a lump of dough

755
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,820
for you to knead however you want?

756
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,700
Chang Si,

757
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:26,920
you wouldn't dare!

758
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,550
Heizi,

759
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,620
tie them up!

760
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,200
[Prince Horqin's Military Camp]

761
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,400
Move it!

762
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,900
Get in!

763
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,920
Hurry up!

764
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,480
Move it!

765
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,590
Hurry!

766
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,190
The newly caught—

767
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,150
send the man to the army,

768
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,410
make the woman a slave,

769
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,760
and have her serve Her Ladyship.

770
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,360
Come here!

771
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,710
Ms. Chang!

772
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,920
Get in there!

773
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,560
Come here!

774
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,840
Get in!

775
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,090
Work properly.

776
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,100
Otherwise,

777
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,590
I'll strangle you to death!

778
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,520
Serve Her Ladyship properly here!

779
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,000
What are you looking at?

780
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Behave yourself!

781
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,590
If you try to escape,

782
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,280
you'll die.

783
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,310
Your horse isn't as fast as theirs,

784
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,840
and you don't have a bow.

785
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,740
Don't do anything stupid.

786
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,610
I still have a friend here.

787
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,680
I need to go find her.

788
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,160
Friend?

789
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,150
In this place,

790
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,190
I haven't heard

791
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,250
that word in years.

792
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,120
What's wrong?

793
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,040
What's going on?

794
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,350
It's a plague!

795
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,760
It's the Black Plague!

796
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,710
Everyone stay away from him!

797
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,480
It's the Black Plague!

798
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,000
Quick! Quick!

799
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,260
-Stay away from him!
-Stay away from him!

800
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,380
Black Plague!

801
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,540
Stay away from him!

802
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,360
Stop!

803
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,630
Stop right there!

804
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,440
Stop!

805
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,550
Shoot!

806
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,550
Shoot!

807
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,220
My Lady.

808
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,780
Please come in.

809
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,070
Go ask His Highness to come here.

810
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,590
Yes.

811
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,640
Your Highness.

812
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,440
[Prince Horqin]

813
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,770
How could they fight the battle like this?

814
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,450
Your Highness.

815
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,400
[Prince Horqin's Wife]

816
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,230
We can't afford to lose any more soldiers.

817
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,360
You must stop scolding them like this.

818
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,870
No matter how accurate our archers are,

819
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,280
their arrows are no match for
the enemy's firearms.

820
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,010
How did things end up like this?

821
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,400
Colluding with outsiders

822
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,930
and killing our own people—

823
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,550
how can that be called being a hero?

824
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,550
They don't care about being heroes.

825
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,860
Your Highness.

826
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,820
What they want is the Horqin Grasslands.

827
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,070
If I were defeated,

828
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,550
I could give him the grassland,

829
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,490
but that would be giving it to
our own people.

830
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,330
But now that he's become a traitor,

831
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,000
I won't give him a single inch of land!

832
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,740
Unless

833
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,800
the blood here runs dry!

834
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,260
Your Highness.

835
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,430
The Junior Khan of western Mongolia
is here.
