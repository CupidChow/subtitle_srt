00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,280

to help the Kang family out of this crisis

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
is a great kindness.

I won't thank each of you individually.

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,180
Over the years,

20
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,650
the Kang family's business

21
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,050
has been smooth sailing,

22
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,079
which made us arrogant enough

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,630
to take on anything.

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,980
This time, we accepted a court assignment

25
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,680
to transport military supplies.

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,810
We thought we could make a good profit,

27

I'm here in mourning clothes
to auction off our family property.

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,530
What a disgrace of a son.

33
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,110
But the country is at war,

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,810

who failed in his studies,

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
switched to learning a craft

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,410
and failed again,

67
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,870
and later found

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
a petty clerk's job in the army camp,

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
earning only a few maces a month.

70
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,190

was generous, righteous,

Though he was physically weak,

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,330
everyone respected him
as a true man of honor.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,080
Later, several friends

80
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,120
pooled money
to open an escort agency for him,

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,580

he suddenly became wealthy.

my great-grandfather once vowed that

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,870
Ms. Su.

194
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,870
My boss ordered me

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
to make absolutely sure

196
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,510
I secure the Kang family's property.

197
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,840
Could you let me take it?

198
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,170
Those people died horribly just now.

199
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,870
It was you?

200
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,200
You're not planning

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
to join them, are you?

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,720
No.

203
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,580
I think

204
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,240
someone is trying
to force the Eight Families to death,

205
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,770
wanting to take everything

206
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,340
without paying a coin.

207
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,480
Was it done by people from the underworld?

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,410
I don't think so.

209
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,410
They don't have

210
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,320
that kind of power.

211
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
We should stay put

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,330
and let the culprit show themselves.

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,090
Dead people!

214
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,870
There really are dead people!

215
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,330
Make up your mind already!

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,150
Everyone!

217
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,870
Everyone!

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
Today I'm selling
the Kang family's assets.

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,170
I truly don't know why people died.

220
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
We're not doing a deal

221
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,000
where we die!

222
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,160
Let's go!

223
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,630
Let's go!

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Every-

225
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,510
Get back!

226
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,200
-Sit down!
-Sit down!

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,840
By His Highness's order,

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
no one drinking here today

229
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,050
is allowed to leave!

230
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,510
If the Kang family's property isn't sold

231
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,320
and the military supplies
can't be delivered,

232
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,780
you can all prepare to die!

233
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,680
Sit down, all of you!

234
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,170
Continue the bidding!

235
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,950
Seven million taels.

236
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,330
[Kindhearted and Serene]

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,150
Manager Li,

238
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,000
since they're all dead,

239
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,670
I'll follow your bid.

240
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,670
Okay.

241
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,260
Alright, alright.

242
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,630
Alright.

243
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Clever.

244
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,990
Eight million taels.

245
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,100
Ten million taels.

246
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,960
Young man,

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
you look unfamiliar.

248
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,870
As long as you know it, that's enough.

249
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,470
It's not unfamiliar, right?

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,860
Eleven million taels!

251
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,270
Everyone, I'll place a bid too.

252
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,870
I'd like to see

253
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,330
if I will get killed today.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Fourteen million taels!

255
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,360
Fifteen million taels!

256
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,130
No matter what you bid,

257
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,130
I'll always add another million.

258
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
Everyone, forgive me.

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,120
I must win today.

260
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,050
Hurry up!

261
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
Any more bids?

262
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,380
Twenty million taels!

263
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,120
What?

264
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Is Li Baiwan's family in the capital

265
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,760
not eligible?

266
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,830
You're joining too, aren't you?

267
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes.

268
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,450
Quite lively here.

269
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,790
But you're not go to do this...

270
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,120
to me and Mr. Gu, are you?

271
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,440
What are you trying to do?

272
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm thinking the same as you.

273
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,620
I want to snatch this bargain.

274
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,040
Didn't you say you'd help me?

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,390
Come on.

276
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,210
What was your bid again?

277
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,320
Twenty million taels.

278
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,870
Twenty...

279
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,070
Twenty-one million!

280
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,890
Twenty-five million!

281
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,670
Twenty-six million!

282
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,870
Even if you boiled Wang Tiangui's bones
into oil,

283
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,730
you couldn't get that much money.

284
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,550
I have it in my draft bank.

285
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,970
I'll lend it to him.

286
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm doing this for your father.

287
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,790
Why are you interfering?

288
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,630
Spending 26 million

289
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,820
can make you happy?

290
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,040
Do you know what I want most?

291
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,280
I want to see you and my father

292
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,060
defeated just once.

293
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,270
Childish.

294
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,560
Mr. Gu, right?

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,260
Please come over here.

296
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,840
Everyone,

297
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,840
if there are no objections,

298
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,660
the Kang family's property...

299
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,300
now belongs to Taiyufeng.

300
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,350
Manager Kang,

301
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,480
26 million taels is a large sum.

302
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,120
Please allow me
to settle it within 10 days.

303
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,720
Thank you.

304
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,840
With so much money,

305
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,830
why did you kill them?

306
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,510
Madam, what are you thinking?

307
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,610
I didn't kill them.

308
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,750
Good.

309
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,030
From now on, Taiyufeng

310
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,960
will be part of the Eight Families.

311
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,690
Congratulations, Mr. Gu.

312
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,180
Congratulations.

313
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,300
His Highness has arrived!

314
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,480
Why is His Highness here?

315
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,770
Your Highness.

316
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,840
The rebels are running rampant,

317
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
[Prince Shen]

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,510
and the imperial court
is pressing urgently.

319
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,110
Without money and supplies,

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
the army can't be sustained.

321
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,770
You can't afford to take the blame.

322
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,720
I am selling off my family property.

323
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,360
Within 10 days,

324
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,290
I'll repay the military supplies.

325
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,840
Ten days?

326
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Is this what the Eight Families do?

327
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,480
The country is in crisis,

328
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
yet you're all here haggling.

329
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,650
The imperial court says I'm

330
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,820
too soft-hearted.

331
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,370
Well, I have no choice now.

332
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,840
Lock them all up.

333
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,480
At least I'll have something to report.

334
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,070
Yes!

335
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,980
Take them away!

336
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,750
If you don't pay within 3 days...

337
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,260
-Go!
-Go!

338
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,660
None of you will survive.

339
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,250
Hurry up!

340
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,690
Move!

341
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,120
Hurry!

342
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,180
Move it!

343
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,640
Move!

344
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,390
Move!

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:47,910
Go!

346
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,390
Move!

347
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,720
Go!

348
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,570
You think having a bit of money

349
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,340
makes you humans?

350
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
To me,

351
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,170
you're nothing.

352
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,120
Move!

353
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Hurry!

354
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,600
Move!

355
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,670
Hurry!

356
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,240
Well?

357
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,050
Your brother's head

358
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,740
will fall faster than his hat.

359
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Gu...

360
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,460
It's gone sour.

361
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,859
Stop drinking—it's spoiled.

362
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,839
Sour or not, it's still food.

363
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,720
Mr. Gu,

364
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,200
tell them

365
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,400
you're not one of the Eight Families.

366
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
You don't need to suffer here.

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,750
I told them,

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
but they wouldn't listen.

369
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,750
They think

370
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,480
since I bought the Kang family's property,

371
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,340
I'm one of the Eight Families now.

372
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Let's face this hardship together.

373
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm afraid by tomorrow,

374
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,720
even this spoiled porridge will be gone.

375
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,920
Would you like a bowl?

376
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,510
[Wanyuandang]

377
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,070
I came to take over Shanxi.

378
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,240
With the way they run things—

379
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,300
small operations, small ambitions—

380
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,560
they can't keep their footing.

381
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,510
Before I came,

382
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,640
I told His Highness.

383
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,070
I'm opening a draft bank right here.

384
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,480
I've already thought of the name.

385
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,640
It will be called Taiping Bank.

386
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,640
From Pingyao,

387
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,900
it will spread to all the nearby counties

388
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
and eventually across
the entire Qing Empire.

389
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,810
Taiping Bank will be a big pouch,

390
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,240
swallowing every draft bank

391
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,350
in Pingyao.

392
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,680
It's a fine business.

393
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,320
The Li family in the capital

394
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,640
will take over the draft bank business.

395
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,550
Three million taels in ransom
for each family?

396
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,550
Isn't that bleeding the locals dry?

397
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,960
How could he even come up with that?

398
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,150
The imperial court
has been asking us for money

399
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,550
quite a lot over the past few years.

400
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,030
Have they won any battles?

401
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,000
Just wait till I get out.

402
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
I have connections with a few people

403
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
in the Grand Council.

404
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,350
I'll buy myself an imperial censor
and impeach him!

405
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,880
Mr. Sun, don't be angry.

406
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,920
In this situation,

407
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,510
without paying, none of us is getting out.

408
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,350
How will you ever get the chance

409
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,270
to buy yourself an imperial censor

410
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,200
and impeach him?

411
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,970
He's the famous

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
Prince of the Iron Helmet.

413
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,970
His words can shake mountains.

414
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,820
You think you can impeach him?

415
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,410
You've got a point.

416
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,650
I'm just curious about one thing.

417
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,630
At the Jinyang Villa gathering,

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,270
all the people we invited

419
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,030
are from the major banks in Shanxi.

420
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,630
How did they know so clearly?

421
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
They blocked the door

422
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,210
and arrested everyone.

423
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,590
I don't think

424
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
this is as simple as it looks.

425
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,720
Father,

426
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,830
you're here.

427
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,680
Well now.

428
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,790
It all depends on you now.

429
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,000
You two talk.

430
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,640
Why are you always hanging around

431
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
with that exile?

432
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,160
You already know what we've been doing?

433
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,310
We created a storefront pawning

434
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,910
and a door-to-door pawning.

435
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,680
We've turned Pingyao

436
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,590
upside down.

437
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,960
It was truly satisfying.

438
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
You may be satisfied,

439
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,110
but who will take the blame for harboring

440
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,680
an exile?

441
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
That won't fall on you.

442
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't worry.

443
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,370
Just tell me,

444
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,510
why did you really come here?

445
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
I sincerely apologize

446
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,700
for the inconvenience.

447
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,070
His Highness asked me to check

448
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,680
whether you ate well.

449
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,680
You are all his guests.

450
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,200
If there's anything lacking

451
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
lacking in our hospitality,

452
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,510
please forgive us.

453
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,790
Your prince is too kind.

454
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,350
I don't have

455
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,610
3 million taels.

456
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,690
All my money is invested in tea.

457
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,240
Go confiscate my household

458
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,640
with an imperial decree.

459
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,830
I'm not qualified

460
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,880
to be His Highness's guest.

461
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
I don't have that much money.

462
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,940
About this matter,

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,130
we've already spoken to His Highness.

464
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,930
However,

465
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,870
His Highness has a noble status.

466
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,290
If he takes back

467
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,640
what he said,

468
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,440
he'll lose face, won't he?

469
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,160
The money in our draft banks

470
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,790
belongs to the people of Shanxi.

471
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,190
If it's all taken at once,

472
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,870
how will the people survive?

473
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The imperial court

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
has already lost Jiangnan.

475
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Now they want Shanxi

476
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,660
to fall into chaos too?

477
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,130
Young man,

478
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,400
you look unfamiliar.

479
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,080
May I know your name?

480
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,350
Everyone in this room

481
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
has only one name—

482
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,110
Silver.

483
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,270
Nickname: Ingot.

484
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,040
That's right.

485
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,510
Sir,

486
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,000
stop pretending to be polite.

487
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
State your terms.

488
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,790
Fine.

489
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
This time, His Highness brought

490
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,770
a draft bank from the capital,

491
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,790
planning to station it in Shanxi

492
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,230
to manage the army's grain and funds.

493
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
If you can't raise

494
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,620
the 3 million taels,

495
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,200
that draft bank can pay on your behalf.

496
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,880
You just need to sign
and stamp your names.

497
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,870
As for

498
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,480
when you repay it,

499
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,120
you may discuss that among yourselves.

500
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,230
Robbers.

501
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,350
Strange things happen every year,

502
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,790
but this year is overflowing with them.

503
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,520
Pingyao now has a Wanyuandang,

504
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,480
said to be owned

505
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,750
by the son of Li Baiwan from the capital.

506
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,030
And now there's another big draft bank.

507
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,480
Our Eight Families

508
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,030
need a total of 24 million taels,

509
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,830
and they do in fact have it.

510
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,680
How can they be so rich?

511
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,070
Could it be

512
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,530
the God of Wealth himself has arrived?

513
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,350
Madam Jin,

514
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,790
this draft bank

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,160
belongs to Mr. Li, Li Wantang.

516
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,970
It's called Taiping Bank.

517
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,820
If you all accept this account

518
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,490
and are willing to sign,

519
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,020
I guarantee

520
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,060
you'll be released

521
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,400
immediately.

522
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,510
This Li Baiwan

523
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,960
is too ruthless.

524
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,890
Just to establish himself in Shanxi,

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,830
there's no need

526
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,570
to ruin all of us.

527
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,000
What is this?

528
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,910
Using officials to pressure us?

529
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,090
Since that's the case,

530
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,640
you can

531
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,860
keep drinking your porridge!

532
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,790
Father,

533
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,810
is this really okay?

534
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,770
You...

535
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,790
Just be good.

536
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,990
Don't cause trouble.

537
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,720
As long as you can watch and learn

538
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,650
from a distance,

539
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
that's all I ask.

540
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,860
Father,

541
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,000
I believe businessmen

542
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,960
should keep their word.

543
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
What you're doing

544
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
is robbery,

545
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,640
bullying with power,

546
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
kicking people when they're down—

547
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,010
using any means necessary.

548
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,570
My good son,

549
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,480
I think you

550
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,350
should just go back, study hard,

551
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,260
and try to earn an official title.

552
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,680
Be a good person?

553
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,030
[Loan Ledger of Taiyufeng,
Eighth Year of the Xianfeng Reign]

554
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,480
How much silver did His Highness get

555
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
from Taiping Bank that made him

556
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,720
pull off this stunt?

557
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,860
No one really knows, I think.

558
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,700
I just feel that

559
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,200
you've barely joined the Eight Families,

560
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,400
and already encountered such trouble.

561
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,750
It's fake.

562
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,920
Fake? What's fake?

563
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,390
Which businessman

564
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,000
would keep all their money

565
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,040
in one place?

566
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,480
Besides,

567
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,870
which draft bank

568
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,270
could even come up with

569
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,110
3 million taels in cash?

570
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,270
I think the demand for silver
is just a pretext.

571
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,880
Taiping Bank wants to

572
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,480
take over all the business

573
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,920
of our draft banks

574
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,560
for themselves.

575
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,310
That's their real goal.

576
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,720
Once these wealthy families
of the Eight Families

577
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,310
sign the loan,

578
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,160
they'll be as good as

579
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,830
meat on someone's board.

580
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,350
This Li Baiwan...

581
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,850
is quite cunning.

582
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,400
Is His Highness coming?

583
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,090
I don't know.

584
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Everyone,

585
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,400
please forgive me.

586
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
I had no choice

587
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,220
but to meet you in prison.

588
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,250
Li Wantang?

589
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,590
Mr. Li,

590
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,070
are you here to mock us?

591
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,200
I wouldn't dare.

592
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,040
We're all in the same line of trade.

593
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,680
I just came to see

594
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,170
if I could be of any help.

595
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,510
You could.

596
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
Hurry and tell His Highness

597
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,640
to release us.

598
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,590
We didn't kill anyone
or set fire to anything.

599
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,590
Keeping us here?

600
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,590
How undignified.

601
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,030
Since ancient times,
officials have had two mouths—

602
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,490
the words from the two mouths
are different.

603
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,440
Reasoning with them doesn't work.

604
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,350
I can pay the 24 million taels first

605
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,420
to help you

606
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,110
escape this disaster.

607
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,590
What do you think?

608
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,910
What a show of power.

609
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,530
The whole Qing Empire

610
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,380
only makes this much in a year.

611
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,130
What exactly are you trying to do?

612
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,870
Times are tough, Madam.

613
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,930
Those of us in business

614
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,210
need to work together even more.

615
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,680
I've been in the capital

616
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,810
for too long, rarely visiting Shanxi,

617
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,270
but I still have

618
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,640
some influential connections

619
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,200
at the imperial court.

620
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,830
Consider this 3 million taels

621
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,920
as my entry into the Eight Families.

622
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,550
If you have any obstacles

623
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,280
to overcome,

624
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,210
Taiping Bank

625
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,790
will help smooth them over.

626
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,790
I'm not trying to take over

627
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,960
the Eight Families.

628
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,260
It's out of respect for your predecessors,

629
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,720
offering my humble assistance.

630
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,350
That's a bit much.

631
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,130
That's not the right way to see it.

632
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,510
Fine.

633
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,720
If you don't agree,

634
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,350
I'll just return to the capital.

635
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,070
Fine.

636
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,270
Fine.

637
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,030
But the military situation is urgent,

638
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,400
and His Highness has a fiery temper.

639
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,440
When I came, he said,

640
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
"The Eight Families"

641
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,490
"hold King Li's Treasure."

642
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,720
"Why won't they let go of
a little profits?"

643
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,750
"It's infuriating."

644
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,790
King Li's Treasure?

645
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Every child in Shanxi

646
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,510
grows up knowing this story,

647
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,110
right?

648
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,790
Yes.

649
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,640
You actually believe that?

650
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,270
Weren't you here

651
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,800
for King Li's Treasure too?

652
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,560
Back then,
King Li's army was incredibly fierce.

653
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
They came out of the Qinling Mountains,

654
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,160
passed through the Taihang Mountains,

655
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,820
broke through Tongguan Pass,
flooded Kaifeng,

656
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,890
swept across the Yellow River,

657
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,960
and conquered the Central Plains.

658
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,480
But what happened

659
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,210
after they got all that wealth?

660
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,310
The generals indulged in pleasure,

661
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,590
the soldiers feared death,

662
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,670
and in the end

663
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,480
they came to a mysterious downfall.

664
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,540
What was it all for?

665
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,540
That's truly a terrible omen.

666
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,000
Those words are really insightful.

667
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,750
You're... Gu Pingyuan?

668
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,920
Yes.

669
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
My son mentions you often.

670
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,550
Your words show great insight.

671
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,440
However,

672
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,970
that's a scholar's perspective.

673
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,510
If you want to go into business
in the future,

674
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,680
that would be a big mistake.

675
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,280
What mistake?

676
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,270
Gold and silver

677
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,590
are public tools of the world.

678
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,310
They carry no inherent good or evil.

679
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,050
People are responsible

680
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,570
for their own mistakes.

681
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
Blaming money itself

682
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,750
makes no sense.

683
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,660
There is no money that cannot be used,

684
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,720
no person that cannot be employed.

685
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,270
Remember that.

686
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,640
I, Li Wantang,
pay respects to Your Highness.

687
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,000
Your plan didn't work.

688
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,460
The imperial court

689
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,270
ordered me to go to Shandong
to suppress the rebellion,

690
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,020
but I keep delaying my advance.

691
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,540
If I hold up
the imperial court's important matters,

692
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,670
who takes the blame,

693
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,270
you or me?

694
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,980
Your Highness.

695
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,900
These merchants are extremely cunning.

696
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,870
If we don't wait long enough,

697
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,510
this won't succeed.

698
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,580
Each of them

699
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,920
is well-connected
with powerful officials at court.

700
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,560
If they find a censor

701
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,200
and report me for bleeding the locals dry,

702
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
I won't be able to handle it.

703
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,740
Your Highness.

704
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm a businessman.

705
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,070
I understand businessmen best.

706
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,720
These wealthy people

707
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
may look generous from the outside,

708
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,150
but deep down,

709
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,650
every single one of them is stingy.

710
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,030
Their money
is practically glued to their ribs.

711
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,000
When you really ask them to hand it over,

712
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you'd need a pair of pliers
to pull it out,

713
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
with the strength

714
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,060
of ripping out their tendons.

715
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,440
Three million taels

716
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,000
won't come that easily.

717
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,070
If you don't push them

718
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,220
to the brink,

719
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,960
you'll never get what you want.

720
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,880
Does...

721
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,630
King Li's Treasure really exist

722
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,200
in this world?

723
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,710
Your Highness, look.

724
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,790
Pingyao and Taigu

725
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,860
are the birthplace of Shanxi's wealth.

726
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,110
In terms of transportation,

727
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,000
this region is surrounded by mountains.

728
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,920
As for resources,
there are no gold or silver mines.

729
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,200
As for talents,

730
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,260
the people here are honest and plain,

731
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,000
with no long tradition of doing business.

732
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Yet right after the Ming dynasty fell,

733
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,830
these two places suddenly became rich.

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,830
Now look here.

735
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,140
This is Taihang Mountains.

736
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,920
King Li fled along this route,

737
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,050
spreading out from here to both sides.

738
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,210
I'm certain...

739
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,220
the treasure

740
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,030
exists,

741
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,590
and

742
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,880
hasn't been much depleted.

743
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,900
As for the so‑called Eight Families,

744
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,360
they've been in business

745
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,320
for generations.

746
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,600
Business has its profits and losses.

747
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,510
How have they stayed prosperous

748
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,150
for over a hundred years?

749
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,820
Where did their capital come from?

750
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,800
How could this be possible?

751
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,320
Li Wantang,

752
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
Li Baiwan.

753
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,000
You'd better

754
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,060
not be wrong.

755
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,030
I burned the military supplies,

756
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,280
and that was your idea.

757
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,360
If I delay the military operations,

758
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,820
fail to find the treasure,

759
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,600
and lose the military supplies
on top of that,

760
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,610
then I'll have no choice

761
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,820
but to use your head

762
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,699
to make up for the loss.

763
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,830
Your Highness, don't worry.

764
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,550
Trust me.

765
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,070
By then,

766
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,290
the treasure will be yours,

767
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,690
and Shanxi will be mine.

768
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,000
As long as you understand what's at stake.

769
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,540
Within 3 days,

770
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,170
make up the money
for the military supplies.

771
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,280
No matter what,

772
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,370
I have to cross the Yellow River
into Shandong

773
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,520
and fight this battle.

774
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,440
Kang,

775
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,120
how could you be so careless

776
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,070
as to let

777
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,850
the military supplies

778
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,670
get burned?

779
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,610
You think I wanted them burned?

780
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,920
I never wanted to take the deal
in the first place.

781
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
The local officials

782
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
forced me to do it.

783
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,760
The fire

784
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,690
must have been set by them.

785
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,730
Putting everything together,

786
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,960
this might be a chain of traps.

787
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,070
They burned
His Highness's military supplies,

788
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,960
forced the Kang family
to sell their property,

789
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,590
then

790
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,150
arrested everyone—

791
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,390
step by step
leading to the situation we're in now.

792
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,830
Even if every one of you

793
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,630
could bring out

794
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,960
3 million taels in cash,

795
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,070
they would still

796
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,200
keep squeezing you.

797
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,410
Because what they truly want

798
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,260
is King Li's Treasure.

799
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,550
Why do people in this world

800
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,960
love to talk nonsense?

801
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,550
As the saying goes,

802
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,320
"a gentleman's only crime
is to carry a jade."

803
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,590
Whether we admit it or not,

804
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,960
as long as they believe we have it,

805
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,840
we're guilty.

806
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,960
I'm thinking

807
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,830
that this stalemate can't go on.

808
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,940
We should talk to His Highness

809
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,440
and have both sides take a step back.

810
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,860
Such childish talk.

811
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,510
Why would he take a step back?

812
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,400
To the government,

813
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,600
we're nothing but ants.

814
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,760
If they find out

815
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,440
we don't have

816
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,900
King Li's Treasure at all,

817
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,330
we probably won't even get
this spoiled porridge anymore.

818
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,670
That makes sense.

819
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,320
Do you

820
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,670
really have

821
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,920
3 million taels in cash

822
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,030
on hand right now?

823
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,150
We already said we don't.

824
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,190
The money in the draft banks
belongs to the depositors.

825
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,170
Our own capital

826
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,770
is all tied up in goods.

827
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You don't have it.

828
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,150
Even if you don't, we can't just

829
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,360
sit here and let them push us to death,

830
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,760
right?

831
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,010
Then tell us,

832
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
what should we do?

833
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,640
I've been thinking—

834
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
no matter how wealthy Li Wantang is,

835
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,940
at the end of the day

836
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,510
he's a merchant just like us.

837
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,770
Everything he's doing

838
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,670
is simply

839
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,840
to seize control of all the draft banks

840
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
in Shanxi.

841
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,160
Here's what we can do.

842
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,690
First, we give His Highness an IOU,

843
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,760
pretending we're willing
to take on this debt

844
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,290
and will deliver the silver

845
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,660
on the date he sets. His

846
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,690
His Highness

847
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,040
isn't a local official.

848
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,410
He could be called to war at any moment.

849
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,230
24 million taels of silver

850
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,190
can't be spent

851
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,230
in just one night.

852
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,360
As long as he gives us some time

853
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,280
to maneuver,

854
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,570
we can turn around

855
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,320
and go all out

856
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,440
against Li Wantang

857
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,160
and force him out of Shanxi.

858
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,230
I believe that

859
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,960
without His Highness backing him,

860
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,710
he wouldn't

861
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,020
have such great power.

862
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,510
No way.

863
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,230
It's easy for the Eight Families
to accept the debt,

864
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,940
but Li Wantang isn't a child.

865
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,760
He has plenty of methods.

866
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,330
If he makes this IOU

867
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,320
public

868
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,110
and announces that our draft banks

869
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,770
owe the imperial court money,

870
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,930
our credibility

871
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,550
will be ruined overnight.

872
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,920
The depositors will fear

873
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,030
we're using their money

874
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,230
to fill the imperial court's
bottomless pit.

875
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,430
If there's a bank run,

876
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,220
how could we handle it?

877
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,190
Who says business

878
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,990
must be done with actual silver?

879
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,110
Bro,

880
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,110
you've had too much spoiled porridge.

881
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,370
Your brain's gone off.

882
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,070
Madam.

883
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,760
Right now none of us
has a single coin on hand.

884
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,630
But I want to make a business deal

885
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,920
of 100 thousand taels with you.

886
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Is that possible?

887
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,110
For example,

888
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,390
this bowl in your hand

889
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,590
is worth 100 thousand taels.

890
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,190
I want it.

891
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,190
But all my money

892
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,480
is deposited with Manager Sun.

893
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,410
What should I do?

894
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,090
Manager Sun,

895
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,880
please give me 100 thousand taels.

896
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,210
I don't have any silver.

897
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,030
And even if I did, carrying it around

898
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,150
would be troublesome.

899
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,150
Your jade pendant looks quite nice.

900
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,120
Could you give it to me as a token?

901
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,800
That's easy.

902
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,650
Madam,

903
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,080
Manager Sun said

904
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,030
that as long as you see this token,

905
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,770
you'll know

906
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,670
that the 100 thousand taels

907
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,150
have already been credited
to your account.

908
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,080
With this token,

909
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,760
may I

910
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,150
take this bowl now?

911
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Was this agreed upon before?

912
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,110
When we conduct a real transaction,

913
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,280
we need a contract.

914
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,370
This way,

915
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,000
the Eight Families can handle

916
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,960
entries and records
from one account to another

917
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,320
without using a single tael

918
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,380
of cash.

919
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,510
If there's a bank run,

920
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,280
the combined strength
of the Eight Families

921
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,340
will be more than enough to handle it.

922
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,590
And if each family acts alone,

923
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,050
each can use its own credit

924
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,470
to guarantee the others.

925
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,580
Transaction records must be kept

926
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,280
for year-end accounting.

927
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,190
As long as the business

928
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,590
stays within the Eight Families,

929
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,530
one written note

930
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,430
can be worth a million in silver.

931
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,840
What do you think of this method?

932
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,690
But what if...

933
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,760
What if one family

934
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
breaks the rules?

935
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,440
What if one of them faces a bank run

936
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,490
and the others don't know in time,

937
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,030
and the funds
can't be shifted quickly enough?

938
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,560
And also,

939
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,610
what if all Eight Families

940
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,530
face a bank run at the same time?

941
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,360
We can appoint a chief manager

942
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,400
to check the funds every day

943
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,660
and publicly announce

944
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,030
an alliance of the Eight Families.

945
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,550
That way, even if a bank run happens,

946
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,210
the impact won't be too great.

947
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,320
Maybe one or two families will suffer,

948
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,230
but it shouldn't be too hard

949
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,590
to handle.

950
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,630
Good.

951
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,440
It's truly good.

952
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,400
If we had thought of

953
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,200
this earlier,

954
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,150
Li Baiwan

955
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,710
would never have gained
a foothold in Shanxi,

956
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,480
and we wouldn't have been

957
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,340
taken advantage of by outsiders.

958
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,400
So who will take

959
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,020
this chief manager position?

960
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,990
How about letting me try?

961
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,970
It's just for show anyway,

962
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,480
just to get through

963
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,080
our current difficulties.

964
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,180
That is,

965
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,400
if you consider me

966
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,530
one of your own.

967
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
We've been eating

968
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,280
spoiled porridge
from the same pot these past few days.

969
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,740
Of course you're one of us.

970
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,280
You're part of the Eight Families now.

971
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,280
I don't think letting him join

972
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,150
is a bad idea.

973
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,930
Alright.

974
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,150
You'll be the chief manager.

975
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,470
It was your idea.

976
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,400
Show everyone how it's done.

977
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,250
Does anyone have objections?

978
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,330
Alright.

979
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,880
In that case,

980
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,670
I hope by this time tomorrow,

981
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,760
we're no longer eating spoiled porridge.

982
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
I'll go negotiate with them.

983
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,510
It's settled.

984
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,820
Guards!

985
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,610
I need to see His Highness!

986
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Send out my order.

987
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,680
Deploy 20,000 troops

988
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,280
to Mount Liang area

989
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,790
and tighten the net.

990
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,620
Your Highness.

991
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,670
I would like to report to you on behalf of

992
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,330
the Eight Families of Hedong.

993
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,130
I request a private audience.

994
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,570
A private audience?

995
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,120
You think you deserve that?

996
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,400
I don't, of course.

997
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,300
But does silver

998
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,760
deserve it?
