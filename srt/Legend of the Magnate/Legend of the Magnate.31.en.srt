[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,000
My dear nephew.

4
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,830
Everyone already thinks

5
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,900
I've made a fortune here.

6
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,450
If I go and personally decide

7
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,560
to hand over the Lianghuai salt industry

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,840
to your family,

9
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,460
the memorials impeaching me

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,140
would pile up even higher than
the city wall.

11
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,229
However, if you render some merit,

12
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,350
then others won't have anything
to hold against you.

13
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,280
Don't you agree?

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,910
Am I right?

15
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,810
That's one way to look at it.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
But why did you involve

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
Gu Pingyuan in this?

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
What if he wins?

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,820
What then?

20
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,560
Mr. Gu represents

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,710
the small merchants
among the common people.

22
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,200
If Mr. Gu wins,

23
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,840
then the salt industry in Jiangnan

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,030
can no longer be dictated solely

25
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,360
by your Li family.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,370
You'll have to leave some room

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,730
for the merchants of Jiangnan to survive.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,700
If your family takes everything,

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,060
it wouldn't look good for me

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,360
as the Viceroy of Liangjiang

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,020
to do nothing about it, right?

32
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,240
Sir, I have one more matter.

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,680
If this coastal embankment

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,540
were to be funded by our Li family,

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
all expenses

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,110
would naturally be covered entirely by us.

37
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,520
But how should Mr. Gu's share

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,850
of the costs be handled?

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,120
Of course we'll wait for
the imperial court's approval.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,000
Court approval? I'm afraid that
even if we wait until next year

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,430
when the floods come again,
the funds still won't be released.

42
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,960
I understand what you mean, Sir.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,130
I dare not delay.

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,710
I'll go to Nantong right away

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,400
to inspect the damage to
the coastal embankment

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,260
and make a plan.

47
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,290
I take my leave.

48
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,110
Please proceed, my dear nephew.

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,620
I'll thank you in advance

50
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,610
on behalf of the people of Nantong.

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,190
Mr. Gu,

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
did I say you could leave?

53
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,079
But I need to go to Nantong
for the field inspection.

54
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,270
Don't make excuses.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,870
The moment you two walk out of this door,

56
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,150
you'll definitely start calling me names.

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,079
Come on, inside.

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll give you the money for
the coastal embankment repairs.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,870
I've already mortgaged

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,530
all my properties in Beijing.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,800
We may not be as rich as the Li family,

62
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,910
but you must remember:

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,000
the money you're receiving is clean,

64
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,120
and you must make sure
its use is clean as well.

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,520
This...

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,910
Li Qin is right.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Even when it floods again next year,

68
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,410
the imperial court's money
still won't arrive.

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,000
But the common people
can't wait that long.

70
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,310
I won't let you down, Sir.

71
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,830
Remember this

72
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,150
about me:

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,520
I've been simple-minded my whole life,

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,310
and my learning and literacy
have never matched others.

75
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,520
But there's one thing—

76
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,280
I take one step at a time,

77
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,840
neither deceiving myself

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,590
nor others,

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,680
and once I set out to do something,
I see it through.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,000
If you rush and push for progress,

81
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
it will only lead to grave mistakes.

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,120
Are you inspecting the coastal embankment
or racing horses?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,190
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,040
That old man is now

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
treating us like three-year-olds.

86
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,070
He's already started

87
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,130
sowing discord between us in public.

88
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,000
Here's what I thought.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
After I left just now,

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,870
he definitely started muttering about me
behind my back again, right?

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,920
Didn't you ask him for me

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,830
why he wouldn't help me

93
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,120
with the salt field matter?

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,720
I did.

95
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,630
He said your family

96
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,270
was just taking advantage of
others' misfortune.

97
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,390
Taking advantage of others' misfortune?

98
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,030
Nonsense.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Merchants buy low and sell high.

100
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,580
This has been

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,630
the natural order of things
since ancient times.

102
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,070
If I preach morality to them every day,

103
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,870
I'll be left with nothing to eat.

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,140
Let's go check the coastal embankment.

105
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,070
This matter is quite troublesome.

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,560
Gu,

107
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,460
give me your word first

108
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,590
so I can feel at ease.

109
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,480
Go ahead.

110
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,310
My father asked me to handle

111
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,360
the salt field matter in Lianghuai.

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,470
This is my only chance

113
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,800
to make something of myself.

114
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,060
So I've been thinking,

115
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,560
no matter what it costs,

116
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,850
I have to win

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and get this done.

118
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,050
Could you give me some leeway?

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,310
It's not a matter of giving you leeway.

120
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:43,920
Well,

121
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,390
I've never done
any salt field business before, either.

122
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,380
But as you said,

123
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,030
we're not three-year-olds.

124
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,870
He wants to trap us

125
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,950
in a chicken coop,

126
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,830
but we

127
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,000
can't just let him manipulate us,

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,480
right?

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,580
Then let's settle it this way:

130
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
for the height of the coastal embankment,

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,240
give me some concession.

132
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,600
The imperial court's standard

133
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,360
is 11 meters.

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,510
I'll raise it by

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
an extra 3.3 meters on top of that.

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,380
Is that acceptable?

137
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,600
I'll thank you in advance

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
on behalf of the people of Nantong then.

139
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,830
I am Gu Pingyuan.

140
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,660
I am Li Qin, candidate intendant
of Jiangning.

141
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,800
[Marshal]

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,560
Come on in.

143
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,150
[Marshal]

144
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,480
Marshal Jiu.

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,730
Marshal Jiu.

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,750
Whenever it's time to pay the troops,

147
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,720
I get anxious.

148
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,830
You two

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,090
seem to have much free time.

150
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,159
Marshal Jiu.

151
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,190
The Viceroy of Liangjiang has tasked us

152
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,000
with repairing the coastal embankment
in Nantong,

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
but now Nantong is nearly deserted.

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,480
We can't even gather enough workers,

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,360
so we've come specifically to trouble you,
Marshal Jiu,

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,160
hoping to borrow some manpower.

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,390
Well, we won't be using your soldiers

158
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,120
for free.

159
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,750
Stonemasons and carpenters
will be paid

160
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,960
300 maces per day,

161
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,160
and laborers 150 per day.

162
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,460
Paid daily for work completed,

163
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,950
with meals and lodging
provided on-site.

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,660
Borrow soldiers?

165
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,070
Come on, just take them away.

166
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,400
Take as many as you need.

167
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,900
That's excellent!

168
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,560
I've been worried about

169
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,960
owing my soldiers' pay
for over half a year.

170
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,750
They've been grumbling every day,

171
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,659
on the verge of mutiny against me.

172
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
If you can take them off my hands,

173
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,250
I'll thank you both eternally.

174
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,360
Please.

175
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,560
That's not what His Excellency said.

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,950
He told us that
if we ran into manpower problems,

177
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,150
we should come to you.

178
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,170
I'm in urgent need of money now

179
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,670
so I can dismiss them quickly

180
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
before they cause trouble here.

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,820
Do you still dare to take them?

182
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,120
But...

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,360
Sir.

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,390
Then what do you suggest we do?

185
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,610
This isn't something money can solve.

186
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,750
If once the work starts,

187
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,720

As for the coastal embankment
in disrepair in Nantong,

375
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,480
your esteemed son has bravely
taken on this immense responsibility

376
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,320
and has already gone to the site
for inspection.

377
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,910
He's even planning to pay

378
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,980
out of his own pocket for the repairs.

379
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,670
I've already submitted the memorial

380
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,530
recommending him for this merit.

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,000
You may be able to fool him,

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,150
but not me.

383
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,910
He's not an official.

384
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,720
Even if a memorial for merit is submitted,

385
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,440
he won't receive any reward.

386
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,390
Your Excellency's aim

387
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,240
in draining his money

388
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,270
was to lure me out—

389
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,080
and here I am.

390
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
Confucius once said,

391
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,670
"to speak to those who cannot respond

392
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
is a mistake of words;

393
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,430
to remain silent
before those who can respond

394
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,890
is a mistake of judgment."

395
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,750
Your Excellency,

396
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,630
which mistake do you plan to make?

397
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,030
You, oh you.

398
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,790
Li Million,

399
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,950
you're still the same as always.

400
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,270
Alright then.

401
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,910
Let's be frank and open with each other.

402
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,960
All the revenue
from the Lianghuai salt fields

403
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,670
has been going to your Li family,

404
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,930
leaving the Jiangnan region lifeless.

405
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,530
At the very least, show some mercy

406
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,850
and leave a little for the local area.

407
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,550
The money made in Lianghuai
should be used in Lianghuai.

408
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,550
Your Excellency,

409
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,840
please do not interfere.

410
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,220
Before leaving the capital,

411
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,970
His Highness instructed me

412
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,910
that as long as you can ensure this area

413
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,730
remains peaceful for 3 years,

414
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,320
he'll find a way

415
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,350
to get you to the capital
to enjoy a life of ease.

416
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,140
Don't get involved

417
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,300
in the salt field matter anymore.

418
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,720
Eat slowly.

419
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,190
Don't bite your fingers.

420
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,890
Look at you,

421
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,870
so busy every day.

422
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,030
We barely even see you.

423
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,200
You don't know the whole story.

424
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,640
The coastal embankment in Nantong

425
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,750
has been washed away,

426
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
and the entire land

427
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,070
has been flooded by seawater.

428
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,890
The common people are fleeing everywhere

429
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,020
with nothing to eat.

430
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,200
When we first heard

431
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,710
you were going to Nantong,

432
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,920
Yu'er and I were actually happy about it.

433
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,050
Who would have imagined such a big city

434
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,330
would end up in such a terrible state?

435
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,350
When the major construction starts,

436
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,310
I'll take you both

437
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,760
to Nantong for a trip.

438
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,440
We'll also visit nearby places

439
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,110
like Zhenjiang

440
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,160
and Jinshan Temple.

441
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,360
Don't worry, Mother.

442
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
You want to go on a trip that much?

443
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,560
I came all the way here with you—

444
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,830
was it just to sit in a different place?

445
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,690
Sorry for that.

446
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,670
Pingyuan.

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,530
Mr. Su from Nantong is here.

448
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,200
Mr. Su.

449
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,440
-I pay my respects to you, Mr. Gu.
-Mr. Su! Mr. Su.

450
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,240
Please get up.

451
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,200
If there's anything, you could have
just sent someone to inform me.

452
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Why did you come

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,880
all this way in person?

454
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,110
This is only right.

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,100
Well, Pingwen,

456
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,200
hurry and clean up these dishes.

457
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Make some good tea

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
and prepare some fruit

459
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,070
for Mr. Su.

460
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,280
Mr. Su,

461
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,510
please wait a second.

462
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,640
I'll go get changed.

463
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,440
Mr. Su.

464
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,160
Apples.

465
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,640
Tea.

466
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,550
Thank you.

467
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,200
I'll put it here.

468
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,460
Please have a rest.

469
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,500
Let me help you.

470
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
Pingyuan.

471
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,340
Six apples,

472
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,920
eaten in one go.

473
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,290
Go get some more snacks.

474
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Sorry to keep you waiting,

475
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,830
Mr. Su.

476
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,680
I've traveled hundreds of miles

477
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,490
and am utterly exhausted.

478
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,880
Please forgive me, Sir.

479
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,750
Please don't call me that.

480
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,410
I don't deserve such respect.

481
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,110
But it's not that far

482
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,510
from Nantong to Jiangning.

483
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,110
How could you have traveled
hundreds of miles?

484
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,640
I've been running around
borrowing grain everywhere.

485
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,680
This year, life in Nantong

486
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,030
has truly become unbearable.

487
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,630
I understand.

488
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,510
This year has indeed been
full of disasters.

489
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,720
But since I've agreed

490
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,070
to repair the coastal embankment,

491
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,590
I'll definitely provide Nantong

492
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,920
with a proper solution.

493
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,080
Pardon me for my incompetence,

494
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,910
but there's one matter
I can only ask of you.

495
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Please, sit down.

496
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,550
Sorry for embarrassing myself.

497
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,590
The reason I came here

498
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,150
is mainly to ask you, Mr. Gu,

499
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,440
to submit a petition for me.

500
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,440
Nantong has always been prosperous
since ancient times.

501
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,500
If not for this flood

502
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,440
and the collapsed coastal embankment,

503
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,550
we wouldn't be suffering like this.

504
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,110
Many people in Nantong

505
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,260
have started selling their children.

506
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,760
I understand.

507
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,480
So Mr. Su, what do you

508
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,170
specifically plan to do next?

509
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,370
Right now,

510
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,060
in this small city of Nantong,

511
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,000
grain merchants from 5 provinces
have all gathered,

512
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,960
and the rice price is extremely high.

513
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,880
What I'm thinking is that

514
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,280
I hope the Viceroy
can send some troops here

515
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,590
to post a notice,

516
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,130
prohibiting the merchants from
hoarding grain.

517
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,000
Mr. Su,

518
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm not an official.

519
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,750
But when it comes to business,

520
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not totally an amateur.

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,670
You want the Viceroy

522
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,160
to send troops to post a notice.

523
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,960
For one thing,

524
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
the Viceroy might not agree;

525
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,280
for another,

526
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,200
those rice merchants

527
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
might just pack up and leave.

528
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,440
The rice belongs to them,

529
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
so they can set the price

530
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
however they like.

531
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,900
We have no control over it.

532
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,240
I'm about to be

533
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,070
driven to death by those people.

534
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
Those rice merchants

535
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,450
are all extremely wealthy.

536
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,160
As a mere county magistrate,

537
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,810
I really can't afford to offend them.

538
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,980
How about this, Mr. Su?

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,070
Stay here

540
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,930
for the night.

541
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,510
First thing tomorrow morning,

542
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,640
I'll go deliver this petition for you.

543
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,680
And I'll talk to those grain merchants

544
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,310
from the 5 provinces while I'm at it.

545
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay.

546
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,790
Pingwen.

547
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,020
Are the snacks ready?

548
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes, Gu.

549
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,960
I've made a pot of plain noodles,

550
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,220
sliced two cucumbers,

551
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,800
and shredded a salted duck.

552
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,750
I wonder if this suits

553
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,790
your taste, Mr. Su?

554
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,210
O-Of course.

555
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,960
It suits perfectly.

556
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,620
Mr. Su.

557
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,280
Please.

558
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,790
Okay.

559
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,230
One really can't go without eating, right?

560
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,090
Indeed.

561
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,100
I heard the people in Nantong

562
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,890
have started selling their children?

563
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,510
Yes.

564
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,280
Let's go.

565
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,310
Take me there.

566
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,330
For what?

567
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,480
You want to draw your sword
and kill some of them?

568
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,440
So you won't do anything about
those people?

569
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,840
What a corrupt official.

570
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,640
Could you not scold me right away?

571
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,830
I'm not even an official—

572
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,920
how could I be a corrupt one?

573
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,780
If you're not a corrupt official,

574
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,360
then you're a profiteer.

575
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,150
If you want to talk about profiteers,

576
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,720
those bastards are the real profiteers.

577
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,830
They know clearly
that the people in Nantong

578
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,750
are starving to death,

579
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,200
yet they're still hoarding goods there

580
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,600
without any compassion.

581
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,440
Tonight,

582
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,490
let me, the corrupt official,

583
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,380
think about

584
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,910
how to punish those profiteers carefully.

585
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,560
I'm so tired.

586
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,300
Take a look at this.

587
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
To be fair,

588
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,150
this Su Yuhua is a good official.

589
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,680
He's an old provincial candidate.

590
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,590
After all these years,

591
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,920
he's only managed to
become a county magistrate.

592
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,030
After more than a decade in office,

593
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,440
all he has is this official robe.

594
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,680
He can't afford to give bribes,

595
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,790
so he can't get promoted.

596
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,030
He treats the common people well though.

597
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,840
I don't want to contradict him,

598
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,000
but what nonsense is he talking about?

599
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,310
He wants me to send troops
to suppress the rice market?

600
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,400
Does that even make sense?

601
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
If they don't want to sell,

602
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
you might enter through the front door,

603
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
and they'd slip out the back.

604
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,240
What charge am I supposed to
bring against them?

605
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,550
If you don't take care of

606
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,680
Mr. Su's matter,

607
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,160
then there's no point

608
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,550
in repairing
Nantong's coastal embankment anymore.

609
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,790
What kind of talk is that?

610
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,590
Repairing this coastal embankment

611
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,550
is meant to save the people from disaster.

612
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,440
People in Nantong are already
trading their children for food.

613
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,480
If you don't help them,

614
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,640
by the time the coastal embankment
is repaired,

615
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,030
everyone will already be dead.

616
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,160
What's the point of repairing it then?

617
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,400
Indeed.

618
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,310
You have a point.

You really can't say
there's nothing you can do.

the coastal embankment here,

as well.

00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,160
can we better gather the manpower,

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,650
I'll make sure it's spent where it counts.

934
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,690
You think I'm making a donation?

935
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,320
No way.

936
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,310
Count me in as a shareholder.

937
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,290
I want to make some profit too.

938
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
The sage once said,

939
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,190
if you don't take advantage when you can,

940
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
you're a fool.

941
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,970
The sage is truly

942
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,890
brilliant.

943
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,280
The show is already over,

944
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,010
yet

945
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,640
he's still putting on airs.

946
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,190
Mr. Chang.

947
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,960
Please sit down.

948
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,220
I'll get you some rice.

949
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Where's Pingwen?

950
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm here, Mr. Chang.

951
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,100
The two of us

952
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,650
came all the way here,

953
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,400
haven't even settled down yet,

954
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
and now we have to go back.

955
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Isn't this Yang Ten-Million

956
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,020
going too far?

957
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,450
That's exactly right.

958
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,440
With all the expenses for food and lodging
on the road,

959
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,230
if they offer lower than 3 taels,

960
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,190
even a penny less,

961
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,480
we can't sell it.

962
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,010
That's settled then.

963
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,840
As the old saying goes,

964
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,630
"if you can't play the part well,
better not to play it at all."

965
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,110
Mr. Chang.

966
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,030
You were amazing.

967
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,110
Master Gu, was it good?

968
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,110
It was excellent.

969
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,070
I'm exhausted.

970
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,670
Pingyuan,

971
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,230
why aren't you praising me?

972
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,080
You didn't even act.
Why should I praise you?

973
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,190
Alright, alright, good job.

974
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,790
Let's eat.

975
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,280
Everyone.

976
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,430
Today, with just a small trick,

977
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,280
we've earned

978
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
600,000 taels of silver.

979
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
Weren't you supposed to be
saving the people?

980
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,530
How did you end up making money?

981
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,840
That Yang Ten-Million

982
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,510
feeds on human flesh
and drinks human blood.

983
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,400
He bought up all the rice

984
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,110
in Nantong,

985
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,360
thinking

986
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,290
he's so capable.

987
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,100
Mr. Liao,

988
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,280
it's your turn now.

989
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,670
Q-Quickly, give me

990
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,470
your costume.

991
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,000
No need.

992
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,320
I had one made

993
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
specially for your size.

994
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,190
Once you put it on,

995
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,320
you'll look even more impressive
than Mr. Chang.

996
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,920
This time,

997
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,630
we need to make two more shipments.

998
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,760
Tomorrow, I'll allocate 600,000 dan
to you;

999
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,670
and the day after, a million dan.

1000
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,410
Remember:

1001
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,070
all has to be sold at 3 taels of silver,

1002
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,400
not a single penny less.

1003
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,990
That Yang Ten-Million isn't a fool.

1004
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,160
Can he handle

1005
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,360
buying so much rice?

1006
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,400
He may not be a fool,

1007
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,720
but he's too greedy.

1008
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,400
However much I feed him now,

1009
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,920
he'll have to swallow it all.

1010
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,650
I'll stuff him until he bursts.

1011
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,970
I have a few friends

1012
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,730
in the rice business in Anhui.

1013
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,030
They can pool

1014
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,740
another 2 million dan.

1015
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,540
Excellent.

1016
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,990
Then I won't trouble another person
for this matter.

1017
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,760
From acting to pooling grain,

1018
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
you handle it all.

1019
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,710
Here's what I thought:

1020
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,760
after we get this done,

1021
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,800
I want to set aside
500,000 taels of silver

1022
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,880
to buy jewelry for Miss Liao.

1023
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,470
What do you think?

1024
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,780
F-Five hundred thousand?

1025
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
That's generous,

1026
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,890
but with Mr. Chang here,

1027
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,670
taking so much money

1028
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,780
makes me a bit uncomfortable.

1029
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,480
Then let's make it less.

1030
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,080
No, no, no.

1031
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,170
It's settled then.

1032
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,030
You're selling much more than me,

1033
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,090
so you should act more convincingly.

1034
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,580
Today,

1035
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,160
I finally got to see

1036
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,150
how despicable Yang Ten-Million was.

1037
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,630
If you didn't need to keep up this act,

1038
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,030
I would've smashed his nose
with one punch.

1039
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,990
He's just a bad guy,

1040
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,160
a complete villain.

1041
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,590
After I finish eating,

1042
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,590
I'll explain everything to you,

1043
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,650
then you'll know how to deal with him.

1044
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,390
Please skip the meal

1045
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,690
and teach me now.

1046
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,590
After you've taught me, then you can eat.

1047
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,710
Let's go have a drink.

1048
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,400
-Come on.
-Alright, alright.

1049
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,930
Let's go.

1050
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,710
Come on.

1051
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,320
Profiteer?

1052
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,120
Time to sleep.

1053
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,880
I knew

1054
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
you'd scold me again.

1055
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,180
That you remember quite clearly.

1056
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,210
You think I want to keep

1057
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,780
all this money for myself?

1058
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,840
I just hope

1059
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,710
the people of Nantong

1060
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,970
can have a better life.

1061
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,110
If every

1062
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,320
worker repairing the coastal embankment

1063
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,550
could earn two more candareens daily

1064
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,710
to support their families,

1065
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,030
once the rice price stabilizes

1066
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,440
and the coastal embankment is repaired,

1067
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,370
Nantong will regain its vitality.

1068
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,960
As the saying goes,

1069
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,230
once you set out to do something,
you must see it through;

1070
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,890
and once you get it done,
you must leave a legacy.

1071
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,300
Except for you,

1072
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,220
I don't want to be criticized
by anyone else.

1073
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
Well, profiteer, you're

1074
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,680
quite the grudge-holder, aren't you?

1075
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:17,400
♪ A single straight purple bamboo ♪

1076
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:23,480
♪ Give the flute made of it to the baby ♪

1077
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,150
♪ The flute to the mouth ♪

1078
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,840
♪ The mouth to the flute ♪

1079
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:31,800
Master.

1080
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,070
♪ A new tune flows from the flute ♪

1081
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,070
Another rice merchant
has arrived in Nantong.

1082
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,000
He's from Anhui.

1083
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,280
Anhui?

1084
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,360
Don't cause trouble for me here.

1085
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,030
How much rice did he bring?

1086
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,800
600,000 dan.

1087
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,730
That's quite a lot.

1088
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,840
I heard there's

1089
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,700
another 2 to 3 million dan coming.

1090
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,240
600,000 dan

1091
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,320
and another 3 mill...

1092
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,360
Are you sure you heard it right?

1093
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,130
Absolutely.

1094
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,090
So it's 3.6 million dan?

1095
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,760
So much rice—

1096
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,070
how could the small city of Nantong

1097
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,110
possibly consume it all?
