00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,860
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,430
You all, sit down!

4
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,509
I know

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,990
that wearing this outfit

6
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,090
dishonors our fallen brothers.

7
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
But if I don't wear it,

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,140
I'd be betraying the friends
who risked their lives to save me.

9
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
Neither could I save you all!

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,290
I know none of you fear death.

11
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,770
Back on the day the city fell,

12
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,190
we had already

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,520
given up our lives.

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,960
But today is different—

15
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,120
the battle is over.

16
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,160
The battles of our entire lives are over!

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,000
From now on,

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,880
none of you are allowed to
touch weapons again.

19
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,360
Wash yourselves clean,

20
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,000
shave your heads,

21
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,310
and go home.

22
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,750
Those who were craftsmen,
return to your craft.

23
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,150
Those who were farmers,
go back to farming.

24
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,250
The land has been left fallow.

25
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,500
You'll need to plow it thoroughly.

26
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,000
Sow the seeds,

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
and live to see next year.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
You must believe—

29
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,680
believe that there is justice
in this world.

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,850
If you don't believe it,

31
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,140
then treat it this way.

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
-General!
-General!

33
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,590
Thank you for your hard work, Marshal Jiu.

34
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,250
I'll go handle the aftermath.

35
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,190
Hold on.

36
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,470
Thirty li to the west,

37
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,010
there's one of my camps.

38
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,580
The travel permits and money
have been prepared.

39
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,630
They can shave their heads,
change clothes,

40
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,160
take the money, and go home.

41
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,710
No one will stop them.

42
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,160
Marshal Jiu, thank you for
keeping your word.

43
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,660
Li Cheng... I mean,

44
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,010
General Li. I still need his head.

45
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,990
After all, I was the one
who took him away.

46
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,920
If the higher-ups ask about it,

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,630
I won't be able to handle it.

48
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Of course.

49
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,430
General Li's head

50
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,950
is worth a red official's hat.

51
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,750
By order of Marshal Jiu:

52
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,560
the main force is to move 30 li west.

53
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,870
Shave your heads, wash your faces,

54
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,159
collect your travel permits
and expenses,

55
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,890
and then return to
your respective hometowns.

56
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,270
Yes.

57
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,350
I've already made all preparations.

58
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,480
Ms. Bai.

59
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,600
If you feel sad, it's okay to cry.

60
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,360
I won't cry.

61
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,310
I always knew

62
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,090
this day would come.

63
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,130
He got what he wanted.

64
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,970
I'm happy for him.

65
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,300
He gave up his life

66
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,940
so that everyone else could survive.

67
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Such compassion

68
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,960
is something you should tell
your child about someday.

69
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,340
Someone!

70
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,490
Take him away!

71
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,540
What are you doing?

72
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,230
Where are you taking him?

73
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
Where are you taking him?

74
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,930
They will give him a proper burial!

75
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,000
No, they won't!

76
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,930
They won't!

77
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,800
Put him down!

78
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,120
-Where are you taking him?
-Gu Pingyuan!

79
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,060
All they want is his head!

80
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,730
Those despicable people!

81
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,610
Where are you taking him?

82
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,210
You...

83
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,630
Where are you taking him?

84
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,390
Let go!

85
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,810
Ms. Bai still hasn't woken up,

86
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,790
and Pingyuan won't do any work either.

87
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
The whole household
is relying on me alone right now,

88
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,480
using me like an ox.

89
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,030
If my legs were in good shape,

90
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,730
I'd be the one taking care of things.

91
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,880
Nagging so much.

92
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
You see, when others become officials,

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,320
it's all fancy sedan chairs

94
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,630
and mountains of gold and silver.

95
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,030
But what about Pingyuan?

96
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,720
Becoming an official

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,960
almost killed him.

98
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,390
He just doesn't have a brain like mine.

99
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,910
If I, Gu Pingwen, were to be an official,

100
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,670
not to mention anything else—

101
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,730
I'd first get myself two concubines.

102
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,410
Go dream on.

103
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,370
Mother,

104
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,060
can I discuss something with you?

105
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,520
You know,

106
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm a grown man,

107
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,670
and taking care of a female guest
every day—

108
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,910
it's also inconvenient for her.

109
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,720
If you ask me,

110
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,550
we should invite Miss Liao
to come help out.

111
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,350
It would be better for everyone.

112
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,270
Doctor,

113
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,670
thank you for your hard work.

114
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,200
Please,

115
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,580
come and have some tea.

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,200
Doctor,

117
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,990
how's her condition?

118
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,750
Her lungs and internal organs

119
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,330
are cold above and inflamed below.

120
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,260
The inflammation won't break out.

121
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,400
Ms. Bai just refuses to wake up.

122
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,640
She's heartbroken.

123
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,310
You're just a kid.

124
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,940
You wouldn't understand.

125
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,330
Go check on Ms. Bai.

126
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
Doctor,

127
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,670
is there any good solution?

128
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,730
Her pulse

129
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,910
is even weaker than
an 80-year-old man's.

130
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,370
When someone wants to die,

131
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,720
even legendary physicians
like Bian Que and Hua Tuo

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
would be at a loss.

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,520
Ms. Bai.

134
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,500
It's okay. It's okay.

135
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,690
Ms. Bai.

136
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,630
It's okay now.

137
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,510
It's okay.

138
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,240
Father.

139
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,550
Father,

140
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,030
I finally get to see you.

141
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,030
Father.

142
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,910
Silly kid.

143
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,630
Why are you crying?

144
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,000
Did you have a nightmare?

145
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,750
Yes.

146
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,600
Where am I?

147
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,570
Don't you recognize it?

148
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,600
All over this mountain

149
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,400
is our family's tea plantation.

150
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,240
I often drink tea here.

151
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,460
You'd promise

152
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,000
to play Go with me,

153
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
but before we could set up the pieces,

154
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
you'd fall asleep.

155
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,320
Did I sleep for long?

156
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,750
About the time it takes
for an incense stick to burn.

157
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,550
What's wrong?

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
What did you dream about?

159
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,490
I dreamed that

160
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,440
suddenly there was chaos and war.

161
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,120
Yimei!

162
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,670
I was captured

163
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
and taken to the enemy's military camp.

164
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,600
I dreamed that Gu came back

165
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,440
and rescued me from the camp.

166
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,600
I dreamed...

167
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
It really is you.

168
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,940
I prayed to it every day...

169
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,790
I dreamed...

170
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,910
Just to let me see you again.

171
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,150
For that, I'd even accept the fate

172
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,480
of being torn into pieces with no regrets.

173
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,840
I fell in love with a general.

174
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,090
All of you...

175
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,360
All of you were mad at me.

176
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,840
Later, he died.

177
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,240
Everyone died.

178
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,010
And I was pregnant with his child.

179
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,140
Father.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,310
All of that was just a dream,

181
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,910
right?

182
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,750
I've never had

183
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,000
such a long dream before.

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
I was terrified.

185
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,630
Now I feel

186
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,930
as if I've been reborn.

187
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:35,970
Father.

188
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,030
I won't make you angry

189
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,270
ever again.

190
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,440
Good girl.

191
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,720
Let me ask you something:

192
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,970
if that general were to come back,

193
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,930
you would still go with him, wouldn't you?

194
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,270
Even though it was a dream,

195
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,790
your feelings were real.

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,670
Kid.

197
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,720
I won't be angry with you.

198
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,240
No matter what you do,

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,540
as long as you live this life in peace,

200
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,200
my wish will be fulfilled.

201
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,240
Who is it?

202
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,290
Coming. Coming.

203
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,750
Mr. Hou Er.

204
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,340
Old Master Hu.

205
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,840
My brother isn't feeling well.

206
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,870
He can't receive visitors.

207
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,280
We came here

208
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,690
specially to see Mr. Gu.

209
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,550
Since that's the case,

210
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,670
I won't go in.

211
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,600
Hou Er.

212
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,630
The gifts.

213
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Old Master Hu.

214
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,690
[Fortune and Peace]

215
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,790
Mr. Gu.

216
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,360
You...

217
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,330
Why are you up?

218
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,390
Weren't you feeling unwell?

219
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,990
This is...

220
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,790
Old Master Hu,

221
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,940
sorry for neglecting you.

222
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,080
Come on, let's talk inside.

223
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,140
Alright, alright.

224
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
Old Master Hu,

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,630
whatever you have to say,

226
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,160
please speak frankly.

227
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,720
I heard

228
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,440
you have an old connection

229
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,690
with Li Wantang's family in the capital?

230
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,750
I wouldn't call it an old connection.

231
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,340
I am somewhat acquainted

232
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,610
with his son, Li Qin,

233
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,000
but Li Wantang

234
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,589
is the wealthiest man
north of the Yangtze River.

235
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,160
How could I ever associate with
someone of his status?

236
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,000
I see.

237
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,270
Your "Top Tea Under Heaven"

238
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,329
has really angered him.

239
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,750
He's gathered many tea merchants,

240
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,349
and now they're all united against us.

241
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,680
Not a single tael of Anhui tea

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,740
is allowed to be purchased this year.

243
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,960
Li Wantang actually
has that much influence?

244
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,480
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

245
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
Well, Mr. Li Million

246
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,830
is prominent and wealthy.

247
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,550
And we

248
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,050
have known each other for quite some time.

249
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,410
How about we

250
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,450
ask Mr. Li to come out and mediate?

251
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,010
After all, Gu Pingyuan's matter

252
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,570
is his personal affair.

253
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Dragging all of us

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
Anhui tea merchants into it

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,830
seems rather inappropriate,
don't you think?

256
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,780
-Yes, exactly.
-That's right.

257
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,110
His personal affair?

258
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,350
This plaque is hanging here
in the Tea Merchants' Association.

259
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,640
How do you explain that?

260
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,240
No, no, no.

261
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,280
It's not what you think it is.

262
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,540
The Empress Dowager

263
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,160
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

264
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
bestowed this plaque upon us.

265
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,720
We didn't ask for it.

266
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,000
It's like a pie falling from the sky
and hitting us on the head—

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,450
we've got no say in it.

268
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,290
Well...

269
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,880
And now, it's brought resentment

270
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,030
against us Anhui tea merchants.

271
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,270
We feel wronged too.

272
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
That's right.

273
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,080
Exactly.

274
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,840
I understand

275
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,200
your reasoning,

276
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,790
but those tea merchants won't accept it.

277
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,790
They lost so much money,

278
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,380
and your Anhui tea got all the glory.

279
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,350
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

280
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,750
In times like these,

281
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,960
with war and chaos everywhere,

282
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,040
wherever you go,

283
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,820
money does all the talking.

284
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,250
My father

285
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,370
doesn't have that much influence.

286
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,970
I've come here this time

287
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,790
to discuss

288
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,110
with all of you.

289
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,350
If, in the future,

290
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,550
you still want to work

291
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,640
with the Li family,

292
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,520
you'll have to give us a discount

293
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,240
on this batch of spring tea.

294
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,040
That Li Wantang has connections
with foreigners.

295
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,480
They've secretly

296
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
formed some kind of

297
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,280
offense-defense alliance.

298
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,310
Those foreigners

299
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,540
aren't buying even a single tael of tea
from us this year.

300
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,640
This is really bad.

301
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,400
Hold on, Old Master Hu.

302
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,000
Though my family has grown tea
for generations,

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,660
I don't have

304
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,760
much experience in selling it.

305
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
I'll need you to teach me.

306
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,160
Well,

307
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,160
in previous years, our Anhui tea

308
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
had three destinations.

309
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,510
First,

310
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,960
it went to tea shops across the country.

311
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,350
Second, a portion

312
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
was sold to Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang.

313
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,160
And third—

314
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,530
which is the majority—

315
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,120
was shipped to Guangzhou,

316
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,350
where the 13 Trading Houses would handle

317
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,480
consignment sales to the foreigners.

318
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,610
Our entire Anhui Province's tax revenue

319
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,270
and the people's livelihood

320
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,400
depend on this.

321
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,400
Now that we're at war,

322
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,990
the imperial court has allowed us

323
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,480
to ship it to nearby Shanghai.

324
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,440
But this year, the Shanghai contract

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,510
has been delayed.

326
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,850
After looking into it,

327
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,880
we found out that it had been

328
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
intercepted by Li Wantang.

329
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,830
He's obtained the exclusive right
to trade tea,

330
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,480
so the foreign merchants
won't do business with us anymore.

331
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,070
We've thought about it again and again,

332
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,110
and there was really no other way.

333
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,550
That's why they sent me
to come talk to you.

334
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,110
What's the point of talking to me?

335
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,590
I've never dealt with foreigners before.

336
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,050
You're different from us.

337
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,160
After all, you hold an official position.

338
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,960
You could at least mediate for us

339
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,810
and help us Anhui tea merchants

340
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,400
to...

341
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,230
To overcome this crisis.

342
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,310
As a Pacification Commissioner,

343
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,750
I do have to deal with

344
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,440
officials,

345
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,880
but I myself

346
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,940
am not an official.

347
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,580
As you know,

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm an exile

349
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,440
who escaped from Ningguta.

350
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,240
I've been through hell and back.

351
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
Now that I've finally made it back
to Huizhou,

352
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,970
just being able to enjoy peace

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
and take care of my mother at home

354
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,820
makes me completely content.

355
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,430
As for becoming an official,

356
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,430
or being like you,

357
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,510
managing so many tea merchants,

358
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,640
I truly have no such ambition anymore.

359
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,200
Please understand.

360
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,110
I see.

361
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,760
Well then...

362
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,390
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

363
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,680
I'll be on my way.

364
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,590
Old Master Hu.

365
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,160
What is Li Wantang

366
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,200
really up to,

367
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,880
bullying us Huizhou merchants like this?

368
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,240
He says your Top Tea Under Heaven

369
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,510
has stolen his thunder,

370
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,640
and if you don't die,

371
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,700
he won't rest easy.

372
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,980
Did he really say that?

373
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,890
He won't rest easy until I'm dead?

374
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,560
Well then.

375
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,480
I'll make him even more uneasy.

376
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,380
This matter needs to be handled fairly,

377
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,240
so my father can have
more credibility out there.

378

565
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,410
If anyone

566
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,750
has bad intentions
and says something wrong,

567
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,750
using two lives

568
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,790
to gain promotion and wealth
for themselves,

569
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,790
then all Pingyuan's efforts

570
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,920
would be in vain.

571
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,270
How should our family survive then?

572
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,000
You could have told me earlier.

573
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,960
It's not like I'm unreasonable.

574
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,790
In my opinion, on this matter,

575
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,750
Pingyuan made a mistake.

576
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,000
Even I, Gu Pingwen, am smarter than he is.

577
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Right.

578
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,330
You're smart.

579
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,240
You're clever.

580
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,440
I think we've done

581
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
more than enough for the Bai family.

582
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,470
That Bai Yimei.

583
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,550
She...

584
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,000
She owes us too much.

585
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
That engagement since childhood,

586
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,680
right?

587
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,640
She ran off with that commanding general

588
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,700
and even got pregnant with his child.

589
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,680
Pingyuan spent so much effort and money

590
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,350
and almost lost his life

591
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,880
just to save her from death.

592
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,440
It's not worth it
no matter how you look at it.

593
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,750
Yes, right.

594
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,790
So you're smart!

595
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
You're smarter than Pingyuan,

596
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,820
aren't you?

597
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,950
Look how smart you...

598
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,110
Stand up and look at yourself.

599
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,020
Look at all this dirt from kneeling.

600
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,660
All this dust. Look at you.

601
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,550
Don't pull me in broad daylight.

602
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,350
How inappropriate.

603
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,550
Easy now. Easy, easy.

604
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
Where's my father?

605
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,830
Where is he?

606
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,070
Haven't seen him.

607
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,000
He went to buy medicine.

608
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,800
Buy medicine?

609
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,400
He had no money.
How could he buy medicine?

610
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,030
H-He came by earlier,

611
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,360
asking what I was doing.

612
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,590
I said I was back from work,

613
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,440
and that I told you

614
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,510
I was going down the mountain
to buy medicine.

615
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,920
He said... He said he would go instead,

616
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,180
so I gave him the money.

617
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,310
How many times have I told you

618
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,550
not to give him money?

619
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,000
He won't come back until he's gambled away

620
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
everything down to his pants.

621
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,590
I've told you so many times.

622
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,940
Why can't you remember?

623
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,960
No, it's not like that.

624
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,270
Isn't he your father?

625
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,270
Just consider it my way of
showing respect to him,

626
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,960
okay?

627
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,830
Otherwise, if he

628
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,400
gets angry

629
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,510
and doesn't approve of our marriage,

630
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,750
what am I supposed to do then?

631
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,310
You

632
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,590
are in for trouble.

633
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,640
I brought you two cans

634
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,590
of such fine tea,

635
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,680
yet here you are, drinking wine.

636
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,790
Tea only makes you more sober.

637
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,960
Why don't you join me for a drink instead?

638
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,440
Here.

639
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,500
Try this wine the foreigners gave me.

640
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,410
Such a good thing you have here.

641
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,000
Try it.

642
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,830
If you like it,

643
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,920
I have plenty.

644
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,910
I'll have someone deliver a few barrels
to your home.

645
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,160
Well, how about

646
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
introducing me to
some foreign merchants as well?

647
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,640
If I did that,

648
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,510
my father would beat me

649
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,200
to death.

650
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,790
I'd be biting the hand that feeds me.

651
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,680
Your father is always so harsh

652
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
when dealing with me.

653
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,530
After all, I'm his junior.

654
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,270
If you ask me,

655
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,070
my father has been quite nice to you,

656
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,110
not harsh at all.

657
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,830
At that Grand Tea Competition,

658
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,790
my father spent money like water

659
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,590
and finally built a stage,

660
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,830
only for the whole thing

661
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,430
to become your one-man show.

662
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,160
He doesn't just hate you—

663
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,480
he even wants to eat you alive.

664
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,480
I think this time, buddy,

665
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,130
you've stirred up a hornet's nest.

666
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,290
So many tea merchants

667
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,400
and so much money

668
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,080
all ended up benefiting
the Anhui tea merchants.

669
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,960
What even is that "Top Tea Under Heaven"?

670
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,310
I've never heard of it.

671
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,770
You must be joking with me.

672
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,680
My father

673
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,760
arrived with his head held high,

674
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,690
yet left completely dejected.

675
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,250
If people start saying

676
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,310
that even Li Million has times

677
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,680
when he can't be counted on,

678
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,550
wouldn't that ruin his reputation?

679
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,550
Who else should he get back at
if not you?

680
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,210
He won't be able to explain it.

681
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,270
What's the deal with

682
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,040
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association?

683
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,840
Are they determined to turn against
the Li family?

684
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,010
Your father is too ruthless,

685
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,960
trying to buy their spring tea

686
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,550
at 20% of the original price.

687
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,480
It doesn't even cover labor costs.

688
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,300
About this matter,

689
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,750
I have no say in it.

690
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,930
I'm just delivering the message.

691
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,210
Do you know why he sent me?

692
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,550
Four words:

693
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,350
to take the blame.

694
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,550
That's refreshingly honest.

695
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,130
Indeed it is.

696
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,240
I actually came here

697
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,550
planning to have

698
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,070
a proper competition with you.

699
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,000
But in this situation,

700
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,240
it would be too unfair.

701
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,160
Maybe next time,

702
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,960
when I have my own

703
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,680
business.

704
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,270
So when will you

705
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,640
have your own business?

706
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,780
My father said,

707
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,200
once the south is reclaimed,

708
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,880
he'll let me manage

709
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,650
our family's

710
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,610
salt business.

711
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,160
That's over 300 salt shops

712
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,830
in 7 southern provinces
and 6 northern provinces.

713
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,880
Actually, I don't need all 300 shops.

714
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,480
Just one.

715
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,400
Just one would be enough.

716
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,780
As long as I can make my own decisions,

717
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,000
instead of following him around

718
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,790
all day long,

719
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,550
doing these thankless jobs.

720
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,840
Where are you going?

721
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,190
To find some foreign merchants.

722
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,110
I can't really be driven to death

723
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,310
by your father, can I?

724
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,630
But you don't know anyone.
How do you want to find them?

725
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,760
Do you know Hart,

726
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,920
the Customs Commissioner?

727
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Do you know Richard

728
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,280
from Xianghe Trade House?

729
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,409
Have you ever been to

730
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,690
the Shanghai Bund?

731
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,320
If you ask me,

732
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,000
this is what you should do:

733
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,590
go buy a rope

734
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,920
and hang yourself

735
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,030
from the beam at our doorway.

736
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,150
I'll take your body

737
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,400
to my father so he can vent his anger.

738
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,460
I promise to give you a proper burial.

739
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,550
Once you have your own business,

740
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,550
I'll definitely teach you a lesson.

741
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,150
Take care! See yourself out.

742
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,280
I just borrowed money from him yesterday.

743
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,630
Think of something.

744
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,710
I'll have to make up an excuse.

745
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,400
Otherwise,

746
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,840
he'll think I'm being unreliable again.

747
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,150
Now you know to think things over?

748
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,760
Pingwen.

749
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,880
Pack your things and come with me
to Shanghai.

750
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,670
We're leaving this afternoon.

751
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,420
I'll go tell Mother.

752
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,760
Pingyuan, I still have something
to attend to.

753
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,400
What is it?

754
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,670
Her father is being held at
the gambling house down the mountain.

755
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,530
What happened?

756
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,580
I told Pingwen

757
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,320
not to give my father any money.

758
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,510
Pingwen is such a fool.

759
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,230
Yesterday, he gave

760
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,440
my father some pennies.

761
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,250
Guess what happened?

762
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,960
He didn't come back last night.

763
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,300
The gambling house just sent word

764
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,560
that he lost 500 taels,

765
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,960
and we must pay his ransom
by this afternoon.

766
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,670
Two hours late

767
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,920
means one finger off.

768
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,360
We were just discussing what to do.

769
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,480
What's there to discuss?

770
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,230
I'll give you the money,

771
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,030
and you go bail him out right away.

772
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,800
I need to go on a trip with Pingwen

773
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,930
in the next few days.

774
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,400
Please take care of Ms. Bai

775
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,230
and my mother.

776
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Okay.

777
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,760
Pingyuan, you're so generous.

778
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,670
Actually, we were just talking about

779
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,960
how to find an excuse

780
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
to borrow money from you.

781
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,370
You just say everything out loud!

782
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,270
She hits me every day.

783
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,200
I've really spoiled her.

784
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Tell her that this money

785
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,590
is a gift to show our respect
to her father,

786
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,630
not something she borrowed from us.

787
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,490
Don't say anything unnecessary.

788
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,730
Pack your things.

789
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,640
[Gu's Mansion]

790
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,440
Gu.

791
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,420
What did the doctor say?

792
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,620
When will she wake up?

793
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,590
The doctor said she refuses to wake up.

794
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,450
Refuses to wake up?

795
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
It's a blessing to refuse to wake up.

796
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,220
I don't have such blessing.

797
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,880
From now on, you'll be taking care of her.

798
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,810
Talk to her more.

799
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,000
I...

800
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,110
What should I say?

801
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,330
Tell her

802
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,440
she's still pregnant with
Li Cheng's kid,

803
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,590
and she still needs to

804
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,440
raise the kid.

805
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,810
She has no right to die.

806
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,280
I...

807
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,490
I'll tell her exactly that?

808
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,760
Or what else would you like to say?

809
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,940
I've been through life and death
so many times,

810
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,800
yet I still managed to crawl back.

811
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,920
How much do you think

812
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,520
it will cost to buy this ship?

813
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,550
How would I know?

814
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,380
This is the reason

815
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,630
why the foreigners could run amok

816
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,760
on our river.

817
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,420
Meanwhile, our merchants

818
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,880
are still fighting among themselves,

819
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,480
having the time of their lives.

820
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,280
How pathetic.

821
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,190
Pingyuan.

822
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,180
Can I discuss something with you?

823
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,070
If you don't want to be
the Pacification Commissioner anymore,

824
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,630
let me have the position
for a couple of days.

825
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,880
You can't even manage a shop properly,

826
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,000
and you want to be
the Pacification Commissioner?

827
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,550
Look, since I

828
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,630
took this position,

829
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,400
have I had a single peaceful day?

830
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Once we go ashore,

831
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,320
we'll first visit

832
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,180
Hart, the Customs Commissioner.

833
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,140
[Shanghai, Hart's Residence]

834
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,500
What are you doing?

835
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,030
His accent is even better than mine.

836
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,670
Our Mr. Hart

837
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,110
is favored by the imperial court

838
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,110
and oversees the Qing Empire's customs.

839
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,110
His son

840
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,700
even earned a degree
in the imperial examination.

841
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,480
His eight-part essay was so well written

842
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
that the chief examiner was amazed.

843
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,500
That little bastard you were talking about

844
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,860
actually became a scholar candidate.

845
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,920
Let's see how he does in the next exam.

846
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,960
Mr. Gu,

847
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,920
if you have something to say, go ahead.

848
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,590
Mr. Hart,

849
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,880
I'd like to ask you
to arrange a meeting with

850
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,110
Mr. Richard from Xianghe Trade House.

851
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,440
I want to get to know him.

852
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,690
Why do you want to meet him?

853
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,030
With the recent victory in Hefei

854
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,920
and the abundant tea harvest
in Anhui this year,

855
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,110
our province is waiting for this money.

856
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,110
Tea farmers need to support
their families,

857
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,750
the government needs to
comfort the refugees,

858
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,400
and the imperial court also hopes
that local regions

859
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,030
can recover their strength
as soon as possible.

860
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,750
But Mr. Richard

861
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,190
isn't buying a single tael of tea
from Anhui

862
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,960
this year.

863
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,700
I don't understand what he means by that.

864
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,510
Business is inherently

865
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,880
voluntary between both parties.

866
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,280
Richard is a merchant.

867
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,590
He works for the East India Company.

868
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,960
If he doesn't want to buy,

869
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,030
you can't force him

870
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,670
with your official position, right?

871
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,800
But I can't just go back empty-handed.

872
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,660
How abut this?

873
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
Please arrange a meeting with him anyway.

874
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
If I can't make a deal,

875
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,110
you can count it as my incompetence.

876
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,240
You're in luck today.

877
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,340
He's having tea in my backyard.

878
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,110
However,

879
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,550
I must warn you.

880
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,310
This man is someone
you can't afford to offend.

881
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,550
So technically,

882
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,440
the whole ship

883
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
was looking at me,

884
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,000
and it was so funny.

885
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,320
And I was like,

886
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,280
what,

887
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,280
why?

888
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,360
Look at these guys.

889
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,740
-Probably asking for money.
-Ladies, if you'll excuse us.

890
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,110
This is Mr. Richard.

891
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,880
This is Mr. Gu,

892
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,670
representing the Anhui Tea Merchants.

893
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
He came from his hometown.

894
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,440
Mr. Richard.

895
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,590
I'd like to know

896
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,030
why you're not purchasing

897
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,630
any tea from Anhui this year.

898
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,840
[Richard, Director of Xianghe Trade House]

899
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,900
Is there a problem?

900
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,630
I'm here representing

901
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,150
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

902
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,350
I'd like to know the reason behind this.

903
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,070
I've signed an exclusive contract

904
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,630
with Mr. Li Wantang from the capital.

905
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,360
I only buy tea from him.

906
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Whether that tea is from Anhui or not

907
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,970
doesn't concern me.

908
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,550
Your dispute

909
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,070
doesn't concern me, either.

910
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,670
Please don't waste my time.

911
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,480
We don't need to be

912
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,080
so confrontational from the start.

913
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,590
Anhui has always been

914
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,860
a major tea-producing province
in our country.

915
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,910
Li Wantang can choose to give it up,

916
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,670
but can you really bear to give it up?

917
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,130
It's a huge business deal.

918
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,210
Though the deal is good,

919
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,670
I cannot afford to offend

920
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,590
my partner.

921
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,340
The Qing Empire has 18 provinces.

922
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,550
Losing one

923
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,520
doesn't matter.

924
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,400
That's the conclusion.

925
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,240
Conclusion?

926
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,230
Also,

927
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,590
don't try to negotiate with
other foreign merchants.

928
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,760
The Great Qing Legal Code
forbids Chinese people

929
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,630
from doing business
with foreigners privately.

930
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,510
I advise you not to speak so absolutely.

931
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,170
I can give you another chance.

932
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,760
Chance?

933
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,710
What chance?

934
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,760
To put me on a ship back to England?

935
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,510
My god.

936
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,470
Want to make a bet with me?

937
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,470
I bet you'll regret it.

938
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,230
Pingyuan,

939
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,630
don't be mad.

940
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Captain Tod wants to know

941
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
what brings you here.

942
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,190
Ask him

943
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,630
if this ship is for sale.
