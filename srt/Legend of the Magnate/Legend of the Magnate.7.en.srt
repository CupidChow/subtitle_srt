[Taiyufeng]

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,759
From now on, call him Mr. Gu.

5
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,650
Mr. Gu.

6
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,760
He's sent here by our boss.

7
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,920
Mr. Gu.

8
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,480
Have you worked in a pawnshop before?

9
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,750
No.

10
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,830
No?

11
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,640
He's a genius.

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Since the beginning of time,

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,540
our shop has finally welcomed new rules.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,590
You all came at the right time.

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,870
From now on, Mr. Gu

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,910
will be our...

17
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,010
Fourth Manager.

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,829
Fourth Manager.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,470
Strange things happen every year,

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,400
but this year, it's more abundant.

21
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,380
Make some room for the Fourth Manager.

22
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,079
Fourth Manager, please move aside.

23
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,640
Please move a bit more.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,980
Fourth Manager, make way.

25
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,400
Fourth Manager,

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,460
please step aside.

27
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,470
You have to deliver gifts yourself?

28
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,690
He's just a county magistrate.

29
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,480
If this were in Beijing,

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,750
even if those officials with red hats

31
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,680
came to my house,

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,470
they wouldn't get to see my father

33
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,400
if he didn't feel like seeing them.

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,730
You're the young master,

35
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,240
and I'm naturally

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,590
just an errand boy.

37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,180
After meeting the magistrate,

38
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll know

39
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,750
how to survive in this place.

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,150
You've seen the silver mountain over there

41
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,400
that vexes all the thieves, right?

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
I really like it.

43
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,120
I plan to put one

44
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,269
in front of our shop too.

45
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:19,930
Right here,

46
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,910
I'll erect

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,130
a huge silver gourd over 3 meters tall.

48
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,630
The feng shui master told me that

49
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,750
the area near the city gate
has the strongest fortune.

50
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,560
I plan to

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,020
absorb it all completely.

52
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,800
And those buildings over there.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I'll rent them too

54
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,690
to set up a large draft bank.

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,159
One for deposits, one for withdrawals.

56
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,880
What's so great about the Eight Families?

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,190
Besides their draft banks,

58
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,250
they have nothing.

59
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,760
My father even said that

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
the Li family will go all out

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,570
to make a big impression here.

62
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,230
I think it's making a mountain
out of a molehill.

63
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,250
Three years...

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,260
No, in 3 months,

65
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,000
and the crowd to our shops

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
will reach the Eight Families' houses.

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,510
What are you laughing at?

68
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,170
I'm smiling at your ambition.

69
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,140
Do you not believe in me,

70
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,730
or do you lack confidence?

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,380
Pingyao isn't big,

72
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,680
but this is

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,850
the financial center of the Qing Empire.

74
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,950
Your father said

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
to go all out.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,510
But I think even with all your efforts,

77
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,840
you may not be able
to shake things up here.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,920
The Eight Families of Shanxi have been
around for over 200 years.

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,820
They have their own history.

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,420
I'll tell you about it later.

81
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,340
Since you've already run away,

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,670
why bother coming back?

83
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,440
Mr. Chang.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,750
You're awake just in time.

85
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,010
The porridge is ready.

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,600
Look.

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,070
I borrowed a portable stove for you.

88
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,450
Some chestnuts for you.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,910
And some shredded chicken.

90
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,110
This is best for restoring your energy.

91
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,210
I didn't make this.

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
Ms. Chang made it.

93
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,750
Here.

94
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,070
Try some.

95
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,550
Careful, it's hot.

96
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,530
Delicious.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,860
Where did this cabinet come from?

98
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,480
From the government office.

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,260
Surprising, isn't it?

100
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,310
You must be the first person

101
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,770
in history to be imprisoned
in such comfort.

102
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,060
What did you trade for this?

103
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,480
Myself.

104
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,050
What do you mean?

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Wang Tiangui

106
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,000
gave me 30 days

107
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,030
to sort out his pawnshop.

108
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,360
I've also become the first person

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,750
in history to be the fourth manager
in a pawnshop.

110
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,950
But for these 30 days,

111
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,630
you'll have to bear
with the inconvenience.

112
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,720
Thirty days?

113
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,440
That pawnshop

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,830
has Wang Tiangui helpless
over its management

115
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,970
for 30 years.

116
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,500
How could you possibly
sort it out in 30 days?

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,960
That's fooling yourself.

118
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,600
It's only the first day.

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,430
There's still time.

120
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,090
I can learn.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,010
Those old appraisers in the pawnshop

122
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,040
were trained by Wang Tiangui's father

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
when he was around.

124
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,430
They won't be easy to get along with.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,240
Even

126
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,530
lifelong businessmen

127
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,480
would be helpless in there.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Mr. Gu,

129
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,240
this is a profession

130
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,270
you must not take lightly.

131
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,810
I wouldn't dare underestimate it.

132
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,090
But as the saying goes,

133
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
"Different trades
share the same principles."

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,050
People's hearts are the same everywhere.

135
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,920
Their pawnshop

136
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,950
just has a slightly higher counter.

137
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,790
Even if it's a hard nut to crack,

138
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,870
I'll break it open.

139
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,200
Please take a look at this, Manager.

140
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,960
My eyes are blurry.

141
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,950
I can't see clearly anymore.

142
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,600
Sir,

143
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,550
what are you

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
trying to pawn here?

145
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,720
This is our family heirloom,

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,310
a jade from the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

147
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,840
My elderly mother is ill
and wants to pawn it.

148
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,790
A family heirloom jade?

149
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,350
Was your home underground?

150
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,380
Why does it smell so strongly of soil?

151
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,200
What?

152
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
Does your pawnshop

153
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,490
care about where items come from?

154
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,320
You really think
you're the government office?

155
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,870
I wouldn't dare.

156
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,870
Catching thieves is not our business.

157
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,990
However,

158
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,320
if there's a major case
at the government office,

159
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,530
they'll definitely come to our pawnshop

160
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,510
to investigate.

161
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,270
Sir.

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
According to the
"Great Qing Legal Code,"

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,870
grave robbery is punishable by death.

164
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,150
You have

165
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,550
good eyes.

166
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,340
This jade piece

167
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,750
was acquired by
my grandfather's generation

168
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,670
back then.

169
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,550
If I were to sell this in the capital,

170
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,910
it would fetch at least
several thousand taels of silver.

171
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,730
I'm only asking for 500 taels
from your pawnshop.

172
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,570
500 taels isn't much.

173
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,000
But there's one problem.

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,540
You claim it's from the Shang-Zhou period.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,560
Hey-

176
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,690
This was made this year!

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,800
You carved the jade,

178
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,300
heated it until red-hot,

179
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,550
and then threw it

180
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,630
into the abdomens of living cats and dogs.

181
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,030
You used their vital essence

182
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,360
to age it artificially.

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,440
Young man,

184
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,150
what you're doing

185
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
will bring bad karma.

186
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,490
You're talking nonsense!

187
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
Seek a third opinion.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,050
If anyone says this is genuine,

189
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,870
you can pluck out these old eyes of mine

190
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,750
and step on them till they pop.

191
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,670
Go away.

192
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,480
I've smashed this jade for you

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,910
to prevent you from cheating others.

194
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Zhu,

195
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,250
if it weren't for your expertise,

196
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,380
I would have been completely fooled.

197
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,150
Gu Chaofeng.

198
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,450
You're late on your first day.

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Are your eyes on top of your head?

200
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,540
Why are you putting on airs

201
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,550
and pretending to be a big shot?

202
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,750
You're an appraiser,

203
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,630
and so am I.

204
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,480
Why speak so harshly?

205
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,960
Well, of course.

206
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,340
This guy

207
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,440
has never worked a day
in a pawnshop before.

208
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,360
But he has the boss to rely on.

209
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,680
Of course, he doesn't see us as equals.

210
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,440
If there's anything

211
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,330
I, the Fourth Manager, can help with,

212
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,300
just let me know.

213
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,510
Young man,

214
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,670
let me ask you.

215
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,630
What does the fourth manager

216
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,960
usually handle at work?

217
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,040
I see.

218
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,360
I'd like to see

219
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,690
your previous years' ledgers.

220
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,020
Where might I find them?

221
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,660
The ledgers aren't here.

222
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,720
They're upstairs.

223
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,790
Manager!

224
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,910
Pawn these for me!

225
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Give me 500 taels of silver for them!

226
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,020
This blade was given to me by the Marshal.

227
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,630
This Imperial Yellow Jacket

228
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,630
was bestowed upon me
by the Emperor himself.

229
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,570
I risked my life

230
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,550
to earn

231
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,790
these two items.

232
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,080
I want 500 taels for them,

233
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
not a candareen less!

234
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,030
These two items together

235
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,550
aren't worth even 5 taels of silver.

236
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,630
Our shop can't accept them.

237
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,120
Perhaps

238
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,740
you should try another pawnshop.

239
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,670
What did you say?

240
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,070
Five taels of silver?

241
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,270
Are you looking down on the Emperor,

242
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,510
the Marshal,

243
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,870
or me?

244
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,770
No, no.

245
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,670
Give it!

246
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Give it back to me!

247
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,550
Don't!

248
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,770
I'll cut you in half!

249
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,960
This is my precious blade!

250
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,390
Fourth Manager.

251
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,150
-Fourth Manager!
-Give it to me!

252
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,080
Fourth Manager!

253
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,300
Your time to shine!

254
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,480
Hand it over!

255
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,210
You, look at them.

256
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,940
Take a good look!

257
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,370
You said you work for the Marshal.

258
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,900
May I ask what rank you hold?

259
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,480
My surname is Bao.

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm here in Shanxi
to collect military funds.

261
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,430
By the Emperor's grace,

262
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,790
I hold a second-rank military position.

263
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,550
What?

264
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,120
Do you want to see my red official's hat?

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
I've heard that under the Marshal,

266
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,750
there are two formidable commanders,

267
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,000
Sir Bao and Sir Ta.

268
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,270
Could you be

269
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Sir Bao Qingde?

270
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,860
I've long admired you.

271
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,820
Taqibu has passed away.

272
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,050
Currently, military funding
across the country

273
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,080
is not coming in promptly.

274
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,340
The soldiers in my camp

275
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
haven't been paid for half a year.

276
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
I had no choice

277
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,290
but to pawn this,

278
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,360
so my brothers in the Bao Regiment

279
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,820
can have something to eat.

280
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,640
If I've offended you,

281
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,090
please forgive me.

282
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,520
Only a true hero can be himself.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,610
Sir Bao, how much would you
like to pawn this for?

284
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,080
Just...

285
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,480
Just 500 taels of silver would be enough.

286
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
Just 500 taels isn't enough,

287
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,530
it's too little.

288
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Staff, make a record.

289
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,450
One precious blade,

290
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,310
and one Imperial Yellow Jacket,

291
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,300
pawned for 1,000 taels of silver.

292
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,470
This...

293
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,520
Announce the pawn and write the receipt,

294
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
that's the rule.

295
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,610
What's there to fuss about?

296
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,320
Write it.

297
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,550
Sir Bao.

298
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,080
These are all banknotes
from the Four Major Banks,

299
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,140
accepted everywhere in the country.

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,360
Thank you.

301
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
Gu Pingyuan.

302
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
You...

303
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,390
Who do you think you are?

304
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,380
He asked for 500, and you gave him 1,000.

305
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,720
You don't care about losses, do you?

306
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,450
This was your job to begin with,

307
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,930
you told me to do it.

308
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,720
You...

309
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,960
Someone come down here!

310
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,720
Quickly,

311
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,840
lock him up in a room somewhere

312
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,750
so he can cool down.

313
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,610
I think he's not right in the head.

314
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,860
You just watched him do that?

315
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,300
[Taiyufeng General Ledger]

316
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,430
[Seventh of the month;
A set of porcelain vases, 10 taels]

317
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,510
[Eighth of the month;
2 bolts of embroidery, 25 taels]

318
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,580
[Ninth of the month;
a set of red jade calculations, 15 taels]

319
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,230
You let him announce the pawn
at the counter.

320
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,849
You couldn't make a decision yourself,

321
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,680
so you let an amateur decide for you.

322
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
You've really become senile!

323
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,400
Exactly.

324
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,589
You've set a precedent by letting him

325
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,950
announce a pawn today.

326
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,490
You won't be able to stop him
from doing anything in the future.

327
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,980
I think the 3 of us

328
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
should pack our bedrolls

329
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,240
and leave while we can.

330
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,349
Head manager,

331
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,880
we've been following you for decades.

332
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,510
Whatever you say,

333
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,690
we'll do.

334
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,270
But about resigning from this job,

335
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,140
is it a real resignation

336
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,200
or a strategic retreat?

337
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,140
Please let us know.

338
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,610
We have to nip trouble in the bud.

339
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,580
This decision isn't mine to make,

340
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,550
it's the boss's.

341
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,220
Notify all employees that

342
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,280
the pawnshop won't open tomorrow.

343
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,320
No business will be conducted.

344
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,710
We're shutting down.

345
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,830
Jin, right?

346
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,880
Here, take it.

347
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,200
You know,

348
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,160
you've been locked up here all day,

349
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,830
and nobody's brought you anything to eat.

350
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,400
Well,

351
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,000
my wife made lunch.

352
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,920
I couldn't finish it,

353
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
so I brought some for you.

354
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
That's great.

355
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,100
Thank you, Jin.

356
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Don't mention it.

357
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,260
I've been

358
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
idle all day

359
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,290
and I can't eat a thing.

360
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,830
Why have you been idle all day?

361
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,690
What happened?

362
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,510
The head manager

363
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,110
told us to put up the shutters

364
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,200
and stop doing business.

365
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,260
We're closed down.

366
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,270
He and the second and third managers

367
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,860
went to the boss to resign.

368
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
Did they resign for good?

369
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,960
How would people like me know about that?

370
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,710
Anyway,

371
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
in this pawnshop,

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,480
the three appraiser masters always

373
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,540
have the final say.

374
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,010
Alright,

375
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm leaving now.

376
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,750
Just

377
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
don't tell anyone I gave this to you.

378
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,110
Thank you.

379
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,070
Doctor,

380
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,550
you need to

381
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,000
examine me thoroughly

382
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,890
for my illness,

383
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
so those gossipers

384
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,250
won't make snide remarks.

385
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,640
I've married so many wives,

386
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
but it's all for nothing.

387
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
From now on,

Thank you for the compliment, Boss.

You think I'm complimenting you?

403

Not even a day has passed

406

and I've nearly ruined everything.

407
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,540
I think it won't take 30 days

408

for me to get the pawnshop in order.

there is some truth to what you say.

413

Have they resigned then?

414

I just need to nod, and it's done.

415

But according to the rules
of this business,

416
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,270
you can't just quit today

417
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,810
and leave tomorrow.

418
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,840

419

and get the business in order
for the boss

420
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,070
before they can leave.

421
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,030
How long will that take?

422
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,360
At least 20 to 30 days.

423
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,430
That should be enough.

Please approve their resignation.

My approval

427
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,810
is just a matter of saying the word.

428
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,770
But these 3 old appraisers

429
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,800
are important figures

430

Of course I can't.

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,150
Are you planning

942
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
to resign again

943
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,590
and leave right away?

944
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,380
Boss,

945
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,050
please stop teasing us.

946
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,230
That matter about us leaving

947
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,000
is over.

948
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,880
That's right.

949
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,250
That matter is finished.

950
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,400
Gone with the wind.

951
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,010
Yes.

952
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,510
Today,

953
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,500
we invited you here

954
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,230
because we want to ask

955
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,920
about that young man.

956
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,090
We don't know

957
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,590
what dealings you have with him.

958
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,500
But his actions

959
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,530
have caused public outrage in Pingyao.

960
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,030
We have to

961
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,920
inform you about this.

962
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,680
That amateur

963
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,720
has broken all the rules.

964
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,480
In these past 10 days or so,

965
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,030
he's been through every corner of Pingyao,

966
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,000
taking everything he can get.

967
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,910
All the pawnshops are empty,

968
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,760
everything's been bought up
by his business.

969
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,920
Items worth 3 taels

970
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,860
he pawns for 5.

971
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,160
Things worth 5 taels, he gives 10!

972
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,120
He comes with a bank

973
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,230
offering high interest rates.

974
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,050
He's been causing trouble

975
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
for every bank in Pingyao.

976
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,710
Everyone's withdrawing their money

977
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,510
and depositing it with his bank.

978
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,590
It's gotten to the point where

979
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,300
both our pawnshops

980
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,270
banks are empty.

981
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,530
In this world,

982
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,260
nobody does business this way.

983
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,450
He's truly a black sheep.

984
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,630
You're familiar with
the county magistrate.

985
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,110
Please step in and do something about him.

986
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,550
If this chaos continues,

987
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,280
things will really get out of hand.

988
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,290
The pawnshop's profit

989
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,850
comes mainly from interest

990
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,490
and undervaluing collateral.

991
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,590
Conditional pawning

992
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,630
sucks people dry.

993
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,560
While outright pawning

994
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,000
squeezes the last worth out of them.

995
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,280
And yet you've somehow managed to ruin

996
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,410
this extremely profitable business.

997
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,910
They offer discounts and still profit,

998
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,620
but what about you lot?

999
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,110
You only know how to make me
call the magistrate to arrest people.

1000
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,500
This isn't how you do business.

1001
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,550
You're just waiting for your own deaths.

1002
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,110
Boss.

1003
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,960
Boss.

1004
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,070
You shouldn't be so harsh

1005
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,840
on us.

1006
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,220
If we fail now,

1007
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,030
we won't be able

1008
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,090
to survive in this business anymore.

1009
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,770
If you keep talking like this,

1010
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,700
then you're

1011
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
not honoring all we've done for you.

1012
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,250
Please, Boss,

1013
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,710
think of all we've done for you.

1014
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,110
Boss,

1015
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,280
please think of all we've done for you.

1016
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,610
All you've done for me...

1017
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,360
General Bao is here

1018
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,630
to redeem his blade
and Imperial Yellow Jacket.

1019
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,090
This...

1020
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,890
Go get it.

1021
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,320
Gu Pingyuan handled this pawn, right?

1022
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,810
General Bao says

1023
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,440
he won't take his things

1024
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,210
unless he sees Mr. Gu in person.

1025
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:13,630
You go.

1026
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,150
Shoo.

1027
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,570
We've been hunters all our lives,

1028
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,580
but now we're the hunted.

1029
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,880
You all better

1030
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
behave yourselves!

1031
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,630
Boss.

1032
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,250
He has now

1033
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,770
gone to Wanyuandang to find Gu Pingyuan.

1034
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,680
Do you know who he is?
