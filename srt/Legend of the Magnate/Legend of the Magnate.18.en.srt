00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,140
Tomorrow, you two brothers

4
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,479
will carry thorny branches on your backs

5
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,680
and come with me
to the Tea Merchants' Association.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Perhaps Mr. Hou Er

7
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,759
will let it go.

8
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,789
-That's right.
-Yeah.

9
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,640
Will you do it?

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,590
No.

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,580
Why should I?

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm not going.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
If you don't go, who will?

14
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,710

15
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,640

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,780

17

The beating you got last time
wasn't enough for you,

18
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,640

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,800
Fine.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,210
I can carry those thorny branches,

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,210

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,230

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,490
slaps me a few times,

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,950
it's worth it.

28
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,079
But let me ask you all—

29
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,800

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,520
It's not like I

31

32
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,110
so why would he hate me this much?

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,990
He just wants to force down

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,240

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,329
If, at this moment,

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
I go bow and scrape to him,

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,730
he'll use the chance

38
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,310
to push down the price of all the tea

39
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,910
in the village even further.

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,590
So what about the tea you have now?

41
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,850
Will you sell it or not?

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
Will you sell it or not?

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,910
He's trying to slash the price.

44

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,880
Today, my brother and I

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,150
went through every tea shop

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,190
Right now, top-grade Silver Bud

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,250

52

-Yeah.

55

Even the third-grade Silver Bud

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,070
can sell for 1.7 strings.

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,410
1.7 strings?

58
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,590
-That's so high.
-Exactly.

59
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,390
But that Hou Er

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,840
simply offers

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,510
only 1.3 strings

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,190
for my best tea leaves.

63
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,750
And the price difference

64
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,630
will all go

65

-Exactly!

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,330
I can finally feel at ease.

194
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,100
However, the reason we invited you here

195
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,870
is that we,
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association,

196
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,700
have a special request

197
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,940
and hope you can help us.

198
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,390
The Grand Tea Competition?

199
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,450
Exactly, exactly.

200
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,880
This time,

201
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,760
our Anhui tea must

202
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,850
win first place no matter what.

203
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,680
Everyone,

204
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
please sit, sit.

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,870
-Sit. Sit.
-Let's sit.

206
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,330
You've probably all heard.

207
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,490
The late Emperor

208
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,680
passed away in Rehe.

209
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,040
The capital has new rulers now.

210
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,360
The former Noble Consort Yi

211
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,950
and the Sixth Prince
jointly oversee state affairs.

212
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,680
The new reign title is Tongzhi.

213
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,160
"Tongzhi"

214
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,810
means the ruler and ministers
governing together,

215
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,270
and also brother-in-law and sister-in-law
ruling together.

216
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,770
That's good, that's good.

217
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm not just making small talk here.

218
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,390
Nominally, the Grand Tea Competition

219
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,720
is hosted by our family,

220
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,789
but the one actually tasting
and judging the tea

221
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,330
is the Sixth Prince.

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,090
The Sixth...

223
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,039
That isn't just a tea gathering.

224
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,390
It's business.

225
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,810
Your Anhui tea wants to win first place.

226
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,640
Then, what about Yunnan tea

227
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,530
and Taiwan tea?

228
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,360
There are many subtleties involved.

229
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,440
Old Master Hu.

230
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,750
What is it?

231
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,210
There's a

232
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,150
young tea merchant outside.

233
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,030
He sent his calling card,

234
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,430
saying he wants to meet
with the Tea Merchants' Association.

235
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,470
This person is too arrogant.

236
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,550
It's clearly the Silver Bud,

237
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,910
and he has the nerve
to call it Orchid Snow.

238
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,030
Send him away. I won't see him.

239
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,720
Orchid Snow tea—

240
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,030
that's quite a lovely name.

241
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,910
Come on, let me take a look

242
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,970
and see who this is.

243
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,730
No manners whatsoever.

244
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,680
What kind of person is this?

245
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,810
An old acquaintance of yours.

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
[To Old Master Hu, head of
Anhui Tea Merchants' Association]

247
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,400
[Greetings from Gu Pingyuan]

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,650
Old Master Hu says

249
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,960
he's too busy to see you.

250
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,270
He's discussing business with guests.

251
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:40,670
Here.

252
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,010
Your card is returned.

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Please leave.

254
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
Who are the guests?

255
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,610
Gu!

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,150
Mr. Li Qin.

257
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,180
I knew it.

258
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,260
You must be the one.

259
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,390
Alright, let's not talk here.

260
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:53,920
Let's go.

261
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,840
How did you manage

262
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,390
to offend that Hu fellow

263
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,120
right after arriving in Anhui?

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,270
That old man's brain is stuck in the mud.

265
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,870
As if he'd ever look kindly
on someone like you.

266
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,330
Listen to me on this.

267
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,810
I'll find a chance.

268
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,880
I'll think of a way to smooth things over

269
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,010
between you and him.

270
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,570
You came

271
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,830
with your father this time, didn't you?

272
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,050
Back in Shanxi,

273
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,520
I offended him terribly.

274
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,530
Counting on him to help me now?

275
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,320
Forget it.

276
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,910
True enough.

277
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,030
Well then,

278
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
I know some

279
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,830
local tea merchants.

280
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,590
I'll pay out of my own pocket

281
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,630
to have them buy

282
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,400
all your tea.

283
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,560
Anyway, I won't let you lose money.

284
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,330
Just hearing you say that,

285
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm deeply grateful.

286
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,360
[Orchid Snow]

287
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,440
It's only that the Orchid Snow tea of mine

288
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,900
is like a timeless beauty.

289
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,970
If it only mingles among common,

290
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,360
[Orchid Snow]

291
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,670
vulgar teas,

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
I think that would be too much of a waste.

293
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,930
[Orchid Snow]

294
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me try.

295
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,630
Orchid Snow.

296
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,390
What do you think?

297
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,690
Truly like a stunning beauty.

298
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,360
You indeed are a kindred spirit,

299
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,890
willing to speak the truth.

300
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,780
But what's the use?

301
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
The tea merchants in Beijing

302
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,290
all listen to my father.

303
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,080
And you've offended

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,580
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association here.

305
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,500
Such fine tea—what a pity.

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,540
Or sell it to the Mongolians.

307
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,630
I've already offended

308
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,960
all the Mongolians too.

309
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,910
Wait,

310
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,340
why do you cause chaos

311
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,850
wherever you go?

312
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,310
You think I want to?

313
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm just a tea farmer now.

314
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,390
My whole family depends on me

315
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,900
selling tea to put food on the table.

316
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,120
Those bloodsucking tea buyers

317
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,930
push the prices so low.

318
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,260
What am I supposed to do?

319
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,780
Just let them bully me?

320
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,920
I think you've reached a dead end.

321
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,750
I've come to realize—

322
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,670
maybe in this life

323
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm destined to end up at a dead end.

324
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,370
I'm used to it by now.

325
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,550
That Grand Tea Competition

326
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,880
your family is hosting—

327
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,880
could my Orchid Snow tea

328
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,170
win the championship?

329
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,470
Sure it could.

330
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,120
Orchid Snow tea takes the crown,

331
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
and then you pass the Imperial Exam
to become top scholar—

332
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,900
parade through town on horseback
and rise to high office.

333
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,750
You're having

334
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,000
quite a sweet daydream here.

335
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,870
Do you want me to kick you

336
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,890
into the lake?

337
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,420
You're always mocking me.

338
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,420
But honestly,

339
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,270
if you really want to attend

340
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,330
our family's Grand Tea Competition,

341
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,670
I can find a way

342
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,440
to get you in.

343
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,380
But after that,

344
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,930
you are on your own.

345
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm at a dead end anyway.

346
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,440
What's there to fear?

347
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,770
I'm counting on you now.

348
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,510
Father.

349
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,970
Where did you get it?

350
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,240
Father,

351
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,080
this is the Orchid Snow tea.

352
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,410
How kind of you.

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Willing to put in a good word for him.

354
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,670
This might even be better

355
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
than the top-grade Silver Bud tea.

356
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,840
I think there's
real business potential here.

357
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,060
I think

358
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,480
that old man Hu

359
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,630
is being too overbearing.

360
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,550
Such good tea—

361
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,370
just because it doesn't suit his taste,

362
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,120
he rejects it without a second thought.

363
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,940
If you ask me,

364
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,460
if we could have

365
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,510
this Orchid Snow tea

366
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,200
for sale in our own tea shops

367
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
every year,

368
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,610
wouldn't that be...

369
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,840
You've been

370
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,510
paying close attention
to the family business lately.

371
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,240
That's good.

372
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,360
Such excellent tea—

373
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
if we have exclusive rights to sell it,

374
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
it'd be wonderful.

375
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,220
But it's Gu Pingyuan's tea,

376
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,490
which changes everything.

377
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,440
Why is that?

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Let me ask you—

379
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,630
if we buy his Orchid Snow tea,

380
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,030
what would happen to him?

381
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,930
I doubt that Hu fellow

382
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,690
would dare to fall out with you.

383
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750
We can just buy it.

384
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,810
Would he dare offend our Li family?

385
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,670
You have a point,

386
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,640
but he would harbor resentment

387
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,860
because we made him lose face.

388
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,640
If our competitors

389
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,150
chose this moment to approach him,

390
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,680
we'd lose him immediately.

391
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,750
Our years of business relationship

392
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,550
would be gone.

393
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,790
Besides, his tea

394
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,590
has limited annual production.

395
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,190
With our hundreds of stores,

396
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,360
could we really rely on the tea alone

397
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
to sustain our business?

398
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,690
Even if none of those issues existed,

399
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,200
by doing this,

400
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,370
wouldn't I be encouraging

401
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,010
people like Gu Pingyuan

402
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
who seek attention

403
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
and emboldening such young people?

404
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,870
One day,

405
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,790
would he demand to share

406
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,390
the profits with us equally?

407
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,870
Or would he simply

408
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,620
take everything and sell it,

409
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,080
no longer working with us?

410
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,550
It's just like

411
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,720
Xiang Yu meeting the First Emperor of Qin

412
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,380
and wanting to take his place.

413
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,800
It's very possible.

414
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,380
Ambition, you see...

415
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,030
It's like

416
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,080
a fire in one's heart.

417
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,430
Easy to ignite,

418
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,530
but hard to extinguish.

419
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,030
In this world,

420
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,430
rules always come first.

421
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,590
And what are "rules"?

422
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,960
I am the father,

423
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,000
and you are the son.

424
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,390
When I meet guests while seated,

425
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,850
you must remain standing.

426
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,930
If even this cannot be upheld,

427
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
what business is there to do?

428
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,480
Remember this:

429
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,330
even the finest herbs must be removed
when they block the path.

430
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,510
I've already instructed every merchant

431
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,600
in the capital

432
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
not to buy Gu Pingyuan's tea.

433
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,150
And you—don't play tricks behind my back.

434
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,980
If I find out,

435
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
I won't spare you.

436
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,450
How did you get back so quickly?

437
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,109
Next time, could you please
assign me tasks

438
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,569
that a human being
can actually accomplish?

439
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,069
The things you make me do—

440
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,440
what kind of tasks are these?

441
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm just not capable of
doing them for you.

442
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,490
I didn't get a single coin!

443
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,410
There's boiled water inside.

444
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,200
You're drinking raw water like this—

445
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,020
aren't you afraid of getting diarrhea?

446
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,070
If I die from diarrhea,

447
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll finally have peace.

448
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,000
All the way back here,

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,110
I've been so worried.

450
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,830
You've already made those big promises,

451
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,640
and soon everyone in the village

452
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,350
will bring their tea

453
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,550
with their palms up, asking for money.

454
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,160
Won't that drive us to our graves?

455
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,480
Mother's legs aren't what they used to be,

456
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,830
and she'll have to flee with us by then.

457
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,560
How pitiful.

458
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,640
Did you get to

459
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
see Madam Jin or not?

460
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,110
I didn't even catch

461
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,240
a glimpse of that Madam Jin

462
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,100
you mentioned.

463
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,550
I handed in your note,

464
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,510
and they said Madam Jin

465
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,740
went out of town to check on some...

466
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
some branch shop,

467
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,950
and they don't know when she'll be back.

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,070
Good grief.

469
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,920
We might be able to wait,

470
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,350
but the tea can't wait!

471
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,450
Besides,

472
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,180
with that scrap of paper you wrote,

473
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,680
and you're asking for
50,000 or 60,000 taels—

474
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,960
why should they lend you money?

475
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,690
Can you please smarten up a bit?

476
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
Hey, you're really getting into

477
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
scolding me now, aren't you?

478
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,160
I won't say anything more.

479
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,310
I'm thick-skinned anyway.

480
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,440
My life is worthless.

481
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,420
Tomorrow I'll go apologize
with thorny branches on my back.

482
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,330
Drink some boiled water

483
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,330
and wash your feet before sleeping!

484
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,400
If I ever listen to you again,

485
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,660
I'm a complete donkey.

486
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,950
[Silver Bud]

487
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,880
Put them inside.

488
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,040
All right.

489
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,630
Okay.

490
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,790
Put it here.

491
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,440
Okay.

492
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,400
Careful.

493
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,080
Zhu Laosan,

494
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
you're the craftiest one here.

495
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
Don't you short me on the weight.

496
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,920
I won't, I won't.

497
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,660
Come on, come on.

498
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,810
[Silver Bud]

499
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,140
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

500
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,130
I'm taking it to your home.

501
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,870
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

502
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,110
Put the tea here.

503
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,640
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

504
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,900
Where's your brother?

505
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,640
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

506
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,510
Okay, okay.

507
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,330
Mrs. Gu.

508
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,310
Having your meal?

509
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,730
Would you like to join us?

510
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,920
I'll pass, but thanks.

511
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Now that the tea is sold,

512
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,070
half the weight on my heart

513
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,190
is lifted.

514
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,040
That's better than any meal.

515
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,920
Right?

516
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,640
Right.

517
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,090
Um...

518
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,560
I have a cousin
who lives at the foot of the mountain.

519
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,050
He's got some good tea too.

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,030
You think we brothers

521
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,630
are rich suckers, don't you?

522
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,260
Your cousin's tea?

523
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,190
What about your uncle's tea?

524
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,470
You want

525
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,160
my uncle's tea too?

526
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,820
We want all your family's tea!

527
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,580
This kid...

528
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,210
How can you speak like that?

529
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,080
We'll buy it.

530
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,410
Spread the word—

531
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,250
besides tea from our village,

532
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,540
I'll take tea from other villages too.

533
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,640
But there's one condition:

534
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,270
I'll only buy first-grade tea.

535
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,510
Second or third grade—forget it.

536
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,770
For all the tea I purchase,

537
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,190
I'll still add 10% to the price.

538
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,590
In the next couple of days,
I'll have Pingwen

539
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,670
bring the money to you

540
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,080
so you can have peace of mind.

541
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,690
Really?

542
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,000
Then I'll tell everyone just that.

543
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,400
Thanks!

544
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,090
Thank you, Mrs. Gu.

545
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,880
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

546
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,210
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

547
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,940
I'll take my leave now.

548
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,000
Mother.

549
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,400
We have a hen at home.

550
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,720
Let's kill it and stew it.

551
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,820
It's doing so well.

552
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,830
Didn't you want to keep it for eggs?

553
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,510
Eggs?

554
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,920
We can't even afford to
eat an egg anymore.

555
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,790
Haven't you heard? We're finished.

556
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,000
My brother is dragging you and me

557
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,200
straight to our doom.

558
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,850
What are you two brothers talking about?

559
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,110
You didn't see it.

560
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,290
A few days ago,

561
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,070
my brother got kicked in the head

562
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,760
by a donkey.

563
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,790
He bought all the tea in the village

564
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,720
and laid it all outside.

565
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,440
If you had seen it,

566
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,480
you couldn't eat right now.

567
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
You shouldn't talk about
your brother like that.

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,790
No manners.

569
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,030
Pingyuan.

570
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,850
What are you doing?

571
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,440
You heard him.

572
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,210
I just bought a batch of tea.

573
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,310
I opened

574
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,100
a tea shop for Pingwen in town.

575
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,720
We've got to
have something to sell, right?

576
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,480
Enough, enough.

577
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Wipe that grin off your face.

578
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,110
You think you're rich like Li Million

579
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,560
with houses, land,

580
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
and mountains of gold and silver?

581
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,810
What are you using to pay everyone?

582
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
Those thorny branches from last time—

583
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,830
Pingyuan, put them on my back.

584
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,130
I'll crawl into town.

585
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,480
If I die halfway there, leave me there!

586
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,740
I might as well be dead!

587
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
Is Mr. Gu home?

588
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,050
We don't want any more tea!

589
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,890
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

590
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,620
Madam Jin,

591
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,850
what brings you here?

592
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,030
Madam Jin?

593
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,470
So you're Madam Jin.

594
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,070
This is your younger brother, right?

595
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,240
Unfortunately, that day

596
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
I happened to be at our Datong branch.

597
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,030
They told me your brother had visited.

598
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,920
He didn't get to eat

599
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,750
or even have tea.

600
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,830
I couldn't bear the thought of that.

601
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,030
So I hurried over to apologize.

602
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,900
I'm sorry.

603
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,640
No need for that, really.

604
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,880
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

605
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,340
Madam Jin, please come in.

606
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,960
Mother!

607
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,460
Mother,

608
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:52,580
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

609
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,240
this is my friend from Shanxi.

610
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,590
Greetings, Old Madam Gu.

611
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,010
I wish you good health.

612
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,400
Get up now, get up now.

613
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,210
Please come with me inside for tea.

614
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,070
Old Madam Gu,

615
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,610
let me help you inside so we can talk.

616
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,310
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

617
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,430
My husband and the others

618
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,240
send their regards.

619
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,030
I've also brought all the gifts

620
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,910
they sent.

621
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,170
Come in quickly!

622
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,000
-Yes, Madam.
-Yes, Madam.

623
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,650
Come on.

624
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,660
Pingyuan,

625
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,770
are those gifts real?

626
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,170
You don't believe it?

627
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Open the boxes and see for yourself.

628
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,540
Madam Jin,

629
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,330
I really owe you one this time.

630
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,260
Mr. Gu,

631
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,880
the untamed spirit you display outside

632
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,520
is kept in check at home, eh?

633
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,060
It's quite interesting to see.

634
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,440
After all, you are

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,700
our Association Head!

636
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,190
That's all made up.

637
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,170
This boy...

638
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,690
What Association Head
are you talking about?

639
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,110
Let me explain to you, Old Madam Gu.

640
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,880
Mr. Gu

641
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,090
is the leader of our Shanxi

642
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,640
Draft Bank Merchants' Association.

643
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,550
Among the 3,000 draft banks in Shanxi,

644
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,200
just one note from Mr. Gu

645
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,550
and everyone will obey.

646
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,880
Speaking of which, Association Head,
I should

647
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,680
apologize for arriving a day late.

648
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,200
No need for such formalities.

649
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,680
Mother,

650
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,580
Madam Jin is just teasing me.

651
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,650
I have something to discuss

652
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,200
with Madam Jin in private.

653
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,800
All right.

654
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,110
Our guest has come from afar,

655
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,910
so you must take good care of her.

656
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,920
We're country folk with simple manners.

657
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,780
Please don't mind, Madam Jin.

658
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,930
I don't deserve such courtesy,
Old Madam Gu.

659
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,590
Please excuse us for a moment.

660
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,660
Madam Jin, you don't have to

661
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,190
come all this way yourself.

662
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,290
When I left Shanxi,

663
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,150
I made it clear.

664
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,110
There would be no such thing

665
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,270
as an association head anymore.

666
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,600
Please stop teasing me.

667
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,270
Mr. Gu, you can live here

668
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,910
and still be so calm about it.

669
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,900
You truly are a great hero.

670
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,790
Those who offended you

671
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,270
must be blind.

672
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,880
I'm just a tea farmer now.

673
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,080
Anyone can offend me.

674
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,170
But you, Madam Jin,

675
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,550
coming all this way
in your esteemed position—

676
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,080
I feel truly sorry about it.

677
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,770
That's where you're wrong.

678
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,300
With our friendship,

679
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,070
Mr. Gu,

680
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,000
even across thousands of miles,

681
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,730
I must come to you immediately.

682
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,000
My husband is in poor health

683
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
and not fit to travel.

684
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,840
If I didn't come personally,

685
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
I simply couldn't be at ease.

686
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,750
To avoid any inconvenience in using it,

687
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,440
I've exchanged everything

688
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,550
for banknotes from the Four Major Banks
in the capital—

689
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,310
10,000 taels each,

690
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,310
20 notes in total.

691
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,480
Redeemable in hard silver.

692
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,880
I hope it's enough.

693
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,110
I can't possibly use that much.

694
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,500
If you can't use it all, just save it.

695
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,450
My husband said

696
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,940
it's rare for you to ask for help,

697
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,870
so we're more than happy to assist.

698
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,030
A small Anhui Tea Merchants' Association

699
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,790
dares to stand in your way?

700
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,550
They must have

701
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,250
lost their minds completely.

702
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Just say the word,

703
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,920
and we can buy up all the tea

704
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,780
in Anhui province. It's nothing.

705
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,640
Anyway, Mr. Li is in the tea business.

706
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,300
He has plenty of connections.

707
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm just a tea farmer now,

708
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,830
trying to prove a point to the villagers.

709
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,680
I don't want to make

710
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,010
such a big fuss about it.

711
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,020
Anyway,

712
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,750
here I must

713
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,060
thank you, Madam Jin.

714
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:53,870
All right,

715
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,680
I'll follow your instructions.

716
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,400
If there's nothing else,

717
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
I'll take my leave now.

718
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
The marketplace is like a battlefield—

719
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,490
no moment should be wasted.

720
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,350
Leaving so soon?

721
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,720
Won't you stay for a meal?

722
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,590
You think I came to Anhui

723
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,440
just for you?

724
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,670
I heard Hefei will be recaptured soon.

725
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,870
All along my journey,

726
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,000
I've been checking when we can

727
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,460
open a branch office here.

728
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,270
Mr. Gu,

729
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,440
you have your way of doing business,

730
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,750
and I have mine.

731
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,540
Mr. Gu,

732
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,350
no need to see me out further.

733
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,040
She's as capable as any man.

734
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,280
It's only right.

735
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
Be more careful.

736
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,570
Listen, everyone—

737
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,880
all the tea

738
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,260
should be stored separately
according to grade.

739
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,960
If this warehouse isn't big enough,

740
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,180
we can rent another one!

741
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,090
My brother said

742
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,010
that for anyone bringing tea,

743
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,570
as long as it's top-grade,

744
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,970
we should pay

745
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,350
10% more
than the Tea Merchants' Association!

746
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,830
Understand?

747
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,490
-Yes!
-Yes!

748
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,090
Mr. Pingwen, the boat has been rented.

749
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,110
Please go check it out.

750
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,240
Let's go take a look.

751
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,180
[Ping]

752
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,490
[Orchid]

753
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,590

Pingyuan,

757
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,140
you really have time
for such refined pursuits.

758
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,510
I heard that the Grand Tea Competition

759
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,000
doesn't allow individual participants.

760
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,030
Only provincial
tea merchants' associations can attend.

762
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,060
will we be allowed?

763
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,200
In this world, you have to take risks.

764
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,240
What?

765
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,520
Without them,

766

we have no path forward?

767
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,210

They set the rules.

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Those rules only benefit themselves.

771
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
I have my own rules.

772

Not for myself,

773
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,110
but for this Orchid Snow tea,

774
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,770
I must fight for recognition.

I'd still be wandering around.
