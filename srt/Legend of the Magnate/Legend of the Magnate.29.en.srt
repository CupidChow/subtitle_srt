00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,320
Your Excellency...

187
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,840
Stop wasting my time with this nonsense.

188
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,500
Stand down.

189
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
Your Excellency, but...

190
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,170
But what?

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,790
The imperial court is watching
with wide eyes,

192
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,520
hoping for the army to disband.

193
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,550
And the army?

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,510
Everyone in the army is watching eagerly,

195
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,000
hoping to get paid soon

196
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,450
so they can go home,

197
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,760
buy houses and land, and find wives.

198
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,090
Their eyes are red with anticipation.

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,010
If you keep them here

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,270
to run those salt fields,

201
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,270
how are we supposed to disband them?

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
What kind of idea is that?

203
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,910
Stand down.

204
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,720
After more than 10 years of war,

205
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,080
[Righteous and Diligent]

206
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,300
the army is poor,

207
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,930
and the common people... are even poorer.

208
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,670
I know

209
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,080
you all

210
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,700
don't want to mistreat

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,670
your soldiers who fought so hard.

212
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,800
You want to pay them as soon as possible

213
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,000
so they can return home
to their sons and grandchildren.

214
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,000
That's why

215
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,540
I've invited young master Li Qin

216
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,020
and Mr. Gu here—

217
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,600
these young business elites—

218
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,160
to give us some advice.

219
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,340
Only when Nanjing prospers

220
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,730
and the people have money in their pockets

221
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:21,790
[Righteous and Diligent]

222
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,630
can we collect taxes.

223
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,490
That's the right approach.

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,160
How could we take money from the people?

225
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,960
Besides,

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,100
Li Wantang, known as Li Million
from the capital,

227
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,010
is a good friend of mine.

228
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,000
He sent his son here to do business,

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,730
buying salt fields.

230
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,560
That's a blessing
for the Liangjiang region.

231
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,960
From now on, none of you shall

232
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
speak like this again

233
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,750
and make things difficult for him.

234
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

235
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Your Excellency is wise.

236
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Your Excellency.

237
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,530
Please sit down.

238
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,780
Come on.

239
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,780
Have a seat.

240
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,670
Sit.

241
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,170
They say you're a remarkable figure.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,730
What insights can you offer me?

243
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,330
I've heard bits and pieces

244
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,480
about Your Excellency's difficulties.

245
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,940
I wonder
what Your Excellency intends to do.

246
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,330
Tell me first,

247
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,210
what are your thoughts

248
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,540
on doing business?

249
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,270
I see business as...

250
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
the Great Way.

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,700
You're wrong, mister.

252
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,840
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—

253
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,630
merchants stand at the bottom.

254
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,600
Confucius said,

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
"The small man comprehends profit,

256
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,670
while the superior man
comprehends righteousness."

257
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,850
Your Excellency is wrong.

258
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,040
What did you just say?

259
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,730
I said, Your Excellency is wrong.

260
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,000
Business

261
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,100
is nothing more than buying and selling.

262
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,060
Back then, Confucius and Mencius

263
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,600
traveled tirelessly throughout the world,

264
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
and what was that for?

265
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,270
Of course, it was

266
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,350
to save all people under heaven

267
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,870
and establish moral authority.

268
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,670
Then how did they save the people

269
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,080
and establish this moral authority?

270
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,550
It was nothing more than persuading rulers
of various states

271
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,610
and peddling their political ideas.

272
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,240
Your Excellency yourself
used the word "peddling."

273
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,970
Wasn't that already business?

274
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,140
That's sophistry.

275
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,770
Without trade,

276
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,150
goods couldn't circulate
throughout the world,

277
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,810
and people would still be born

278
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,600
and die in the same place,
living in caves.

279
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,550
Isn't business

280
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,510
the Great Way?

281
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,960
Strong ships and powerful cannons,

282
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,270
the gains and losses of states,

283
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,840
and the rise and fall of nations—

284
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,900
all depend on this.

285
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,510
So how can you say business

286
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,510
isn't important?

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,330
If you put it that way,

288
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,120
I suppose...

289
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
you have a point.

290
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,250
In that case,

291
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
businessmen

292
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,080
are just like scholars,

293
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,870
both seekers of the Way.

294
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,390
There's no real difference.

295
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,650
For scholars,

296
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,200
seeking office is the lesser path,

297
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,600
while saving the world is
the greater path.

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,960
For merchants,

299
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
pursuing wealth is the lesser path,

300
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,790
while enriching the world is
the greater path.

301
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,320
This student, though lacking in talent,

302
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,030
has a heart

303
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,070
that yearns to follow the greater path.

304
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,820
Anyone can speak grand words.

305
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,730
I've heard plenty of them.

306
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Tell me your true intentions first.

307
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,510
When I first entered the business world,

308
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,440
I thought everything in this world

309
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
was merely a tool for profit.

310
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,550
I believed that keeping one's word,

311
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,840
following through on promises,

312
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
and ensuring both parties benefit

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
was the greater path.

314
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,780
But merely "both parties"

315
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
is too narrow.

316
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,280
It's like two armies at war—

317
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
those who care only about
winning a city or a fortress

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
aren't true generals.

319
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,040
Just as when I was a tea merchant—

320
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,150
only after seeing the tea trade
across the province

321
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,790
and even the entire nation

322
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,360
did I know

323
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,270
how I should pursue this path myself.

324
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,330
Only then could I see the big picture.

325
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
But now...

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
now my thoughts

327
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
have changed somewhat.

328
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,760
I wonder,

329
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,270
why limit oneself to one profession

330
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,100
or focus on just one business?

331
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,040
Since arriving in Nanjing,

332
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,480
I've witnessed devastation everywhere

333
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
and people struggling to survive.

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,870
And I think

335
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,850
this is a good business opportunity.

336
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,790
If possible,

337
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,630
I would like to assist Your Excellency

338
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,830
in managing Jiangnan

339
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,110
and planning for the nation.

340
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,720
Audacious young man,

341
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,780
you truly are an audacious young man.

342
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,560
Even I wouldn't dare

343
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,930
speak so boldly about managing Jiangnan.

344
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
However, such ambition

345
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,170
is indeed commendable.

346
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,770
Don't just be someone

347
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,430
who talks.

348
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,240
I must see actual results.

349
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,680
If you want results,

350
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Your Excellency will need to
follow my instructions.

351
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,770
Follow your instructions?

352
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,870
Young man,

353
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,520
that's quite a bold request.

354
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
I came to Jiangnan

355
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,610
not for wealth or position.

356
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Your Excellency has brought

357
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,130
my entire family here as hostages.

358
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,570
I only ask

359
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,260
that they return home safely.

360
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,670
You really

361
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,960
don't want money or position?

362
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,530
What use are position and wealth anyway?

363
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,480
I only fear that one day,

364
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,550
your forces will fall into chaos again,

365
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,960
the people of Jiangnan
will suffer terribly,

366
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,320
and my hometown will be destroyed
once more—

367
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
then there will truly be no hope left.

368
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,290
Neither the country nor the people

369
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,850
can bear such devastation.

370
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
In times of chaos,

371
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,850
what use

372
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,090
are position

373
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,630
or wealth?

374
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,960

catch a glimpse of her.

752
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,640
with the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

753
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,440
Is that true?

754
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,030
It is.

755
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,650
I didn't know you had such interests.

756
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
Food and sex are human nature.

757
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,130
What's the big deal?

758
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
So it's true then.

759
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Truth is truth.

760
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,960
[Clear Rivers and Ringing Shrines]

761
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,070
His Excellency is not feeling well today!

762
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,030
If anyone has business,

763
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,400
please submit a written report!

764
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,920
Also...

765
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,640
Mr. Gu, please come with me.

766
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,790
His Excellency specifically asked
to see you.

767
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,200
Yes.

768
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,680
Lord Gu...

769
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Your Excellency.

770
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,350
You...

771
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,720
Y-You're going to be the death of me.

772
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,140
I've already convinced myself

773
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
hundreds of times not to kill you.

774
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,340
Are you deliberately coming here

775
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,020
to d-drag me through the mud?

776
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,800
I didn't want to come.

777
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,230
You forced me to come.

778
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,550
I must have lost my mind.

779
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,550
No, I just...

780
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
What's wrong?

781
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,240
"What's wrong?"

782
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,770
You have the nerve to ask me?

783
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,310
Shouldn't you

784
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,510
explain yourself to me?

785
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,640
What am I supposed to explain?

786
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,300
Explain...

787
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,970
Tell me,

788
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,860
what exactly are you trying to do?

789
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,840
A-And where's the money you mentioned?

790
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,640
Well, Your Excellency is well-read.

791
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,510
Don't you know

792
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,550
which patron saint is

793
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,350
worshiped in all the brothels
in the country?

794
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,480
Well, isn't that...

795
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,100
The classics even mention this?

796
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
It actually is.

797
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,590
Confucius, in his lifetime,

798
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,920
praised very few people.

799
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,880
Among them was the Prime Minister of Qi,

800
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,740
Guan Zhong, also known as Guanzi.

801
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,590
Stop showing off.

802
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,610
Just tell me.

803
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
Back then, Qi was remote
and sparsely populated,

804
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
so Guan Zhong established
a women's quarter.

805
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
That women's quarter

806
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,270
was just like what we have now
at the Qinhuai River.

807
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,030
And the result?

808
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,160
Within three years,

809
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,480
the capital, Linzi, became prosperous,

810
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,410
with crowds of people everywhere.

811
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,720
I know Your Excellency is
a master of Neo-Confucianism.

812
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
You uphold the principle,
"Preserve heavenly principles

813
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,680
and suppress human desires."

814
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
But in matters under heaven,

815
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,680
if you go against human desires,

816
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,310
you can't accomplish anything.

817
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,390
The Qinhuai River has always been

818
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
a place where scholars
and refined gentlemen linger.

819
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,110
So I'd like to ask Your Excellency

820
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,110
to allocate

821
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,750
100,000 taels from the treasury.

822
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,400
First,

823
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,810
to dredge the Qinhuai River.

824
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,960
Second, to provide interest-free loans

825
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,030
to those brothels

826
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,860
so the girls there

827
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,110
can buy more hairpins and jewelry,

828
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,920
fabrics,

829
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,860
fine food, and tea snacks.

830
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,270
Then we need to spread

831
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,370
this news quickly.

832
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,550
Once word spreads
among merchants and travelers,

833
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,880
they'll come in droves.

834
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,310
With more people coming,

835
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,310
more business being done,

836
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,570
and more circulation,

837
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,950
won't the tax revenue increase as well?

838
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,440
By then, Your Excellency,

839
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,070
you won't have to worry about
collecting money.

840
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,440
What nonsense is that?

841
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,290
Using government funds

842
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,030
to lend to those houses of pleasure?

843
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
If those censors find out about this

844
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,270
and submit memorials against me,

845
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,530
what will become of me?

846
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,480
Those memorials would merely

847
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,850
accuse you of indulging in wine and women.

848
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,690
Isn't that preferable to
having chaos everywhere?

849
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,880
That's one way to look at it.

850
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,350
But all the officials

851
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,270
are watching.

852
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,580
How can I,
a respected master of Neo-Confucianism,

853
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,990
act out of line like this?

854
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,750
Tell me clearly

855
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,450
what you're really planning.

856
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,830
We haven't earned a single coin,

857
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,270
and now you want 100,000 taels?

858
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,880
No way.

859
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,790
Gaozi once said,

860
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
"Food and sex are human nature."

861
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,290
All people in the world

862
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,000
care about nothing
but food and sexual desires.

863
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,870
I believe

864
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,440
that once we revive the pleasure quarters
along the Qinhuai River,

865
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
within a year,

866
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,160
the vitality of Nanjing

867
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
will gradually recover.

868
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,090
Ridiculous.

869
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,640
Restoring vitality through those women?

870
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,500
What else then?

871
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,410
Renovating the examination hall

872
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,200
and printing a few Confucian classics?

873
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,730
Will that revive anything?

874
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,600
Your Excellency,

875
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,070
we agreed from the beginning

876
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,730
to manage Jiangnan together.

877
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,450
If so, we must adopt

878
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
a business perspective.

879
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,030
Business is

880
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,240
nothing more than
the outflow and inflow of money.

881
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,980
If you truly agree to this,

882
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,190
you'll demonstrate to the whole world

883
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,200
your determination

884
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,270
to restore normal life here.

885
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,880
First, revitalize the market

886
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
and fill everyone's stomachs.

887
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,510
The investment is small,

888
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,970
but the returns are great.

889
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,010
One hundred thousand taels
will be effective

890
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,920
and will also make a statement.

891
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,110
Your Excellency,

892
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,909
don't you think it's a good deal?

893
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,710
Really?

894
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,400
Speaking of which,

895
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,790
when I visited

896
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,320
some brothels
with Your Excellency yesterday,

897
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,260
it truly opened my eyes.

898
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,550
Can Your Excellency teach this student

899
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,280
some of those terms and jargon?

900
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,550
Enough, enough.

901
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,469
Let's not discuss this topic anymore.

902
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,260
Fine, I'll approve this money.

903
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Your Excellency has
the heart of a Bodhisattva.

904
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,400
Since that's the case,

905
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,530
I'd like to ask Your Excellency
to allocate another sum.

906
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,560
Isn't that enough already?

907
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,510
People will say

908
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,920
I came to Nanjing as an official

909
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
only to spend all the money

910
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,710
on businesses along the Qinhuai River—

911
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,550
wouldn't that be utterly humiliating?

912
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,710
Not at all, not at all.

913
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,230
The second allotment of funds
I'm requesting

914
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,230
is for two things.

915
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,800
First,

916
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,320
to gather the finest woodblock carvers
from across the country,

917
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,630
rebuild the academy here,

918
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,110
and carve the "Complete Library
of the Four Treasuries."

919
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,570
Second,

920
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,670
to resume
the imperial examinations this year

921
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,030
and renovate the examination halls.

922
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,510
It's the way of civil
and martial governance—

923
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,840
alternating
between tension and relaxation.

924
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,110
How much money would that require?

925
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,240
Also 100,000 taels.

926
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,880
It's like cutting a big watermelon
in half.

927
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,550
Half for you.

928
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,320
Half for you.

929
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,710
And nothing left for me.

930
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,560
Then I'll just spread my wings.

931
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,960
Fly away to buy another one.

932
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,070
Mr. Liao, Mr. Chang,

933
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,200
practicing kung fu?

934
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,640
Let's go inside
to practice internal energy.

935
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,870
I...

936
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,320
Miss Liao.

937
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,360
What, am I a ghost?

938
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,820
All of you are running away
at the sight of me.

939
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,280
Tell me,

940
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,710
what on earth is going on?

941
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,550
Why does everyone who sees me

942
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,810
have that expression?

943
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,280
Where do you think you're going?

944
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,070
Tell me quickly.

945
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,400
What exactly happened?

946
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,360
-Mr. Gu is back!
-Mr. Gu is back!

947
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,360
-Mr. Gu!
-Mr. Gu!

948
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,360
-Good fortune and peace to you, Mr. Gu!
-Good fortune and peace to you, Mr. Gu!

949
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,550
-Wait, why are you...
-Mr. Gu.

950
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,070
It's me.

951
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,320
I'm from Henian House.

952
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,230
I'm from Taoye House!

953
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,960
We're from Shuiming House!

954
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,420
We're from Hongxue House!

955
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,030
Alright.

956
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,440
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

957
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,070
I know you.

958
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,910
I know you all.

959
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,880
Why have you all gathered here

960
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,510
to see me?

961
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,680
No need to massage, no need.

962
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,220
What's this all about?

963
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,200
My good sir,

964
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,550
why are you being

965
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,880
so distant with us all of a sudden?

966
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,840
-That's right!
-Exactly!

967
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,510
The other day, you came to drink with us,

968
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,360
enjoying yourself

969
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,510
and telling all sorts of jokes—

970
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,670
why are you acting so formal
all of a sudden?

971
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,000
-Yes.
-Indeed!

972
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,630
Don't talk nonsense!

973
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,070
When did I

974
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,960
tell so many jokes?

975
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,840
Get to the point.

976
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,480
Mr. Gu,

977
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,670
we've come this time

978
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,630
for just one thing.

979
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,550
Along the Qinhuai River,

980
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,970
hundreds of sisters

981
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,110
sent us here as representatives

982
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,650
to kowtow to you properly.

983
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,360
If it weren't for you and His Excellency

984
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,760
looking after our business

985
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
and writing an elegiac couplet
for the Grande Dame,

986
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,620
we would've all

987
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,470
starved to death long ago.

988
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,670
-That's right.
-Exactly.

989
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,230
-Indeed.
-Yes.

990
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,400
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

991
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,760
has even allocated silver for us

992
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,960
to repair our houses.

993
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,130
Tomorrow,

994
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,680
they'll start dredging the Qinhuai River!

995
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,920
Wouldn't you say

996
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,550
this is like being blessed
by a living Bodhisattva?

997
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,360
-Yes.
-Indeed!

998
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,390
-A pleasure Bodhisattva!
-Yes.

999
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,670
-Our great benefactor!
-Indeed.

1000
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,570
When I go back,

1001
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,630
I'll set up a longevity tablet for you

1002
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,190
and place it alongside the tablet

1003
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,720
of our good sir, Guan Zhong.

1004
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,760
Come on, come on!

1005
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,300
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

1006
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,800
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

1007
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,510
Please get up, get up!

1008
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,310
Please get up!

1009
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,920
Just call him Guan Zhong.

1010
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,000
Don't say "my good sir."

1011
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Address him properly.

1012
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,320
And there's no such thing
as a pleasure Bodhisattva,

1013
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
only living ones.

1014
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,960
Alright, you're absolutely right.

1015
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,510
We've

1016
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,500
kowtowed

1017
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,030
and will leave after saying
what we came to say.

1018
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,550
We know

1019
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,630
you're newly married.

1020
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,440
Our presence here

1021
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,500
must be inconvenient for you, right?

1022
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,360
And we know you're an honest
and upright official.

1023
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,070
Therefore,

1024
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,830
we've prepared some rouge

1025
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
for your wife

1026
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,780
and your mother,

1027
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,110
along with face powder

1028
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,300
and some fabric.

1029
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,770
Please don't refuse.

1030
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,930
If you refuse,

1031
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,530
you're looking down on us.

1032
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,230
-Yes, exactly.
-Yes.

1033
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,710
Don't be nervous.

1034
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,980
All 160 brothels

1035
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,740
along the Qinhuai River—

1036
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,070
the girls have all agreed

1037
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,470
to keep the back doors of the houses open
for you day and night!

1038
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,770
Even if you don't bring a single coin,

1039
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,190
we'll take care of you
for the rest of your days!

1040
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,120
-For the rest of your days!
-For the rest of your days!

1041
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,430
Alright, alright.

1042
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,710
Thank you, thank you all.

1043
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,710
Please go back now.

1044
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,790
Look, everyone,

1045
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,630
Mr. Gu hasn't been drinking,

1046
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,800
so he's being shy!

1047
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,710
-Indeed!
-Yes!

1048
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,110
It's perfectly normal
for a real man to enjoy

1049
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,440
the company of courtesans!

1050
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,900
-That's right!
-Exactly!

1051
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,190
-Do come often!
-Please come often!

1052
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,550
Remember to visit our Henian House.

1053
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,280
Come to our Taoye House!

1054
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,230
Yu'er.

1055
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,690
Doing embroidery?

1056
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,440
How did you,

1057
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,730
a woman who wields weapons,

1058
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,460
suddenly start embroidering?

1059
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,110
There's food saved for you in the kitchen.

1060
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,240
I've already eaten.

1061
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,470
I've made tea for you too.

1062
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,100
You're so thoughtful.

1063
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,370
What's this?

1064
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,130
A list of gifts sent to you.

1065
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Didn't I tell you?

1066
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,110
We can't accept gifts

1067
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,840
from anyone.

1068
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,080
Why don't you listen?

1069
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,000
Mother wants you to read the gift list.

1070
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,590
[Gift List]

1071
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,670
Ten boxes of

1072
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,510
agarwood bracelets, carved with

1073
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,280
hollowed-out swastika patterns.

1074
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,820
Six gold-inlaid jade
peach-shaped hairpins.

1075
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,400
A pair of

1076
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,480
rose-tourmaline twist-pattern bracelets.

1077
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,810
One long gold-inlaid white jade hairpin.

1078
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
A pair of gold-inlaid

1079
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,360
spring water green jade
peach-shaped rings.

1080
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,630
One hundred...

1081
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,730
Virility Pills.

1082
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,960
These were sent by people
from the brothels, right?

1083
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,800
What kind of gift is this?

1084
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
Do I look like someone
who needs such pills?

1085
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,130
Finish reading the list first.

1086
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,460
Sixty pieces of

1087
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,630
erotic paintings, large and small.

1088
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,930
A complete set of
The Sexual Arts of the Bedchamber.

1089
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,730
There's no way to explain this now.

1090
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,400
Yu'er.

1091
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,960
Um, Yu'er.

1092
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,800
Yu'er!

1093
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,840
Stop embroidering.

1094
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,670
Talk to me,

1095
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,510
okay?

1096
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,480
If you're really going to

1097
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,510
deal with those officials every day

1098
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,070
while I only know how to handle weapons,

1099
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,590
ride horses, and shoot arrows,

1100
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,250
wouldn't that embarrass you?

1101
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,850
You should hire a tutor

1102
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,620
to teach me reading, writing,

1103
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,300
embroidery, and cooking,

1104
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,170
so I won't end up
being sent back to Shanxi by you.

1105
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,960
Who told you these things?

1106
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,670
Aren't they clearly trying to
drive us apart?

1107
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,510
Who said it? I'll go find them!

1108
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,960
Why are you being so fierce?

1109
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,770
I said it.

1110
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,680
What's wrong?

1111
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Just keep practicing with these things.

1112
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,090
When you're with me,

1113
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,510
you don't need to
put yourself through all this.

1114
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,320
If you really want to
learn to read and write,

1115
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,180
I'll teach you.

1116
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,030
There's no one under heaven

1117
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,360
who could teach you better than I can,

1118
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,800
right?

1119
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,760
I knew it.

1120
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,190
The moment I walked in,
everyone who saw me

1121
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,920
acted like they'd seen a ghost.

1122
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,090
And you were smiling at me.

1123
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,760
Take it.

1124
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,600
I know you're angry inside.

1125
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,480
Just let it out.

1126
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,280
When you feel better, I feel better too.

1127
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,410
As husband and wife,

1128
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,610
we don't hold things in like others do.

1129
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,490
Everyone's been saying lately

1130
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,360
that you've been visiting brothels
along the Qinhuai River every day,

1131
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,690
and I didn't believe it.

1132
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,090
Of course you shouldn't believe them.

1133
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,090
Did you go then?

1134
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,150
I went for one day.

1135
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,840
If I told you

1136
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,000
that I went there on official duty,

1137
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
would you believe me?

1138
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,280
Would you really believe that yourself?
