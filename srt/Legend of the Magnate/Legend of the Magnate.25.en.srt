[Episode 25]

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,060
Please have a seat.

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,789
Let me.

5
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,789
Have a taste, Lord Gu.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,229
This is what they usually drink.

7
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,560
It's similar to our tea.

8
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
How do you like it?

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,190
Similar?

10
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,570
Not at all.

11
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,590
The British don't drink tea?

12
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,320
They do.

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,730
They just add milk to it.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,329
Captain.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,290
Greetings, sir.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,930
It's a pleasure to meet you.

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,910
A handshake will do.

18
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,840
He said it's a pleasure to meet you.

19
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,970
How are you?

20
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,690
How are you?

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,150
I'm fine.

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,620
He's great.

[Tod, British Warship Captain]

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,310
The captain says

25
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,560
this warship belongs to

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,340
the British Empire's Indian Navy,

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,400
protecting the Indian Ocean routes.

28
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,400
He's

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,870
going back to India to report for duty.

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,480
This ship is not for sale.

31
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
I was just about to ask

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,410
about India.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,630
Thank you.

35
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,430
See you.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
No problem.

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,200
Mr. Zhang from Lu'an Salt Shop.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm here.

39
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,840
Excuse me.

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,680
Our Master wants to see you.

41
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,240
Mr. Li.

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,750
You're here, bro.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Have a seat.

44
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,400
Mr. Li,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,540
I won't lie to your face.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I'll be frank.

47
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,660
This salt field

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,800
has been in my family for 3 generations.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,660
I heard

50
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,710
you were buying salt fields in bulk,

51
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,370
so I rushed over with the deed.

52
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,430
It's just that...

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
if I just sell it

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,910
like this,

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,250
I'd be betraying my ancestors.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,190
Taking someone's ancestral property

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,430
is unforgivable.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,240
This salt field deed
is not that important to me—

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,190
I can take it or leave it.

60
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,750
But if I don't buy it,

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,680
brother,

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,480
can you go back?

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,510
If I'm not mistaken,

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
that outfit

65
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,120
is what you just redeemed

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,180
from the pawnshop.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,190
There are

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,390
more than 390 salt households in Jiangnan.

69
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,480
Since I'm getting into the salt business,

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
I must be careful.

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
Please forgive me if I offended you.

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,090
To be honest,

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,510
life is indeed a bit hard right now.

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,580
How about this?

75
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,680
I'll give you some money

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
to open a salt shop

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
so you can make a living.

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
In name, the shop

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,159
will be yours.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,310
Once it turns a profit,

81
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,040
we'll split it eighty–twenty.

82
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,060
I'll supply the goods.

83
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,040
Take

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,070
this deed back.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Mr. Li,

86
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,040
you're truly a living Bodhisattva.

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,480
You're helping me at a time like this

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,340
so that our whole family can live.

89
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,740
I...

90
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,410
I don't know what to say.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,240
You...

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,640
Take him down

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,180
and hand over the money
and the salt license.

94
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,840
Let's go.

95
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,120
Father.

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,860
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

97
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,000
Just a few hours feels long to you?

98
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,650
It's not that I can't wait.

99
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,330
I've been waiting for more than 20 years.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
Are you upset?

101
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,040
Then tell me, what have you been waiting

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,170
for all these years?

103
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,160
I'm waiting for a chance.

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,720
Waiting for your trust.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
I've barely been here a few days,

106
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,750
my seat isn't even warm,

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,870
and here you are.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,420
When will that old fox Hu

109
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,720
surrender?

110
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,270
Soon.

111
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,030
I followed your arrangement

112
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,390
and gave him 3 days.

113
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,040
Three days?

114
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,110
How do you know it'll be soon?

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
He's at a dead end.

116
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,070
But I heard him tell the tea merchants

117
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,040
that if they can't hold out,

118
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,470
they can sell the tea to him

119
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,130
and he'll buy it back

120
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,020
according to the previous price.

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,590
He was just dreaming.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
He's afraid we'll split his power.

123
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,680
He's still reluctant to admit his failure.

124
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,690
This old man

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,430
has been in charge of tea in a province

126
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,480
for most of his life.

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,240
And you think he's scared?

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
You naive young man.

129
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,870
He's hoarding tea

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
to challenge us.

131
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,280
Challenge us with what?

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,430
At worst, we don't buy his goods

133
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,160
and let him cry

134
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,190
over that old tea.

135
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,010
Don't pile it here.

136
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
How can we get in?

137
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,490
[Tea]

138
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,160
Has Mr. Gu

139
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
brought any news?

140
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,140
No.

141
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,600
Is there no room in the warehouse?

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,950
Go.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Mr. Hou Er,

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,940
the warehouse is full.

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,890
Full?

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,430
Yes.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,750
Old Master Hu.

148
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,350
Old Master Hu, Old Master Hu.

149
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,120
Waiting like this

150
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,290
isn't going to work.

151
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,430
The nearby tea merchants

152
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,750
all know you have a way,

153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,070
so they keep

154
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
sending tea here.

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
The money in our counter

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,170
flows out like water

157
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,390
and never comes back.

158
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,360
The tea gets older every day.

159
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,640
Spring tea has a daily price.

160
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,920
What do we do if we don't wait?

161
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,390
Well...

162
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Right now, the whole market

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,560
follows the same price—

164
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,630
that's set by Li Wantang.

165
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,240
You tell me, do I accept it or not?

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Well, why does Li Million

167
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,070
hold a grudge against us?

168
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,800
Don't you know that?

169
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,680
Isn't it because

170
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,720
that Mr. Gu

171
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,720
ruined his plan?

172
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,270
If you ask me,

173
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,360
you should just compromise a little

174
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
and beg Li Wantang for some leniency.

175
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,390
The lives
of all the tea merchants in Anhui

176
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,120
are in your hands.

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait, you...

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,130
Old Master Hu, you have an invitation.

179
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,560
Invitation?

180
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm busy.

181
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,510
It's a guest from the capital.

182
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,360
From the capital?

183
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,950
Come on.

184
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,270
[Yours Humbly, Li Wantang.]

185
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,070
Old Master Hu.

186
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,950
Li Wantang invited you personally.

187
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,350
This is a way out.

188
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,680
At least it gives you face.

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
It would be inappropriate

190
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,190
if you don't go.

191
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,040
If I go,

192
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
it's for the Tea Merchants' Association.

193
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,720
Of course.

194
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,440
You never said anything

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,630
about buying a ship.

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,760
See you again, my friend.

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,200
When did I ever say

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
I wanted to buy a ship?

199
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,390
Are you even here to handle

200
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,440
the tea business or not?

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,480
Isn't that exactly

202
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,540
what I'm doing now?

203
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,080
Come on, Pingyuan,
focus on the proper work,

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,870
will you?

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,240
You came here
and just drank some black bitter water.

206
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,300
You didn't like it?

207
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,080
I found it interesting.

208
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,200
I like it.

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,600
I like it.

210
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,600
Go back now.

211
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,150
Why?

212
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,870
You didn't get it done,

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,510
Pingyuan.

214
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,250
That British guy said

215
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,200
the imperial court

216
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
has given the authority to purchase tea

217
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,270
to the Li family.

218
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,360
If they don't buy it from us,

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
many people in Anhui

220
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,960
will hang themselves
or jump into rivers this year.

221
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,690
How is that considered "done?"

222
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,550
Your logic is getting

223
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,750
clearer and clearer.

224
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,300
Not bad.

225
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,790
Pingyuan,

226
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,270
stop teasing me.

227
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,910
Just tell me—

228
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,790
do we have a solution or not?

229
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Here's what we do.

230
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,170
Rent a fast boat immediately.

231
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
You must go back

232
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,650
before dawn tomorrow.

233
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,280
Impossible.

234
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
Even if I could do magic,
I couldn't make it.

235
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,790
Didn't you hear

236
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,960
that foreigner just now?

237
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,600
Li Million has to deliver

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,860
within 3 days.

239
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,750
He's not in Beijing right now.

240
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,830
My only worry is

241
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,630
Old Master Hu

242
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,440
getting soft

243
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,530
and selling the tea.

244
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,790
If that happens,

245
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,910
there will be no place for us

246
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,030
in Anhui.

247
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,960
When you get back,

248
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,090
tell Old Master Hu

249
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
to give me one more day and night.

250
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,000
I will definitely

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
get this done for him.

252
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
One day...

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,150
and one night?

254
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,750
Tell him exactly what I said.

255
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,480
Well... so where are you going?

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,970
I have my things to do.

257
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,390
Those foreigners can scheme against us,

258
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,150
and we can scheme against them too.

259
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
Before, our disadvantage

260
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,960
was that we knew too little

261
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,620
about them.

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Just wait and see.

263
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,200
Once this is over,

264
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,470
we'll have plenty of big business to do.

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Pingyuan,

266
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,090
can you just give me a hint?

267
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,030
No.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
It's not the time yet.

269
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,760
Don't worry.

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,290
You'll understand when it's done.

271
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
So what if Li Million

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
is strong?

273
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,080
Since he wants to

274
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,410
drive me into a dead end,

275
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,750
he can't blame me.

276
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,790
I told you to keep an eye

277
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,120
on that Gu.

278
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,050
Where is he now?

279
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,840
I-I don't know.

280
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,870
I'm not sure.

281
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,120
Master,

282
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,940
he left it to us.

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,790
So soon?

284
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,720
He agreed to leave the deed here

285
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,360
[Official Certificate]

286
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,220
as collateral.

287
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,030
This family

288
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,150
smokes opium every day.

289
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,080
I don't think the deed
will last more than 3 days.

290
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,530
They're suffering
but still want to save face—

291
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:02,740
what's the point?

292
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,240
[Official Certificate]

293
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
Do I

294
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,440
have a dinner with Old Master Hu

295
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,320
tonight?

296
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,840
Yes, Master.

297
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,080
Go tell the people outside

298
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,050
to head home

299
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,410
and come back tomorrow.

300
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,510
Wait!

301
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,390
Father,

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
you promised

303
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,460
to let me handle things here.

304
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,840
I just came here today, and you're now

305
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,300
stirring things up again.

306
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,870
If you go to this dinner tonight,

307
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll go back to the capital!

308
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll just leave everything behind!

309
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,920
Leave us.

310
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,030
Are you angry?

311
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,840
Was it you who suggested Gu Pingyuan

312
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,020
go to Shanghai?

313
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,110
Was it?

314
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,360
He doesn't understand

315
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,240
how the Qing Empire's customs work

316
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,000
at all. What's going on?

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,550
He's just a small-time tea farmer,

318
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,500
a prisoner who escaped from exile.

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't understand,

320
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,870
why do you have to be friends

321
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,030
with him?

322
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,440
You'd rather
ruin your own family's business

323
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,690
to help an outsider!

324
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,360
Father,

325
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,130
you had people eavesdrop on me.

326
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,840
Whether this tea deal

327
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,030
makes or loses money—

328
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,670
I don't care at all.

329
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,280
There are
plenty of business opportunities.

330
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
But I have

331
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,550
only one son.

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,390
Tell me,

333
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,870
why did you do that?

334
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,270
Why?

335
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
I just thought

336
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,530
we couldn't do business like that.

337
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,120
Then how should we do business?

338
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,080
It doesn't have to be a fight
to the death.

339
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,830
The roads of the world
should be open for everyone to walk.

340
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,090
Why do you have to

341
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,180
force others into a corner like that?

342
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,480
I regret it.

343
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,000
I should've let you

344
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,390
keep studying.

345
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
You're not cut out for business.

346
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,240
As long as you don't smoke opium
or gamble,

347
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,960
our family fortune

348
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,890
will last you several lifetimes.

349
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,720
Fine.

350
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,010
Go back to the capital.

351
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,730
I'll hire an old Hanlin scholar

352
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,930
to help you pick up your studies again

353
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,840
and teach you

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,870
the classics.

355
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,860
That would be good too.

356
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,910
Father,

357
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,630
you want me

358
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,760
to withdraw from the family business?

359
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,080
Yes.

360
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,450
You're not made for business.

361
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,770
And you don't understand the Qing Empire.

362
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I don't!

363
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,080
You do!

364
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,790
You are always right!

365
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm the one who suggested Gu Pingyuan

366
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
go to Shanghai.

367
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,360
I didn't even

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,560
want to come to Anhui in the first place.

369
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,600
You want to buy the goods
from those tea merchants

370
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,170
at 20 percent of its value—

371
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,550
that's bullying!

372
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,790
That's pushing them

373
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,480
to the brink!

374
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,020
What kind of business is this?

375
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,250
If you had troops,

376
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
you might as well send soldiers
to rob them!

377
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,720
Wouldn't that be easier?

378
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,120
Kid, kid,

379
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,810
a kind man can't command troops,
and a righteous man can't manage wealth.

380
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,790
Whose path is really easy?

381
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,800
So you're saying

382
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,750
I can't do business

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,720

We're exploiting Anhui this time

385

because His Highness wanted us to.

386
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,320
He was furious that the Anhui people

387
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,440
ruined his plan
at the Grand Tea Competition.

let them go,

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,910
and offend His Highness?

391
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,440
I can't.

If His Highness fails,
I'll be dragged down.

406
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,349
told me to give you a message.

408
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,369

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,690
Why put yourself through this?

575
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,220
Has Master

576
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,270
ever miscalculated in business?

577
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,820
With all his moves,

578
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,770
how could that Hu be his match?

579
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,830
[Maojian from Mount Huangshan]
[Taiping Hou Kui]

580
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,430
Just wait for the final news.

581
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,050
Mr. Gu said 3 days.

582
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,550
[Tea]

583
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,550
It's been 5 days.

584
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,160
And we are still waiting?

585
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,590
Indeed.

586
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,640
How long are we supposed to wait?

587
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,960
I told you from the start—

588
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
Orchid Snow tea is a monster

589
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,030
and shouldn't have been brought
to the capital.

590
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,590
And what happened?

591
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,880
He went on his own

592
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,770
and stirred everything up.

593
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
And the result?

594
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,090
What happened?

595
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
All the tea merchants in the province

596
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,920
are apologizing on his behalf.

597
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,680
What kind of nonsense is that?

598
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,720
Sun Wukong was very capable,

599
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,030
but when he ruined the Peach Banquet,

600
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,030
he still got trapped

601
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,760
under Five Elements Mountain.

602
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,720
Sun Wukong at least had a cudgel.

603
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,440
That Gu

604
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,310
only has his mouth.

605
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,270
That's right.

606
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,670
What kind of situation is this?

607
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,680
Then why don't you come up with an idea?

608
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,670
What good is all this useless talk?

609
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,310
When he won the title

610
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,590
of "Top Tea Under Heaven,"

611
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,550
you all rushed

612
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,400
to ask for his recipe and tea seeds.

613
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,840
Why are you all just talking now?

614
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,110
Mr. Hu,

615
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,220
spring tea waits for no one.

616
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,680
Let's not talk about

617
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,880
what Gu is like for now.

618
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,430
We need to get through

619
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,610
this crisis first.

620
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,900
Otherwise,

621
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,030
everyone will be doomed.

622
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,830
That's right.

623
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,750
Everyone will be doomed.

624
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,680
All of us.

625
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,830
If any of you think

626
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,750
you're capable

627
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,240
of getting us through this crisis,

628
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,370
I'll kneel and step down immediately.

629
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,960
If you have no ideas, then just shut up.

630
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,070
What?

631
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,110
Li Wantang is using official power
to pressure us.

632
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,580
Even if we hand over

633
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Mr. Gu's head,

634
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,900
will he stop?

635
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,110
Who got us the plaque

636
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,510
of "Top Tea Under Heaven?"

637
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,910
Who works their butt off
every day outside?

638
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,530
I'm honestly embarrassed for you all.

639
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,400
Shame on you.

640
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,890
You seriously think

641
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,700
Master will lose?

642
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,000
When I first arrived,

643
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,810
I said

644
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
the tea business in Anhui

645
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,920
shouldn't be handled this way.

646
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,960
If we want to run
the "Top Tea Under Heaven" brand,

647
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,640
we could negotiate with them.

648
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
Why bully them

649
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,830
so arrogantly?

650
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,240
Who does business like that?

651
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,580
At first, I thought

652
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,270
Master was just venting his anger.

653
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,640
Now that I think about it,

654
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,200
what he said makes sense.

655
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,370
As the saying goes,

656
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,270
"No merchant is without cunning."

657
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,680
It's a bit harsh,

658
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,400
but it's right.

659
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,580
You're Pingwen?

660
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,050
Where is your brother?

661
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,500
Did he leave a message?

662
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,680
What did he say?

663
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,820
What did he say?

664
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,240
Servants!

665
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,880
Take him inside.

666
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,150
Make them some hot porridge.

667
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
Old Master Hu,

668
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,150
let's go.

669
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
Even if you want to die,
wait a little longer.

670
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,290
What are we waiting for?

671
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,270
Look at him—

672
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,070
what can he even say?

673
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,930
I remember now.

674
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,780
My brother said...

675
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,680
What did he say?

676
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,450
He said to wait for him
for one more day and night.

677
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,680
Is there ever an end?

678
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,540
Get him inside!

679
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,070
He really dares?

680
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,310
He really dares.

681
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,010
Is it funny?

682
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,880
No.

683
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,130
Have you sent people to ask around?

684
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,720
Is he afraid to come,

685
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,900
or

686
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,500
is someone among them against it?

687
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,810
No one's against it.

688
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,520
It's just that old guy Hu

689
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,790
holding out on his own.

690
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,000
Master, please don't be angry.

691
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,590
I don't think he can hold out much longer.

692
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,350
It's not like

693
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,810
he can turn things around.

694
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,350
I can't believe it.

695
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,290
By logic,

696
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,310
he should've been cornered.

697
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,960
So how did he stand his ground

698
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,160
after just one night?

699
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,110
Something's off.

700
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Something's off.

701
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,580
Nothing's off.

702
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,110
If he wants to drag it out, let him.

703
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,570
We can outlast him anyway.

704
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,880
It must be

705
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,750
that brat Gu causing trouble.

706
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Send some men to Shanghai

707
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,510
to dig around

708
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,260
and see what he's up to.

709
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,110
Okay.

710
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,110
Father,

711
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm going back to sleep.

712
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,720
Our business is not going well.

713
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,110
How dare you go to sleep?

714
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,110
It's your business,

715
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,240
not mine.

716
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,320
Go back.

717
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,590
So many people are waiting for you.

718
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,240
Yes.

719
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,680
Go back.

720
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,520
Old Master Hu, there's a letter!

721
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,590
Old Master Hu.

722
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,080
[To Old Master Hu]

723
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,540
[Cover]

724
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,500
[I caught a chill last night
and was unable to keep our appointment.]

725
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,380
[I feel deeply sorry about it.]

726
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,430
[I have arranged a banquet
at Baixiang Restaurant at noon today,]

727
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,030
[and I sincerely invite you to attend]

728
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,630
[so that I may offer my apologies
in person.]

729
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,240
It's Li Million.

730
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,300
Li Million?

731
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,980
He said that

732
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,130
because he stood me up yesterday,

733
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,810
he wanted to make it up to me

734
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,660
by inviting me to a banquet

735
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,890
at Baixiang Restaurant at noon today.

736
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,830
Go. You should go.

737
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,680
Old Master Hu,

738
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,290
we must accept the face he's giving us.

739
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,100
I should go?

740
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,170
Yes.

741
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,960
You should go.

742
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,750
Hey,

743
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,770
where is the messenger?

744
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,750
Old Master Hu,

745
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,180
he's waiting for your reply downstairs.

746
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,160
Well,

747
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,570
tell him this...

748
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,640
Why did you...

749
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
Why did you tear it up?

750
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,720
Why did you tear it up?

751
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,550
Yes.

752
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,440
Yesterday,

753
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,060
if that Li Million

754
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,180
hadn't acted so overbearing,

755
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,530
I would have sold him

756
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,670
all the tea in the province

757
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,350
for cheap.

758
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,270
That was close.

759
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,280
Where are you going?

760
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,110
I

761
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,900
didn't sleep well last night.

762
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,070
I have a headache.

763
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,550
If anyone comes looking for me,

764
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,450
just say I'm unwell
and won't see visitors.

[Top Tea Under Heaven]

766
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,350
After you go back,

767
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,200
tell all your clerks

768
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,480
not to sell

769
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,960
a single ounce of tea today.

770
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,750
Master.

771
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
That Hu

772
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,970
is still that stubborn?

773
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,070
Yes.

774
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,640
He hid away
under the pretext of recuperating,

775
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,720
saying he had a headache

776
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,450
and wouldn't see anyone today.

777
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,300
I made a wrong move.

778
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,720
I thought Hu

779
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,480
was just arrogant and foolish,

780
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,480
and I wanted to knock him down a notch

781
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,960
to push the price lower.

782
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,170
If I'd gone

783
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,660
to that dinner last night,

784
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,940
things would probably be settled by now.

785
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,470
Let's wait

786
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
and see what miracle

787
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,200
he can pull off.

788
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,400
I've been thinking.

789
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,290
I thought about it the whole afternoon

790
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,170
and still couldn't figure it out.

791
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,480
Master,

792
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,680
we've already

793
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,310
taken care of the foreigners.

794
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,160
And everyone at the imperial court
is on our side.

795
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,690
He has no room to make a move.

796
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,240
What can he even do?

797
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,790
Don't talk too big.

798
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,310
Time has changed.

799
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,620
Now there are foreigners
and the Southern Army.

belongs to young people now.

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,290
I'm not going anywhere.

803
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,320
I'll stay right here and watch.

804
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,590
Where is Qin?

805
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,000
He's in his room.

806
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,750
I'm already this old,

807
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,880
and I'm still competing with my own son.

808
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,480
Let it be.

809
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,210
I'm curious about the outcome.

00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,370

put yourself through this

such a large deal before.

845
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,440
Now the fate
of all the tea merchants in Anhui

846
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
rests on me alone.

847
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,440
So, Mr. Li,

848
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,340
I really need your help this time.

849
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,480
Come, sit down.

851
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,840
was just about to ask you.

the "Top Tea Under Heaven"—

854
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,980
what exactly is it?

855
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,670
I'm in the tea business myself,

856
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,270
yet I didn't even know
what Orchid Snow tea was.

857
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,720
Only after asking around

858
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,160
did I find out it's yours.

859
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,300
As long as you want it,

860
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,360
I can supply as much as you need.

861
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,920
Okay.

862
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,160
It's a deal then.

863
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,400
Now,

864
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
let's talk business.

865
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,380
What was it you said

866
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,110
about Anhui tea?

867
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Here's the thing.

868
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,320
Li Wantang got the exclusive rights

869
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,110
to the tea trade between
the imperial court and the foreigners.

870
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,880
He holds a grudge
because I ruined his plan

871
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,150
at the Grand Tea Competition,

872
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,150
and now he's determined

873
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,670
to crush Anhui's tea business.

874
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,230
I can't just sit and wait to die.

875
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,710
I've decided

876
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,840
to fight him.

877
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,030
Li Million in the capital?

878
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,070
He's not so impressive.

879
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,450
Wencai means

880
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,550
Li Million isn't anything special.

881
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,690
That may be,

882
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,360
but this time he got the exclusive rights

883
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,590
to the tea trade

884
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
between the imperial court
and the foreigners.

885
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,230
This

886
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
can't be solved with just money now.

887
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,480
Mr. Li,

888
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,950
for the sake
of all the tea farmers in Anhui,

889
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,150
please help me.

890
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,960
Okay.

891
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,960
Bro,

892
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,530
I'll take all of Anhui's tea this year.

893
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,070
Worst case, I'll make

894
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,230
a few more trips to Inner Mongolia.

895
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,760
It will be sold eventually.

896
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,360
Right?

897
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,670
Mr. Gu,

898
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,040
I still have to say this—

899
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,440
for something this minor,

900
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
you could've sent someone

901
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,400
to tell us.

902
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,330
Or you could've sent us a letter

903
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,760
through any of our shops.

904
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,030
Why did you have to come all the way
in person?

905
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,550
Your health is more important.

906
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,360
Don't end up

907
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,550
getting sick all over,

908
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,710
just like my husband.

909
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,630
Then we really wouldn't be able

910
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,890
to forgive ourselves.

911
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,630
Yes.

912
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,290
I know

913
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,650
you truly care about me.

914
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,770
But I can't

915
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,590
dump every burden on your shoulders

916
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,470
whenever

917
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,190
I encounter something.

918
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,860
As for this matter,

919
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,030
I do have a few ideas

920
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,510
we can discuss together.

921
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,030
Okay.

922
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,910
Although I only spent a day in Shanghai,

923
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,190
I've come to believe

924
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,630
that this so‑called
exclusive tea‑trade right

925
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,920
isn't such a big deal.

926
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,320
The imperial court has no real control

927
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,050
over the foreigners nowadays.

928
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,920
So I was thinking—

929
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,050
could you support me

930
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,500
in making a deal with the foreigners?

931
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,630
Go ahead.

932
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,840
According to my sources,

933
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,480
the British East India Company

934
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,510
is based in India.

935
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,630
If we leave

936
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,300
from Shiliupu Pier,

937
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,630
pass through the Strait of Malacca,

938
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
and then travel by sea
for another 2 days and nights,

939
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,510
we can reach India.

940
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
Tea sells

941
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,380
extremely well there,

942
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,320
and the price they pay is far higher

943
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
than what the foreigners pay here

944
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,880
in our country.

945
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,970
So I've been thinking,

946
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
instead of relying on Xianghe Trade House

947
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,920
to deal with the foreigners,

948
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,290
why don't we sell our tea

949
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
directly to India?

950
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,510
I'm not dreaming.

951
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,360
I've actually found
a few possible channels.

952
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
We're listening.

953
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,840
Before I say it,

954
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,800
could you help me

955
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,710
with one thing?

956
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,010
Anhui tea can't wait even one more day.

957
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,590
Li Wantang has gone mad with greed.

958
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,480
He wants to swallow it in one bite.

959
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,290
Could we find someone

960
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
who can take over
all of Anhui's tea at once

961
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,770
and ship it to Shanghai?

962
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,190
Then I'll go to Shanghai with you,

963
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,880
and from there

964
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,340
we can make a trip to India.
What do you think?

965
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,880
Mr. Li,

966
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,360
your draft bank in Hefei

967
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,820
hasn't opened yet, has it?

968
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,250
Are you short

969
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,190
on ready cash?

970
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,350
How about

971
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,510
I invest?

972
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,110
You invest?

973
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,110
There's no need for that.

974
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,960
What I'm thinking is that

975
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,760
we need someone

976
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,020
with enough influence

977
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,360
to take over all the Anhui tea—

978
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,070
someone who can suppress Li Wantang
so thoroughly

979
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,550
that he can only tuck his tail
between his legs

980
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,210
and slink back to the capital.

981
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,670
Only then will our Association Head's face

982
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,400
stay intact.

983
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,880
At a time like this,

984
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
saving face doesn't even matter.

985
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,040
No, no, no.

986
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,800
Please wait for a moment.

987
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,650
I'll arrange for someone
to deliver the message.

988
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,110
Mr. Gu,

989
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,070
how about I show you the garden?

990
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,030
Let's go.

991
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,840
He's doing that again—

992
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,700
conducting business in silence.

993
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,840
When you buy your coffin,

994
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,960
let me invest.

995
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,070
Fine.

996
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,760
Mr. Gu,

997
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,640
the water in this lake

998
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,870
is from the Jin River.

999
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,680
A feng shui master once said

1000
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,630
that it leads straight
to the Dragon Palace.

1001
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,400
Businessmen

1002
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,630
like auspicious symbols,

1003
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,390
so I named

1004
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,280
this place

1005
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,150
"Seven Treasures Garden."

1006
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,590
"Mountain spirits burn the alchemy stove,"

1007
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,880
"the Dragon King offers a treasure boat."

1008
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,810
This is a sign of world domination.

1009
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,650
Gu, you don't mean it sincerely.

1010
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,470
In such an elegant place,

1011
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,710
it would be a pity

1012
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
to talk business.

1013
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,880
But now,

1014
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,010
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association

1015
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,710
is really at a critical point.

1016
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,110
If you could lend a hand

1017
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,820
and save us from disaster,

1018
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,360
wouldn't that kindness

1019
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,470
outweigh

1020
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,670
even the beauty before us?

1021
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,800
I never help anyone.

1022
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,550
Never.

1023
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,320
You can't show kindness.

1024
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,110
When a beggar

1025
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,690
calls out "Master,

1026
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,510
Madam"

1027
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,440
and receives a bowl of leftovers,

1028
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,550
it's only because of

1029
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,840
those two words.

1030
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,200
That's how business

1031
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,670
works.

1032
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,510
Mr. Gu,

1033
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
do you understand

1034
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
what I mean?

1035
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,760
Yes.

1036
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,590
Nothing in this world comes for free.

1037
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,190
If you beg with your face raised,

1038
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,360
you'll get nothing.

1039
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,880
Yes.

1040
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,150
This time,
Li Million got an imperial edict

1041
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,680
from a noble in the capital.

1042
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,480
With the authority of the imperial court,

1043
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,630
he wants to dominate

1044
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,070
the tea and medicine market
in the Southeast.

1045
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,320
If I act rashly

1046
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,800
on my own,

1047
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,240
would there be risk?

1048
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,760
Besides,

1049
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,280
overseas matters

1050
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,590
are uncertain.

1051
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,880
If I

1052
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,710
board an ocean liner

1053
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,770
and go out there,

1054
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,230
it would be like a human
stepping into a beast's den—

1055
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,560
how could I do business?

1056
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
Of course, for a friend,

1057
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,000
it's okay to take a risk,

1058
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,060
but it can't be a long-term strategy.

1059
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,030
I'm a businessman.

1060
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
I have no reason to go against

1061
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,640
the imperial court and Li Million.

1062
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,490
As for which path should I take,

1063
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,060
I defer to your advice.

1064
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,320
You specialize in the tea trade

1065
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,110
and dominate the market in the Northwest.

1066
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,510
But if Li Wantang

1067
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,160
grabs the entire

1068
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,320
Southeast tea monopoly

1069
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,740
for himself,

1070
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,920
he will inevitably
become a great rival of yours.

1071
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,840
That's the first reason

1072
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,900
you should help me.

1073
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,030
This is a political talk.

1074
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,200
Nowadays, business

1075
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,710
is no longer like in the past,

1076
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,230
when merchants stayed in their lane

1077
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,960
and the imperial court

1078
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,490
could control everything.

1079
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,910
With the rebellion in Jiangnan,

1080
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,550
the regime's hold on local affairs

1081
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,510
is weakening.

1082
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
This is a situation unseen

1083
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,760
in 300 years.

1084
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,740
Yet Li Wantang still thinks

1085
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,940
he can use the imperial court's power

1086
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,440
to suppress the provinces,

1087
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,640
imagining he can dominate everything.

1088
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,670
That thinking is outdated.

1089
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,070
Since we are in merchants' associations,

1090
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,430
we should join hands

1091
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,550
and make money together.

1092
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,750
If you are willing,

1093
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,270
I can offer Anhui tea

1094
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,610
at the lowest price

1095
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,870
and guarantee you a fixed yearly quota.

1096
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,950
We can

1097
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,820
expand outward together—

1098
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,890
that's the real way to win.

1099
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,280
Why bother fighting among ourselves?

1100
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,510
Cooperation?

1101
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,250
That's good.

1102
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,400
Let's join forces

1103
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,440
and make money
from the foreigners together—

1104
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,070
wouldn't that be better?
