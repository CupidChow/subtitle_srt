to enter the main gate

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,400
all under heaven?

383
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,550
Certainly not yours.

384
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,430
No, no, no.

385
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,920
And it's not mine, either.

386
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,270
[Sanjin Merchants' Hall]

387
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,350
Pingyuan,

388
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,290
we've only been in the capital
for one day.

389
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
I haven't had enough fun yet.

390
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,720
I heard that the area
outside Qianmen Street is really lively.

391
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,120
Outside Qianmen Street?

392
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,830
Outside Qianmen Street is
the red-light district.

393
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,830
Who told you that?

394
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,440
From the way you said that,
you've clearly been there before.

395
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
You knew exactly what I was talking about.

396
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,680
I was just a poor scholar back then.

397
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,240
How could I afford

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,640
such dens of indulgence?

399
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,680
Let's hurry back.

400
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,790
The tea can't be stored for very long.

401
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,990
Get up and get to work.

402
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,480
We've already bragged about

403
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,110
winning the Grand Tea Competition.

404
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,070
I don't know what happened

405
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,670
to that friend who helped me.

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,130
I need to ask around.

407
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,310
Mr. Gu!

408
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,440
Mr. Gu,

409
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,570
you have a visitor.

410
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,850
Are you Mr. Gu from Huizhou?

411
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,190
I'm Gu Pingyuan.

412
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,460
May I ask your name?

413
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,010
Bao Qing.

414
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,270
[Bao Qing, Military Affairs Officer]

415
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,870
I've heard so much about you.

416
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,880
It's an honor

417
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,660
to finally meet you today.

418
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,770
So you're Mr. Bao Qing.

419
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,080
I wonder how I

420
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,420
can be of service to you.

421
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
I have a friend

422
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,110
who's on duty at the imperial court today

423
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,000
and cannot leave his post.

424
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,510
So he asked me to come in his place

425
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,720
to invite you to his residence
for a banquet.

426
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Please do us this honor.

427
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,160
[Anhui Governor Qiao Song respectfully
extends an invitation to Mr. Gu Pingyuan]

428
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,470
[to a banquet at my residence,
feeling both anxious and deeply honored.]

429
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,010
Mr. Bao Qing,

430
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,160
Governor Qiao—Qiao Song—

431
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,720
is our provincial governor,

432
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,120
our respected official.

433
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,900
I've never met him before.

434
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,720
I wonder why he's looking for me.

435
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,690
You must go, Mr. Gu.

436
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,070
Please do us this favor.

437
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,830
I'm here at my friend's request.

438
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,090
I had to make this trip.

439
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,320
I pay my respects to you, Mr. Gu.

440
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,830
Mr. Qiao!

441
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,850
Mr. Gu has arrived.

442
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,430
Gu, let me introduce you.

443
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,730
This is Qiao Song.

444
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Greetings, Governor Qiao.

445
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,510
What are you doing?

446
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,270
Don't be like this.

447
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,470
Please get up. Get up.

448
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't be like this.

449
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,560
I can't accept such formality.

450
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,310
Governor Qiao, you're the protector

451
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,370
of us Anhui people.

452
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,830
Kneeling before you

453
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,690
is only proper.

454
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,080
[Qiao Song, Governor of Anhui]

455
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,240
That's not how it should be.

456
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,380
From now on, Gu,

457
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,720
we shall treat each other as brothers.

458
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,870
Please enlighten me, Governor.

459
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,200
Why have you summoned

460
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
my brother and me?

461
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,480
Otherwise,

462
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,820
I dare not drink

463
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,720
or speak freely.

464
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,980
Being kept in the dark,

465
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
I'd die with regrets.

466
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,200
Gu,

467
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,590
you were just serving tea
to Her Majesty the Empress Dowager

468
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,680
at the Sixth Prince's Mansion.

469
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,680
Her Majesty was very pleased.

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,980
She told her personal eunuch

471
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,150
that it's remarkable indeed

472
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,070
that Anhui has produced
such a tea merchant

473
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,490
with such insight.

474
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Remarkable.

475
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
When these words reached me,

476
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,190
how could I not feel ashamed?

477
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,000
Having received such praise
from Her Majesty—

478
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,590
if I didn't come personally
to express my gratitude,

479
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,620
how could I possibly sleep?

480
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,160
We couldn't sleep at all.

481
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,920
Mr. Gu,

482
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,680
come on, let me toast you.

483
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Cheers.

484
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,850
Governor Qiao, you seem troubled.

485
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,510
As for the battle at Hefei,

486
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,030
I'm not worried about that.

487
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,360
I'm from the Northwest.

488
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,790
The imperial court ordered me
to train troops

489
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,240
to quell the rebellion in the Northwest.

490
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,680
The situation there,

491
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,310
though complicated to explain,

492
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,960
can be summed up in one sentence:

493
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,270
the traitors within conspire,

494
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,070
and enemies from outside invade.

495
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,700
But even if I train the army

496
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,070
into elite troops,

497
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,040
once we reach the Northwest...

498
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,600
it'll still be useless.

499
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,640
How could it be useless?

500
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,400
This is no longer

501
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,070
the age of swords and spears.

502
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,500
Think about it—

503
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,140
the foreigners' firearms are formidable.

504
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,680
Their guns and cannons
dominate the battlefield.

505
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,640
Their rifles are

506
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,830
now breech-loading.

507
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,060
They can load five bullets at once,

508
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,680
each with a range of 500 meters,

509
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,750
firing once every eight to nine seconds.

510
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,310
And ours?

511
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,560
Our muskets

512
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,140
are still muzzle-loaded.

513
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,720
It takes two minutes
just to load one shot,

514
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,610
with a range of only 100 meters.

515
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,640
We'd be killed before we

516
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,700
even saw the enemy.

517
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,480
Those rebels in the Northwest

518
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,280
are all using foreign firearms.

519
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,750
I heard from my friends

520
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,880
who fought there

521
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
that while defending a mountain pass,

522
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,790
our entire battalion of musketeers

523
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,960
could only watch helplessly as men fell,

524
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,590
unable to advance!

525
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Since the rebels can buy from foreigners,

526
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
why can't the imperial court

527
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
do the same?

528
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,040
We can buy them, certainly.

529
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,590
But how many foreign rifles

530
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,990
are actually available?

531
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,830
The Xiang Army wants them,
the Huai Army wants them,

532
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,640
and the imperial court wants them too.

533
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
One rifle costs 16 taels of silver,

534
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,110
and it takes seven to eight months
to arrive.

535
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,310
I ordered 300 rifles.

536
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,410
It's been a year,

537
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,030
and I haven't seen a trace of them.

538
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,680
I don't think this is difficult.

539
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,910
My brother...

540
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,110
he knows how to do business.

541
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,440
He'll always find a way.

542
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,880
Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,310
Who knows how to do business?

544
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,110
Don't forget,

545
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,480
up until now,

546
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,070
we haven't sold a single tael of tea.

547
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,670
Stop talking nonsense here.

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,790
Don't worry about the tea.

549
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,270
With Her Majesty's endorsement,

550
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,550
your tea practically

551
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,920
sells itself.

552
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,830
As for the rifles,

553
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,270
I was just venting my frustrations.

554
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,200
I've never heard of

555
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,440
any merchant who can trade in firearms.

556
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,530
Come on,

557
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,960
Mr. Gu, let's drink.

558
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,280
Cheers, cheers.

559
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,340
Governor Qiao.

560
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,920
If it's convenient for you,

561
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,780
please provide me with the models

562
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,270
and written specifications
of the firearms you need.

563
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,070
When I have time,

564
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,070
I'll look into it.

565
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,280
If this path

566
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,440
can truly be opened,

567
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,770
it would be a good thing.

568
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,960
Sure.

569
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,680
Mr. Gu!

570
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,200
Just hearing you say that

571
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,550
gives us a little hope!

572
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,350
Hope.

573
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,920
Let's not talk about it anymore.

574
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,850
Come on, cheers.

575
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,640
Let's have another round.

576
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,270
I can see

577
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
that you're genuinely

578
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,720
working for the people of Anhui.

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,830
As someone from Anhui, it's my duty

580
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,030
to share your burden.

581
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,590
Come on, come on.

582
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,110
Cheers.

583
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,550
What's wrong?

584
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,550
You're asking me what's wrong?

585
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,270
Why did you lock me up

586
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,350
like a dog?

587
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,940
You e-even had them

588
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
seal the windows with wooden slats!

589
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,210
You really want to know?

590
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,070
Yes.

591
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,270
Fine.

592
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,680
I'll tell the truth,
and you must tell the truth too.

593
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,610
Neither of us can lie to each other.

594
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,040
I won't tell a single lie.

595
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,080
Alright. I'll ask you first.

596
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,410
What were you trying to do
by going out this morning?

597
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,710
If you want the truth,

598
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
you must answer truthfully as well.

599
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,590
Gu Pingyuan came.

600
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
He brought his tea,

601
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,750
wanting to participate in
the Grand Tea Competition.

602
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,720
I promised to help him

603
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,380
by using my token to get him in.

604
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,810
But I've failed to fulfill my promise!

605
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,560
You wanted to help him...

606
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,510
Alright, you can ask now.

607
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,120
Why didn't you let me go out?

608
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Ms. Su...

609
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,000
She heard that the Empress Dowager
from the western palace

610
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
would be
at the Sixth Prince's Mansion today

611
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,890
for the Grand Tea Competition.

612
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,550
Tomorrow, I'll slip in

613
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,350
by blending in
with your merchants' association.

614
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,200
You don't need to worry about
what happens afterward.

615
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I promise you won't be implicated.

616
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,490
You can't promise that.

617
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,590
This is the sort of offense
that dooms an entire family line.

618
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,190
You need to be honest with me.

619
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,750
What is the relationship

620
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,270
between the Empress Dowager
and the Sixth Prince now?

621
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,800
Naturally, she regards him as
a trusted aide.

622
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,300
Sister-in-law and brother-in-law
are family.

623
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,330
Isn't it said that the ruler and ministers
govern together?

624
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,040
You actually believe that?

625
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,270
There's no such thing as shared rule.

626
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,920
Once she became Empress Dowager,

627
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,880
she took the Sixth Prince's
favorite daughter

628
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,270
as her goddaughter
and kept her by her side.

629
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,470
To outsiders, it appears to be an honor.

630
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,350
In reality,

631
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,310
his daughter is just

632
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,840
a hostage used as leverage.

633
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,790
Besides, the Sixth Prince

634
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,350
oversees the Office of General Management.

635
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,400
The Empress Dowager doesn't dare
move against him—

636
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,930
not because she values him,

637
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,790
but because he uses foreigners
as his backing.

638
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,850
The Empress Dowager is wary of
causing complications.

639
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,950
I heard that the Empress Dowager
is displeased

640
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,850
with tomorrow's Grand Tea Competition.

641
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,590
She plans to enter through the rear gate

642
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,590
of the Sixth Prince's Mansion
accompanied only by her personal eunuch.

643
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Ms. Su,

644
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,680
how could outsiders possibly know

645
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,740
the Empress Dowager's whereabouts?

646
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,440
I bought this information

647
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,370
from her personal eunuch himself.

648
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,280
My plan is...

649
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,440
Ms. Su, stop, stop.

650
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,490
I don't want to hear it. I don't.

651
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,310
I'm begging you.

652
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,790
Alright.

653
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,120
Say no more, say no more.

654
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
Ms. Su intended to

655
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,440
poison her secretly.

656
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,640
She told me

657
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,550
that everyone
attending the Grand Tea Competition today

658
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,280
would likely

659
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,920
not make it out alive.

660
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,570
That's everything.

661
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,640
Father,

662
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,400
have you lost your mind?

663
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,640
You're actually involved in a plot
to kill the Empress Dowager?

664
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,550
Do you know who Ms. Su is?

665
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,480
No.

666
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,240
You've grown up now.

667
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
It's time I told you

668
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,710
our family's secret.

669
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,750
Have you heard of Lord Gong Deng?

670
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,110
Yes.

671
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,920
The Chief Grand Councillor,

672
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,440
a pillar of the state, was executed

673
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,100
on the Empress Dowager's orders
for his crimes.

674
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,280
That's right.

675
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,070
Lord Gong

676
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,960
was the Empress Dowager's sworn enemy,

677
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,290
which cost him his life.

678
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Ms. Su...

679
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,720
is Lord Gong's only daughter.

680
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,160
She...

681
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,410
Our Li family owes everything

682
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,940
we have today to Lord Gong.

683
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,990
Let me put it this way—

684
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,930
we were his bookkeepers

685
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,210
and also his household servants.

686
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
Fortunately, that court struggle

687
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,370
didn't affect us.

688
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,460
Do you understand now?

689
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,880
But there's one thing
I still don't understand.

690
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,590
Lord Gong Deng is already dead,

691
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,510
so why does Ms. Su

692
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,110
still wield such influence?

693
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,550
A giant

694
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,120
doesn't fall overnight.

695
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,180
Lord Gong

696
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,960
served as Chief Grand Councillor

697
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,270
for his entire career.

698
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,150
His disciples and old friends
are everywhere.

699
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,830
He commanded the southern campaigns,

700
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,400
and the viceroys and governors
of Jiangnan,

701
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
along with the frontier officials,

702
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,960
were all his loyal followers.

703
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,880
His influence was immense.

704
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,440
Do you think

705
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,320
we're the only bookkeepers?

706
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,920
Do you think Ms. Su

707
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,650
cares that much about us?

708
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,000
She could turn us in

709
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,800
to the imperial court anytime.

710
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,340
When that happens,

711
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,180
the label of "rebel remnants"

712
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
would instantly lead to our family's

713
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,050
complete destruction.

714
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
"Li Million"?

715
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,750
What Li Million?

716
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,940
Even if we had ten million
or a hundred million taels,

717
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,070
in their eyes,

718
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,570
we would still be nothing.

719
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,790
I didn't tell you before

720
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,290
because I was afraid
you couldn't handle it.

721
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,790
Now that you know,

722
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,420
remember all this, okay?

723
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,510
I don't know

724
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,960
when I might die because of this matter.

725
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
You could be implicated too.

726
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,550
Or we might have to

727
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,110
flee for our lives.

728
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,990
Therefore, we must be extremely cautious.

729
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,960
That kind of mistake—rashly making

730
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,620
bold promises out of loyalty—

731
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,410
must never happen.

732
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,030
I didn't even get a chance
to make that mistake.

733
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,030
I didn't even get to leave the house.

734
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,660
What's the name of the tea
your friend grows?

735
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,260
Orchid Snow...

736
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,720
Orchid Snow tea.

737
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,560
The Sixth Prince went to the palace
to apologize.

738
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,200
The Empress Dowager rewarded him
with a jar of Orchid Snow tea

739
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,680
and told him to savor it.

740
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,710
Your friend has attracted
too much attention.

741
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,310
Pingwen.

742
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,070
Pingwen,

743
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,060
is that you?

744
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,310
Ms. Su.

745
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,720
You...

746
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,750
Gu,

747
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,140
are you the bane of my existence?

748
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,570
What have I done?

749
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,490
Meddling in my affairs—

750
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,750
are you tired of living,

751
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,510
huh?

752
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,680
Why did you try to kill her?

753

She is my mortal enemy.

00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,030
stop bullying the tea farmers from now on,

944
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,360
that will be worth
more than any polite words.

945
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,560
I will, I will, I will.

946
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,730
Come on, come on.

947
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,030
Cheers.

948
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,600
Mr. Gu,

949
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,920
you're truly a broad-minded man.

950
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
Actually, I have so much

951
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,360
I've wanted to say to you.

952
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,400
Mr. Gu?

953
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,230
Mr. Gu?

954
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,170
T-The tea...

955
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,880
has been tampered with.

956
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,540
[Xuming Inn]

957
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,060
Everyone, I'm truly sorry.

958
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,270
Mr. Gu really isn't here.

959
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,720
Please come another day.

960
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,030
Mr. Gu really isn't here.

961
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,220
Please come another day.

962
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,280
What are you doing?

963
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,680
Please come another day.

964
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,000
We're truly not receiving any visitors!

965
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
Please come another day.

966
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,710
What's going on here?

967
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,510
Is this some kind of performance?

968
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,440
Why such a crowd?

969
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,980
This is the lodging
of the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

970
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,670
I suppose all these people at the door

971
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,000
are merchants from the capital,

972
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,070
here to buy Orchid Snow tea.

973
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,950
We're truly not receiving any visitors!

974
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,410
Give them my calling card.

975
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,800
Yes, Your Highness.

976
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,920
Prince Gong has arrived!

977
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,580
We humble subjects
kowtow to Your Highness!

978
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,930
Rise and speak.

979
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,090
Thank you, Your Highness.

980
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,190
Where is Gu Pingyuan?

981
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,250
M-My brother has gone missing again.

982
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,000
Missing?

983
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,710
This is Gu Pingyuan's younger brother.

984
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,070
Tell me,

985
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,360
what do you mean

986
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,220
by your brother has gone missing?

987
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,180
Your Highness,

988
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,010
it's all because of my useless cousin.

989
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,030
He went by carriage to pick up Mr. Gu,

990
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,710
but

991
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,960
somehow along the way,

992
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,590
he was rendered unconscious.

993
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,670
After he woke up,

994
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,360
he went to Mr. Gu's room

995
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,230
and was told Mr. Gu had been taken away.

996
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,870
As of now, we still don't know

997
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,550
Mr. Gu's whereabouts, Your Highness.
