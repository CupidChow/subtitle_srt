[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,009
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,060
Earlier today, when you

4
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,530
took me into the city,

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,400
you never thought

6
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,160
I'd make it back alive, did you?

7
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,229
Mr. Gu,

8
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,789
where is this coming from?

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,500
What qualifications do I have

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,810
to be the Pacification Commissioner?

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,970
I offered Her Majesty the Empress Dowager

12
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,430
some Orchid Snow tea,

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,259
which offended the Sixth Prince.

14
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,030
And yet he still wanted me

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,160
to be the Pacification Commissioner?

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,430
What sense does that make?

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,590
Well...

18
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,240
Mr. Gu,

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
you've got that wrong.

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,630
From what you're saying,

21
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,960
since you already knew,

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,400
why did you still go?

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,120
Yes,

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,560
I knew.

25
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,090
Even knowing the risks, I had to go!

26
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,120
I wanted to

27
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,810
save whoever I could!

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,250
I'm sorry, my Lords.

29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,950
Now that everything is settled here...

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,420
I'll go back to my village to grow tea.

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,140
From now on,

32
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,920
I will never again

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,900
try to outshine you, my Lords.

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
This commoner didn't know any better

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
and caused much offense.

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,860
I'll drink this one

37
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,730
as punishment.

38
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,500
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu,

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,190
you've misunderstood!
You've misunderstood me!

40
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,110
This is absolutely not the case!

41
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,750
My Lord,

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
you're an official, and I'm a commoner!

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,400
How could there be any misunderstanding?

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,590
-Come down first.
-Mr. Gu!

45
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,610
Don't act rashly!

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,210
His Highness didn't mean it that way!

47
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,910
And you're not just a commoner!

48
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,280
You're the Pacification Commissioner
appointed by the imperial court!

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,079
You still hold the appointment!

50
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,310
If you leave now, it will be seen as
defying the court—

51
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,280
as inviting disaster!

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,410
Inviting disaster?

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,870
Come and arrest me then!

54
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,750
Hyah!

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,240
You...

56
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,280
Well...

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,800
Let him go.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
We'll just risk a few harsh words—

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,430
just say we couldn't keep him here.

60
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,150
A man like him is too stubborn
and too lucky.

61
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,930
Once he learns

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,560
our ways,

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,530
we won't be able to rein him in.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,420
But what if the court asks about this?

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,200
Tomorrow we attack Hefei.

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,600
With such a great military achievement,

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,830
even the Empress Dowager herself

68
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,680
couldn't

69
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
punish us arbitrarily for this.

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,090
Come on.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,190
Back to drinking.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
My friend,

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,510
missing home?

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,010
[Safe]

75
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,250
What's happening?

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,140
The imperial court is going to kill us!

77
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,630
Everyone, let's stick together
and rush out!

78
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,740
Run quickly!

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,300
Fire!

80
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,830
[Safe]

81
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,360
Congratulations, Governor Qiao.

82
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,390
Without shedding a drop of blood,

83
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,790
you've eliminated so many enemies at once!

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,980
Good thing your friend isn't around.

85
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,750
If he were,

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,100
this wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,760
It's heaven's will.

88
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,380
Help...

89
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,920
Help me...

90
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,790
Mr. Gu, you're awake.

91
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,270
Your qi and blood surged to your heart,

92
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,200
causing damage to your internal organs.

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
I've brewed some herbal medicine for you.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,610
Here...

95
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,820
Killing those who surrender
brings misfortune.

96
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,550
Killing those who surrender
brings misfortune!

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,790
Misfortune?

98
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,110
Gu,

99
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,250
I'm not like you.

100
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm not that lucky.

101
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,600
My position

102
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,200
was earned through battle after battle!

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,270
Because of this war,

104
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,790
my brother and elderly mother are missing.

105
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,600
Now, you tell me about misfortune?

106
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,510
Then misfortune it is.

107
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
We've already started attacking Hefei.

108
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,670
By nightfall at the latest,

109
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,930
Hefei will fall!

110
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,240
This great military merit

111
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,170
will be credited to all three of us!

112
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,900
Attack!

113
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:39,970
Attack!

114
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,450
This will earn us great merit!

115
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,790
Gu.

116
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,670
If you really walk out this gate,

117
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,750
then from now on,

118
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,280
I'll have no choice
but to treat you as a rebel.

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,460
Your mother and brother
are still out there.

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,690
Is this really worth the price?

121
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,280
Come with me.

122
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,920
[Marshal]

123
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager's decree.

124
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,080
Gu.

125
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,310
"Whether they surrender or not,

126
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,350
execute them immediately."

127
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
It's Her Majesty's order.

128
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,130
Gu, don't act on impulse.

129
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
Let me ask you something.

130
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,120
Given the current situation,

131
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,520
do you think they can win?

132
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,320
Whether they surrender

133
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
or die in battle,

134
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,720
the imperial court will never spare them.

135
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,690
You know it.

136
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,760
My friend, I too am a scholar.

137
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,600
[Marshal]

138
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,750
I don't want to carry out this order

139
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,360
to kill those who surrender.

140
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,470
But I thought it over—

141
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,030
if I don't do it, someone else will.

142
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,970
A court like this...

143
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,810
What's the point in saving it?

144
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,390
Gu,

145
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,840
about killing those who surrender,

146
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,300
we can't be soft-hearted.

147
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,150
The men Li Cheng commands

148
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,480
are all veteran rebels!

149
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,910
They've been fighting for 10 years!

150
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,390
You expect them to suddenly obey the law

151
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,510
and live as good citizens?

152
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,510
Is that possible?

153
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,150
In times like these,
if you want to be a good person,

154
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,750
fine—

155
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,450
go home and grow tea.

156
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,200
Here's a chance to save

157
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,010
400,000 civilian households,

158
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,000
but you run off just to keep

159
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,910
your reputation clean.

160
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,970
Isn't that too selfish?

161
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,200
[Desheng Gate]

162
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,660
[Desheng Gate]

163
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
[Desheng Gate]

164
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,550
Your Highness!

165
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
Li Cheng!

166
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Li Cheng!

167
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,360
Li Cheng!

168
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,090
How are you?

169
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,240
Are you hurt?

170
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm fine.

171
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,030
Dear,

172
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,790
listen to me.

173
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,630
I'm afraid we can't hold this place
until nightfall.

174
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,440
In a moment,

175
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,450
I'll send a cavalry unit

176
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,110
to escort you out of the city.

177
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,710
What did you say?

178
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,180
Escort you out of the city.

179
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,330
You want to send me away?

180
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,150
Where am I supposed to go?

181
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,360
Anywhere.

182
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,480
Just stay alive.

183
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,390
No.

184
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,910
If we cannot share the same bed in life,

185
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,040
we shall share the same grave in death.

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,890
That's what you promised.

187
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,910
Do you want me to go to a place

188
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,300
where I know no one

189
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,530
and beg for food until I die?

190
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,920
I won't leave.

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,460

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,910

all the uninjured

These two are

rebel leaders and will be sent
to the capital in chains!

his corpse to the capital?

211

You want to throw me in a prison cart

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,660
and take me to the capital,

222
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,640
so the Emperor can watch my head fall

223
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,570
to the ground at the Meridian Gate, right?

224
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
Otherwise,

225
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,270
the Emperor will get angry,

226
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,490
and you'll all lose
your official positions.

227
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,510
Li Cheng,

228
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,680
you've greatly misunderstood me.

229
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,240
Those soldiers who surrendered

230
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,110
now lie buried beneath the city.

231
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,790
They all believed your words

232
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,270
and went out.

233
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,170
Four hundred and sixty-one lives.

234
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,570
I remember them all.

235
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,510
If there's retribution,

236
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,850
I won't hide from it.

237
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,150
But I must keep the promise

238
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
I made to Mr. Bai.

Enough, Gu.

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,210
You're a high official.

243
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm just a commoner.

244

You don't need to worry about my life.

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,570
I'm not going anywhere.

246
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
What I mean is,

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,910
I want both of you to live.

and looting,

If I wanted to go with him...

What about our child?

Can our child decide for you?

You're pregnant.

Why didn't you tell me?

I heard you've been commended.

306
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,370
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you yet.

307
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,260
Don't you think

308
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,510
you owe me an explanation?

309
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,790
What do I need to explain?

310
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,750
I didn't kill

311
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,460
those 400-plus surrendered soldiers.

312
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,790
I knew nothing about it.

If you don't believe me,

314
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,590
go on, kill me.

If I didn't believe you,

316
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,770
do you think you would still be breathing?

317
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,720
I tried to

318
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,460
persuade Li Cheng.

319
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,720
He's set on dying.

320
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,830
I can't change his mind.

321
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,640
Aren't you supposed to be the clever one?

322
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,350
Don't you know how to persuade someone?

323
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,080
Before becoming
Pacification Commissioner...

324
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,680
I thought with my ability

325
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,590
and wisdom,

326
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,880
I could change things.

327
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,830
But after taking this position,

328
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,890
I realized that...

329
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,900
all I can do is go with the flow.

330
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,590
I can't change anything.

331
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
The so-called history

332
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,360
is merely an emperor's family genealogy.

333
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,090
How ridiculous.

334
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,610
So you've become enlightened.

335
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,150
Are you planning to go back to growing tea

336
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,400
or become a monk?

337
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm not going anywhere.

338
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,720
Since I've already

339
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,510
been dragged into this matter,

340
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,310
I must Li Cheng and his wife's

341
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,270
safety.

342
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,200
I need your help.

343
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,380
Go ahead.

344
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,830
Recently,

345
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,840
I've been reading
the imperial court bulletins.

346
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,100
It's like doing business.

347
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,510
I need to understand the situation.

348
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,560
To those officials at court,

349
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,890
Li Cheng and his men

350
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,510
are like merchandise,

351
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,550
waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.

352
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,640
They can be handed over
to the Empress Dowager

353
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,070
in exchange for an official position

354
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,640
or recruited under one's own command

355
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,900
to expand one's power.

356
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,400
In these chaotic times,

357
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,920
one might gain greater fame and fortune
with them.

358
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
However, this batch of merchandise

359
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,570
can't be kept for too long.

360
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,270
They told me

361
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,910
they wouldn't kill
innocent people indiscriminately.

362
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,970
I don't trust them.

363
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,030
That's why I stayed.

364
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,500
You don't believe them?

365
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,350
Of course not.

366
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,960
Fame and profit—

367
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,050
fame comes first, and profit follows.

368
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,890
What nonsense about
"scholars having a conscience"?

369
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,510
That's only because

370
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,200
they haven't risen high enough
in officialdom yet.

371
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,110
When it truly comes to trading lives

372
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,790
for an official position,

373
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
who would care about

374
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,270
what they once said?

375
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
For the people

376
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,200
and the safety of Hefei,

377
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,510
I need someone more powerful

378
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,270
to help me.

379
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,790
I've run out of leverage.

380
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,520
I need someone with real clout

381
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
to back me up.

382
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,260
Who do you suggest?

383
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,540
Have you heard of Marshal Jiu?

384
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,790
The foremost marshal

385
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,650
under the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

386
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,610
From what I know,

387
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,750
his military force is formidable,

388
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,080
unmatched in the world.

389
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,200
He is the person with real clout

390
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,310
that I have in mind.

391
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm afraid even you wouldn't be able to

392
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,550
approach such a heroic figure.

393
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,520
You're trying to goad me into it.

394
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,390
Jiu owes me a favor.

395
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,330
He should feel honored

396
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,110
that I even bother to see him.

397
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,510
Report!

398
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,650
Marshal Jiu

399
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,010
from the Jiangning camp has sent a letter.

400
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,310
Double the guard at noon.

401
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,200
Go to the city and order

402
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,310
the best Yan cuisine banquet!

403
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,840
Yes, sir!

404
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,510
Jiu is utterly arrogant and disrespectful!

405
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,880
He's been besieging Jiangning
for three years

406
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,160
without gaining an inch of land!

407
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,030
Now he comes here

408
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,440
to steal my credit!

409
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,550
What should we do?

410
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,830
I'll write a memorial to impeach him!

411
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,530
I've only heard that the man carries
a murderous air.

412
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,550
Throughout the Yangtze region,

413
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,310
the army under his command

414
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,590
is the most powerful.

415
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,860
We must not offend him to his face.

416
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,240
As for a memorial,

417
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,310
the imperial court is
counting on his service.

418
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,310
If you file a report,

419
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,040
will the court side with him...

420
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,310
or with you?

421
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,030
Then what should I do?

422
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,920
Those prisoners of war are elite soldiers.

423
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,120
Hefei has been taken,

424
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,880
and now he just writes a note

425
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,160
saying he's going to come take

426
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,750
those 1,000-plus prisoners

427
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,100
to incorporate into his army.

428
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,880
Isn't that...

429
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,540
Isn't that outright robbery?

430
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,590
Send Li Cheng and his wife to the capital

431
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,510
in chains to present them to the court,

432
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,510
and just give those prisoners
to Marshal Jiu.

433
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,650
He should at least leave us

434
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,270
some scraps, right?

435
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,490
That's also how things work
in officialdom.

436
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,260
Report!

437
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,000
Marshal Jiu's advance troops have arrived
at the camp gate!

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,030
Set up the ceremonial formation!

439
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,030
All of you, look sharp!

440
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,880
We'll wait outside the camp

441
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,610
to welcome Marshal Jiu!

442
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,460
Yes, sir!

443
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,090
Where's our tea-selling

444
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,750
Pacification Commissioner?

445
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,550
This man, Gu Pingyuan,

446
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,830
is neither truly a scholar

447
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,030
nor truly a merchant.

448
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,840
Why are you keeping such a close eye
on him?

449
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
I fear his intentions

450
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,030
are no longer aligned with ours.

451
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,550
If we don't keep a close eye on him,

452
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,880
there might be trouble.

453
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,000
San!

454
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,440
Go invite Lord Gu here immediately.

455
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
Tell him Marshal Jiu has arrived.

456
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,070
As the subordinates,
we're hosting a banquet,

457
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,110
and he is obliged to attend.

458
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,640
Yes, sir.

459
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,110
He's here.

460
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,710
What an impressive display!

461
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,830
Jiu's carriage is quite novel.

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,060
That's a foreign-style carriage,
like a turtle shell.

463
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,970
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

464
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,830
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

465
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,490
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

466
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,030
[Marshal of Jiangning, Marshal Jiu]

467
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,330
Rise.

468
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,110
I dare not trouble you with this.

469
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,910
You two have worked hard.

470
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,170
I heard about the victory at Hefei,

471
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,160
and I haven't had the chance
to congratulate you yet.

472
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,240
This small achievement

473
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,640
can't compare to yours—

474
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,400
years of bloody battles at Jiangning.

475
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,360
It's hardly worth mentioning.

476
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,410
Governor Qiao.

477
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,590
Mr. Bao Qing.

478
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,920
He's a descendant
of an old friend of mine.

479
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,610
I just ran into him on the road—

480
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,120
he kept me company.

481
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,950
You all know each other?

482
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,170
Of course.

483
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,520
Mr. Gu is the Pacification Commissioner
personally appointed

484
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,110
by Her Majesty the Empress Dowager.

485
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,460
Amid the fierce battle,

486
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,400
Mr. Gu has accomplished great merit.

487
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,440
I was just looking for him

488
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,840
but didn't expect to find him here
with you.

489
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,270
Isn't it hot standing out here?

490
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,640
After the meal, I'll take the men with me.

491
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,500
Yes, of course.

492
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,710
Please, Marshal Jiu.

493
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
Mr. Gu,

494
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,190
you actually know Marshal Jiu?

495
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,440
We've known each other for a long time.

496
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,550
There are only about 1,000

497
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,150
prisoners of war from Hefei?

498
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,460
What about the others?

499
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,730
Where are the others?

500
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,300
All killed?

501
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,060
Buried to fertilize the soil?

502
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,720
No.

503
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,160
After such a long siege,

504
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,880
some starved to death,
while others escaped.

505
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,950
Those 1,000 or so

506
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,640
are the ones
who fought to their last breath

507
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,720
protecting their commander, Li Cheng.

508
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,450
They're all severely wounded.

509
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,510
Marshal Jiu, I'm afraid
you can't transport them now.

510
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,960
It's better to leave them here.

511
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,310
Once they've recovered,

512
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,260
I'll tie them up

513
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,720
and send them to your camp.

514
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,750
Not long ago, I was
in the thick of battle,

515
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,210
and my forces were strong!

516
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,590
But damn it,

517
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,240
a plague wiped out half my troops.

518
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,090
I need to replenish my forces immediately!

519
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,760
Those over 1,000 prisoners—

520
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,110
as long as they're breathing,
I'm taking them all.

521
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,280
Marshal Jiu,

522
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,910
those 1,000-plus prisoners

523
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,510
are indeed severely wounded.

524
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,590
Let us

525
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,990
reorganize them for you—

526
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,410
shave their heads,

527
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,350
feed them well,

528
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,110
dress them warmly,

529
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,310
restore their spirits,

530
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,010
and then deliver them to you.

531
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Wouldn't that be better?

532
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,180
Will you even be able to
send them by then?

533
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,060
You think I don't know?

534
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,960
You want to incorporate

535
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,020
those captives into your own troops.

536
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,360
Then later,

537
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,510
you'll send me a bunch of old, weak, sick,
and disabled leftovers

538
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,710
to fool me, is that it?

539
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,670
Are you envious of my military success

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,520
and want a share?

541
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,670
Please.

542
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,710
Marshal Jiu,

543
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,030
I wouldn't dare, wouldn't dare.

544
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,989
If you want them, just take them.

545
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,120
How would we dare

546
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,239
compete with you, Marshal Jiu?

547
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,250
I want Li Cheng too.

548
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,920
He's being held in prison.

549
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,870
We're preparing to send him to the capital
in chains immediately.

550
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,870
But we can't give this person to you.

551
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,290
We've worked so hard for so long.

552
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,400
Otherwise, we'd have no credit

553
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,330
for our efforts.

554
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,290
For a tiny little Hefei,

555
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,880
you besieged it for so long,

556
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,340
asked for so much money...

557
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,100
and now you still want credit?

558
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,320
Marshal Jiu.

559
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,480
He's

560
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,550
the only valuable piece we have left.

561
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,030
You wave your hand

562
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,440
and take all those prisoners—fine.

563
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
At least leave us

564
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,710
something to earn a promotion with!

565
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
You've got a death wish?

566
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,170
No, no, no.

567
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,030
Why are you shouting at Marshal Jiu
like this?

568
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,440
You...

569
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,270
You're going too far!

570
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,710
Bao...

571
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,310
What disgraceful behavior!

572
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,510
Well...

573
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
This is outrageous.

574
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,540
What's this all about?

575
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,030
I told him.

576
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,240
Apart from those 1,000-plus prisoners...

577
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,400
I want Li Cheng

578
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,150
as well.

579
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,000
That's...

580
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,190
Well... T-That really won't do.

581
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,960
Won't do?

582
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,440
Won't do.

583
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,300
Won't do?

584
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Well...

585
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,410
You want this, you want that!

586
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,590
You should at least leave us something!

587
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,920
You dare to fight me over a prisoner?

588
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,880
You... keep...

589
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,610
You need to keep your word.

590
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,030
I avenged you.

591
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,030
So you're just taking them by force?

592
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,590
I'm not a businessman.

593
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,640
I'm here precisely to take what I want.

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,450
But you'll have to

595
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,760
repay this favor.

596
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,360
He's not dead yet, is he?

597
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,100
Marshal Jiu!

598
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,300
Marshal Jiu, Marshal Jiu.

599
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,150
Get them out for me.

600
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,410
I'll take both of them.

601
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,690
Marshal Jiu,

602
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,330
these two are supposed to be

603
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,760
sent to the capital in shackles.

604
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
If you take them both,

605
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
how can we explain it
to the Empress Dowager

606
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
and the Emperor? Please...

607
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,120
at least leave us one.

608
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,440
Yes, yes.

609
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,710
Even crickets are kept in pairs.

610
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,470
One alone won't survive.

611
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,110
Take them both.

612
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,710
Let's go!

613
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,360
Gu, you invited Marshal Jiu here?

614
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,890
Ms. Su invited him.

615
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,320
Jiu is notorious for

616
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,870
being merciless
and leaving nothing behind.

617
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,800
I originally thought I'd face him

618
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,310
on the battlefield—

619
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,920
never thought I'd end up

620
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,180
at his mercy like this.

621
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,630
He's the Qing court's general.

622
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,280
How could he possibly save us?

623
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,540
Don't be fooled by him.

624
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,720
The price must've been high, hm?

625
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,490
Indeed, the price is high.

626
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,230
But Gu, the money you spent

627
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,400
might only be enough to save

628
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,230
my wife and me.

629
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,440
If you want all my men

630
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,590
to live as well,

631
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,030
how should you negotiate this deal?

632
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,250
Please show some mercy.

633
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,770
Give my men a chance to live.

634
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,110
Mercy?

635
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,010
Marshal Jiu means that...

636
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,080
your men can be released...

637
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,390
but you two

638
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
must join his troops.

639
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,000
And he wants you to serve under him

640
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,150
as a military adviser.

641
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,280
That way, he can justify himself

642
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
to his subordinates

643
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,780
and to the imperial court.

644
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,390
After the war is over,

645
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,950
he'll send you back home.

646
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,330
Gu, you've risked your life

647
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,800
and braved danger for us.

648
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,120
I won't make things difficult for you.

649
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,790
Bring me the clothes.

650
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,570
I accept your offer.

651
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Stop!

652
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,230
I, Zha Lanchai, Vice Commander

653
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,590
of the Tiger Battalion
under Marshal Jiu's command,

654
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,120
am here to attend to you
while you change, Sir!

655
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,960
This bandit chief Li

656
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,920
is truly skilled in battle.

657
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,490
I really don't understand

658
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,880
how an illiterate child,

659
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,590
a filthy mine laborer,

660
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,960
could have risen so far.

661
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,320
What a pity.

662
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,210
We couldn't meet on the battlefield.

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,940
The Qing Empire's fate is sealed.

664
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,150
Foolish rulers and incompetent ministers
maintain the status quo,

665
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,560
flattering those above
and oppressing those below,

666
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,490
yet remain blind to their own doom.

667
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,470
The military campaign in Jiangnan is over.

668
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,070
Spring has arrived,

669
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,710
and the Central Plains are
ripe for conquest.

670
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,440
Marshal Jiu.

671
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,000
Are you interested in
claiming the Central Plains?

672
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,110
[Delusion]

673
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,060
[Delusion]

674
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,800
This is a fine blade
Marshal Jiu had forged

675
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,000
by master craftsmen.

676
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,400
Only officers who achieve great merit

677
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,190
are rewarded with one.

678
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,920
General, now that you've turned to
the righteous side,

679
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,780
your future is certainly bright!

680
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,130
All of you, sit down!

681
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,060
I know.

682
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,370
Wearing these robes

683
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,770
betrays our men who died in battle.

684
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,260
But if I don't wear them...

685
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,580
I betray the friend who risked his life
to save me.
