00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,940
[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,950
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,750
Enough with your honeyed words.

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,039
I'm leading troops to battle imminently

5
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,200
and have no patience
for long-winded speeches.

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,060
Speak plainly!

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,979
Your Highness,

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,110
do you realize

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,039
how many carts are needed

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,900
to transport 24 million taels of silver?

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,430
It would require
over a hundred large carts

12
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,000
and over a hundred strong men
to manage them.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
The route would also pass

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,470
through numerous prefectures and counties.

15
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,710
May Your Highness please clarify

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,770
what should be written
on the banners.

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,590
What banners?

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,030
When transporting

19
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,430
such a vast sum of silver by cart,

20
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,190
the banners

21
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,160
must clearly state their purpose.

22
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,630
Is it
for Your Highness's military provisions

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,960
or for the sustenance
of your royal household?

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,750
We Eight Families of Hedong

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,810
have deliberated.

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,950
Even if we must
melt our cauldrons for scrap

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,870
and risk our lives,

28
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,150
we will raise this sum.

29
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,910
Your Highness licks blood
from the blade's edge,

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,630
risking your life for the nation.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,120
Should we

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,320
quibble over silver,

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,910
we'd be ungrateful wretches.

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,630
You should have said so earlier

35
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,630
and spared yourselves this ordeal.

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,060
Write out an IOU for Li Baiwan

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,140
and summon him.

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,630
That old fellow really knows
how to get things done.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,690
No, Your Highness,

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,550
that won't do!

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
We were just discussing—

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,870
we can provide the funds,

43
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,710
but we cannot

44
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,520
let Li Baiwan

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,490
reap the credit.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,150
Silver looks the same

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,000
everywhere.

48
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,750
Is

49
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,870
Li Baiwan's silver

50
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,130
any shinier than ours?

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Highness, imagine

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,630
if you campaigned through great hardship

53
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,470
only to see another take the glory—

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
could you stomach that?

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,680
Moreover,

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,590
the Eight Families of Hedong

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,280
are influential clans
with centuries of history.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,280
From the provincial capital
to the imperial court,

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,230
each of them

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,800
has allies among the imperial censors
and ministers.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,520
If Your Highness oppresses us
too harshly,

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,579
this goodwill may turn to grievance.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,360
Truth be told, we intend

64
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,079
to give more than 24 million taels—

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,910
considerably more.

66
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,840
Whatever Li Wantang paid

67
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,470
to enlist your pressure,

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,910
we will match.

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Such a sharp tongue!

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
I am

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,400
a prince leading armies—

72
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,680
do you take me for a merchant?

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,000
We beg Your Highness
to leave us a path to survival.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,460
Then state your proposal.

75
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,170
As you command.

76
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,840
Since Your Highness

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
campaigns along the Yellow River,

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,740
let this sum be designated

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,450
as military provisions

80
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,680
from the Eight Families of Hedong.

81
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,010
But the amount

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,570
is staggering—

83
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,120
once the silver carts roll out,

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,590
it will cause an uproar.

85
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,120
We need not fear memorials

86
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,000
from censors,

87
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,520
for Your Highness' merits overshadow all.

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
What we dread is

89
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,440
others reaching out

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,630
to claim a share,

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,370
spoiling the endeavor.

92
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,480
Thus, I propose

93
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,030
transporting the silver to the capital

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,410
to exchange for banknotes
from the Four Major Banks—

95
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,870
portable and convenient.

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,070
Your Highness could then

97
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,240
simply tuck them into your robe.

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,640
Wouldn't that be better?

99
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,950
Good.

100
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
Then produce the banknotes.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,390
How long?

102
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,980
Two months to load the silver,

103
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,130
reach the capital,

104
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,740
convert to banknotes,

105
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,980
and deliver to you—

106
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,530
this already requires traveling
day and night.

107
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,050
Your Highness,

108
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,140
behold:

109
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,560
the signed pledge
of the Eight Families of Hedong

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
with personal seals.

111
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,240
[Donation of 24 million taels
by the Eight Families of Hedong]

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
"Donation of 24 million taels

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,160
[To Prince Shen,
redeemable against this document.]

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,020
to Prince Shen,

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,300
redeemable against this document."

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Once you receive the banknotes,

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,480
simply return this slip.

118
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,610
How can I trust

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
this flimsy paper

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,990
to be worth 24 million?

121
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,190
You expect me

122
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
to release you based on this?

123
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,040
Do you take me for a child?

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,100
Your Highness,

125
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,000
do not underestimate

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,070
this thin slip.

127
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,960
Could Li Baiwan produce such a pledge?

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,950
The Eight Families of Hedong

129
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,360
have thrived over 300 years—

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
in both capital and credibility,

131
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,159
we are, perhaps,

132
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,950
a slight step above Li Baiwan.

133
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
Unless Your Highness intends

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,040
to destroy us,

135
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,680
in which case I shall say no more

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,070
and await execution.

137
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,800
You wouldn't dare flee.

138
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,770
If I don't see those banknotes
in two months,

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,360
my troops

140
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,190
will raze your ratholes. Now go!

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,260
Get out now!

142
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,610
As you command.

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Pack up the supplies.

144
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,480
We break camp for Shandong.

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,390
A new imperial decree every single day!

146
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,390
This is trying the patience
of even someone like me.

147
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,310
At once.

148
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Young Master,

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
the manager of Taiyufeng, Mr. Gu,
is here to see you.

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Tell him I'm not in.

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,240
Wait—

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,980
why refuse him?

153
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,800
He'll think I'm scheming against him.

154
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,650
Scheming?

155
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,240
He's with Taiyufeng,

156
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,310
and you're with Wanyuandang.

157
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,040
If you're not scheming against him,
then who?

158
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,570
Go ahead.

159
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,560
Ask him

160
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,480
when he plans to hand over

161
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,280
those 3 million taels of silver.

162
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,110
And how did he even get released?

163
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,010
How could the boy

164
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,170
be so soft-hearted?

165
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,750
The Young Master is still young.

166
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,800
He finally made a friend

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,820
here in Shanxi.

168
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,950
A friend?

169
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Do we need to come all the way
to Shanxi to make friends?

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,600
We're here to take

171
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,750
over these draft banks—

172
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,680
this is a battlefield!

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,310
There's no room for sentimentality.

174
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,390
You're right, you're right.

175
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,650
I'll talk to him again.

176
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,510
How was that man released?

177
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,770
Why wasn't I informed?

178
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,190
I was concerned, Master,
that you would be angered

179
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,830
and planned to tell you later.

180
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,070
That lad convinced the eight families

181
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,870
to sign a pledge to His Highness,

182
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,160
guaranteeing they'd deliver

183
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
24 million taels in Four Major Banks

184
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,600
within 2 months.

185
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
His Highness was in a hurry
to march to Shandong,

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,370
so he agreed.

187
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,050
Unacceptable!

188
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll speak to His Highness.

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
His Highness has already departed.

190
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,260
Fool!

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,070

while he had the chance.

If he ever collects that debt,

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,500
I'll take his surname!

197
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,630
Whose idea was this?

198
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,870
I heard it was that fellow surnamed Gu

199
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,270
who negotiated the deal.

-you know how I am...
-Say no more.

206
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,480
After what your father has done—

207
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,800
offending every draft bank in Shanxi

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
from top to bottom—

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,130
how could he possibly stay?

Such a promising situation,

211
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,970
utterly ruined.

212
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,270
What a perfectly staged scene—

213
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,260
and in the end, it's that kid
who walks away with all the credit.

214

218

245
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,920
Your task is simple:

to squeeze out all their reserves.

you must strike its vital spot.

311
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
what is your view?

312
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,290
Was this idea

313
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,140
suggested to you,

314
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,080
or did you conceive it yourself?

315
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
Back in the penal colony,

316
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,120
when no one

317
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,480
had much silver on hand,

318
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
we often traded

319
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,750
this way.

320
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,510
Say I needed to hunt a tiger—

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
I'd require spears, blades,

322
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,630
tools, and provisions.

323
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,930
I could only pledge repayment

324
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,200
on the condition
that I successfully brought

325
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,150
the tiger back.

326
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,790
The shopkeeper would then make

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,950
the same

328
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,030

329
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,360
to the blacksmith.

330
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Over time,

331
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,390
this method of transaction

332
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,520

333
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,150
That tiger might

334
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,680
still be roaming the mountains,

335
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,230
but among us,

336
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,250
it had already been bought
and sold many times over.

337
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,120

the Eight Families will prevail.

not tempted?

Without Mr. Chang's release,

371
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,200
no further dealings can proceed.

is still not done with you.

755
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,200
You must find a way

756
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,640
to escape his grasp.

757
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,770
He's a man with no lineage to preserve—

758
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,030
vicious at heart
and ruthless in his actions.

759
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,890
You can't trust

760
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,230
a single word he says.

761
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,640
I'm well aware.

762
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,300
This battle hasn't even started yet.

763
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Let me advise you:

764
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,000
you've already pushed him

765
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,920
into the position of chief manager
for the Eight Families;

766
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,270
that's achievement enough.

767
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,790
Everyone has seen

768
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,590
your skill and capability;

769
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,120
even a man like Wang Tiangui

770
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,100
has to treat you with respect.

771
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,350
This is the perfect time
for you to make your exit.

772
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,750
Don't throw that away
out of stubbornness.

773
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,710
Mr. Chang,

774
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,030
if I don't personally

775
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,070
bring down Wang Tiangui

776
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,750
and secure your freedom this time,

777
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,350
I will never forgive myself.

778
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,070
A true man, in navigating life
and society,

779
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,790
must be clear about friendship and enmity.

780
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,640
I will always remember

781
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,770
your kindness to me.

782
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,310
I may not speak of it often,

783
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,240
but that doesn't mean I'm unaware.

784
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,480
Now,

785
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,350
I should return to the bank—

786
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,480
Wang Tiangui is likely looking for me.

787
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,310
In the next couple of days,

788
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll make a trip to Jinyang Villa.

789
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,310
Those elders
have just regained their footing,

790
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,960
and now

791
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
that I've stepped down as chief manager,

792
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
I can finally catch my breath.

793
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,510
It's time to visit them.

794
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,960
Okay.

795
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,660
Leave me be.

796
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,310
Cry if you want to.

797
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,150
How can I leave you be?

798
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,690
Are you a ghost?

799
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm worse off than a ghost.

800
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,140
At least a ghost may be reborn—

801
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,110
there's hope.

802
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,370
What hope do I have?

803
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,510
It's late.

804
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Enough tears.

805
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,240
Come,

806
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,240
let me walk you back.

807
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,510
You weren't eavesdropping
on my talk with Father, were you?

808
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:10,960
No.

809
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
What did you discuss?

810
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,550
Nothing much.

811
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,810
He did praise you, though.

812
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,050
If Mr. Chang doesn't blame me
for dragging him into this,

813
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,310
that's blessing enough.

814
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,910
I dare not expect his praise.

815
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,100
Stop saying

816
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,960
you're neither human nor ghost,

817
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,890
as though life isn't worth living.

818
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,880
If you truly felt that way,

819
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,400
why did you escape

820
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
from Ningguta at all?

821
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,280
You will live on, and live well.

822
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,960
You

823
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,160
and my father,

824
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,450
both of you are good people.

825
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,510
I often wonder,

826
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,210
if you hadn't gone to Ningguta,

827
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,030
if I hadn't stirred up so much trouble,

828
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,590
maybe your life

829
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,850
would've been easier.

830
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,480
Gu,

831
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,350
I've come to a realization.

832
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,850
Will you hear it?

833
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,160
I will.

834
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,170
I sincerely

835
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
do not regret going to Ningguta.

836
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,490
I do not regret meeting you.

837
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,720
And I sincerely hope

838
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,950
that you and my father will soon be free—

839
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,330
that all who've harmed you

840
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,110
will be gone,

841
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that you'll

842
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,270
return home, see your family,

843
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,220
honor your betrothal,

844
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,730
and live out your days in peace.

845
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,830
As for myself,

846
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,350
I too will live a good life.

847
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,510
Even if I wander the world

848
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,640
with my father,

849
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,590
having known you in this life—

850
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,850
that is enough.

851
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,830
To aid the desperate
and rescue the imperiled

852
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,400
in their hour of greatest need—

853
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,130
that is the code of the Jianghu.

854
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,150
Let us both be at peace with that.

855
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,150
I'm home.

856
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,360
See?

857
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,630
Even you can be
left speechless sometimes.

858
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,400
Gu,

859
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,280
is your heart at ease now?

860
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,090
Where the heart rests,
there lies my home.

861
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,330
So sentimental.

862
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,110
[Fenglingdu Inn]

863
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,840
Is Mr. Li from the capital

864
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,100
staying here tonight?

865
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,560
What is it?

866
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,630
I've been riding for two days—

867
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,960
I've come all the way
from Pingyao with a message.

868
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,620
It seems that lad surnamed Gu

869
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,730
is resorting to such a petty trick.

870
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,630
I fear your Taiping Bank may not

871
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,560
hold its ground in Shanxi anymore.

872
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,490
So close, yet so far.

873
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,630
Back when His Highness caught them

874
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,520
at Jinyang Villa, I said,

875
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,720
"Don't let them go."

876
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,860
But he thought holding their IOU

877
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,560
meant no one

878
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,920
would dare renege.

879
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,480
I know

880
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,070
you deposited funds in all eight families

881
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,730
precisely for a run like this.

882
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,190
At the time, I didn't fully grasp it.

883
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,590
Now I see:

884
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,320
"To take, you must first give."

885
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,630
Truly shrewd.

886
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,510
Just withdraw the money

887
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,470
and see if they can withstand it.

888
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,230
"Dead silver stays,

889
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,700
and living silver returns home."

890
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,850
Do you understand what that means?

891
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,630
It means the silver

892
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,760
that's just sitting there stays,

893
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,490
and the rest comes back, right?

894
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,010
Half a year before you arrived,

895
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,550
we deposited over 6 million
taels of silver

896
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,710
with the Eight Families

897
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,070
through other firms.

898
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,190
The plan was

899
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,750
to suddenly strike during a run,

900
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,920
demanding the full withdrawal

901
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
all at once

902
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,630
to force them to shut down.

903
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,550
That move

904
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,030
was set long ago.

905
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,090
But judging by the letter,

906
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,070
it seems we're not making that move—

907
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
we're just leaving the money there.

908
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,340
How can that be?

909
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,590
That's handing them

910
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,150
a huge advantage for nothing.

911
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,710
Then go ahead

912
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,850
with the plan!

913
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,590
Since we're leaving anyway,

914
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,360
there's no reason
to suffer such a crushing defeat.

915
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,400
I'll write to the Master at once.

916
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
What for?

917
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,440
We've already followed
your advice this far,

918
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,770
and look where it got us.

919
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,030
Stop it!

920
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
I have an idea—

921
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,800
we could still fight back.

922
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,930
Want to give it a try?

923
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,720
Young Master,

924
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,810
please don't act recklessly.

925
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,440
Oh, so only you're allowed to be reckless?

926
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,550
Today,

927
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,360
the kitchen is fully stocked,

928
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,400
and they'll be serving around the clock.

929
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,330
Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves!

930
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,960
Mr. Sun,

931
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,520
I suppose our dishes

932
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,120
still can't compare

933
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,010
to those few bowls of spoiled rice

934
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
you enjoyed the other day, can they?

935
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,860
Don't mention that spoiled rice!

936
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,030
Madam,

937
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,400
could we please not

938
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,670
bring that up again?

939
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,760
Just hearing about it

940
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,590
makes my throat itch

941
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,720
as if a little hand were scratching it.

942
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,280
Madam.

943
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,480
Come on.

944
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,670
Mr. Gu,

945
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,980
take a look at this.

946
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,630
What is it?

947
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,400
[A withdrawal of six million taels
is scheduled for prior to noon tomorrow.]

948
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
That Li Baiwan

949
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,480
deposited 6 million taels of silver

950
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,340
in our draft banks half a year ago.

951
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,890
Now he wants
to withdraw it all at once.

952
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,800
If we eight families

953
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,920
have to scrape together

954
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,070
6 million taels right now,

955
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,710
our liquidity will be completely drained.

956
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,710
This isn't silver—

957
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,570
it's a blade aimed at our throats.

958
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,150
Even with Mr. Gu's plan

959
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,840
to unite the eight families,

960
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,760
which of us could

961
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,220
withstand a run like this?

962
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,480
The depth of Li Baiwan's scheming

963
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,060
is truly chilling.

964
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,440
Do you

965
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
intend to pay him?

966
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,140
What do you suggest?

967
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,130
We'll follow your lead.

968
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,000
In my opinion,

969
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,400
this is Li Baiwan's

970
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,460
final hidden card.

971
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,360
But simply handing it over like this

972
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,080
would be

973
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,150
most unwise.

974
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,150
Since he wants it,

975
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,040
then we shall give it to him.

976
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,480
I'm familiar with Wang Tiangui's accounts

977
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,230
and I can

978
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
produce 2 million taels of silver

979
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,840
at once.

980
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,420
What about the rest of you?

981
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,630
I'll contribute

982
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,110
four million.

983
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,560
The full amount?

984
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,850
Excellent.

985
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,360
I'll sweep

986
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,480
our vaults clean

987
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,030
and contribute everything as well.

988
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,160
Is that acceptable?

989
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,430
What kind of deal is this?

990
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,400
M-Me too! Count me in!

991
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,940
What a vicious idea.

992
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,960
I'll go get paper and brush.

993
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,290
Let's settle the score.

994
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,890
Just what is this deal?

995
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,000
Tell me, what's going on?

996
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,960
Don't keep me in suspense!

997
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,190
Mr. Gu has a proposal:

998
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,510
Taiping Bank is offering an interest rate
of 30% on deposits—

999
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,360
a full ten percentage points
higher than ours.

1000
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,230
If Li Baiwan

1001
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,760
wants to move his funds,

1002
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,280
fine.

1003
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Let's give him

1004
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,760
every tael we have.

1005
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,630
We'll turn his own money
against him and live off the interest!

1006
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,210
What a splendid plan!

1007
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,750
In the back and forth,

1008
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,710
this is such a big deal.

1009
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,280
Indeed.

1010
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:57,790
[Taiping Bank]

1011
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,630
My dear Young Master,

1012
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,880
how can you still sleep
at a time like this?

1013
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,630
They are already

1014
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,800
on our doorstep!

1015
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,400
Who is on our doorstep?

1016
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,740
[Taiping Bank]

1017
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,690
This...

1018
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,800
Open the doors.

1019
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,840
Can't you see? They're all here

1020
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,900
to deposit silver.

1021
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
They're returning

1022
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
the 6 million taels of silver?

1023
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,660
More than that!

1024
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,630
Look—the silver carts

1025
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,760
are lined up stretching

1026
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,800
over 10 miles beyond Pingyao!

1027
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,030
Our interest is 10% higher—

1028
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,920
they've brought silver

1029
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,840
to earn the interest from us.

1030
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,760
The Eight Families

1031
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,890
are nearly drained.

1032
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,480
I told you to listen to the Master,

1033
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,590
but you just had to be stubborn about it.

1034
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,030
Well?

1035
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,040
Now, do you even dare open the door?

1036
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Young Master,

1037
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
you're actually opening it?

1038
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,110
What's the point of fighting me on this?

1039
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,510
We must have a clear plan!

1040
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
Can't you even cover this amount?

1041
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,760
I thought you said we were prepared!

1042
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Young Master,

1043
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,550
even if we had mountains
of gold and silver,

1044
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,110
we can't be taken for such fools!

1045
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,280
We're about to shutter this place
and return to the capital.

1046
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,150
Why offend the Eight Families

1047
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,550
and pay them interest on top of it?

1048
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,510
What's the point?

1049
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,110
We'll be the laughingstock.

1050
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,450
Stop knocking!

1051

00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,400
Dead and gone?

1053
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,410
Alright then, dead and gone. Let's go.

Come on out!

truly drive someone to ruin? Right?
