that the gravest concern now

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,320
Okay.

194
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,850
If you're onboard,

195
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,770
I'll go with it.

196
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,190
Let's see who knocks who out first.

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,059
Please come over, gentlemen!

198
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's take a photo
with this Western stuff!

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
Time for a photo!

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,860
Mr. Li, come here.

201
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,940
Mr. Gu, come.

202
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,920
Let's take a picture.

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
God of Wealth!

204
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,240
Coming!

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,410
Mr. Gu, your reputation

206
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,600
is growing by the day.

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,550
In Jiangsu and Zhejiang,

208
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,840
your name's mentioned on a daily basis.

209
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,030
You're really something.

210
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,890
It feels so cool

211
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,240
here in your cabin.

212
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,060
Cool, right?

213
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,290
The secret's over there.

214
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,950
Take a look.

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,530
What a smart way to make ice.

216
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,190
I must say, God of Wealth,

217
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,100
you're really living an immortal's life.

218
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,340
That's not true.

219
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,870
Having spiritual powers makes one a god,

220
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,120
and being carefree makes one an immortal.

221
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,200
Which of those standards
do you think I've met?

222
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,540
Stop flattering me.

223
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,860
Take a seat now.

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Have some lotus root and fruits.

225
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,370
They've just been chilled.

226
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,150
Settle down,

227
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,150
and we'll drink later.

228
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,030
That can wait.

229
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:13,910
Well,

230
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,800
have the ships arrived yet?

231
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,170
Look at you, so impatient.

232
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,240
I've got them prepared for you.

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,430
Exactly

234
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,880
16 ships.

235
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,400
Good thing I own a draft bank

236
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,000
and charter ships year-round
to transport raw silk.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,130
People other than me

238
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,440
may not be able to secure
these many ships.

239
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,170
In that case,

240
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,430
I owe you many thanks.

241
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,530
Alright, alright.

242
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Be seated.

243
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,310
I heard that recently in Liangjiang,

244
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,000
salt merchants have been racking

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,670
their brains

246
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,600
for issues regarding salt fields.

247
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,510
I suggest you not worry too much

248
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,870
about winning or losing.

249
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,930
At such a young age,

250
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,550
you're already a well-matched rival

251
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,530
for Li Million.

252
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,840
That's a remarkable achievement itself.

253
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Even if you're forced onto the back foot,

254
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,290
that won't be your fault.

255
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,390
Don't let

256
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,210
this matter

257
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,670
affect your health.

258
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,220
I've been pushed

259
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,840
this far by the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

260
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,820
In fact,

261
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,240
Rui Lin never intended

262
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,890
to let Li Wantang manage
the Lianghuai salt business.

263
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,670
He just set me up to take on the latter.

264
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,760
What happened later—
stabilizing salt prices,

265
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,720
taking action against rice merchants,

266
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
and that trouble concerning the Li family—

267
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,060
was all instigated by him.

268
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,210
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

269
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
is nicknamed the Wringer.

270
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,240
Even if he saw the King of Hell,

271
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,440
he'd wring every last copper out of him.

272
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,970
I must warn you of this—

273
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,690
stay cautious

274
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,980
in the salt trade.

275
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,270
It concerns many interested parties.

276
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,600
I've done everything

277
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,560
I can to help you.

278
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,730
As for the rest,

279
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,730
I'm not sure what exactly I can do.

280
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,630
Thank you for the kind reminder, Mr. Wu.

281
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,270
Butler!

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,750
How's my father?

283
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,480
Young Master,

284
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
Master is still in a coma.

285
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,100
The problem is I can't wait

286
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,050
till he comes to!

287
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,050
If anything goes wrong...

288
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,360
I'll take full responsibility.

289
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,930
It's not your money at stake anyway.

290
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,790
This is a very tense situation.

291
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,670
What are you still dawdling for? Go!

292
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,120
Fine.

293
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,480
I'll go check on Master.

294
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,080
His Excellency

295
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,870
demands the salt field taxes

296
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,320
be paid right on time.

297
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,610
Before I came back,

298
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,320
I had just settled the payment.

299
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,840
The monthly

300
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,870
tax bill of over 400,000 taels of silver

301
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,810
is like a knife

302
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,370
pressed against my throat.

303
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,370
That really...

304
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,570
feels awful.

305
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,010
Alright.

306
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,350
Enough said about me.

307
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,600
Tell me how you've been.

308
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Any problems in doing business?

309
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,750
We're faring well

310
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,910
in business.

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,270
The problem is

312
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,110
the current salt prices are far too low,

313
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,670
while the taxes are excessively high.

314
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,360
Even if you owned a silver mine,

315
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,090
you'd be drained financially.

316
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,410
I think it's time to shut down
these two silk shops

317
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,130
in Tianjin.

318
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
They're tying up too much money,

319
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,020
while yielding thin profits.

320
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,510
Young Master,

321
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,510
they bring in an annual revenue
of hundreds of thousands of taels.

322
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,750
You call that "thin profits"?

323
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,030
Do you even know the meaning

324
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,870
of "thin profits"?

325
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,720
I definitely know better than you do.

326
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,670
When these shops are closed,

327
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,150
and the properties
and inventory liquidated,

328
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,200
we'll at least gain hundreds

329
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
of thousands more taels.

330
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,910
Hands off!

331
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,040
You can't do this!

332
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,080
How am I going to explain

333
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
to Master when he wakes up?

334
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,750
Who's in charge of the Li family now,

335
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,790
you or me?

336
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,250
Definitely not me.

337
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,600
But is pouring money into this

338
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,330
non-stop really the solution?

339
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,760
I think it's better

340
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,120
to bribe the officials.

341
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,390
That way,
you get to keep some money for yourself,

342
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,600
and things will go more smoothly.

343
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
If I give this money to the officials,

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,500
will they stop taxing my salt fields?

345
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm closing these two tea shops too.

346
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,430
Young Master,

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,130
you really must not do this.

348
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,000
You know what business

349
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,860
Master does.

350
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
It's not worthwhile
to sustain the salt fields

351
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,750
at the cost
of his most significant ventures!

352
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,470
Doing so

353
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
will make you a...

354
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,270
A real spendthrift.

355
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,000
Is it what you were going to say?

356
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,520
Young Master,

357
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
I didn't mean any of that.

358
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,560
I don't care what you meant.

359
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,870
Right now, every month,

360
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,270
I'm required to pay 400,000 taels

361
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,320
in salt field taxes.

362
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,200
I have people to feed, horses to maintain,

363
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,150
clerks to hire, managers to pay—

364
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,080
so many expenditures!

365
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,550
I'm hemorrhaging money every month.

366
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,320
If my father wakes up and finds out

367
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,670
I've lost the salt fields,

368
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,080
what do you think he'll make of this?

369
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,570
I'll have to obediently

370
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,840
return to the capital
and study for the rest of my life.

371
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll never be allowed to do business

372
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,910
again!

373
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,120
So, I'm telling you,

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,260
I must win this battle!

375
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,090
Understood?

376
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,720
Master has come to!

377
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,780
Master has come to!

378
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
Master has come to...

379
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,900
Master has come to!

380
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,520
Come on, drink up.

381
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,160
No need to panic, everyone.

382
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
Everything will be fine as I said.

383
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,910
Boss.

384
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,340
Mr. Tu,

385
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,780
what is this about?

386
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,600
Do tell us what trick you have

387
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,460
up your sleeve.

388
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,750
Come with me.

389
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,150
No, no.

390
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,140
What are you doing?

391
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,270
I didn't do anything.

392
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,470
It's not like I'm going to eat you alive.

393
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,070
I just want to take you out

394
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
and show you the salt.

395
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,840
Heizi.

396
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,480
Father, it's me, Li Qin.

397
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,300
Would you like some water?

398
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,390
Master,

399
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,870
The salt fields have been

400
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,670
causing financial losses to us.

401
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,750
Why bring this up?

402
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,630
Come with me.

403
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,550
My father is seriously ill.

404
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,750
To save my father's life,

405
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,750
I'd never hesitate to forfeit

406
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,480
all family assets,

407
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
let alone some shops.

408
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,850
So drop this topic for good.

409
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,350
Lift the cloth and show them.

410
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,080
This...

411
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
Take a good look.

412
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,210
Put the cover back on!

413
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
Move!

414
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,900
That's a lot of salt.

415
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Yeah.

416
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,550
I guess it's even more than

417
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,270
all our stock.

418
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,270
-Indeed.
-Right.

419
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,870
Boss,

420
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,140
where did this salt come from?

421
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,050
Tell them.

422
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,560
This salt

423
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,630
wasn't sourced in Lianghuai.

424
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,520
It's well salt
delivered from Sichuan and Yunnan

425
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,980
by horse gangs and waterways.

426
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,630
Boss,

427
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,890
you're dealing in illegal salt.

428
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,010
That's a capital offense.

429
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,200
Everyone,

430
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,140
in business at this level,

431
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,000
who isn't risking his life?

432
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,670
In such difficult times,

433
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,700
working with all of you

434
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,000
is my honor.

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,790
I was reluctant to tell you the truth

436
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,480
because I was concerned

437
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,070
that if the government investigated,

438
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,550
you would all be implicated.

439
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,550
Now, I've told you

440
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,750
the trick I have up my sleeve.

441
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,350
As for what path to take next,

442
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,720
please decide for yourselves.

443
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
I won't force anyone.

444
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,030
Boss,

445
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,680
we're so blessed

446
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,240
to be taken in by you.

447
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,750
For that, we're truly grateful.

448
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,170
But this matter...

449
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,690
How about this?

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,790
Let it be the last risk we take.

451
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,030
We'll bear all potential consequences
together.

452
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,560
At worst,

453
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,050
when we're done with this—

454
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,400
we'll have some savings by then—

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,070
we'll close our shops to put an end

456
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,930
to everything.

457
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,160
It's unnecessary to fight Li Wantang

458
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,490
over short-term gains.

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,730
Don't worry about that.

460
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,310
You must be tired from the journey.

461
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,770
Get home and get some rest.

462
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,880
Tomorrow morning,

463
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,210
escort your boats back.

464
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Young Master,

465
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,980
there's a finding.

466
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,560
What is it?

467
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Our men spent a long time observing

468
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,880
each salt shop

469
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
in the salt guild.

470
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,520
They discovered that before dawn,

471
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,880
packs of salt carried by big ships

472
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,380
would arrive at the dock.

473
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
Our men followed the ships

474
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,750
and found the salt

475
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,750
wasn't sourced locally.

476
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,310
Most of it was well salt from Sichuan.

477
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,920
Well salt?

478
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
How many shipments?

479
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,880
Deliveries were made day and night.

480
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,940
Last time, there were 16 large ships.

481
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,750
Well salt costs less than half of ours.

482
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,410
No wonder they can keep going.

483
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,060
I was wondering

484
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,710
why he dared to enter a price war with me.

485
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,130
I'm merely hanging on

486
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
by selling shops,

487
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,560
while he remains unscathed.

488
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Go get the butler.

489
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,550
Yes.

490
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,790
When Master wakes up,

491
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
we'll let him decide.

492
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,470
No need.

493
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,270
My father is too weak now.

494
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,750
he shouldn't be bothered
with these matters.

495
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,750
Besides, he's not keeping us around

496
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,310
so we can be dead weight, right?

497
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,770
Tell me.

498
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Do you have a plan?

499
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,150
Gu Pingyuan smuggles a large amount

500
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
of salt at a time.

501
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
This is a capital offense.

502
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,760
Anything wrong, Young Master?

503
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,050
You want to report it to the authorities?

504
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,640
How foolish of you.

505
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,390
Now, it is known to everyone

506
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,360
in Liangjiang

507
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,550
that Gu Pingyuan is heavily favored

508
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,200
by the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

509
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Who would dare touch him?

510
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,920
Maybe the Viceroy's Office is going to

511
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,180
reward him for stabilizing salt prices.

512
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,860
Listen.

513
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,830
To my recollection,

514
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,630
when we first came to Jiangning,

515
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,810
we sent generous gifts

516
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,400
to the Canal Gang, didn't we?

517
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,680
Now, these people have come in handy.

518
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,010
Tell them

519
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,640
to seize this shipment of salt

520
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,830
that Gu Pingyuan is expecting

521
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,960
as soon as possible.

522
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,350
If he boldly demands it back,

523
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,350
seize him too.

524
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,120
Under such circumstances,

525
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,590
Gu Pingyuan won't dare
to ask the authorities for help.

526
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,790
He'll have to swallow this bitter pill.

527
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,480
That's the first task.

528
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,270
Second,

529
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,610
notify all our shops nationwide

530
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,170
to transfer all their funds here.

531
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,240
I'll finish Gu off while he's down.

532
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,550
I don't believe I'll lose again.

533
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,070
The time has come for Gu Pingyuan

534
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,270
and me to see who's better
through this salt competition.

535
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,550
Carry out the tasks now.

536
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,410
Stop your boats!

537
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,720
Halt!

538
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,880
Stop your boats now,

539
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
or we'll set them on fire!

540
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,720
Everyone,

541
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,490
what...

542
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,920
what's going on here?

543
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,380
[Canal Gang]

544
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
Mother.

545
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,350
Why are your eyes so red?

546
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
Did you not sleep last night?

547
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,720
I...

548
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,360
I must've got so tired

549
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,940
that I fell asleep.

550
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,720
How long have I been out?

551
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,260
For... over 10 days.

552
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,260
Mother.

553
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,670
Are you really awake now?

554
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,410
I know what happened in the past few days.

555
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,920
You gave me bed baths

556
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,140
and fed me medicine.

557
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,590
Yet I just couldn't open my eyes.

558
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,070
I wasn't even able to move

559
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,000
my fingers.

560
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
I was like a bug

561
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,110
trapped in glue.

562
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I yelled "no" as loud as I could.

563
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,380
Then I asked this guy

564
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,850
to at least let me

565
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,620
bid farewell to my family.

566
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,240
He fell silent,

567
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,880
and I felt that I could move.

568
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,960
Who...

569
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,000
was that guy?

570
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,790
Maybe he was God,

571
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,200
or

572
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,550
an educated man.

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,310
Who cares who he was?

574
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,680
Mother.

575
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,410
You must've had a bad dream.

576
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,600
Kid, you don't understand.

577
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,240
The real bad dream is being awake.

578
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,510
When I was asleep,

579
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,880
everything was clear to me.

580
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,940
Where is Pingyuan?

581
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,780
He... went out for business.

582
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,240
I need to tell you something.

583
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
Listen carefully.

584
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,160
Do not demand

585

586
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,180
as long as he's ambitious.

587
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,980
Do not demand a man be smart,

588
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,450
as long as he's kind-hearted.

589
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,240
In chaotic times,

590
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,340
being together matters more than anything.

591
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,790
You get it?

592
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,760
Mother...

593
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Why are you saying this?

594
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,440
When I first lied down,

595
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
I wished I could die immediately.

596
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,650
I slowly came to realize everything,

597
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,920
but unfortunately, it was too late.

598
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,900
Father,

599
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,790
why did you suddenly fall ill?

600
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,480
This is fate.

601
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,510
Are you and Gu Pingyuan

602
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,390
still neck and neck in business?

603
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,070
Maybe yesterday we were.

604
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,760
But after today,

605
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,880
that won't be the case.

606
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
I had the Canal Gang

607
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,960

608
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,660
You have no idea.

609
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,110
He adopted the tactics

610
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,440
of illegal salt dealers

611
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,380
and smuggled

612
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,510
cheap well salt from Sichuan for sale.

613
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,070
No wonder
he dared to wage a price war against me

614
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,400
and has not lost ground.

615
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,370
Shame on him.

616
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,880
Business is just business.

617
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,880
What you've done is unethical.

618
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,660
That...

619
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,980
Father,

620
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,720
why are you suddenly

621
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
talking about ethics with me?

622
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,160
Remember what you taught me?

623
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,270
One shouldn't do business

624
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,440
if he cares much about ethics.

625
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
You said nothing is more important than

626
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,750
accomplishing what I set my mind to.

627
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,810
Why the sudden talk about ethics now?

628
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,030
And where is this mercy

629
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,160
for him coming from?

630
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,440
The salt industry
is the lifeline of Lianghuai.

631
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,800
Though it's entirely under my control now,

632
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,350
I've never thought of

633
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,000
monopolizing it.

634
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,410
Neither should you ever expect that.

635
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,640
If we cut off the livelihood of Lianghuai,

636
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,330
our family will become
a target of public criticism.

637
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Son,

638
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,080
don't go to the extremes
when you do business.

639
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,000
Gu Pingyuan

640
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,930
isn't doing business for himself.

641
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,310
He's trying to leave Jiangnan

642
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,550

643
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,680
Capturing half of the market

644
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
is good enough for us.

645
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,440
As for the Canal Gang...

646
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,440
tell them to back off right away.

647
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,650

648

get well soon

650
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
and take back

651
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,950
the business from me.

652
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,880
The young master's actions

653
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,480
are truly surprising.

654
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,570
Haven't you noticed he's changed?

655

658
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
and with money,

659
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,400
there's nowhere in the world

660
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
they don't want to go.

661
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,880
These three things are the most dangerous.

662
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,590
Now that he's taken over the business,

663
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,190
he would inevitably change.

664
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,780
I've managed to step away from it all.

665
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Just let him be.

666
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,000

667
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,640
you're disheartened

only because of the illness.

669

When you recover, all family affairs

670

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Who am I to do that?

of holding onto all this money?

760
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,150
Do you have a death wish?

761
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,810
I don't care what hall that is!

762
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,900
What good is brute strength?

763
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,360
Being all brawn and no brains

764
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,690
won't get you anywhere.

765
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,330
Madam!

766
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,260
Mr. Gu has been kidnapped!

767
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Madam!

768
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,480
Good grief!

769
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,340
What are you doing?

770
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,440
Going for a fight?

771
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,150
Why haven't you changed your clothes yet?

772
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,510
You look like an old master.

773
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,240
Why should I change my clothes?

774
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,840
Didn't you hear what Heizi said?

775
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,550
They've kidnapped your son-in-law

776
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,000
and are demanding
20 million taels of silver.

777
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
How can we raise that much money?

778
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,590
Go change your clothes quickly.

779
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,710
Do you still have your fighting dagger?

780
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,710
You want the two of us
to storm in their place?

781
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,480
Have you let the operas
get into your head?

782
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,760
I don't have the abilities

783
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,620
of that legendary hero Dou Erdun!

784
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,440
Father,

785
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,160
what's the matter?

786
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,900
We've been

787
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,230
extorted before.

788
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,920
We'll play by the rules, negotiate,

789
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
and resort to violence
only if a consensus can't be reached.

790
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,810
How can we be afraid of them?

791
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,370
How about this?

792
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,880
Keep this robe on to conceal

793
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,550
the fighting clothes you're in.

794
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,400
Let's hide our iron fists

795
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,630
with velvet gloves.

796
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,590
Chances are

797
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,800
that they won't be alert around you.

798
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,840
You then intimidate them with a strike,

799
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,460
and I'll handle the rest.

800
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,110
How does that sound?

801
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,310
It's a terrible idea!

802
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,420
The Canal Gang

803
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,590
has hundreds of thousands of members.

804
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,720
Can they be subdued by one strike only?

805
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
To avoid imminent danger,

806
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,630
maybe they will release Pingyuan.

807
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,110
But after that,
it'll be much more difficult

808
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,910
to ship items on the Grand Canal.

809
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,440
It's not like we're demanding
lost goods back now.

810
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,840
That's the least of my concern!

811
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
Heizi said

812
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,520
they'd drown him

813
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,150
unless we paid in 3 days!

814
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,440
If I wait till you devise a proper plan,

815
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,710
it'll be too late
to even collect his body!

816
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,190
Yu'er!

817
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,560
T-This is a serious matter.

818
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,190
I have told Pingyuan

819
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,810
not to deal in illegal salt!

820
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,330
Look what has happened.

821
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,760
We can't report this to the authorities.

822
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,290
Getting him back by force
is not the solution.

823
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,690
It's better

824
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,640
for us to find a mediator

825
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,110
to reconcile both sides.

826
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,790
I know quite a few notable figures

827
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,960
in the Canal Gang.

828
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,930
I've asked someone influential

829
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,190
to speak on our behalf.

830
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,670
What are you doing here?

831
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,270
You should be recuperating.

832
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,370
When I left,

833
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,480
Gu Pingyuan asked me to find someone

834
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,190
to save him.

835
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,380
I went looking but she wasn't around.

836
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I wanted to ask...

837
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,280
if I should go again.

838
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,450
You silly child!

839
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,590
Who did he ask you to find?

840
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,320
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

841
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,030
Why are you looking at her?

842
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,710
Say it now!

843
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,920
A life is in danger!

844
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,360
It's a Ms. Su

845
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,620
in Marshal Jiu's camp.

846
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,780
You look down on me.

847
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,440
You look down on me, don't you?

848
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,230
Su can save him,

849
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,310
but I can't?

850
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,190
Are you going or not?

851
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,250
I will if you don't!

852
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,050
Out of my way!

853
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,290
Off you go!

854
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,440
Yu'er,

855
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,300
can't you put yourself together?

856
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,590
Incense smoke rises from the burner.

857
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,000
Three elders and four young masters
sit in the hall.

858
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
This humble fellow offers incense

859
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,190
and begs for a meeting with Chief.

860
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,030
Here I hold another burner
before my chest.

861
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,590
The three elders and four young masters
beam with joy.

862
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,110
My mentor comes
and takes the seat of honor,

863
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,440
as this humble disciple lights incense
to pay his respects.

864
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
May I have your name, sir?

865
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,360
My surname is Chang.

866
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,590
I am the fourth child in my family.

867
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,920
Above me, it's the "Tong" generation.

868
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,550
Below me, it's the "Wan" generation.

869
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,610
As for me, I'm in the "Wu" generation.

870
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,030
You are a respected senior then.

871
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,170
Could you tell me who your mentor is?

872
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,510
A son dare not speak his father's name.

873
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,190
I learned from a gentleman
of the "Tong" generation.

874
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,650
I've come with my daughter

875
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,360
to discuss matters about her husband.

876
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,050
Please.

877
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,480
Boss Gui,

878
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,840
Chang Si pays his respects to you.

879
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,590
Mr. Chang,

880
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,280
the senior member of the "Tong" generation
you mentioned

881
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,210
has spoken to me.

882
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,590
You're here to save your son-in-law,

883
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,720
Gu Pingyuan, right?

884
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Yes, exactly.

885
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
He smuggles salt on the Grand Canal,

886
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,920
but refuses

887
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,400
to share profits with his helpers

888
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,050
along the way.

889
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,310
It's unfair, isn't it?

890
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,210
What?

891
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,240
Do we not deserve to be paid?

892
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,550
But there are rules in place.

893
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,400
My son-in-law is acting on

894
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,190
orders from the Viceroy of Liangjiang

895
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,410
to revitalize Lianghuai salt fields.

896
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,680
He's not trading salt for private gain.

897
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,070
Boss Gui,

898
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,890
I hope you understand.

899
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,670
Don't try to pressure me

900
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,870
with the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

901
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Those filthy rich officials

902
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,730
are rolling in money,

903
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,890
while my brothers in the Canal Gang

904
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,590
have to buy their own shoes

905
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,190
when they wear them out running.

906
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,000
If you have a complaint,

907
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,150
take it to the authorities.

908
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,320
I'd like to see who dares to interfere

909
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,380
when this blows up.

910
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,910
The Canal Gang possesses

911
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,210
a dragon-headed scepter
awarded by Emperor Qianlong.

912
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,840
If this gets out of hand,

913
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,840
I don't mind

914
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,140
talking it out in the government office.

915
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,960
But that senior member
of the Tong generation...

916
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,310
[Hall of Loyalty]

917
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,320
I have hundreds of thousands of mouths

918
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,840
to feed!

919
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,030
You think I'd care about
some senior member?

920
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,170
Go home right now

921
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,000
and raise the money.

922
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,050
Do you understand?

923
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,400
[Hall of Loyalty]

924
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,190
-Go raise the money!
-Raise the money!

925
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,270
Let's go home.

926
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,730
This is a tough problem.

927
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,670
You've seen it yourself.

928
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,000
This is no place for you.

929
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,070
Let's go.

930
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,650
How is my husband doing?

931
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,700
His condition

932
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,920
depends on the amount of money

933
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,780
you'll give us.

934
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,880
I have...

935
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,220
I have a hairpin

936
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,580
that's worth a million.

937
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,230
I'll leave it here with you as collateral.

938
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,110
Can you make sure

939
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,310
he gets proper meals?

940
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,230
Yu'er,

941
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,150
you can't give it away.

942
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,630
That's...

943
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,490
A hairpin that's worth a million?

944
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I've never seen one.

945
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Let me take a look.

946
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,410
Boss Gui,

947
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,440
can you bring him out

948
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,740
so I can see him?

949
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,490
I...

950
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,000
need to ask him

951
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,360
where he hid the silver.

952
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,320
Sounds good.

953
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
This kidnapping is paying off well.

954
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,920
Guys!

955
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,590
Bring that Gu fellow here.

956
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:47,670
[Hall of Loyalty]

957
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,330
-Yes.
-Yes.

958
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,030
Pingyuan!

959
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,630
Mr. Chang.

960
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,580
Why are you here?

961
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,440
Where is Ms. Su?

962
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,910
Yu'er was worried about you,

963
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,170
so we came first.

964
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,920
Father and I risked our lives

965
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
to come to your rescue,

966
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,800
yet you asked about her
the moment you saw us.

967
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,110
No.

968
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,280
What can you do here?

969
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,110
You're not able

970
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,370
to solve this problem.

971
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,590
Don't you see I'm worried about you?

972
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,850
Why can't I be here?

973
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,140
Enough. Stop arguing!

974
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,580
I can't believe you two

975
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,110
are quarreling at my place.

976
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,880
Now, ask him

977
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,190
where he hid the silver.

978
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,590
There's no silver at all.

979
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,510
What?

980
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,040
No silver at all?

981
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,480
Then I guess

982
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,240
it's time to teach you a lesson.

983
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,630
Guys!

984
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:35,880
[Hall of Loyalty]

985
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,800
Pierce his collarbones with an iron chain!

986
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,600
Please don't!

987
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,320
Let's talk it...

988
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,230
You're having his collarbones pierced?

989
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:41,840
Yes.

990
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,280
I'll have it done right in front of you.

991
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,950
Let me tell you what's good

992
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,030
about this hairpin.

993
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,450
Sure.

994
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,410
Tell me about it.

995
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,920
Look,

996
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,570
just...

997
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,840
Take her down!

998
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,450
Back off!

999
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,020
Shut up and stay back,

1000
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,440
or I'll have his right collarbone

1001
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,230
pierced too!
