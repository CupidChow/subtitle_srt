00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,000
What is it?

195
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,630
Father.

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
I was just

197
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,450
going through the title deeds.

198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,440
If you're resting...

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,760
I'll come back tomorrow.

200
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Is there more?

201
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,110
Ms. Su came to see me.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,320
She said that in Nanjing,

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,060
she can help me.

204
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,030
But I have to help her too.

205
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,150
I just feel uneasy.

206
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
Uneasy?

207
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,030
She is meticulous.

208
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,070
If there are problems you can't solve,

209
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,790
tell me.

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
She said some

211
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,630
baffling things.

212
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,450
I can't figure them out.

213
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,600
Like what?

214
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,550
She said that you gained

215
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,030
the upper hand every time,

216
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,790
yet you intentionally left Gu Pingyuan

217
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,870
a way out.

218
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,600
She said there is more to it.

219
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
There is more to it?

220
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,670
What do you think?

221
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,440
I don't know.

222
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,130
You only go all out for a worthy opponent.

223
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,510
He isn't worth it.

224
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,030
I can't let the tea trade of one province

225
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,160
ruin my grand plans.

226
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,210
Do you understand?

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,260
I understand, Father.

228
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,410
Every choice has trade-offs.

229
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,750
Business is the same.

230
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,390
This time, I'm staking all my connections

231
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,750
and assets.

232
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,390
Once we secure the Jiangnan salt trade,

233
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,590
you can show the world

234
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,870
what you can do.

235
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,600
To win this battle,

236
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,440
I'd even kneel.

237
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,670
What does admitting defeat matter?

238
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,890
I understand, Father.

239
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,710
[Pingyao, Shanxi]

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,720
It's you.

241
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,840
What are you doing here?

242
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,610
I'd like to meet Mr. Chang.

243
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,440
What do you want?

244
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,240
Why are you so annoying?

245
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,150
Who is it?

246
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,840
A beggar!

247
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,870
Gu Pingyuan, let's get this straight.

248
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,900
I heard you got rich
and became an official.

249
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,080
You're proud of yourself,

250
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
aren't you?

251
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,330
I know why you're here.

252
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,720
If you leave now,

253
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,600
I, Heizi, will

254
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,120
kowtow to you 100 times.

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Okay?

256
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,910
I'm begging you, please.

257
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,480
You...

258
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,000
Heizi.

259
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Heizi!

260
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Go get the guy some food.

261
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,030
I woke up this morning

262
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,390
feeling refreshed and spirited.

263
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,650
Turns out it was because you were coming.

264
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,840
Heizi.

265
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,320
Run to Tianfu Restaurant

266
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,000
and order their finest dishes.

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
We'll be talking. No time to cook.

268
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,690
Bring the things in.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,560
Yu'er!

270
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,240
Look who's here.

271
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,150
Mr. Chang.

272
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,480
Mr. Chang, don't call Yu'er yet.

273
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
This time,

274
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
I came on my mother's orders.

275
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,290
Let's talk inside.

276
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,720
Okay.

277
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,610
What are you doing?

278
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,320
I made a mistake!

279
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,670
Mr. Gu.

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,150
Check for me.

281
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,250
Is it straight?

282
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,670
Yes, straight.

283
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,900
I rarely pay formal visits.

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,460
I don't have fine clothes.

285
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,430
Since you are here
on your mother's orders,

286
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,270
we must observe proper etiquette.

287
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,910
Mr. Gu.

288
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,240
Please, sit.

289
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,890
Speak your mind.

290
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,670
Mr. Chang.

291
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,750
From now on,

292
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,080
you should stop calling me

293
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,670
Mr. Gu.

294
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,020
That's too formal and polite.

295
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,080
Out with it.

296
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,600
I'll call you Big Brother if I have to.

297
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
Mr. Chang, don't joke like that.

298
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,120
Come.

299
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,530
Please take your seat.

300
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,270
I, Gu Pingyuan,

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
by my mother's order,

302
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,730
came to propose marriage.

303
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,160
Mr. Chang, I beg your blessing.

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,099
I wish to marry your daughter,

305
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,560
Chang Yu'er, as my wife,

306
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,270
to unite our families forever.

307
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,160
This is the betrothal letter I prepared.

308
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,420
And my birth date card.

309
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,080
I also prepared a betrothal gift.

310
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
It's a keepsake from my late father.

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
My mother said she can't see well

312
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
and has trouble walking,

313
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,890
so I must deliver the gift myself.

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,620
My manners may be lacking.

315
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,500
Mr. Chang, please forgive me.

316
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,810
You really are something.

317
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,420
I knew this day would come.

318
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,830
Why did you wait until now

319
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,360
to marry my daughter?

320
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,550
She's been waiting for ages.

321
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,400
I was a convict.

322
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,880
Thanks to you and Miss Chang,

323
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,810
I'm still alive.

324
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,590
Before, at home,

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,070
there were old scores unsettled.

326
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,000
I dared not come.

327
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,000
Mr. Gu, please rise.

328
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,180
Mr. Chang.

329
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,880
Stop calling me

330
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,600
Mr. Gu.

331
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,410
Old habits die hard.

332
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Today,

333
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
I really didn't expect this.

334
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,240
Yu'er always says

335
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,510
she wants to support me until I die.

336
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,110
But I am old

337
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,200
and a burden to her.

338
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
I feel uneasy about it.

339
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,480
To tell you the truth,

340
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,830
I wish I could immediately

341
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,240
go on a long-distance trade run.

342
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,430
Even to Tianshan.

343
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,910
Even if I died on the road,

344
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,090
it'd be better than

345
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,180
watching her

346
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,080
be depressed every day.

347
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,920
Look at me.

348
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,830
I'm getting old,

349
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,110
going a bit crazy.

350
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,240
Crying one moment, laughing the next.

351
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,960
Go tell her now.

352
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,720
Yu'er!

353
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,640
Where are you going?

354
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,510
She is a girl.

355
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,480
Let her cry it out.

356
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,150
After she cries,

357
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,590
she will feel better.

358
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,640
Don't go.

359
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,270
♪ Tea picking in January
marks the new year ♪

360
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,640
♪ Tea picking in February ♪

361
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,510
What's with you?

362
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,790
Grinning like a fool.

363
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,110
I'm happy.

364
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,970
You can't fool me.

365
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,070
It must be because your mother

366
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,800
has been smiling at you lately.

367
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,070
If anyone's happy, it's your brother.

368
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,640
All his suffering has finally paid off.

369
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,440
You surely never went to school.

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
This is called proper hierarchy.

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,830
When parents are alive,

372
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,030
children shouldn't travel far.

373
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,790
If my brother is single,

374
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,590
I stay unwed.

375
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,310
You surely are.

376
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,430
Your brother isn't back yet?

377
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,640
I told the assistants down the mountain

378
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,140
to wait at the dock, morning and night.

379
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,070
Once he's back, I'll go pick him up.

380
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,900
Thank you for the meal.

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,200
It's the least I could do.

382
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,960
This time,

383
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,550
Pingyuan is finally seeing better days.

384
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,510
This is the best news in the world.

385
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,230
I am clumsy sometimes.

386
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,350
If I missed anything,

387
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,800
don't scold me.

388
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,030
Mother.

389
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,680
I heard my sister-in-law

390
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,030
comes from a martial background.

391
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,110
An expert fighter.

392
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,350
We two brothers

393
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,680
just don't have the fate

394
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
to have gentle, considerate wives.

395
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,960
I'll beat you up.

396
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,680
I dare you!

397
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,240
Why did you brew the guest tea?

398
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,530
Switch to the rough tea.

399
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,370
Mother.

400
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,240
We won't drink that tea anymore.

401
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,380
Haven't you heard?

402
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,830
Pingyuan made a name for himself

403
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,090
in Shanghai this time.

404
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,510
You remember Hou Er, right?

405
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,080
He used to be so arrogant.

406
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
Now, when he sees me

407
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,280
from a mile away,

408
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
he hangs his head like a whipped dog.

409
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,550
"Mr. Pingwen."

410
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,470
"Mr. Pingwen."

411
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,110
I used to be just Gu Pingwen,

412
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,590
but now I'm Mr. Pingwen.

413
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,680
This respect wasn't given to us.

414
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,110
We earned it ourselves.

415
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,830
Back then, on the dragon boat,

416
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,930
we nearly died.

417
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,400
As they say, "Survive a great disaster,

418
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
and great fortune will follow."

419
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,790
That tea smells wonderful.

420
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,020
Pour me a cup of it.

421
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,760
Sir, you are…

422
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,870
Pingwen.

423
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,680
Pour some tea for the guest.

424
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,290
Sir.

425
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,550
Are you looking to rest your feet

426
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,890
or join us for a meal?

427
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Old Madam Gu.

428
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,880
My surname is Wu.

429
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,680
I came over

430
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
on behalf of my good friend, Gu Pingyuan,

431
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,880
to take a look at the bridal chamber.

432
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm afraid he won't have time to prepare,

433
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,480
and the bride might feel slighted.

434
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,880
So

435
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
I rushed over here

436
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,880
without giving you prior notice.

437
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,480
Please forgive my intrusion.

438
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,210
You must be the "God of Wealth."

439
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,180
What God of Wealth?

440
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,510
[Spring Breeze of Yi River]

441
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,830
That's just a nickname people gave me

442
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,860
to flatter me.

443
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,160
I dare not accept it.

444
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,280
I

445
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,320
have the most debt in the world.

446
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,290
I can't be called the God of Wealth.

447
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,110
At best,

448
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,790
I'm the God of Debt.

449
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
He has such a good friend,

450
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,000
but he never told us.

451
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,170
Pingwen.

452
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,070
Add a pair of chopsticks,

453
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,430
and cook another dish.

454
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,180
Come.

455
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,400
[Spring Breeze of Yi River]

456
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,510
Eat with us.

457
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,480
Sure.

458
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,010
I happen to be hungry.

459
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,450
There are a few eggs left.

460
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,350
I'll go fry them.

461
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,860
No need.

462
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,000
This is good enough.

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,500
It's fine. It'll be quick.

464
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,560
I'll take this bowl.

465
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,240
Sure.

466
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,270
No one has used it.

467
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,400
Here.

468
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,680
Alright.

469
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,550
Sir.

470
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,490
Good or bad?

471
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Just say it.

472
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,860
Don't rush.

473
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,510
Maybe he calculated wrong.

474
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,030
Mr. Chang, I've kowtowed to you.

475
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,510
No matter what,

476
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,170
you have to let me marry Yu'er.

477
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,550
I'll face whatever difficulties come.

478
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:22,920
Okay.

479
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,780
Mr. Gu's fate

480
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,720
is not very good.

481
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
Others will become pillars of society.

482
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,240
Why doesn't the scholar return home early?

483
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,310
You will toil your whole life

484
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
and rarely return home.

485
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,920
This young lady's fate

486
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,320
is also strange.

487
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,510
Body and soul held in others' gaze.

488
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,030
A lone boat drifting in the dark.

489
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,160
If longing turns to stormy weather,

490
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,110
who can easily find love?

491
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,070
Isn't this

492
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,270
utterly bizarre?

493
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,880
It means the first half of life
drifting in storms

494
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,000
and the second half in solitary longing.

495
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,960
No, wait. What?

496
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,220
Solitary longing?

497
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,210
I am right here.

498
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,040
What longing?

499
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,920
Sir.

500
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,590
Read these two horoscopes together.

501
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,160
Don't rush.

502
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,950
When these two fates

503
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,820
are combined…

504
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,470
Once they meet, no matter where or when,

505
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,440
they find their true selves in each other.

506
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
It means husband and wife
will stay together

507
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,580
until the end of their days.

508
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,510
I told you so!

509
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,350
Heizi.

510
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,730
Take the gentleman to get some food.

511
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,450
Here, here.

512
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
Take this red packet.

513
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,590
Thank you. Thank you.

514
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,110
Please.

515
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,480
Farewell.

516
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,720
Back when I was

517
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,250
down and out in my hometown,

518
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,270
I ate "door-plank meals" every day.

519
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,830
Thinking about it now,

520
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,760
it wasn't so bad.

521
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,060
I actually miss it.

522
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,480
What is a door-plank meal?

523
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,890
For a door-plank meal,

524
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,270
I'd go into restaurants

525
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,640
after customers have finished eating

526
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,310
and eat up whatever's left

527
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,070
on their plates.

528
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Is this the place?

529
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,790
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

530
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,050
Come on. Guys, come in.

531
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,540
You're finally here.

532
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,000
Everyone here?

533
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,930
Yes.
Yes.

534
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
All here.

535
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,500
Listen to me.

536
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
When you go in,

537
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,880
first, clean up

538
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
the main room

539
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,200
and Old Madam Gu's room.

540
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,420
Be gentle and quiet.

541
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,110
Before dark,

542
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,440
Old Madam Gu needs to use it.

543
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
If she feels even a bit

544
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,250
of discomfort,

545
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,550
I won't have it.

546
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,750
Then

547
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,820
check inside and out,

548
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,720
the courtyard and surroundings,

549
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,310
up and down, front and back.

550
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,510
Inspect everything.

551
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,090
Replace anything broken with new ones.

552
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,520
In short,

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,030
renovate this house

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,200
until it looks brand new.

555
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,030
This house is

556
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,430
for my friend's wedding.

557
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,510
Don't let my friend

558
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,240
have any reason

559
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,160

-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

-Pingwen.
-Thank you.

Mr. Wu.

This… This is too much.

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
This is too much.

568
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,370
It's not too much at all.

569
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,100
Old Madam Gu,

570
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,370
it's the least I can do.

571
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,290
As you said,

572
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
we aren't some

573
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,750
wealthy, noble family.

574
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,920
As long as everything is fixed up

575
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,400
to look presentable, that's enough.

576
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,160
Don't worry.

577
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
These are all

578
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,170
top craftsmen I hired from Hangzhou.

579
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,370
They won't mess it up.

580
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,860
They…

581
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,590
They…

582
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,590
I traveled thousands of miles to get here.

583
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,410
It's just a little kind gesture.

584
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,340
Old Madam Gu.

585
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,960
Please indulge me.

586
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,000
Mr. Gu.

587
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,070
Let's go over the Three Letters

588
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,200
and Six Rites.

589
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,310
We clap if we both agree.

590
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,750
Okay.

591
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
I've already written the betrothal letter.

592
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:58,960
In a bit,

593
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,350
I'll send it to Yu'er.

594
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,520
The gift letter…

595
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,990
The gift list is here.

596
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:03,510
[Gift List]

597
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,000
It's a bit long. Take a look.

598
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,240
As long as there is one, it's fine.

599
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,030
I'll put it here for now.

600
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,790
As for the wedding letter,

601
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,030
it's used on the wedding day.

602
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,160
We don't need it now.

603
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,950
Those are the Three Letters.

604
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,140
Now for the Six Rites.

605
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,110
The first

606
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,200
is the proposal.

607
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,030
The matchmaker's visit.

608
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,570
Since you are here…

609
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,270
It counts.

610
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,940
I act as my own matchmaker.

611
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,110
Second

612
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,350
is birthdate matching.

613
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,480
The fortune teller just now

614
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,400
already checked your horoscopes.

615
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
No problem there.

616
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,110
Third

617
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,510
is divination—

618
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,550
picking the wedding date.

619
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,560
We will do that back in Huizhou.

620
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,790
Fourth

621
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,400
is presenting the gifts.

622
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,950
Mr. Chang.

623
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,440
This is my late father's keepsake.

624
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,300
Keep it for now.

625
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,590
Give it to Yu'er later.

626
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,000
So that's settled.

627
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,210
Fifth

628
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,510
is setting the wedding date.

629
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,040
Both sides need to agree on a date.

630
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,030
I totally agree.

631
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,920
I agree too.

632
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,160
And the last one

633
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,530
is welcoming the bride.

634
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,980
On the wedding day,

635
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,110
the groom needs
to bring the bride to his home.

636
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,310
Done.

637
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,830
No problems, right?

638
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,790
If I don't bring her,

639
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,390
does she walk there herself?

640
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,030
Come on.

641
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,230
Cheers.

642
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,730
Cheers.

643
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Mr. Chang.

644
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,070
Why hasn't Yu'er

645
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,400
come over to eat with us?

646
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
She's a girl.

647
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,320
We're discussing her marriage.

648
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,700
She's bound to be shy.

649
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,830
Skipping a meal won't hurt.

650
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,700
Come on.

651
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,320
We've been talking all this time,

652
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,920
but it seems we're just

653
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,050
amusing ourselves.

654
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,150
We haven't asked the girl involved.

655
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,950
That's right.

656
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,420
I felt something was missing too.

657
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,600
It's fine.

658
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,350
Go ask her yourself.

659
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,950
I'll wait for you to drink.

660
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,390
Hurry up, or the food will get cold.

661
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,030
Wait.

662
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,000
What should I do?

663
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,340
Give her the betrothal letter and gifts.

664
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,200
Then come back.

665
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,480
She's in the room across the way.

666
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,920
Go on.

667
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,830
That simple?

668
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,440
It's not some royal princess
getting married.

669
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,800
We're poor folk.

670
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,110
It's not that complicated.

671
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,790
Go on.

672
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,240
Yu'er.

673
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,090
I have something for you.

674
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,610
Yu'er.

675
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,590
Just now,

676
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,560
I was going over the rituals
with Mr. Chang.

677
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,610
I didn't come to see you right away.

678
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,360
Don't hold it against me.

679
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,680
Back at Shanhai Pass,

680
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,810
when we parted ways,

681
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,810
didn't I tell you

682
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,550
as soon as I had a moment to breathe,

683
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,550
I'd come find you?

684
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,790
Yu'er.

685
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,830
Yu'er.

686
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
Are you hungry?

687
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,890
Do you want to go eat something?

688
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,440
Sir.

689
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you.

690
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,920
Have some water.

691
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,560
Rest a bit.

692
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,030
Here, sir.

693
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,090
Easy does it. Take it slow.

694
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,690
Watch your safety up there.

695
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,070
Have some water.

696
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,520
Thank you.

697
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,550
Thanks.

698
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
God of Wealth.

699
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,930
These materials...

700
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,430
we have them locally too.

701
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,070
Why ship them

702
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,270
all the way from Zhejiang?

703
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,330
You have them here?

704
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,270
I don't think so.

705
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,340
Take this white mud for instance.

706
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,640
It's made from sticky rice pulp
and limestone,

707
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,170
pounded ten thousand times

708
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,990
and washed perfectly clean.

709
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,350
Pointing the walls with it
prevents termites.

710
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,410
As for weathering,

711
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,930
I won't claim it lasts 1,000 years,

712
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
but several hundred years for sure.

713
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,880
Only Zhejiang people

714
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,160
know how to make it.

715
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,400
I especially

716
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,720
went to an old craftsman

717
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,500
and used his old stock

718
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,830
just for this.

719
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,720
Mr. Gu

720
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,590
just doesn't know

721
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,900
how to deal with women.

722
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,680
He can't learn that.

723
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,280
The grand ceremony is prepared.

724
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,400
A fine union is established.

725
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,600
With deep affection
like inseparable birds,

726
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,430
may we have respect for each other.

727
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,110
May we be blessed with fertility

728
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,320
and prosperity for our descendants.

729
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,210
With one heart and one mind,

730
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,000
may we build a harmonious home.

731
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,960
May we be united forever

732
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,790
as a loving couple,

733
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,030
like in the poem of Guan Ju

734
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,160
and the elegant song of Lin Zhi.

735
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,640
May prosperity last for five generations,

736
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
and our virtue spread like the classics.

737
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,590
Respect each other

738
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,050
and enjoy harmonious intimacy forever.

739
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,310
Help each other with sincerity,

740
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,750
and pledge our love like mandarin ducks.

741
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,890
Rejoice that today,
the red thread binds us

742
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,450
in a perfect union,

743
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,750
and may we grow old together

744
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,110
with fragrant happiness.

745
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,260
In witness hereof.

746
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,880
Yu'er.

747
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,260
I also prepared a betrothal gift.

748
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
It is a keepsake my father

749
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
left for the family.

750
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,140
[Chang]

751
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,160
Yu'er.

752
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,210
What exactly are you upset about?

753
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,970
Open the door and tell me.

754
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm not very clever.

755
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,860
I can't guess if you don't tell me.

756
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,680
We have faced death together.

757
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,400
You can tell me anything.

758
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,550
I admit

759
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,270
I am a bit dense.

760
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,110
I thought it through on the way here.

761
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,200
Since I'm here,

762
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,170
all those past matters...

763
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,910
I've left them outside the door.

764
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,090
For any previous

765
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,000
thoughtlessness

766
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,460
or disrespect toward you,

767
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
if you feel upset,

768
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,930
just open the door.

769
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,470
Come out and scold me.

770
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,920
Hit me.

771
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Anything is fine.

772
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,280
As long as you are happy.

773
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,000
Yu'er.

774
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,150
Stop talking.

775
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,570
I'm going to sleep.

776
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:51,389
[Chang]

777
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Yu'er.

778
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,760
You two

779
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,510
have been drinking since noon.

780
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,320
You stayed behind

781
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
closed doors all day.

782
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,590
We were drinking while waiting for you.

783
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,760
Mr. Chang was already drunk.

784
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,890
I told him to go rest.

785
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,170
He insisted on waiting with me.

786
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,050
So we drank until he got like this.

787
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,880
Great.

788
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,980
When you're not here,

789
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,150
I let my father drink

790
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,510
only a little every day.

791
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,710
Once I closed my door today,

792
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,110
you two really let loose.

793
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,000
He is old.

794
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,430
He can't drink this much.

795
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,280
Mr. Chang was a hero all his life.

796
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Now that he's old,

797
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,150
he has to take attitude from his child.

798
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,750
Who dares give him attitude?

799
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,150
Yu'er.

800
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,840
Sit down.

801
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,190
Talk to me.

802
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,150
What for?

803
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,710
I came here

804
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,640
to deliver the marriage proposal.

805
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,870
Why are you so annoyed with me?

806
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,480
Are you smug?

807
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,590
Waiting for me to kowtow and thank you?

808
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,230
No.

809
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,520
I wouldn't dare.

810
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,360
I hope you'll agree.

811
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,400
I agree?

812
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,230
Even my father thinks

813
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,280
if I don't accept you,

814
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,320
I'd be ungrateful

815
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,190
and foolish.

816
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,920
I find it strange.

817
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,030
Back then, when you left,

818
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,670
my father called you a hero,

819
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,440
a good man.

820
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,190
Now you've come to propose,

821
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,400
and he still calls you a hero,

822
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,110
a good man.

823
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,480
Why do you men

824
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,510
have 1,000 excuses for everything

825
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,110
while whatever I do is wrong?

826
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,640
Truly hypocritical.

827
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,150
Right.

828
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,230
Well said.

829
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,320
Well said.

830
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,670
If you still feel

831
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,150
bound by debts of gratitude,

832
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,550
you don't have to be here.

833
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,840
My father saved you.

834
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,760
You saved him.

835
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,030
Now he has retired.

836
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
The messy scores

837
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,760
are better left unsettled.

838
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,400
As for my feelings,

839
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,360
that's my own business.

840
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,800
I never asked anything of you.

841
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,200
So don't take it to heart.

842
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,440
Yu'er.

843
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,960
What do you mean by that?

844
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,840
I...

845
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,110
I...

846
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,280
I thought of you

847
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,320
day and night.

848
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,030
But it was never like this.

849
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,040
Then what was it like?

850
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,910
It was...

851
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,190
Your eyes.

852
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,150
Brows.

853
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,320
Teeth.

854
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
If you are reborn in another life,

855
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,880
even among thousands of people,

856
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,740
I could recognize you at a glance.

857
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,710
I...

858
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,170
I never expected
to marry you in this life.

859
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,400
Yu'er.

860
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,550
Today feels like a dream.

861
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,070
I...

862
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm speaking nonsense.

863
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,150
What

864
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,190
are you afraid of?

865
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,530
I'm afraid this is just a dream.

866
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,550
I'm more afraid your feelings
aren't the same as mine.

867
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,370
Does this look like a dream?

868
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
Are dreams this real?

869
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,150
Sometimes dreams are this real.

870
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,010
You don't know.

871
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,000
I know.

872
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,360
Of course I know.

873
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,550
Waking up...

874
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,910
with a heart full of pain.

875
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,360
Some words

876
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,510
cannot be said to others.

877
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,420
If I hadn't been woken up,

878
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,150
I really don't know

879
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,800
how long I'd stay confused.

880
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,330
Someone as smart as you

881
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,060
needs waking up?

882
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,920
Then…

883
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,930
how are the rest of us supposed to live?

884
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,480
Don't mess with me.

885
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,880
Earlier,

886
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,110
your betrothal letter…

887
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,310
I didn't understand a single word of it.

888
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,050
I want to hear your true feelings.

889
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,970
True feelings?

890
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,960
Alright.

891
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,260
You...

892
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,260
You are unforgettable to me.

893
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,300
Meeting you

894
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,940
is the most memorable thing in my life.

895
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,360
All my true feelings

896
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,810
can be expressed in four words.

897
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,710
You are...

898
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,480
etched in my heart.

899
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,610
Me too.

900
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,110
I can't take it anymore.

901
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,040
I can't stand it.

902
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,810
I'm done pretending.

903
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,400
Too tired.

904
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Too tired.
