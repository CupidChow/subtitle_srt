00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,479
You're awake.

4
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,430
If it weren't for

5
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,789
my quick reflexes,

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,210
you would've been trampled to death.

7
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,020
In the end, I just got beaten for nothing.

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,150
Pingwen.

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,840
Where are we going?

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Are you stupid?

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,390
We're going home.

12
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,510
We're beaten up this badly.

13
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,770
Where else could we go?

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
It wasn't easy escaping that place.

15
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,870
Stop, I'm getting off.

16
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,680
I need to return to the camp.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,190
What are you going back to the camp for?

18
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,360
With all this chaos,

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,070
people get trampled

20
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,590
like they're nothing but ants.

21
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,310
Several people

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,960
were trampled to death back there,

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,890
and no one even knows who they were.

24
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,890
I'd be a fool to trust you again...

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,500
Pingyuan.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,160
Pingyuan!

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,010
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,900
Yimei is still in the military camp.

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,430
Those women are still in the camp.

30
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,120
I need to bring them back.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,150
They can't come back, Pingyuan.

32
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,030
They can't return.

33
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,840
That's a military camp.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,630
Who do you think you are?

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,750
Then what should we do?

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,010
Watch them die?

37
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,690
Many people have already died!

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,030
Just now, you and I

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,160
almost died!

40
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,840
If we die,

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,100
no one would even know.

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,590
No one should die in vain.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,790
No one.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,870
If I can't even protect

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,520
the women and children of the village,

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
can I still call myself a man?

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,370
Out of my way!

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,130
Don't stop me.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,960
Why are you trying to be a hero,
Gu Pingyuan?

50
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,950
You just talk big.

51
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,160
I may be a coward,

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,460
but at least I take care of our mother!

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,110
You!

54
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,120
You were gone for so many years,

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,250
Mother's eyes went blind from crying!

56
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
When the soldiers came,

57
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,590
she hid in the stove

58
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,590
and survived on sweet potato scraps
for 3 days and 3 nights.

59
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,630
I hid on the beam

60
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,870
and nearly starved to death.

61
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,520
Where were you when that happened?

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,079
Why didn't you

63
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,520
say that back then?

64
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,190
Now you're finally back,

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,300
and you're already leaving!

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
What do you take us

67
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
for?

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,620
If our commanding general dies today,

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,550
none of you will make it back alive!

70
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,150
Hurry!

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,050
How is the commanding general?

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,240
He's still bleeding.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
Save the general, quickly!

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,000
Hurry up!

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,430
You,

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,380
go get a cloth to cover his face.

77
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,520
He's not dead. Why cover his face?

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,370
I'm scared.

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,100
Here, General.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,720
Hurry up!

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Alright.

82
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,970
Go get

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,470
a sharp knife, alcohol, wound medicine,

84
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,270
and a brazier.

85
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,070
Okay.

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,270
Quick!

87
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,920
The brazier!

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,850
Alcohol! Hurry!

89
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,130
Li Cheng!

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Tell Li Cheng to come out!

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,270
I need to see him!

92
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,240
Li Cheng!

93
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,290
General.

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,450
I need to dig out the iron sand

95
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,180
in his wound.

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,510
You need to hold him down.

97
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,310
Alright.

98
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,700
I told you to hold him down!
What were you doing?

99
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,680
The iron sand will sink deeper

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,490
into his wound like this.

101
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,090
If I can't get it out, can you?

102
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,680
Yes.

103
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,240
Come.

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,159
Come quickly.

105
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,690
I'll pull out the arrow for you.

106
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,150
No.

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,180
He'll die if you do.

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,150
We must remove the arrow's body,

109
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,800
slowly push the arrowhead out,

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,060
and sew the wound up
with lamb intestine.

111
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,950
Water.

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,830
Water...

113
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,090
You've lost a lot of blood.

114
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,650
You can't drink too much water.

115
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,980
Just moisten your lips.

116
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,930
Look, he's much better.

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,430
He really does look much better.

118
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes.

119
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,409
You're really something.

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
I think he'll be fine now.

121
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,440
General, moving on,

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
you need to eat well

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,900
to build up your strength.

124
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,560
I think...

125
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,210
You'll recover in a month or so.

126
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,210
This...

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,300
What are you doing?

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,360
The general values this

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,200
like his own eyes.

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,870
You're just writing on it like that?

131
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,630
If he's dead,

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
what good are his eyes?

133
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,580
Well...

134

135
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,080
Get medicine according to
this prescription.

136
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,890
Take it once a day,
and his fever will subside in 3 days.

137
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,030
His heart and lungs will then be safe.

138
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,600
Alright.

139

140
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,160
Let's go.

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,080
Come on.

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,980
Those women...

143
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,190
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,580
What do you take us for?

145
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,420
We don't raise our weapons

146
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,110
against defenseless women.

147
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,880
Don't worry.

148
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,370
We didn't hurt any of them.

149
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you doing?

150
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,570
I'm going back too.

151
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,720
You can't leave.

152
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,210
Only when the arrow is removed

153
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,510
and he's up and about,

154
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,220
will your life be fully saved.

155
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
Watch him carefully.

156
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,670
Who taught you your medical skills?

157
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,670
I learned from my father.

158
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,860
When I recover,

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,670
I will reward you generously.

160
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,780
Tell me about your father.

161
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,840
What kind of person is he?

162
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,750
My father is a scholar

163
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,550
who never passed the imperial exams.

164
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,500
He said,

165
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,970
"If not a famous minister,

166
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,760
then a renowned doctor."

167
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,150
Later, he stopped taking exams

168
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,910
and became a teacher in the village.

169
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,910
He opened a school

170
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
to teach the kids

171
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,510
and studied medicine himself.

172
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,440
Tell your father to stop teaching.

173
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,810
All that Confucius and Mencius stuff

174
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
is useless anyway.

175
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,900
Come to my army

176
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,390
and be a doctor.

177
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,350
Have you ever been educated?

178
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,600
People who are educated
and understand principles

179
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,730
would never do this.

180
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,440
Because of your war,

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,270
we couldn't sell our tea

182
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,640
or bring in supplies.

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,370
Men live in fear of being drafted.

184
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,720
When the tea forest was burned down,

185
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,920
the whole village cried for a whole day.

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,120
But no one came to help.

187
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,040
Drink the medicine.

188
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,210
Just leave it there.

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,200
If you don't take the medicine,

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,770
they won't let us leave.

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,550
It's hot.

192
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,790
I'm done.

193
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
What's your name?

194
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,600
My name is Bai Yimei.

195
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,280
Fitting name for your heartlessness.

196
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,700
What happened?

197
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,010
There was a big explosion!

198
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,000
Is everyone all right?

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,480
We're fine.

200
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,340
What happened?

201
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,240
Guards!

202
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,000
It's not an enemy attack!

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Yimei.

205
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,160
Come, help me untie this.

206
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,730
General!

207
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,880
The explosives in the hay barn blew up.

208
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,600
No!

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,510
No!

210
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,500
Put your weapons away.

211
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,390
General.

212
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,510
Get up and speak.

213
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,610
So you're still alive.

214
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,530
We still have business to discuss.

215
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,790
You set off those explosives?

216
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,320
Clever move.

217
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,210
What's your relationship with Miss Bai?

218
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,140
We are engaged.

219
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,200
You trespassed into my military camp.

220
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,550
That's a capital offense.

221
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,360
But considering

222
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,960
what Miss Bai has done for me,

223
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,780
I'll let you go.

224
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,870
Go.

225
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,960
If I wanted to leave,
I would have left already.

226
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,790
I came here to take

227
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,030
all those prisoners with me.

228
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,270
General, let's just kill him.

229
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,670
Don't waste words on him.

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Fine.

231
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,960
Let's continue our business discussion.

232
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,320
Besides those hemp ropes,

233
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,870
I can also supply you with tung oil.

234
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,690
Tung oil?

235
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,550
How much?

236
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,550
If I gather all the tung oil in Huizhou,

237
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,550
there would be at least
several thousand barrels.

238
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,240
I'll sell you hemp ropes and tung oil.

239
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,370
In exchange, release all those women.

240
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,620
Are you really not a spy?

241
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,150
Whether I'm a spy or not

242
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,080
doesn't matter anymore.

243
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,030
As long as the hemp ropes
and tung oil are real,

244
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,359
isn't that good enough?

245
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,710
You make a good point.

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,680
All right.

247
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,400
As for the payment,

248
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,460
I won't short you a single candareen.

249
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,410
I'll release all those women, too.

250
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,589
However...

251
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,210
If you and I do business,

252
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,829
what will you do if the government

253
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,089
accuses you of colluding with the enemy?

254
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,220
It doesn't matter.

255
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,040
I'd be the only one guilty of it.

256
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,880
It's a small price to pay

257
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,700
for saving so many people.

258
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,000
Risking your life for a business deal?

259
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,720
Are you a fool?

260
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
Business always requires investment.

261
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,270
Sometimes a life is also part of the cost.

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,470
I can keep my promise.

263
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,380
I hope you will, too, General.

264
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,100
They're not related to you.

265
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Is it worth it?

266
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,350
Whether it's worth it
isn't for you to decide.

267
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,590
It's what I think that matters.

268
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,390
Brother Gu...

269
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,510
Fine.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,250
Let this man go.

271
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,080
Let those women go too.

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,030
Except Miss Bai.

273
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,250
Yes, sir.

274
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Li Cheng?

275
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,680
Take him away.

276
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,300
Li Cheng!

277
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
I mean all women,

278
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,110
including Bai Yimei!

279
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,640
Gu!

280
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,520
Li Cheng!

281
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
You broke your promise.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,680
Li Cheng!

283
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,160
When I recover,

284
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
I'll let you go.

285
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,920
Father.

286
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,920
Father.

287
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,200
Mother, I'm here.

288
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,110
My child.

289
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,950
I finally see you all again.

290
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,480
Sir.

291
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,080
Yimei is

292
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,590
treating someone at the military camp.

293
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,030
It will be a few days

294
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,630
before we can bring her back.

295
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
My daughter-in-law.

296
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,540
You scared me to death.

297
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,510
I'm fine.

298
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,930
As long as I'm still breathing,

299
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,210
I will protect her with my life.

300
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,880
Please don't be too sad.

301
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,240
Better to be a dog in peaceful times

302
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,280
than a human in chaotic times.

303
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,980
I wish I were dead!

304
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,210
I wish...

305
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,510
I were dead.

306
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,080
Pingyuan, please don't be angry

307
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,670
anymore, okay?

308
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,640
Look, after that,

309
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,270
I gathered my courage

310
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,110
and went back
to the military camp to find you.

311
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,350
Look how badly they beat me.

312
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,720
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

313
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,770
Pingyuan, please don't tell Mother

314
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,830
that we had a fight.

315
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,750
Why don't you hit me instead?

316
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,550
I won't fight back.

317
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,210
Just leave me alone, will you?

318
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,310
What's with all that noise outside?

319
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,430
Pingyuan, are you back?

320
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,370
Don't tell Mother where I went.

321
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,510
Mom, I'm back.

322
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
Mom, I'm back.

323
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,750
Mom.

324
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,680
Son, you're finally back.

325
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,640
You really had me worried sick.

326
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,590
Your brother said you've been

327
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,720
in the city doing business these days.

328
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,880
I told him you just got back home

329
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,310
and haven't even settled in yet.

330
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,190
What business could you possibly have?

331
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,760
A friend of mine in town

332
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,590
asked me to get him some hemp rope,

333
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,720
tung oil, and stuff.

334
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,720
I thought I could earn some money

335
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,510
and use it to renovate

336
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,270
our house.

337
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,540
With all this chaos,

338
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,540
it's hard to get a good friend.

339
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,470
Who is he?

340
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,030
You should invite him

341
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,230
to visit us sometime.

342
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,310
He's called

343
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,580
Li Cheng.

344
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,820
He's, uh,

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,800
from Guangxi.

346
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,840
He just arrived in Anhui, too.

347
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
He's very hospitable,

348
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,140
so

349
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,010
he kept me there for a few days.

350
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
You're trying to fool me.

351
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,040
You shouldn't charge money
for helping a friend.

352
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,040
We must keep our hearts righteous.

353
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm not lying to you.

354
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,480
We're doing business together.

355
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
I'm not costing him much.

356
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,260
My son is going to have a better life.

357
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Our family

358
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,850
is going to prosper.

359
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Mom.

360
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,210
Let me tell you more good news.

361
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,480
All the women in the village

362
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,610
have been released.

363
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,190
But Yimei

364
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,160
needs to stay in town for a few more days.

365
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,350
She needs to treat someone.

366
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,240
When she returns,

367
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,030
I'll have her come
pay her respects to you.

368
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,790
Then you should quickly

369
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,240
go tell Mr. Bai.

370
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,240
Mother.

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,310
We've already told Mr. Bai.

372
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
In the past few years,

373
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,330
Yimei

374
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,300
has visited us the most.

375
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,390
See the gown I'm wearing

376
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,310
and Pingwen's shoes?

377
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,580
She made them all.

378
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,040
You must treat her well,

379
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,770
or I won't stand for it.

380
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,550
What are you saying?

381
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,640
I wouldn't dare mistreat her.

382
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,970
Please have some water.

383
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, Mom.

384
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,810
This afternoon, Pingyuan and I

385
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,950
need to go out again.

386
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,270
We ordered 200 tea seedlings

387
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,230
that we need to bring back.

388
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,680
Oh, right.

389
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
Time waits for no one.

390
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,790
Once we bring them back,
we need to plant them right away.

391
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,110
We're trying to harvest another batch

392
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,840
before the Qingming Festival.

393
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,460
I'm really getting old.

394
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,920
I've always thought of you two as kids.

395
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
But in the blink of an eye,

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,860
you've both grown into young men.

397
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,820
Just keep thinking of us that way.

398
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,110
No matter when,

399
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,750
Pingwen and I will always be

400
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,750
kids in your eyes.

401
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,690
These are blades and needles.

402
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,430
Wipe them clean with alcohol

403
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,110
and sterilize them with fire before use.

404
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,970
I haven't used them in a long time.

405
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,640
These hands of mine

406
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,790
sometimes shake terribly.

407
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,320
I won't need these anymore.

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,070
Yimei knows

411
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,370
what they're used for.

412
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,270
If anything is missing, just tell me,

413
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,040
I'll find it.

414
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,510
Let your disciples handle the work.

415
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,170
You have plenty of disciples.

416
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,040
Don't worry.

417
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,750

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960

[Wound Medicine]

420
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,490
Though I have good disciples,

421
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,840
they're all busy with farming.

422
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,790
I am a useless teacher.

423
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,610
Tao Yuanming said,

of the mundane world,

30 years have gone past in an instant."

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,440
to achieve something in life?

428
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,580
Some old sayings need to be changed.

429
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,120
After bringing Yimei back,

430
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,160
I plan to properly

431
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,960
reorganize the tea plantation.

432
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,350
Earlier this afternoon, Pingwen and I

433
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,120
bought some tea seedlings back.

434
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,320
No matter who's fighting in this world,

435
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,790
people will always
need to drink tea, right?

436
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,790
Just wait and see.

437
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,360
I have an old friend who roasts tea

438
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,680
in Zhonghe Village on the mountain
across from here.

439
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,750
His surname is Liao.

440
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,310
You can invite him over.

441
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,480
Your mother and Pingwen once met him

442
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,410
when he came to roast tea years ago.

443
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,280
That's great.

444
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,640
I've been wanting to learn tea roasting.

445
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,300
I could take him as my teacher.

446
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,900
Liao is quite stubborn.

447
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,550
If I don't keep an eye on things,

448
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,160
I'm afraid he won't teach you at all.

449
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,510
Speaking of which,
with these years of war,

450
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,830
Liao hasn't come to roast tea
in a long while.

451
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh well.

452
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,770
If he refuses to teach you,

453
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
I'll take this walking stick

454
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,220
and give him a good whack on his backside.

455
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,370
Can you bear it?

456
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Does it hurt a lot?

457
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,710
It should have been pulled out long ago.

458
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,340
We need medicine for this.

459
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,790
First, we need to remove
the flesh around it.

460
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,390
If we pull it out carelessly,

461
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,920
blood will gush out,

462
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,950
and you'll be beyond saving.

463
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,720
Come on, pull it out.

464
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,290
I'm going to pull it out now.

465
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,090
Do you want something to bite on?

466
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,240
If I'm afraid of pain,

467
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,830
how could I lead troops into battle?

468
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,490
Pull it out.

469
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,530
Don't panic.

470
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,200
It doesn't matter if I die
under treatment.

471
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,180
I've already told my men

472
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,830
what to do.

473
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,080
No matter what happens,

474
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,580
they will take you home.

475
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't move.

476
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,550
If your wound remains closed

477
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,540
by dawn, you'll be fine.

478
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,000
It's the first time

479
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,600
I've felt breathing could be so pleasant.

480
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,200
Breathing is naturally pleasant.

481
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,410
Eating, sunbathing, and drinking tea.

482
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,570
They're all pleasant things.

483
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,210
I really don't understand.

484
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,180
Heaven created humans

485
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,510
and grew crops on the earth.

486
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,110
The crops produced fruits

487
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,710
to satisfy people's hunger,

488
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,960
and grew cotton

489
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,720
to keep people warm.

490
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,250
Why then do people
have to kill each other?

491
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,740
You're a pampered young lady
from a wealthy family,

492
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,640
how would you understand these things?

493
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm not a pampered young lady.

494
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,880
A pampered young lady wouldn't know
how to treat wounds.

495
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,140
My father is a scholar.

496
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
At least,

497
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,260
you can eat a full meal, right?

498
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,110
Where I was born,

499
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,530
girls were sold off

500
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,030
before they even grew up.

501
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,610
When boys reach 6 or 7 years old,

502
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,410
they have to follow their fathers
into the mines to dig for coal.

503
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,350
My father died when the mine collapsed,

504
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
and he was buried inside.

505
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,210
My two younger brothers

506
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,630
died when water flooded the mine

507
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
and drowned them.

508
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,260
The youngest was only 4 years old.

509
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,210
My mother had to borrow money
from loan sharks

510
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,510
just to barely afford

511
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,440
two dog-knocker coffins

512
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,850
to bury them.

513
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,130
What does "dog-knocker" mean?

514
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,070
If the coffin boards were thick,

515
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,330
that would be fine.

516
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,450
But the poor people's coffin
are all made too thin

517
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,010
and buried in shallow pits.

518
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,310
Heavy rain washes them out easily.

519
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Wild dogs would then follow the scent

520
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,100
and knock open the coffin lids
with their heads.

521
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,430
They'd drag out the bodies,

522
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,160
tear them apart wildly,

523
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,550
and leave them in pieces.

524
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,130
My two older brothers and I

525
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,750
worked desperately

526
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,120
to no end,

527
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,970
but still couldn't pay
the loan sharks back.

528
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,300
What's a loan shark?

529
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,730
The mine owner knew we needed money.

530
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,230
So, he convinced my two brothers

531
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,570
to blow up the mountain with explosives.

532
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,670
They couldn't escape in time

533
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,780
and were killed in the explosion.

534
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,270
My mother lost all hope.

535
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,830
She made me one last full meal.

536
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,670
Then, while I was asleep,

537
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,970
she drowned herself in the river.

538
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,570
After that, I joined the Resistance Army.

539
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,200
My comrades told me

540
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,750
that all the suffering of poor people
in this world

541
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,400
is because of

542
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,030
those bastards.

543
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,760
So I swore

544
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,700
to kill all the evil people in this world.

545
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,270
But you killed

546
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,640
those innocent people.

547
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,710
They had done nothing to you.

548
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,260
No one in this world is innocent.

549
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,920
Fine.

550
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,090
I won't mention it again.

551
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:18,950
Don't be angry.

552
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,370
It would be bad if your wound reopened.

553
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,630
This has been upsetting for you.

554
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,400
When you go back,

555
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,830
I'll reward you generously.

556
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,560
What's there to be upset about?

557
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,440
You'll eventually return
to the battlefield

558
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,070
and come back like this again.

559
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,420
I'm a soldier.

560
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,240
Fighting is my destiny.

561
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,760
Besides,

562
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,230
dying wouldn't be so bad.

563
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,080
If I die, I can see

564
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,890
my parents and brothers again.

565
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,480
I miss them so much.

566
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,540
Yimei.

567
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,990
Gu.

568
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,670
Your father asked me to give this to you.

569
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,800
What did my father say?

570
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,160
He wants you to return
as soon as possible.

571
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,340
Are you doing alright?

572
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,750
Here.

573
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,270
You have knives and scissors here.

574
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:52,920
If I really wanted to do something,

575
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I wouldn't need to sneak a weapon in.

576
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,160
And you call yourself a deputy commander.

577
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,070
You're such a coward.

578
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,350
Who are you calling a coward?

579
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,240
Say that again. I dare you.

580
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,100
That's enough.

581
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,960
You can't win an argument

582
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,020
against a scholar.

583
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,320
Let him come forward and speak.

584
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,760
You heard him.

585
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,640
General, about the hemp ropes
and tung oil...

586
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,400
I know.

587
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,350
I heard that you bought

588
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,880
4,000 barrels of oil

589
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,880
and six carts of hemp rope in Huizhou.

590
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,510
Yes.

591
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,350
I bought all the tung oil

592
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,240
in Huizhou.

593
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,310
A man of your word.

594
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,090
You've earned back

595
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,590
your life by yourself.

596
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,710
I see you're feeling better.

597
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,010
I'd like to take Yimei and leave first.

598
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,550
When it's time to send her back,

599
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,720
I will do so myself.

600
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,810
No need to say more.

601
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,350
You've kept your word.

602
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,310
I'll keep mine.

603
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,930
It's not that I don't trust you.

604
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,610
I just think once the war breaks out,

605
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,870
you might not
even be able to protect yourself.

606
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,200
Take him away.

607
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,930
Yes, sir.

608
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,830
Out!

609
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,270
-Get out!
-General!

610
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,200
Get out!

611
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,190
Go!

612
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,639
Give me the medicine.

613
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,190
General.

614
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,389
Speak freely.

615
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,320
She's such a blockhead,

616
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,120
she won't understand anything.

617
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,280
General.

618
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,159
Actually, these days,

619
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,710
the others in the camp

620
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,400
keep asking

621
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,810
when we're going to move.

622
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,270
What's there to ask about?

623
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,020
Our orders from above

624
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,360
are to wait here for ships

625
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,510
to transport the troops.

626
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,239
I haven't even seen

627
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,570
the shadow of a ship yet.

628
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,840
But everyone's saying

629
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,670
that our navy

630
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,690
was defeated by the imperial court.

631
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,480
Nonsense!

632
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,860
General.

633
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,670
Where did you hear that?

634
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
From our men who escaped

635
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,920
and came back.

636
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,010
They say our navy has defected.

637
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,850
It's not just a rumor. It's true.

638
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,400
See?

639
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,940
How fast the news travels!

640
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,140
General.

641
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,070
Are we stranded here alone?

642
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,550
The men are saying

643
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,280
we should have gone
to surround Hefei long ago.

644
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,510
If we stay in this godforsaken place,

645
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,370
we'll be swallowed whole one day.

646
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,000
Bring me the map.

647
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,630
Yes, sir.

648
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,450
General.

649
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,360
Here. Careful.

650
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,060
[Angelica sinensis, Dipsacus asper 1 tael,
Cynanchum paniculatum
3 taels, Deer antler 0.5 tael]

651
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,850
Who wrote on my map?

652
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,660
Qimen and Anqing have fallen.

653
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,710
The upper Yangtze is now exposed.

654
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,800
If we go south now,

655
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,550
we'll walk right into

656
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,760
the imperial court's troops waiting there.

657
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,600
If you have

658
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,880
even the slightest thought of retreat,

659
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
we'll be completely wiped out.

660
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,200
What will you do then?

661
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,670
Then, let's attack Hefei.

662
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,440
Yes, General.

663
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,570
General, let's attack Hefei.

664
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,670
-Let's attack Hefei.
-Let's do it.

665
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,440
Attack Hefei?

666
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,100
We weren't ordered to do that.

667
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,450
We were told to hold this position

668
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,580
to relieve pressure

669
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,790
for the siege forces.

670
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,700
If we withdraw,

671
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,000
the imperial court's forces will sweep in

672
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,930
and immediately

673
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,550
surround the Resistance Army

674
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,720
besieging Hefei.

675
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,990
Who will take responsibility for that?

676
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,900
I will.

677
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,550
You?

678
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,090
How many heads do you have?

679
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,920
General,

680
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,800
the navy won't be coming.

681
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,540
If we just wait here,

682
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,030
when their cavalry arrives,

683
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,670
one charge

684
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,710
and they'll drive us all

685
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,770
into the Yangtze to feed the turtles.

686
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,880
We might as well

687
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,360
go to Hefei and join the attack.

688
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,420
We'll take the city, and all get rich.

689
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,560
What if we can't take Hefei?

690
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,630
If we can't take it,

691
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,570
we'll either

692
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,240
die

693
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,400
or

694
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,280
surrender.

695
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,050
I’ll kill you!

696
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,450
General, calm down!

697
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,110
-General! Calm down!
-General.

698
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,640
General!

699
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't want to live anymore.

700
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Ever since my two brothers

701
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,790
died,

702
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,450
I haven’t wanted to live anymore.

703
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,150
Come on!

704
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,590
Cut me down!

705
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,590
Do it!

706
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,960
I'm still investigating
the naval situation!

707
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
If the navy has truly been defeated,

708
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,840
we'll move immediately!

709
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,000
But before that,

710
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,200
if any of you stir up dissent again,

711
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,330
I will personally behead you.

712
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,230
I know.

713
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,670
The battle has dragged on

714
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,470
and everyone feels frustrated.

715
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,740
But if we can't live well as humans,

716
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,090
what makes you think we’d live
good lives as dogs?

717
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,020
If you only wanted a full meal,

718
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,510
why bother joining the Resistance Army?

719
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,110
Why risk your life in battle?

720
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,650
Those words you just said,

721
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,890
do they honor our fallen brothers?

722
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,700
Everyone, dismissed.

723
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,760
Leave.

724
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,320
Did I scare you?

725
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,520
This is what war is like.

726
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,620
The medicine is burnt.

727
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,550
Here.

728
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,400
Tea picking in January marks the new year.

729
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,070
Tea picking in February
welcomes the new spring.

730
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:11,030
Tea picking in March,
when peach blossoms are red.

731
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,760
Tea picking in April makes us busy.

732
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,760
Tea picking in September,
when chrysanthemums are yellow.

733
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,590
Tea picking in October,
when it's briefly warm.

734
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,510
Tea picking in November,
when snowflakes fall.

735
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:39,070
Tea picking in December,
when another year passes.

736
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Drink some water.

737
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,880
Sir, please don't worry anymore.

738
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,890
I'll go to the military camp again
tomorrow.

739
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,760
Yimei is a good person,
heaven will protect her.

740
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,220
She's always been so kind,

741
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,880
she wouldn't even

742
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,760
step on an ant.

743
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,850
Heaven won't let someone like her down.

744
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,320
You can't go there again.

745
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,400
Tigers and wolves don't listen to reason.

746
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,030
They didn't eat you today

747
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,560
because you were lucky,

748
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,070
not because they've changed their nature.

749
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,170
I've already lost my daughter.

750
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,600
If I were to lose you as well,

751
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,820
I don’t think I could keep living.

752
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,840
Sir,

753
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,330
don't think like that.

754
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,020
In this world,

755
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,120
nothing is greater than reason.

756
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,480
She has already saved

757
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,680
that general's life.

758
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,570
What more could they want?

759
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,860
Reason is something between humans.

760
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,950
What reason can you talk about
with beasts?

761
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,880
Look at tigers and wolves,

762
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,540
they don't eat their own kind.

763
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,580
But humans?

764
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,630
They specifically slaughter and enslave

765
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,540
their own kind.

766
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,150
They're worse than beasts.

767
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,360
Who can you reason with then?

768
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,960
I've been thinking these days.

769
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,000
Now that Yimei has been taken away,

770
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,840
only a few outcomes may happen.

771
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,520
Outcome 1,

772
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,890
she returns unharmed.

773
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,710
This is certainly the best outcome.

774
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,840
May all the Bodhisattvas protect her.

775
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,670
Outcome 3

776
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,440
is the worst outcome.

777
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Only her body comes back.

778
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,760
Maybe, we might not even find her body.

779
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,950
If so, I would soon follow her.

780
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,030
But I fear outcome 2.
