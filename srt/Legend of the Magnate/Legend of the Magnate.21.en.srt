[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,350
You, come here.

4
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,960
Come here. Come here.

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,660
Look what I've got for you.

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,580
Take it.

7
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,390
This is for me?

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,240
Yes, for you.

9
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,860
Take it.

10
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,000
A little gift for you.

11
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,870
Thanks a lot.

12
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,360
Weapons

13
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,960
ready!

14
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,920
Salute!

15
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,150
One!

16
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,240
Two!

17
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,360
Weapons

18
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,320
back!

19
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,930
Nice!

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,190
Nice. Excellent.

21
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,340
Excellent!

22
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,079
Nice.

23
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,590
Nice.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,980
If you like it, come again!

25
00:02:59,510 --> 00:02:59,960
Sure.

26
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,710
Are we sleeping in the cave tonight?

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,190
We can't sleep in a cave
at this kind of time.

28
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,790
The yin energy is too strong.

29
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,079
You keep watch
for the first half of the night,

30
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,740
and I'll take the second half.

31
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,079
Just bear with it.

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,060
Things will get better
once we reach the horse camp.

33
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,920
Aren't we going back to Ningguta?

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,230
Why are we going to the horse camp again?

35
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,190
There's still a treasure
in that horse camp.

36
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,360
Once we sell this cartload of
foreign weapons,

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,890
what treasure can't we buy?

38
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,710
My treasure can't be bought with money.

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,590
Here.

40
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,870
Take it.

41
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,870
Tell me.

42
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,310
After we hand over these guns,

43
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,390
what kind of official position
do you think they'll give me?

44
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,320
If you're lucky,

45
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,850
they might reward you with
a general's rank.

46
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,720
How long have you been taking this stuff?

47
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,430
This is taboo for officials.

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,480
Everyone in the official circle

49
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,090
is secretly taking this stuff.

50
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,460
I'll quit it once my cough is gone.

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,970
I'm going to be a general, you know?

52
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
A great general,

53
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,000
mighty and imposing.

54
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,690
Let's find a place sheltered from the wind
to hide for a bit!

55
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,830
We can't hide!

56
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,390
If the horses freeze to death,

57
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,360
we'll never make it back!

58
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,270
Just keep moving—

59
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
we'll reach the horse camp before dark!

60
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,280
There's still one more mountain to cross!

61
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,460
Stop neighing!

62
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,800
Are you trying to call the wolves over
or something?

63
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,110
I've fought with them for years.

64
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,390
They'd gather in packs trying to eat me,

65
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
but didn't they end up as meat in my mouth

66
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,820
and bedding for me to sleep on?

67
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,870
We're leaving tomorrow.

68
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,270
Let's bid them farewell.

69
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,970
Look how cowardly you are.

70
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,430
Come on.

71
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,310
Go get some rest.

72
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,070
I'll tie up the horses

73
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,620
and give them some fodder.

74
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,360
Bolt the door properly—

75
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,960
don't let the wolves get you.

76
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,000
There's wine in the pot.
Feel free to drink.

77
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,890
We can't take it with us anyway.

78
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,930
What are you doing?

79
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,570
Do you know how to use a gun, boy?

80
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
If they smell the scent of blood,

81
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,720
they'll love it.

82
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,150
You stole my bullets!

83
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,010
Are you out of your mind?

84
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
You planned to die all along!

85
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,720
So why did you take me on

86
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,380
such a long detour to get here?

87
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,630
I want you to taste

88
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,630
what I've been through—

89
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,560
falling headfirst

90
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
from the clouds.

91
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,480
Fine.

92
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,790
Now things are just the way you wanted.

93
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,200
Go on then. Shoot me.

94
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,480
Shoot me!

95
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,390
In another 100 days,

96
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,130
or even 200 days,

97
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,360
no one will ever come here.

98
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
The wolves will drag you away,

99
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,390
leaving only a pool of blood
on the ground.

100
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,630
When it heats up

101
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,730
and after a few rainfalls,

102
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,000
it'll be washed clean—

103
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,720
like you were never here at all.

104
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,970
I know you're out of opium.

105
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,550
Come back to the Central Plains with me.

106
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,210
I'll find you the best doctor.

107
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,810
And also,

108
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,630
that cartload of guns,

109
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,240
I won't take a single penny
from selling them.

110
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,100
It's all yours.

111
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
My illness can't be cured!

112
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,340
I've told you it can't be cured!

113
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,870
I've been clinging to life with this opium

114
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,190
just to wait for you.

115
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,670
You've ruined my life!

116
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,720
My illness

117
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,550
first developed here from the cold!

118
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,820
Everything I ever had

119
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,300
has been ruined by you!

120
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,510
Look carefully.

121
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
This is the Ice Hell,

122
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,860
and I'm the King of Hell!

123
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,310
Get up, come on.

124
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,750
Go away!

125
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,820
Go away!

126
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,910
Here.

127
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,530
Are there any bullets left?

128
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,490
No, none left.

129
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,500
How do I check?

130
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,530
There's only one left.

131
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,110
The wolves are banging on the door again.

132
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
It won't be long
before they break it down.

133
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,130
The two of us

134
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,670
are going to die sooner or later—

135
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,310
that's all there is to it.

136
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,960
Open this for me.

137
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
So this is your treasure?

138
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,120
My treasure is gone.

139
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,160
When that girl surnamed Su

140
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,870
came last time,

141
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,930
I was on the brink of death.

142
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,580
She left two crates of this treasure,

143
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,910
so I could stay alive and wait for you.

144
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,070
Isn't she just like

145
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,160
a living Bodhisattva
who can predict everything?

146
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
Su Zixuan!

147
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,160
If I were you,

148
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,850
I'd use this thing

149
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,790
to put a bullet in my own head.

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
Being torn apart by wolves hurts a lot.

151
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,060
Judging by the direction,

152
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,290
they should be near the horse camp.

153
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,910
Yu'er,

154
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,060
don't rush.

155
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,480
The wind is strong and the snow is heavy.

156
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Let's find a local to guide us there.

157
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,960
Isn't there a path right in front of us?

158
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Yu'er!

159
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,680
Yu'er!

160
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,880
Yu'er.

161
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Yu'er.

162
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,240
Mr. Chang.

163
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,910
My friend.

164
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,130
We traveled day and night here.

165
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,130
Thank heavens

166
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,400
that you're safe and unharmed.

167
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,790
What does the Empress Dowager look like?

168
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,490
Just a nose and two eyes—

169
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,010
like any normal person.

170
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,270
I don't believe you.

171
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,070
You're lying.

172
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,110
I'm not.

173
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,550
When I met her,

174
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,150
I didn't even know
she was the Empress Dowager.

175
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,380
She's not as pretty as you.

176
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,410
What about Yimei?

177
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Who of us is prettier?

178
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,310
I'm sorry, Gu.

179
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,030
I couldn't help but ask.

180
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,710
It's okay.

181
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,960
Whether she's pretty or not

182
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,360
has nothing to do with me.

183
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,850
She chose her own path.

184
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
But sometimes when I think about it,

185
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm quite envious of her.

186
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,790
Why?

187
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,170
She believed that path was right,

188
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,230
so she just took it.

189
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,790
In life,

190
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,000
if you never go a little wild,
you're letting yourself down.

191
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,820
Gu,

192
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,620
that's something
only a true hero would say.

193
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,960
I've been messed up like this—

194
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,820
how could I still be called a hero?

195
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,130
What about you?

196
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,880
Still traveling with the horse caravan
alongside Mr. Chang?

197
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,360
I didn't expect that
upon arriving in the capital,

198
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,090
I'd hear that you're also here.

199
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,100
Li Qin asked me to tell you

200
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,330
not to go to the capital,

201
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,120
saying people there
wouldn't treat you well.

202
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,480
If I don't go to the capital,

203
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,810
who am I supposed to
sell all these guns to?

204
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,480
In this world,

205
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
aside from you and Mr. Chang,

206
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
hardly anyone truly cares about me.

207
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,200
After you left,

208
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,590
we made two more trips to Horqin.

209
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,880
When leaving the city, I was
thinking about

210
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,000
how you'd walked that road before.

211
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
When I got to the grasslands,

212
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,380
I thought again of

213
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,860
the time when we were fighting

214
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,880
and got surrounded by cavalry.

215
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,790
You said...

216
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,010
You said you never imagined

217
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,750
that the two of us

218
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,150
would end up dying there.

219
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,170
If we had died then,

220
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,690
wouldn't that have actually been
a blessing?

221
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,230
Up ahead is Ningguta.

222
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,960
Shall we revisit our old haunt?

223
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,200
Who's revisiting old haunts with you?

224
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,830
Once we enter the city,

225
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,070
we'll swap for two new horses,

226
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,200
buy some food, and continue on our way.

227
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,590
What were you two talking about?

228
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,360
Why are you crying like a bunny?

229
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,110
It's too late to wipe your tears.

230
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm hungry.

231
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,230
I'll go ahead.

232
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,790
Mr. Gu.

233
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,060
Yu'er and I

234
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,010
won't be going to the capital.

235
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,880
This road leads straight into Shanxi—

236
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,040
it's very fast and convenient.

237
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,880
Mr. Chang, have you forgotten?

238
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,680
I've traveled this way with you before.

239
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,280
That's right. That's right.

240
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
All good things must come to an end.

241
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,400
Let's part ways here.

242
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,480
Mr. Chang.

243
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,260
What is this about?

244
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,350
Get up! Get up! I cannot accept this.

245
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,750
Listen to me.

246
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,950
You came from afar to save me—

247
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,720
such noble kindness

248
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,570
cannot be repaid

249
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,640
with a mere "thank you."

250
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Get up now. Get up.

251
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,780
Come on, get up!

252
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,140
You're a good person in every way,

253
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,150
but occasionally

254
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,920
when you say those refined things,

255
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,300
I really can't take it.

256
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,590
My daughter and I
have benefited from your kindness,

257
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,720
and this time, we've just repaid
a little of it.

258
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,440
Actually, we're the ones

259
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,970
who should be thanking you.

260
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,910
All right.

261
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,750
Young fellows grow old
in this world of strife—

262
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,680
who knows when we'll meet again?

263
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,030
Father.

264
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,240
You've picked up quite a few of

265
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,070
these pretentious phrases too.

266
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,390
After knowing Mr. Gu for so long,

267
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,860
isn't it only natural that
I picked up a thing or two?

268
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,640
You two say your goodbyes properly.

269
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,100
I'll wait for you up ahead.

270
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,960
Yu'er.

271
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,750
I'll be thinking of you all the time.

272
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,510
You...

273
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,550
Don't make me cry,

274
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,810
or Father will just laugh at me later.

275
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,080
How about

276
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,170
I escort you back to Shanxi?

277
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Forget it.

278
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,200
Even if

279
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,750
we get to Shanxi,

280
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,010
you're still going to leave, aren't you?

281
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,030
I don't want to live
this kind of life anymore,

282
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,030
always begging the sun and the moon.

283
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,900
What do you mean,
"begging the sun and the moon?"

284
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,400
I...

285
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,640
I beg the sun to set later,

286
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,640
so I can stay with you longer.

287
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,790
I beg

288
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,660
the moon to rise earlier,

289
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,550
and I wish this road

290
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,880
would never end.

291
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,480
But doesn't every road in this world

292
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,240
eventually come to an end?

293
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,300
And when it does...

294
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,050
It means we have to part.

295
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,480
Even if we go to Shanxi together,

296
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,080
it's not the end of the world.

297
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Yu'er.

298
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,750
I know I owe you a lot.

299
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,030
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,240
What's there to apologize for?

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,040
O-On our way here,

302
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,330
my father secretly came to me and said

303
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,750
someone like you,
who could venture deep into foreign lands

304
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,920
to buy weapons for the imperial court

305
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,240
and still escape death,

306
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,070
must be a person

307
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,880
blessed with great fortune,

308
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,560
with unlimited potential.

309
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,480
I...

310
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,150
I agree with that.

311
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,520
In the future...

312
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,800
In the future,

313
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,250
if you become a governor

314
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,850
or a general someday,

315
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,370
there will be...

316
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,620
There will be many more people
who will like you.

317
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,330
You can't possibly apologize to me
every day then, can you?

318
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,210
You're really something.

319
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,510
What governor or general?

320
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,370
I've never imagined such things.

321
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,600
Stop making fun of me.

322
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,170
Things between men and women
in this world are always like this.

323
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,370
Once we enter this world,

324
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,610
we're destined for a hard life.

325
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,000
If I could have a love
to be remembered for a lifetime,

326
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,860
that would already be a blessing.

327
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,160
If I still don't know contentment,

328
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,400
even Heaven would blame me

329
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,330
for being unappreciative, right?

330
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,480
Gu,

331
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
please live well.

332
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,040
Do...

333
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,730
Do things that make you happy.

334
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
That's my greatest wish.

335
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,050
I want to tell you

336
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,360
that when life finally
settles down someday,

337
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,500
I want to come find you.

338
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,140
But I'm afraid that day

339
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,350
might keep you waiting for too long.

340
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Well...

341
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,330
Just like what my father just said,

342
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,160
"young fellows grow old
in this world of strife."

343
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,620
If you want to come find me,

344
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,150
then hurry.

345
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,590
By His Highness's command,

346
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,720
please bring Mr. Gu in for an audience.

347
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,850
Mr. Gu.

348
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,570
The entire capital
has been searching for you,

349
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,280
[Prince Gong's Mansion]

350
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,070
making me worried sick.

351
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,790
Come on,

352
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
pay your respects to His Highness.

353
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,790
Even for distinguished guests,

354
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,680
His Highness has never

355
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,480
come to the gate to welcome them.

356
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,970
Your Highness.

357
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,110
Please rise.

358
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,920
You're not an official,

359
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,190
so let's treat each other as equals.

360
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,000
I heard about it
as soon as you entered the city.

361
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,280
So, this cart is loaded with foreign guns?

362
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,610
Indeed, Your Highness.

363
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,110
Let me see.

364
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,440
[Prince Gong's Mansion]

365
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,670
Mr. Gu.

366
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,150
You've had a long and tiring journey.

367
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,920
Thank you for your efforts.

368
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

369
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,710
It was no trouble.

370
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,760
Nice stuff.

371
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:50,860
Here.

372
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,250
Mr. Gu.

373
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,960
I truly never expected

374
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,440
that you'd be able to

from the foreigners.

376

This...

377
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,850
How can I ever repay this favor?

378
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,680
Mr. Qiao,

379
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,150
please don't say such things.

380
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,360
If you could truly help our country

381
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,400
reclaim lost territory,

382
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
all the common people

383
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
would be eternally grateful to you.

384
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Come here.

385
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,190

387

388
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,770
and first send them to
the Northwest Military Supply Station.

389
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,150
-Have our men keep a close watch.
-Mr. Gu.

390
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,880
Don't let anyone take them away.

391
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
The Empress Dowager

392
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,030
has praised your insight

393
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,510
in front of me several times.

394
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,660
Do me a favor—

395
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,800
would you be willing to serve as

396
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,630
a Pacification Commissioner
for the imperial court?

397
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,490
Your Highness.

398
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,510
I've never been an official,

399
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,790
nor do I know how to be one.

400
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,320
A Pacification Commissioner
isn't an official,

401
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
but a bridge between the imperial court

402
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,350
and the rebels.

403
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,000
Once the war breaks out,
casualties are inevitable.

404
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,320
Besides, not everyone in Hefei

405
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,670
is in collusion with the bandits.

406
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,760
We need someone to enter the city

407
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,390
and evacuate the civilians.

408
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,630
This person should be

409
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,880
a well‑known local figure—

410
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,070
a gentry trusted by both sides
would be ideal.

411
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,930
Besides, Anhui is your hometown.

412
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,040

413
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,970
you're obligated to help.

414
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,660
If you manage to accomplish this,

415
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I will personally

416
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,950

417
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,090
How does that sound?

418
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,690
Since Your Highness has said that,

419
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,070
for the people of my hometown,

420
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,930
I, Gu Pingyuan,

421
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,590
will dedicate myself to it
even at the risk of my life.

422
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,320
It's just

423
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,070
I have one humble request

424
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,480
that I hope Your Highness will grant.

425
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,150
Go ahead.

426
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,670
Years ago, my father came to the capital
for the imperial examination

427
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,880
and never returned.

428
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,760
He remains missing to this day.

429
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,400
Later, when I went to take
the imperial examination,

430
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,840
someone at the examination hall

431
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,710
falsely claimed my mother was gravely ill,

432
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,230
which made me cause a scene
at the examination hall

433
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,400
and got exiled to Ningguta subsequently.

434
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
To this day, I still don't know
whether my father is alive or dead,

435
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
nor who has been scheming against me

436
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,130
from behind the scenes.

437
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,330
I'm merely a commoner

438
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,190
with no authority to investigate
such matters.

439
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,030
If Your Highness

440
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,230
could give the order,

441
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,360
perhaps the truth could finally
come to light

442
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,960
and resolve the greatest confusion
of my life.

443
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,280
As a filial son,

444
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,510
causing a scene at the examination hall
for your ill mother

445
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,960
is understandable.

446
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,930
But your father's disappearance

447
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,230
is indeed somewhat strange.

448
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Here's what we do.

449
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,640
Later tonight,

450
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,920
write a petition
and have it delivered to my residence.

451
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,070
I'll have
the Nine Gates Infantry Commander's men

452
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,920
investigate for you.

453
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,050
If there's any news,

454
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,150
I'll have them
send word to you immediately.

455
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,280
How does that sound?

456
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

457
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,480
The Hefei Garrison General,
Li Cheng, is really fierce.

458
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,190
Even though the situation
has become hopeless for him,

459
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,650
he's still putting up stubborn resistance.

460
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,050
Let me show you something.

461
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,840
Do you know what this is?

462
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,190
This is...

463
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,800
This is Hefei city.

464
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
Those two mountains outside the city

465
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
were taken by the Green Standard Army

466
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,710
at the cost of countless lives.

467
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,480
I've already sent men

468
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,880
to transport the Western cannons
to the mountaintops.

469
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,590
If he still refuses to surrender,

470
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,830
we'll fire from above

471
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,510
directly at his mansion.

472
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,280
But if we keep fighting like that,

473
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,070
won't all the civilians in the city

474
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,070
be blown to death?

475
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,880
Mr. Gu, you truly have
a compassionate heart.

476
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,150
No one has ever cared about

477
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,030
these civilians anyway.

478
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,960
Mr. Gu, look.

479
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,670
I've only encircled the city
on three sides,

480
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,030
leaving one side open.

481
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,840
We've been digging tunnels under the city
for nearly half a year,

482
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,070
and we've secretly placed
30,000 catties of explosives

483
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,400
beneath the city walls.

484
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,280
Now that our forces
are strong and well-equipped,

485
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,010
we can guarantee victory
in one decisive battle.

486
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,400
Will Li Cheng and his men
be willing to retreat?

487

that the citizens
have even started eating rats,

490
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,510
yet they still stand firm

491
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,120

if he doesn't hold on to the city
for a few more days,

502
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,550
he'd be unworthy of

the official's hat bestowed upon him.

I was totally lacking in perception.

559
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Please punish me, Mr. Gu.

560
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,060
It's too late for that now.

561
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,710
Shut up.

562
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,360
Old Master Hu,

563
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,420
what's this about?

564
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,800
I was totally
lacking in perception before.

565
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,350
Please punish me, Mr. Gu.

566
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,640
This is no empty talk.

567
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,510
I've brought trouble upon everyone.

568
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,710
I caused this trouble alone,

569
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,150
so I should be the one
to bear the consequences.

570
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,280
Even in front of His Highness,

571
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,410
I would say the same.

572
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,360

with such gestures.

begs for your forgiveness.

588
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,760
I cannot accept this, Old Master Hu.

589
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,620
I really can't.

590
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,870
Please get up.

591
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,620
You're even older than my mother.

592
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,100
I cannot possibly accept such a gesture.

please take the seat of honor.

Everyone,

603
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,730
I was arrogant and disrespectful in Anhui

604
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,490
and offended Old Master Hu.
