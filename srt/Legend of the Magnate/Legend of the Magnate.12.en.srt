00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,440
But I'm not going in.

191
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,910
I don't want to be scolded again.

192
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,040
His bad temper isn't

193
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
anything new.

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,560
I remember when I was little,

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
if I couldn't recite the articles,

196
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,630
he would hit my palms,

197
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,200
making my hands swell.

198
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,910
If I have to name someone

199
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,640
in this world

200
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
who makes my legs tremble
just by seeing them,

201
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,810
it would definitely be Mr. Bai.

202
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,390
You got off easy.

203
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
Back in my day,

204
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,030
he hit my hands

205
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,750
and twisted my ears,
which ended up like Buddha's long ears.

206
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,160
That was what you get
for not studying hard.

207
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,220
If you were like me,

208
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
reciting articles well,

209
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,720
you could even stay
for dinner at his house.

210
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,440
If I had Miss Bai

211
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
studying with me,

212
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,700
I would have done better than you.

213
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,000
Well,

214
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,020
how is Yimei doing?

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,790
Has she

216
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,370
gotten married already?

217
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,200
No.

218
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
I know.

219
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,080
I made her

220
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,490
wait for me all these years.

221
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,800
She's suffered.

222
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,630
So,

223
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
first thing tomorrow morning,

224
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,610
I'll go visit Mr. Bai

225
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,440
and apologize to him in person.

226
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,630
Whether he beats me up

227
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,670
or scolds me,

228
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,040
at least it makes me feel better inside.

229
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,820
By the way,

230
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,960
on my way back,

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,120
I saw some burned tea plants

232
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,380
in the tea plantation.

233
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,340
What happened?

234
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,840
Tell him.

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
Otherwise, your brother

236
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,200
won't eat

237
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
or sleep well.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Last month,

239
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,910
soldiers fought a battle here.

240
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,630
So the tea plantation was burned.

241
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,080
Qimen was besieged, too.

242
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
And Miss Bai was taken away

243
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
by the southern army.

244
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,070
In the whole village,

245
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
except for little girls and elderly women,

246
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
all women who could work were

247
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,910
taken away.

248
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,320
They said
it was to look after wounded soldiers

249
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,510
and do laundry.

250
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,670
They promised to release them in 10 days,

251
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,070
but it's been a month now.

252
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,750
These days,
people in the village are saying

253
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,080
that we should select someone

254
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,540
to go demand their return.

255
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,140
But we can't get in.

256
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,770
We would be driven away at the gate.

257
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
They have all kinds of weapons,

258
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,480
like swords, guns, spears, and axes.

259
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,410
Are we throwing ourselves at them?

260
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,410
Do you know which army it is?

261
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,109
It's said to be
the Resistance Army from Guangxi.

262
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,170
They're led by a general surnamed Li.

263
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,750
He's quite formidable.

264
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,950
They're even planning to attack Hefei.

265
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
So, when is our village

266
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
planning to ask for our people back?

267
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
I already told you.

268
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,270
We can't get through the camp entrance.

269
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,680
Who would dare to force their way in?

270
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,410
No one dares.

271
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,990
Yimei has been captured.

272
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,070
Then Mr. Bai...

273
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,160
Pingyuan,

274
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,670
you should go see him tomorrow.

275
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,280
All these years, it's been Pingwen

276
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,030
delivering firewood and water

277
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,830
to their home.

278
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,970
Yimei's life hanging by a thread,

279
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,180
Mr. Bai must be

280
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
as worried as I used to be.

281
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,960
Mother,

282
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,510
don't think too much.

283
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,710
Let's enjoy our meal.

284
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,790
Now that I'm back,

285
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,950
I won't be away for so long again.

286
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,830
This war will eventually

287
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,030
come to an end one day.

288
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
And I think that day will soon come.

289
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,090
Once the war is over,

290
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,270
Pingwen and I will

291
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,730
fix up the tea plantation.

292
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,610
We'll continue selling our tea,

293
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,870
run our business well,

294
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,050
and live a good life.

295
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,640
Mother,

296
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,140
don't worry too much.

297
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,510
Your health comes first.

298
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,120
Our good days are yet to come.

299
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't fall ill or get into trouble.

300
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,550
I once heard

301
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,440
these words in my dreams.

302
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,030
Now I can hear you say them in person.

303
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,950
Even if I were to die right now,

304
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,080
it would be worth it.

305
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,720
Pingyuan,

306
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,470
I don't remember seeing you
carry a shoulder pole before.

307
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,930
You're doing pretty well.

308
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,030
I used to think of myself as a scholar.

309
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,520
Why would I need to carry firewood?

310
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,780
But later in Ningguta,

311
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,880
I hunted tigers in the mountains

312
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,350
and panned for gold in the rivers.

313
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,160
Carrying a shoulder pole?

314
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,420
That's a piece of cake.

315
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,440
Mr. Bai,

316
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,130
I, Pingwen, am here

317
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,510
to bring you water and firewood.

318
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Carrying water and delivering firewood are

319
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,070
two jobs.

320
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,920
What do you mean
by "bring you water and firewood"?

321
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Do you have multiple heads and arms?

322
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,310
Did you hear that, Pingyuan?

323
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,350
How nitpicky he is.

324
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,890
This isn't nitpicking.

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,130
Incorrect names lead to discrepancies
between words and truths.

326
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,720
And with these discrepancies,
things won't make sense.

327
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,010
If things won't make sense,
nothing can be accomplished.

328
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,200
Didn't I teach you this

329
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,640
when you were a student?

330
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Mr. Bai,

331
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,850
I-I'll be going now.

332
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,070

Good.

Get up now.

354

Mr. Bai,

355
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,920
your place hasn't changed at all.

356
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,720
That's great.

357
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,880
What's so good about it?

358
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,310
I remember back then,

359
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,840
seeing that I was too small,

360
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,340
you let me sit in the front.

361
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,210
Right here.

362
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,310
At that time, my feet

363
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,110
couldn't even touch the ground.

364
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,070
You squatted

365

by my wall to eavesdrop every day,

and even snored.

368
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
I kept wondering

369
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,920
if my teaching was really that boring.

370
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
The sunshine was so comfortable back then.

371
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,510
Once I basked in the sun,

372
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,970
I'd fall asleep in no time.

373
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,710
Did you come back yesterday?

to come visit you early this morning.

378
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,640
Is your mother feeling better?

379
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,510
Last night, when she saw me

380
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,830
and we talked for a while,

381
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,630
her eyes seemed to light up a bit.

382
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,720
I've failed to be

383
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,460
a good son all these years.

384
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Someone set you up
in the examination site.

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,060
Guess it was a tribulation
you were destined to suffer.

386
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,570
Being back today is

387
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,640
a blessing in and of itself.

388
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,400
Mr. Bai,

389
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,370
please don't sigh.

390
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,760
I heard

391
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,070
that Yimei was taken away, right?

392
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,680
All the women in the village

393
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,880
have been taken away.

394
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
I think they're probably

395
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,270
being made to do sewing and washing work.

396
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,110
Isn't the village just

397
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,240
looking for a representative

398
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,200
to go to the camp
and ask for their return?

399
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,480
I think I can go.

400
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,980
A scholar can't talk sense

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,640
into soldiers.

402
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,030
Don't go.

403
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,370
We should choose a smooth talker.

404
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,580
Mr. Bai,

405
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm no longer a scholar.

406
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,650
My academic title was revoked.

407
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,240
Now I've got a way

408
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,680
with words.

409
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,790
Trust me.

410
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,550
These past few years,

411
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
you've indeed grown a lot.

412
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,790
Once I bring Yimei back,

413
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,250
I'll marry her right away.

414
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Last night with my mother,

415
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,300
I said these words.

416
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,830
Today, facing you, Mr. Bai,

417
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,960
I say the same thing.

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,550
Mr. Bai,

419
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,350
you must take good care of yourself.

420
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,680
I still need to take good care of you
as my father-in-law.

421
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,270
If this comes true,

422
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,640
I'd be such a lucky man
in my twilight years!

423
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,110
I have a good student,

424
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,090
an excellent son-in-law,
to bring me joy by my side.

425
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,400
How wonderful.

426
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,610
What a joy.

427
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,240
Pingwen.

428
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,750
Is there any place nearby
that sells hemp ropes?

429
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,310
Hemp ropes? We have some at home.

430
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,760
No, I mean the big kind.

431
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,820
In large bundles. The thick type.

432
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,180
Those villages down there all grow hemp.

433
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,640
You could go look for them.

434
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,210
How much do you want to buy?

435
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
About 400 or 500 taels worth.

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
400 or 500 taels?

437
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,270
That's about several warehouses of hemp!

438
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,800
Exactly.

439
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,000
Is that possible?

440
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
Stop bragging, okay?

441
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,880
Even if you have people
from several villages

442
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,000
twist ropes with you

443
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,680
for three years,

444
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,240
you still can't make

445
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,840
ropes worth 400 or 500 taels.

446
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,830
A quick question for you.

447
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,590
Would you like to learn

448
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,850
to do business from me?

449
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,270
I'd like to.

450
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,540
But I only know how to grow tea.

451
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,280
Well then,

452
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,480
from now on,

453
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,680
I'll be your teacher.

454
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,960
Observe carefully when you're with me,

455
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,720
listen closely,

456
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,290
and ask me privately
about anything you don't get.

457
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,890
Remember,

458
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,450
never question

459
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,610
any of my decisions in front of others.

460
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,750
Alright. Have a safe trip, sir.

461
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,480
These are the last two baskets.

462
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,480
How do I look?

463
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,480
Why did you grab

464
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,270
Li's glasses?

465
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,070
I paid!

466
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,450
They'll come in handy.

467
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:53,910
Let's go

468
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,170
sell hemp ropes.

469
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,160
[The Military Camp of Li Cheng,
Resistance Army]

470
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,380
Stop there!

471
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,240
Where do you think you're trespassing?

472
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,720
Go back!

473
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,400
Go back?

474
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,580
What about my cartload of goods?

475
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,360
Take your things and get lost.

476
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,420
No outsiders are allowed
into the military camp.

477
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,550
Don't you know that?

478
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,510
Young man,

479
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,130
may I have your name?

480
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,070
So when Li Cheng asks me about it,

481
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,030
I can tell him

482
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,880
who drove me away.

483
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,590
If you don't make yourself clear,

484
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,050
how can we let you in?

485
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,270
Our general's orders are

486
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,260
very strict.

487
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,970
Let me tell you.

488
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,960
This cartload of goods is urgent supplies

489
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,830
for your naval forces,

490
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,270
not easy to get these days.

491
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,640
Not letting me in, right?

492
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,100
Fine, we're leaving.

493
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,060
Wait, wait, wait!

494
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,590
Was it really the General
who asked you to come?

495
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,370
Come on, get up here.

496
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,910
I'll take you inside.

497
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,950
You can ask him yourself, alright?

498
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,350
You may go in by yourself.

499
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,830
Listen,

500
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,490
once you enter the camp,

501
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,790
you must get off the wagon

502
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,640
and don't park anywhere.

503
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
All forms of driving
and horseback riding are

504
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,330
prohibited in the camp.

505
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,900
Pay attention to this.

506
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,720
Yes, sir.

507
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,880
Come on,

508
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,870
clear the way!

509
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,200
There are two people outside

510
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,350
asking to meet the General.

511
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,350
It's these two, right?

512
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,720
Yes.

513
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,870
You may go.

514
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,830
You're the one
looking for our general, huh?

515
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,430
General Li is busy with work.

516
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
Just leave these things

517
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,740
over there and go.

518
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,240
I'll report it to him later.

519
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,200
Go and report

520
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
that his cousin,

521
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,610
Gu Pingyuan, is here.

522
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,790
How impertinent!

523
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,110
No matter how busy he is,

524
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,310
how can he not meet me?

525
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,070
Cousin?

526
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,640
So you claim to be

527
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,300
our general's cousin, right?

528
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,720
Go report to him now!

529
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,400
Alright.

530
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,780
How about this?

531
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,160
You go by yourselves.

532
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,010
See that gate ahead?

533
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,080
Go through it

534
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,160
and then go straight.

535
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
The large tent up front is

536
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,050
our general's headquarters.

537
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,120
Go ahead.

538
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,150
Off you go.

539
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,780
Take it slow in there.

540
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,790
Go ahead.

541
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,000
Li

542
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
leads his troops quite well.

543
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,460
How do you know about leading troops?

544
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,550
Back when I was in Ningguta,

545
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,160
I hung around with the soldiers there

546
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
and learned a bit.

547
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,940
I think you've

548
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,650
picked up other skills, too.

549
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,640
What?

550
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,790
Your smooth talk and lies.

551
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
How could you be

552
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,770
Li Cheng's cousin?

553
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,920
What will you say

554
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,250
when you meet him later?

555
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm just playing it by ear.

556
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,400
How else would we get in without bluffing?

557
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,490
Is General Li Cheng inside?

558
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,360
I, Gu Pingyuan, am seeking an audience.

559
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,600
Is General Li Cheng inside?

560
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,270
I, Gu Pingyuan, am seeking an audience.

561
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,080
Is General Li Cheng inside?

562
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,480
You bluffer.

563
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,240
Cousin?

564
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,770
Take them away.

565
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,580
Do we really

566
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,920
have to besiege Hefei?

567
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,400
The imperial court's army

568
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,390
has already pulled through
the toughest time.

569
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,110
The navy controls
the middle and upper reaches.

570
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,270
Now we still have a chance

571
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,330
to push northward.

572
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,510
If we spend

573
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,510
too much time in Hefei,

574
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,110
it will bring us big trouble!

575
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,240
Do you still remember

576
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,840
the last northern campaign?

577
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,170
Say no more.

578
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,160
We'll follow orders from above.

579
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,550
I'm afraid he only cares

580
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,880
about his Sufu Province

581
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,660
and ignores Tianjing.

582
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,240
Ever since His Lordship passed away,

583
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,440
something feels off.

584
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,690
Forgive me for saying this,

585
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,640
but our situation is deteriorating

586
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,590
day by day.

587
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,730
General,

588
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,460
there's no point

589
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,940
in our staying in Huizhou.

590
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,200
They want us to create a diversion
to support the navy.

591
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,460
With these few troops,

592
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,710
how can we pull it off?

593
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,590
Besides, given Huizhou's low terrain,

594
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,590
we're here just for the imperial court

595
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,050
to have its troops raid us.

596
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,550
With insufficient forces,

597
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,680
a long defense line,

598
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,550
and frequent night attacks from the enemy,

599
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,820
all camps are rattled

600
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,490
in a state of low morale.

601
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,510
Everyone,

602
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,110
you're all my old pals

603
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,910
from Guangxi.

604
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,920
I've joined
the Resistance Army since childhood,

605
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,180
rising from a child soldier to a general.

606
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,510
I clearly remember

607
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,400
that we all swore

608
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,730
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

609
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,030
Since we followed the Heavenly King,

610
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,490
kept our hair, and rose up,

611
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,000
we should know

612
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,510
that this is a war to the death

613
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,710
with no turning back.

614
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,280
Alright,

615
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,920
return to your camps

616
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,550
and stabilize the morale.

617
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,350
Furthermore,

618
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,200
don't let me hear of anyone

619
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
plundering villages again.

620
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,960
Otherwise,

621
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,030
I'll execute them before reporting

622
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,830
with no mercy.

623
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Yes, General.

624
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,440
Who is that general?

625
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,030
You've claimed to be
my general's cousin for a while.

626
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,830
And you don't even know who he is?

627
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,510
General Li!

628
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,450
General Li!

629
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,570
How stupid you are.

630
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,510
Swaggering into our camp so boldly,

631
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,030
you truly have no regard

632
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,530
for those heroic figures.

633
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm just a small merchant.

634
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,850
To seek profits,

635
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I played a trick and accidentally

636
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,740
entered your camp.

637
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,400
Please forgive me, General.

638
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,590
A small merchant?

639
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
You're lying!

640
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,370
Who on earth are you?

641
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,790
Where's my brother?

642
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,480
Your brother?

643
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,550
Your brother is dead because of you.

644
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,480
Your brother...

645
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,590
General Li, you lead the army
in a disciplined way,

646
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,200
and you don't look like someone
who kills innocents.

647
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,060
I just want to make a deal with you.

648
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,530
Will you let me up, please?

649
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,030
Make a deal?

650
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,790
[Li Cheng, General of the Resistance Army]

651
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,670
What deal?

652
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,560
Did you see

653
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,050
my cart full of hemp ropes?

654
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,440
I know your navy

655
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,670
needs a large quantity of hemp ropes

656
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,000
to reinforce the ships.

657
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,230
People in Huizhou

658
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,480
dare not sell any to you.

659
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,540
I can help you purchase what you need.

660
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,080
Does he look like

661
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,909
a spy sent by the imperial court?

662
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,489
Yes, he does.

663
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,190
No, I don't.

664
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,230
I...

665
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,000
About 25 kilometers from here,

666
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
there's Shanjian Village.

667
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,739
You took

668
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,880
all the women here

669
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,020
from that village,

670
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,800
saying that you would

671
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,960
return them in 10 days.

672
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,070
It's been a month now,

673
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,150
and there's been no news at all.

674
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,409
I'm from that village.

675
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
What's your name?

676
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,110
My name is Gu Pingyuan.

677
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,340
I've lived in Shanjian Village
since childhood.

678
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,920
I have a teacher surnamed Bai.

679
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,630
His daughter is called Bai Yimei.

680
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,510
"Mei" as in plum blossom.

681
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,920
She should be in your military camp now.

682
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,719
You can ask her

683
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,670
about me.

684
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,330
Continue with the hemp ropes.

685
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I know you need

686
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,550
a whole lot of hemp ropes.

687
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,630
The people in the village might

688
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,430
not be enough.

689
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,130
All these women can twist ropes.

690
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,110
Letting them back

691
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,640
can work in your favor, too.

692
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,170
I have so many wounded soldiers.

693
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,630
Who will take care of them
if the women leave?

694
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,000
General,

695
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,290
forgive me for being blunt.

696
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,360
You won't be able

697
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,760
to stay here much longer.

698
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,460
Those women are innocent.

699
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,310
I don't want them to die here.

700
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Who told you

701
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,680
that I won't be staying here long?

702
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,550
You've been besieging Hefei

703
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,550
for over 2 months.

704
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,110
Yet you still haven't taken it.

705
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,540
Once the imperial court's troops arrive,

706
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,000
they'll surround you completely.

707
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,460
Watch what you're saying!

708
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,570
General Li,

709
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,240
I just have one question.

710
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,840
Have you already killed

711
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,960
those women who were brought here?

712
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,760
If so,

713
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,530
just give me a straight answer.

714
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,990
So I can go back to the village
with the news.

715
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,080
Untie his feet.

716
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,080
Bring him out.

717
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes, General.

718
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,690
Come on.

719
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,870
Open the door.

720
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,190
See?

721
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,510
In our Resistance Army,

722
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,770
we have separate camps for men and women.

723
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,010
Even married couples
must sleep separately.

724
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,550
We lead our troops differently

725
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,880
from those brutal guys.

726
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
For the poor things in the world,

727
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,400
we treat men like our brothers

728
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,930
and women like our sisters.

729
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,760
Our Resistance Army

730
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,220
will never mistreat them.

731
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,960
See clearly now?

732
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,690
If you do, then just leave.

733
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,550
Get these two brothers

734
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,250
out of the camp.

735
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,980
Understood.

736
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,710
Go.

737
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,320
Go!

738
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,400
Night raid!

739
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,100
Form ranks for battle!

740
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,400
Charge!

741
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,670
Kill them!

742
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,630
Yimei.

743
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,630
Yimei!

744
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,030
Yimei!

745
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,670
Yimei!

746
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,800
Yimei!

747
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Yimei.

748
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,070
Yimei!

749
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,320
Yimei!

750
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,000
Yimei!

751
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,030
Yimei!

752
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,960
Yimei!

753
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,960
Yimei!

754
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,880
Gu!

755
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,070
Gu!

756
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,400
Gu!

757
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,360
Gu!

758
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,030
Gu!

759
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,590
Yimei.

760
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,670
Yimei.

761
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,740
It really is you.

762
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:08,690
Did you get hurt?

763
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,840
[Bai Yimei, Daughter of Bai Shi'an]

764
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,760
Where are the other women
from our village?

765
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,330
They scattered when the firing started.

766
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,950
Quickly, come with me.

767
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,440
No.

768
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,110
These two were wounded by arrows.

769
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,040
They need water every few minutes.

770
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,470
At a time like this, you still...

771
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,800
Then help me first.

772
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,030
Move aside!

773
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,510
Get out of the way!

774
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,510
Move!

775
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,420
Fire!

776
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,680
Pingwen?

777
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,840
Save me!

778
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,590
Help! Help me!

779
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,360
Help!

780
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,790
It's on fire!

781
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,920
Untie them all.

782
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,150
I'll go find the other women.

783
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,670
Okay.

784
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,630
Help me!

785
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,280
Okay.

786
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,470
I'll help you one by one.

787
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Anyone from Shanjian Village?

788
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,190
Is there anyone from Shanjian Village?

789
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,030
Those from Shanjian Village, follow me!

790
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,710
Anyone from Shanjian Village?

791
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,310
Pingyuan!

792
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,400
Pingyuan.

793
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,530
Pingwen.

794
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,450
Yimei is still in the hut.

795
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,320
Let's hurry inside!

796
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,710
Okay.

797
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,230
Yimei!

798
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,030
Yimei!

799
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,320
No time to waste!

800
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,920
Let's run.

801
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,080
Be careful.

802
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,500
Fall back!

803
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,630
Fall back!

804
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
Go back!

805
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,360
Go back!

806
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,590
Fall back!

807
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,920
Back off!

808
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,000
Fall back!

809
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,920
Fall back!

810
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,320
-Back off!
-Go back!

811
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,030
Fall back!

812
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,640
You!

813
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,480
Get back!

814
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,720
Pingyuan! Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

815
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,580
Gu!

816
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,880
Gu!

817
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,110
Let me go!

818
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,320
Let go of me!

819
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,760
What are you waiting for?

820
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,010
There must be a snitch among them!

821
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,130
The General is injured.

822
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,530
Check every one of them!

823
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,420
Si,

824
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,200
go check on the medic now.

825
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,910
I can help.

826
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,320
I know how to treat patients! Let me help!

827
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,380
Don't hurt anyone!

828
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,190
Stop!

829
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,530
Who just spoke?

830
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,320
Me.

831
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,240
It was me.

832
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,920
I beg you.

833
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,720
P-Please don't hurt anyone.

834
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,030
I-I've studied medicine since childhood.

835
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,590
I...
