[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,870
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you know who he is?

4
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,229
He is the greatest warrior
of the Qing Empire,

5
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,200
the commander of the Bao Regiment,

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,789
Bao Qingde.

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,350
He came here specifically

8
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,970
to thank Mr. Gu.

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,640
He deposited all of Pingyao's

10
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,670
allocated funds in Wanyuan Bank.

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,270
Even

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,970
the provincial governor's office
wouldn't dare

13
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,170
ask a single question about that money.

14
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,430
It seems Li Baiwan

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,930
really has

16
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,230
put down roots in Pingyao.

17
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,140
He should thank you three.

18
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,210
Boss!

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,380
That wasn't our intention.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,510
Stop it.

21
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,400
I don't care

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,130
if it was your intention or not.

23
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,190
It was you three

24
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,400
who drove him away.

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,000
And this is the result.

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,190
If you three

27
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,079
still want to stay in this business,

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
go home,

29
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,740
think carefully,

30
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,800
review your accounts thoroughly,

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,860
and then come to me for verification.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,310
If you can explain

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,430
every account clearly,

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
I might be able
to help you think of a way out.

35
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,240
If you can't,

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
then go home

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,630
and be prepare to live a hard life

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,150
with your children.

39
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,630
Like smashing soybeans on a stone slab—

40
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,370
it's a head-on collision.

41
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,430
You two have turned

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
the entire city upside down.

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,540
Not quite upside down.

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,590
We just poked a hole in it.

45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,000
This Mr. Gu

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
does business the way

47
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,030
a general commands troops.

48
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,750
Honestly,

49
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,079
I was really nervous a few days ago.

50
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,630
We spent money renting those warehouses,

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,760
and inside were just

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,520
pots and pans

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,630
and a pile of broken water jars.

54
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,290
It was absolutely killing me.

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,770
You're absolutely right about that.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,110
Gu,

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,280
think about it.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,750
I, Bao,

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,710
risk my life on the battlefield.

60
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,620
If someone

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
chops off

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
my head,

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,820
wouldn't your 1,000 taels

64
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,430
be wasted?

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,000
Say it!

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Be honest with me!

67
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,920
General Bao, someone like you,

68
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,330
wearing a Imperial Yellow Jacket

69
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,630
and carrying a waist sword,

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,490
is worth far more than 1000 taels.

71
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,770
Forgive me for saying this,

72
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,650
but if you were to die for our country,

73
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,390
I could take your

74
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,870
Imperial Yellow Jacket and waist knife

75
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,240
to the Marshal's camp.

76
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,680
Even if I asked

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,430
for two or three thousand taels,

78
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,630
the Marshal would have to buy them back.

79
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,280
Cunning!

80
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,159
Cunning.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Very cunning indeed!

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,360
You two young fellows

83
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,830
are truly something.

84
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,920
I can now say

85
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,930
I've seen true heroes

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,700
and haven't lived in vain!

87
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,050
Do you think...

88
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,920
that by stirring things up

89
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,790
and punching a hole in Pingyao,

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,110
you can get yourself out of trouble now?

91
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,170
Get out of trouble?

92
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,850
As long as my case isn't dismissed,

93
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,750
no matter where I go,

94
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,150
I'll still be a criminal.

95
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,630
If I could

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,830
get those who
got involved because of me out of this,

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,370
I wouldn't mind dying.

98
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,590
Don't talk nonsense.

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,070
If nothing else works,

100
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,670
come back to Beijing with me.

101
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,470
My father may know what to do.

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,800
The name Li Baiwan

103
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,960
isn't just for show.

104
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,320
He knows so many ministers and nobles.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,530
Helping you clear your name

106
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,860
wouldn't be difficult.

107
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,730
At worst...

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,650
At worst, I'd kneel and beg him.

109
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,360
A man's dignity is worth more than gold.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,490
How can you say that?

111
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,120
Doing business with you

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,780
gives me great satisfaction.

113
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,720
If you get caught by the government,

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,980
they'll send you back.

115
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,450
You'd better keep your distance from me.

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
Do you know who I really am?

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,680
Do you know what crimes I've committed?

118
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,150
Everyone who's been close to me

119
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,910
has already been implicated because of me.

120
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,630
We should

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
go our separate ways

122
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,850
from now on.

123
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,430
Actually,

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,190
the reason I stirred you up

125
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,720
to cause so much trouble was

126
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,930
simply so we could use each other.

127
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,280
You could establish yourself in Shanxi,

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,159
and I

129
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,190
could save the people

130
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,120
I wanted to save.

131
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,400
That's all.

132
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,130
As for being friends,

133
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,250
I don't deserve that.

134
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,720
I'll be going now,

135
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,360
Mr. Li Qin.

136
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,120
Gu...

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,240
You're here.

138
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,240
Come.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Sit down.

140
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,310
I came for Mr. Chang.

141
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,700
You want that mansion, right?

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,720
Take it.

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,920
I even brought the deed.

144
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,880
Today,

145
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,260
I also helped you
foil the pawnshop's scheme.

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,790
This deal
can be considered complete, right?

147
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,390
Complete?

148
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,560
Of course it is.

149
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,870
I still have another task for you.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,730
That's not how business works.

151
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,210
How business is done is up to me.

152
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,180
As for Chang Si's house,

153
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,930
I don't want it anymore.

154
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,070
Take back the deed.

155
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,270
Keep it for yourself

156
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,600
or give it to him—

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,040
it's a reward for both of you.

158
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,600
However,

159
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,040
I can't

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,860
release him.

161
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,090
You still need to help me
with something else.

162
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,720
Have you heard of

163
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,240
King Li's treasure?

164
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,370
It is said that after Li Chuang
captured the capital,

165
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,690
he gathered 70 million taels of silver

166
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,580
under the name of redemption funds.

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,309
Later, his army was utterly defeated,

168
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,570
so he abandoned Chang'an

169
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,830
and fled to Hunan and Guangzhou.

170
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,230
When passing through Shanxi,
he was pursued by the Qing army.

171
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,760
To escape,

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,200
he abandoned all this silver

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,610
in a mountain valley.

174
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,470
In that valley,

175
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,530
there were eight households.

176
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,830
Stumbled upon this windfall,

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,520
they began generations
of business from then on.

178
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,810
The Eight Families have stood firm

179
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,410
from the late Ming dynasty to today,

180
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,470
all because

181
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,110
they relied on King Li's Treasure.

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,510
No matter what disasters came,

183
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,950
they could turn misfortune into fortune
with this treasure.

184
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,950
Now I want you to get into
the Eight Families

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,710
and help me find this treasure.

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,320
Look.

187
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,750
Taiyufeng has a new manager.

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,970
He looks quite young.

189
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,850
I heard he is a close confidant
of Mr. Wang

190
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,370
and very capable.

191
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,940
The boss of our bank

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,180

[Taiyufeng General Ledger]

197
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
The manager has checked the ledgers!

198
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,980
Congratulations, Boss!

199

As all streams flow to the sea,

you've acquired the finest talent
in the land.

201

Heizi,

207
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,990
where have you gone to fight?

208
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Didn't Father say

209
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
not to pick fights?

210
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,960
People like me

211
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
can only fight.

212
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,570
I'm not as clever as him.

213
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,310
Who made you angry this time?

214
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,360
Taiyufeng
has a new manager starting today.

215
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,090
Did you know?

216
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,030
I don't go out.

217
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,960
How would I know?

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,300
The new manager

219
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,980
is Gu Pingyuan, the one our father

220
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,580
saved at the risk of his life.

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,570
He's all dressed up and decent,

222
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,320
drinking with the magistrate.

223
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,650
Looking so impressive.

224
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,450
It's true our father saved him.

225
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,970
But he also saved you guys.

226
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,440
He... he is... he...

227
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,120
Can you stop defending him

228
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,850
all the time?

229
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,740
I just feel that

230
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,560
once he got rich, he changed his attitude.

231
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,200
Our father

232
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,260
is still in prison.

233
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,640
Then what do you expect him to do?

234
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,900
Break into the prison?

235
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,670
Heizi,

236
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,720
you wouldn't dare either, right?

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,570
Or should he

238
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,030
stay home and cry with me?

239
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,870
It's not as if I'm short of company.

240
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,630
He's a good guy.

241
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,090
He's great. He's the best.

242
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,120

243
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,030
like a big shot,

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,000
while our father
spent his whole life helping others

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
and is now sitting in a cell.

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,670
Come with me later to bring him food.

247
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,730

to congratulate you.

Please forgive me.

Mr. Li Qin, a manager

261

who works for Li Baiwan in the capital

262
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
and the head of Wanyuandang.

263
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,610

since we have such a distinguished guest,

266
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,540
shouldn't you introduce him to us?

267
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,150
This is the head of Wanyuandang,

268
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,790
Mr. Li Qin.

269
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,610

272

I've long admired you.

273
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,250
You flatter me.

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,960
I am Wang Tiangui,

275
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,250
and I'm not that old.

276
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,860
What a decent young man.

277
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,210
I heard you're the young man

278
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,840
who drove my pawnshop and draft bank

279
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,760
into the red

280
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,000
and thrown

284
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,340
look around.

285
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,360
See how these people can hardly wait

286
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,600
to eat you alive?

287
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,240
Mr. Wang,

288
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,680
I wouldn't dare.

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,470
I only seek a place to stand.

290
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,400
I came here
as a student to learn the trade.

291
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,020

292
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Very well.

293

those little tricks—

299
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,330
you'd better stop them, right?

300
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,240
Of course.

301
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,480
I apologize if I've offended you.

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
Please forgive me.

303

From now on,

304
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,510
I will listen to Mr. Wang

305
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,680
and put an end

306
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,090
to all those antics.

307
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,460
Enjoy.

Something interesting happened recently.

310

Dozens of appraisers have come to Pingyao.

311
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,350
What do you think they're here for?

312
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
Dozens of appraisers and managers

313
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
suddenly came to Pingyao,

314
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,200
this small county.

315
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,080

316

Ms. Su, the one close to you,

317
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,470
is behind it.

319
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,790

Everyone present

322
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,420
is among the most senior

323

324
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,580
and draft bank managers in Shanxi.

325
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,600
You rarely step out of your doors.

326
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,410
A toast to you.

327
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,240
Why are my family in Nanjing?

328
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,480
What's going on here?

329
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,350
Really?

330
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,770
What's written on yours?

331
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,360
When I left home,

332
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,480
everything was fine.

333
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Really?

334
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,590
-Yeah.
-What happened?

335
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,580
Who did this?

336
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,460
I've paid you well

337
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,820
to come.

338
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,190
If you want to know how big this deal is—

339
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,750
well,

340
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,270
it's a big one.

341
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,790
In business,

342
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,890
some pursue wealth,

343
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,200
some pursue fame.

344
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,520
I pursue the country.

345

I come from the south.

346
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,320

None of you in this room

348
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,020
can escape

349
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,510
the charge of

350
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,660
colluding with the enemy.

351
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,640
Here.

352
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,030
Here's to

353
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,310
this accusation.

354
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,700
Let's drink together.

355
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,790
Bro,

356
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,350
this woman is not simple.

357
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,680
Stay away from her.

358
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,170
Otherwise,

359
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,730
it could bring disaster
to your whole family.

360
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,190
I've wanted to tell my father
the same thing,

361
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,480
but he won't listen.

362
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,580
What about you?

363
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,830
What about me?

364
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,200
You're now

365
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,560
the manager of Taiyufeng—

366
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,200
[Taiyufeng]

367
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,750
a position so many envy.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,310
Apart from the Eight Families in Hedong,

369
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,830
the most powerful in this region

370
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,420
is your Mr. Wang.

371
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
So now that you've taken this post,

372
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,510
are you going to follow its rules

373
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,440
and start opposing me

374
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
from now on?

375
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,730
I'm just playing along,

376
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,750
nothing more.

377
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,960
Why don't you

378
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,860
just resign your position

379
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,720
and come work at my Wanyuandang?

380
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,640
Or I could write to my father

381
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
and have the charges against you dropped.

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Anyway, as long as you

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,270
remain manager here for a day,

384
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,870
I won't feel at ease for a day.

385
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,110
Wanyuandang

386
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,510
doesn't want an enemy like you.

387
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,270
I also don't want

388
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,270
an enemy like you.

389
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,690
I appreciate your kind offer.

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
But right now,

391
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,750
I still have some unfinished business.

392
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,510
If one day
I find myself with nowhere to turn,

393
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,040
don't forget what you said.

394
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
The country is divided in two,

395
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,070
and the Resistance Army
already controls half.

396
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,070
Jiangnan is the wealthiest region,

397
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,030
but after years of war

398
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,040
and all its ups and downs,

399
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,960
even the banks and pawnshops in Nanjing

400
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,200
are completely gone.

401
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
And there's Zhejiang,

402
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,640
Suzhou, Yangzhou,

403
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,830
Zhenjiang, Ningbo—

404
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,310
which of these places

405
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,810
wasn't rolling in wealth?

406
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,310
Now they're all barren.

407
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,590
The Resistance Army intends

408
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,160
to reorganize Jiangnan's finances

409
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,620
and get commerce flowing,

410
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,440
but many of those skilled
in running draft banks and pawnshops

411
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,310
have either died or fled.

412
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,400
For a time, we couldn't find many of them.

413
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,070
That's why I invited you here.

414
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,830
Those of you who are willing to go south

415
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,000
to make a living—

416
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,790
I can help

417
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,210
send your families to Nanjing

418
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,920
and settle them properly

419
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,180
with absolute safety.

420
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,900
Once you're there,

421
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,600
you can choose good shops

422
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,080
and capable assistants,

423
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,620
reopen the banks,
and run your own business.

424
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,790
The initial funds
will be provided by the Resistance Army.

425
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,400
And your descendants
can take the imperial exams

426
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,920
and become officials in the south.

427
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,070
Those who do well

428
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,900
might even earn a noble title.

429
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,150
That makes some sense.

430
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,850
In these turbulent times,

431
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,440
could such a good opportunity
really exist?

432
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,480
If it's true...

433
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,010
I guarantee you

434
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,570
that within 3 years,

435
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,680
money will be flowing in the south.

436
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,890
After 3 years,

437
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,930
if you want to stay in the south,
you can stay,

438
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,510
and if you want to come back,

439
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,700
I can make that

440
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,510
happen too.

441
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,040
[Li Mansion]

442
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
Why didn't you tell me about

443
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,720
such a major matter
as the allocated funds?

444
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,550
I only just received the news.

445
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,680
General Bao Qingde

446
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,400
has given all the allocated funds
of Pingyao

447
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,030
to Young Master's bank—

448
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,490
millions of taels of military funds
every year.

449
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,350
Those draft banks in Pingyao

450
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,230
are absolutely jealous.

451
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,630
This kid.

452
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,960
He only focuses on business

453
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,020
without leaving himself any way out.

454
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,240
You yourself said

455
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,480
that no one in this world
gives way to others.

456
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,500
Whether it's storefront pawning,

457
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,350
door-to-door pawning,

458
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,480
or clergy-oriented pawning,

459
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,610
without such a reputation,

460
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,480
how could anyone land a deal like this?

461
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,080
In ancient times, a man offered

462
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,720
1000 gold coins
to buy a horse's corpse to show sincerity.

463
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
In less than a month, Young Master

464
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
achieved so much.

465
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,180
You should praise him.

466
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,440
Praise him?

467
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,550
This is a victorious start.

468
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,480
Don't you think?

469
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,110
That's true.

470
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,750
He hasn't been in Shanxi long

471
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,110
and has already made such a breakthrough.

472
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,440
It's truly remarkable.

473
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,040
Can I say this

474
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,550
to Young Master?

475
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,490
Don't praise your own people.

476
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,330
Any other news from Shanxi?

477
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,680
Young Master wrote that that Gu fellow

478
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
has already returned to the pawnshop.

479
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,730
They've each settled
in their positions now.

480
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,400
How should we

481
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,830
reply to Young Master?

482
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,460
Write back and tell him

483
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,180
that friends in business

484
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,070
are the least trustworthy people

485
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,250
in the world.

486
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,000
Boss.

487
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,820
Forgive me.

488
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,830
How does it feel to be

489
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,310
the manager of Taiyufeng?

490
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,070
My position is precarious.

491
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,350
I just perform whatever role

492
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,510
you assign me.

493
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,110
Are you

494
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,110
interested in Chang Si's daughter?

495
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,270
How could you say that?

496
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,160
What's my status now?

497
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,270
And what's hers?

498
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,670
How could I be interested in her?

499
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,880
It doesn't matter if you are.

500
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,160
You're now

501
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,750
the manager of Taiyufeng.

502
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,830
You can afford to spend lavishly.

503
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,720
I'll give you wealth and honor.

504
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,160
Do you want it?

505
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,400
You know where I came from.

506
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,960
The people locked up there

507
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,160
are all men of wealth.

508
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,950
That taught me one thing:

509
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
in this world,

510
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,310
nothing matters

511
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,680
more than staying safe.

512
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,200
In 10 days,

513
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,830
representatives of the Eight Families
will gather at Jinyang Villa.

514
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,160
Among these Eight Families

515
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,830
is the Kang family.

516
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,110
They lost His Highness's
military supplies.

517
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,190
The imperial court is furious.

518
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,860
This time they will definitely
punish them.

519
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,510
The Kang family

520
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,680
has been in bodyguard business
for generations

521
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,310
and is very wealthy,

522
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,110
but now

523
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,480
they have no choice
but to sell off their property.

524
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,440
Do you think they're selling property?

525
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,040
What they're selling is their family name.

526
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,880
I understand what you mean.

527
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,480
You want to go all in—

528
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,290
buy out the Kang family,

529
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,700
enter the Eight Families,

530
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,160
and get your share

531
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,530
of King Li's Treasure.

532
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,320
But even if you know

533
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,960
where the treasure is,

534
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,040
what could you possibly do?

535
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,440
After all, that treasure

536
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,970
is jointly controlled
by the Eight Families.

537
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,790
People say you're a nerd,

538
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,780
and you really are.

539
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,180
What is money?

540
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,610
A small amount of money
can reach the gods,

541
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,030
and a vast amount

542
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,710
is the god itself!

543
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,310
Ms. Yu'er.

544
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,880
Where are you going?

545
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
Don't touch me.

546
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
It's getting cold.

547
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,450
Put it on.

548
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,880
Did my clothing offend you?

549
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,960
You look quite pleased with yourself.

550
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,560
I haven't seen you in so long.

551
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,400
Mr. Chang is in jail.

552
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm worried too.

553
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
But what good would it do
for me to go back?

554
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,020
Should I cry with you face to face?

555
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,310
But you still didn't come,

556
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,610
leaving me there guessing alone.

557
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,590
Heizi—

558
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,450
you know him.

559
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,410
He never thinks before he speaks.

560
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,900
You look drunk,

561
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,590
not at all like someone about to cry.

562
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,830
What?

563
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,960
In your eyes,

564
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,240
am I someone who only cares about wealth?

565
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,640
You think I want to be in a foreign place?

566
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,590
You think I want to be this

567
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,720
puppet manager?

568
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,480
How is Pingyao a foreign place?

569
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,960
I was born here.

570
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,350
I...

571
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,000
I mean...

572
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
my home is in Huizhou,

573
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,180
and now I can't go back.

574
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,930
So I can't fulfill my filial duty
to my mother.

575
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,830
So for me, Pingyao

576
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,200
is indeed a foreign place.

577
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
You're always so clever with words.

578
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,180
Anyway, nothing I say seems right.

579
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,030
You're driving me crazy.

580
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,550
My father is sick,

581
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,270
sometimes better, sometimes worse.

582
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,250
He lives there without sunlight.

583
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,920
Though he's treated
better than other convicts,

584
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,270
it's still a prison.

585
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,740
I told him to rest well,

586
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,470
yet he asks about you every day.

587
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,960
How am I supposed to answer that?

588
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,820
Tell him you're a big manager now,

589
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,400
dressing all fancy every day

590
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,150
and wearing a big black cloak?

591
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,640
Just tell Mr. Chang that.

592
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
See if he believes it.

593
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,320
As for you,

594
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,480
don't keep listening to all that gossip.

595
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,920
It's all just for show.

596
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,270
Only a fool would believe it.

597
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,070
I'm not a fool.

598
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,940
Although I said that to you,

599
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,400
I don't really believe it.

600
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,960
I told Heizi

601
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,750
that if you were a person chasing wealth,

602
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,680
you would have stayed on the grasslands.

603
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,270
I...

604
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,270
I'm just anxious.

605
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,160
Alright.

606
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,080
Stop talking nonsense.

607
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,770
Didn't I tell you last time?

608
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,550
Wang Tiangui asked me

609
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,030
to complete two tasks for him.

610
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,760
Only when they're done
will he release Mr. Chang.

611
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
Someone's upstairs.

612
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,590
You keep saying the same thing
over and over.

613
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,060
Get lost, Gu!

614
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,240
What?

615
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,590
It's so cold today.

616
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,310
Keep it for yourself

617
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,770
so you can live a long life!

618
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,820
You ungrateful thing!

619
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,790
Get lost!

620
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,030
This was given to me by a Russian.

621
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,960
This...

622
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,070
This... this...

623
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,310
What's with all this stammering?

624
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,200
You, a young master, have no clue

625
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,590
about doing a thief's job.

626
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,790
Someone's been sitting here for ages,

627
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,410
and you didn't even notice.

628
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,540
I wasn't born to be a thief.

629
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,030
I'm just curious.

630
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,350
Curious?

631
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,890
What do you want to know?

632
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
Was it you who sent those dozens of people

633
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,240
over there?

634
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,890
To the south of the Yangtze River?

635
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,590
You really are a rebel?

636
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,290
Didn't you already know that? Why ask?

637
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,280
And my father still listens to you?

638
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,480
Doesn't he know that dealing with

639
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,920
someone like you

640
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,680
could get our whole family executed?

641
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,830
Well said.

642
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,880
You truly are a filial son.

643
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,270
Shouldn't you ask your father

644
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,880
why he listens to me?

645
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,750
Why are you here interrogating me?

646
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,350
Yes.

647
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,880
Of course I'll ask him.

648
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,730
But I want to ask you first.

649
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,160
You must know the reason.

650
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,240
Of course I do.

651
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,400
But your father

652
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,660
told me not to tell you.

653
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,640
He said you're just a child.

654
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,280
You want to know

655
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,970
why I came to Pingyao with you?

656
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Now you know.

657
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,350
I have my own business.

658
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,650
You should

659
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
just do your job as the young master.

660
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
Don't cause trouble.

661
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,540
Before we left, I told your father

662
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,610
it didn't matter
whether you could make a profit or not.

663
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,200
If you lose, just see it as a joke.

664
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,690
The bigger the joke,

665
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,790
the better it works as a cover for me.

666
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,630
No wonder.

667
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,830
Of course.

668
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,790
If it weren't for you
stirring things up here

669
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,790
and drawing everyone's attention,

670
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,160
gathering all those people

671
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,090
would have made me too suspicious.

672
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,960
Come to think of it,

673
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,690
you made a great contribution.

674
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,240
If we get a chance to go to the south,

675
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,370
I'll make sure to reward you properly.

676
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,400
You've finished your business.

677
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,310
Now leave.

678
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,590
My father is extremely wealthy.

679
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,160
Even if he owed you any favors,

680
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
they should be repaid by now.

681
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,240
Go.

682
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,310
You're quite amusing, kid.

683
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,360
There's no way
I'd ever let your father go—

684
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,400
and now I won't let you go either.

685
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,310
You really think
I wouldn't dare pull the trigger?

686
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,680
If you're going to do it,

687
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,880
at least choose something that works.

688
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,150
This is a gift from my friend.

689
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,570
It's never been loaded.

690
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,160
Every time I play with it,

691
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,750
I polish it carefully for hours.

692
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,480
Put it away.

693
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,530
You're holding it so carelessly.

694
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,770
Aren't you afraid it'll hurt my heart?

695
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,530
Put it back.

696
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,460
You just won't listen.

697
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,350
Seriously.

698
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,040
You've gotten it all dirty.

699
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,090
There's no bullets in it.
Who are you trying to scare?

700
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,720
Next time you enter my room,

701
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,380
I'll put a bullet in your head.

702
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,400
Get out.

703
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,480
Stop.

704
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,790
Tomorrow, bring more men

705
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,830
and get the carriages and horses ready.

706
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,490
We're going to Jinyang Villa.

707
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
The Kang family
of the Eight Families of Hedong

708
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,750
is selling their property.

709
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,150
I'm determined to get it.

710
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,100
And tell your friend

711
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,830
that if he doesn't want to be
sent back to Ningguta,

712
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,890
he'd better not cause trouble for me.

713
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,950
[Jinyang Villa]

714
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,200
Excuse me, are First Master Jin
and First Madam Jin

715
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,790
at home?

716
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm the manager of Taiyufeng.

717
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,310
My name is Gu Pingyuan.

718
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,460
This is my calling card.

719
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,870
[The Eight Families of Hedong,
First Madam Jin]

720
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,260
The manager of Taiyufeng is so young.

721
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
That old dog Wang Tiangui

722
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,880
must be blind.

723
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,680
Could you please deliver my card?

724
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,200
I am First Madam Jin.

725
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,340
Come in.

726
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,550
I've heard so much about you.

727
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,950
It's an honor seeing you.

728
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,590
Manager Gu,

729
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,060
please have a seat.

730
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,160
I'll attend to my husband
while he takes his medicine

731
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,960
and then come back to talk to you.

732
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,080
So you like stones too, Manager Gu?

733
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,190
They have a certain rustic charm.

734
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,670
Do you know

735
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,270
the history of these stones?

736
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,139
They're Taihu stones,

737
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,100
transported from Taihu Lake.

738
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Partly right,

739
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
and partly wrong.

740
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,480
These

741
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,480
were the stones personally chosen
by Emperor Huizong

742
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,139
of the Northern Song Dynasty.

743
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,480
He gathered rare stones
from all over the land

744
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,880
to be shipped back to Bianjing.

745
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,760
But before the boats arrived,

746
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
the dynasty fell.

747
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,920
The boatmen, to save their lives,

748
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,630
dumped all these stones

749
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,670
into the Yangtze River.

750
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,600
And the river
washed over them for hundreds of years.

751
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,790
My husband loves stones too.

752
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,820
He spent five years

753
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,460
having all of them salvaged.

754
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,560
Truly a man of great wealth.

755
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,730
These are national treasures.

756
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,350
National treasures?

757
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,530
If you ask me,

758
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,760
they're nothing but things

759
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,560
that ruin families and nations.

760
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,210
In famine years,

761
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,020
they're not even worth a steamed bun.

762
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,400
Madam,

763
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,530
that's a very insightful view.

764
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,610
Save the flattery.

765
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,600
My husband is in poor health.

766
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,930
Didn't you just see it?

767
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,480
Yes.

768
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,070
I didn't expect he's...

769
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,250
I came at an unfortunate time.

770
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,920
He's been like this since he was young.

771
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,110
He's simply too clever,

772
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,320
too skilled in business,

773
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
and he stole heaven's secrets.

774
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,770
At his age, he's already

775
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,670
like a candle flickering in the wind,

776
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,960
a lamp caught in the rain.

777
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,880
He has no son,

778
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,250
and his siblings are a complete mess.

779
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,210
Everything falls on me alone. Sit.

780
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,160
Please sit down.

781
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,680
Let's talk business.

782
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,150
My boss sent me specifically

783
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,070
to pay respects to everyone
from the Eight Families.

784
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,280
He wishes to use his own funds

785
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
to buy all of the Kang family's property

786
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,070
and help them

787
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,970
survive their present hardship.

788
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,080
What else?

789
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,360
Our boss also said that

790
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,480
the Eight Families of Hedong
have been prominent

791
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,070
in the Qing Empire's business world
for more than 200 years

792
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,280
and have been leaders among merchants
across the country.

793
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,840
He holds your families
in great admiration.

794
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,000
If he can take this opportunity

795
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,460
to buy out the Kang family,

796
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,240
would you be willing to help him

797
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,360
gain a place among the Eight Families?

798
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,760
It would also be a way

799
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,540
to contribute to the country.

800
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,400
Wang Tiangui

801
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,040
would never say such things.

802
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,110
Mr. Gu, you're an educated man.

803
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,040
These are your words, aren't they?

804
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,190
Yes.

805
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,590
It's polite talk,

806
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
but it's also truly what I think.

807
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,360
The Eight Families?

808
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,350
What Eight Families?

809
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,120
We've long been scattered to the winds.

810
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,550
Master Sun
from Sun family in southern Shanxi

811
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,840
and the Li family in northern Shanxi—

812
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,800
they all have more influence

813
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,930
than our Jin family.

814
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,400
But...

815
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,450
Meeting you today

816
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,910
is already a great honor.

817
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,920
Since that's the case,

818
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,320
I won't trouble you further.

Fujian rock tea?

825
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,320
It really is the finest tea in the world.

826
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,020
You know tea?

827
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,280
[Beauty of Spring]

828
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I'm from Huizhou.

829
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,880
I grew up in tea fields.

830
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,340
I've sampled a little with my family.

831
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,460
Since you know tea, you're not a fool.

832
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,280
Let me ask you.

833
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,920
What makes you think

834
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,000
that Taiyufeng can enter the Eight Families
of Hedong

835
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
just by buying the Kang family's property?

836
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,880
Is Wang Tiangui alone

837
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,640
richer than all of us?

838
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,710
Of course not.

839
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,670
The Eight Families of Hedong

840
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,730
have always looked after each other.

841
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Why would we need outsiders
bringing in money?

842
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,530
Wang Tiangui thinks

843
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,330
he can compete with us,

844
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,950
doesn't he?

845
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,800
No, not at all.

846
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,810
Let me ask you another question.

847
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,510
Mr. Li,

848
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,480
I've long admired your reputation.

849
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,410
I came specially today to meet you.

850
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,230
You're the host and I'm the guest.

851
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,630
Would you allow me to say a few words as well?

852
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,530
Go ahead.

853
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,630
As you said,

854
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,960
the Eight Families have always looked after each other.

855
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,920
The other seven families are wealthy beyond measure.

856
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,280
They could easily spare a fraction of their wealth

857
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,920
to cover the deficit the Kang family is facing.

858
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,630
So why has the Kang family

859
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,490
been forced to sell its property?

860
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,070
But anyway,

861
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,550
Taiyufeng

862
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,770
is the wealthiest household in Pingyao.

863
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,230
Even if we join the Eight Families,

864
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,490
at least we wouldn't bring you any shame.

865
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,680
Yet Madam Jin spoke vaguely,

866
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,710
and you turned me away

867
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,840
outright.

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,510
Has our boss

869
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,710
offended you somehow?

870
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,120
Or is there something else

871
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,440
behind all this?

875
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,840
I admire him a little.

876
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,200
How did he manage to get someone like you

877

942
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,560
will definitely strike us hard.

943
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,280
I might as well sell everything

944
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,440
and go home to look after my children and tend the land,

945
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,320
which would be much easier.

946
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,380
Don't you think so?

947
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,550
That makes sense.

948
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,790
You've suffered a lot, Kang.

949
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,710
Here, get up first.

950
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,590
Kang,

951
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,550
this isn't the right way.

952
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,340
Do you think that if you sacrifice your family to ease the trouble,

953
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,470
the imperial court won't suspect you?

954
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,590
Not necessarily.

955
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,550
Can't you see?

956
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Everyone outside

957
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,510
is only after

958
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,910
King Li's Treasure.

959
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,760
Buying the Kang family's property is just an excuse.

960
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,000
Their real goal is to get into the Eight Families

961
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,890
and find out

962
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,110
where the treasure is.

963
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,240
Then let them buy it.

964
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,150
Once they do,

965
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,000
they'll realize

966
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,250
it's not like it seems.
