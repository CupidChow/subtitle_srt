[Legend of the Magnate]

2
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
They all say that these days,

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,229
you've been frequenting the brothels
along the Qinhuai River.

5
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,360
I didn't believe it.

6
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,070
Of course, you shouldn't have believed it.

7
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,930
Did you do that?

8
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
I went for one day.

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,000
If I tell you

10
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,950
I was there on official business,

11
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,150
would you believe me?

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,810
Do you believe it yourself?

13
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,890
It's a bit complicated.

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,430
Yes.

15
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,870
At first, I didn't believe it either,

16
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,950
but then all these people

17
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,760
from the brothels showed up at our home.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,400
I wished there was a crack in the ground

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,729
I could disappear into.

20
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,030
Mother told us not to speak to you.

21
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,680
You know me.

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,150
I'm not that kind of person at all.

23
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,070
They said

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,470
you visited more than 10 brothels
in a row.

25
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,120
I didn't.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,460
You didn't?

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,090
Maybe 5 or 6.

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,400
They said
you were drinking with courtesans

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
until you were completely drunk.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,650
I wasn't.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,710
You weren't?

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,650
I wasn't completely drunk.

33
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,870
They said you wrote an elegiac couplet

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,520
for a famous courtesan who just died.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,079
I didn't.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,800
You didn't?

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,910
His Excellency wrote it.

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,310
You...

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,500
You've made Mother so angry.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,310
She said
you've become a beast with no morals!

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,310
What kind of talk is that?

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,329
How am I a beast?

43
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,630
Can you please listen to my explanation?

44
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,710
When I say I was on official business,

45
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,620
I mean it!

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,840
The way of pen and sword demands

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
a balance between tension and relaxation!

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,329
Besides,

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,590
visiting courtesans

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,320
is a common thing for a real man.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,150
Say that again.

52
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,590
Where did you learn that?

53
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,520
I was confused in my anger.

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,870
The brothel madam said it.

55
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,430
Is that what you

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,230
really think?

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,140
No.

58
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,710
Yu'er,

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
I think I've twisted my back.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,430
Help me up.

61
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,960
Are you trying to murder your own husband?

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,090
You hit way too hard.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,910
I...

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
I didn't push hard. Are you hurt?

65
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,630
Let me see.

66
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,490
Just down here.

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,560
You... You...

68
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,360
You...

69
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,430
You...

70
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,120
Alright, listen to my explanation.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,560
Nanjing is so desolate now.

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,020
I need to revitalize the Qinhuai River
first

73
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,490
to attract merchants.

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,010
These are just tactics.

75
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,079
Why don't you mention that His Excellency

76
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,840
also went there?

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,520
He's even a Neo-Confucian scholar.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
Don't be angry with me.

79
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,400
That's all explained?

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,660
That's all explained.

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,960
What's there to explain?

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,840
-Cheating, huh?
-Blow the light and go to bed.

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Pingyuan.

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
Mother wants you both

85
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,400
to stop arguing.

86
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,710
Pingwen.

87
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,960
Is my bedroom

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,200
a place you can enter whenever you want?

89
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,680
I just came to the rescue.

90
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,150
Mother was afraid you might fight.

91
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,960
Fight?

92
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,930
You think Yu'er is like you?

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
She's understanding.

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,800
Yu'er and I

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,520
couldn't possibly have
any misunderstanding.

96
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,870
Do I need to explain anything to her?

97
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,300
Unlike you who jump at every chance...

98
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,470
You're sleeping outside tonight.

99
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't let Mother think I'm a pushover.

100
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,740
Get out.

101
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,750
No meat today.

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Is Mr. Gu in?

103
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm...

104
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Come in.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,630
I am Sun Er, Acting County Magistrate,

106
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,160
paying my respects to you, Mr. Gu.

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
No need for such formalities

108
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
when we're at home.

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,750
Have you eaten yet?

110
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,270
Join us.

111
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,750
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Gu.

112
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,880
I've already eaten.

113
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,310
Mr. Gu, I'm here for your instructions.

114
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,040
Official business so early in the morning?

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,170
His Excellency said

116
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,800
that he was aware of the gifts

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,840
from the Qinhuai River yesterday,

118
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,240
which are not considered a bribe.

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
He asked you
to accept them without concern.

120
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,750
He'll be responsible

121
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,950
if anything happens.

122
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,680
I was wondering.

123
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,920
I was wondering why last night

124
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,650
so many people came to my house.

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,970
So those gifts

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,730
were meant
for the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

127
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,830
That was the original plan.

128
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,159
But His Excellency said

129
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,680
the Qinhuai River
revitalization initiative

130
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,480
was your idea,

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,159
so he can't accept the gifts.

132
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,000
His Excellency

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
truly has a broad mind

134
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,600
and a noble character.

135
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Mr. Gu, you're incredibly resourceful,

136
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,010
well,

137
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,780
even surpassing Zhuge Liang.

138
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,070
His Excellency

139
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,070
specifically mentioned

140
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,720
that he is a disciple of Confucius,

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,600
and you are

142
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,160
a disciple of Master Guan Zhong.

143
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,290
Please accept them with peace of mind.

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
He's messing with me.

145
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,040
His Excellency

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,190
has prepared the elegiac couplet

147
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,390
for the madam already

148
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,730
and some gifts as well.

149
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,390
Today we'd like you

150
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,870
to represent
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

151
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,560
on a visit to the Qinhuai River.

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,160
Oh, right.

153
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,870
He can't go himself.

154
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,700
So I need your instructions—

155
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,690
shall we go by boat or by sedan chair?

156
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,190
Let's take a boat.

157
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,160
It's more discreet.

158
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,570
Yes.

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,830
I'll be waiting outside

160
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,830
to accompany you.

161
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,160
Good.

162
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,430
Mother, are you still mad at me?

163
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
Do you think your son is the type

164
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,680
who would put on official robes

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,080
and then visit brothels?

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,020
Or is it that

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,460
you're afraid
Yu'er will be taken advantage of?

168
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,550
Mr. Chang.

169
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,240
We have a friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,500
You can't not trust me.

171
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,360
Stop taking Mr. Liao

172
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,740
to practice your inner strength.

173
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,400
Sit down and let me talk to you.

174
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,190
I do trust you.

175
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,690
But Yu'er told me

176
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,240
that last night you said,

177
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,500
"Visiting courtesans

178
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,950
is a common thing for a real man."

179
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,830
I said so many

180
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,120
righteous things last night.

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,430
Why did you only tell Mr. Chang

182
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,380
this one sentence?

183
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,640
Did he really say that?

184
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,240
If you don't speak up,

185
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,900
no one will think you're mute.

186
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,990
A grown son makes his own decisions.

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,660
No, Mother,

188
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,850
you talk, and I'll listen.

189
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,290
Although you don't hold
any official position,

190
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,240
we are now

191
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,430
staying at
the Viceroy of Liangjiang's post station.

192
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,510
All of this is true.

193
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,230
I don't know many characters,

194
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,409
but I've lived long enough

195
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,870
to have learned

196
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,320
a thing or two about life.

197
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,840
Look at the opera stage.

198
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,800
Those little spirits and soldiers

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,950
doing somersaults and handstands

200
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,080
put on a lively show.

201
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,240
But look again,

202
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,860
the emperor,

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,830
the prime minister,

204
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,490
and the generals on stage.

205
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,480
Which one of them is doing somersaults

206
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
or handstands?

207
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,940
There's a principle here.

208
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,520
What clothes you wear

209
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,750
and what position you hold

210
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,560
determine what you should do.

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,830
If you can't understand
even this basic point,

212
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,030
you seem not to value your life anymore.

213
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,270
Yes.

214
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,830
You're right.

215
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,950
I know.

216
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,480
You're not a fool.

217
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,070
You wouldn't start drinking
and visiting brothels

218
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,930
as soon as you set foot in Nanjing.

219
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,370
I don't believe it.

220
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,290
Yu'er doesn't believe it either.

221
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,630
What do the viceroys

222
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,330
want from you?

223
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,320
What do they see in you?

224
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,120
Simply that you have no backing,

225
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,370
and you have talent.

226
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
So they can use you as their tool.

227
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,890
But they are real high officials.

228
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,870
Even if you help them make Nanjing

229
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,790
prosperous and magnificent,

230
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
if just one person says

231
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,840
that they, as high officials,

232
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,330
drink and visit brothels,

233
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,640
and if the emperor blames them,

234
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,360
they'll need to find a scapegoat

235
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,510
to deal with the situation.

236
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,110
Which scapegoat do you think

237
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,880
would be the most suitable one?

238
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,100
Then that would be so despicable of them.

239
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,470
Pingyuan,

240
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,800
I'll just say one thing.

241
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,120
Your mother's wisdom far exceeds yours.

242
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,790
Last night,

243
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,900
Mr. Chang and I couldn't sleep at all.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,540
We were tossing and turning in bed,

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,030
trying to figure out
how to get you out of this mess.

246
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,720
I know.

247
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,370
You want to save the world,

248
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,760
but you can't even save yourself.

249
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,630
Who do you think you can possibly save?

250
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,230
You've dragged us into this.

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,580
You've made your mother sick with worry.

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
Aren't these your fault?

253
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,580
I didn't think it through.

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,260
Mother, you're right.

255
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
You always

256
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
rush headlong into things,

257
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,570
with that stubborn personality of yours.

258
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,950
If you harm yourself,

259
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,480
you'll end up dragging Yu'er

260
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,340
down with you.

261
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,710
How could I bear that?

262
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,900
Mother,

263
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,380
you're so farsighted.

264
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,120
You

265
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,210
don't need to be so modest.

266
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,270
Such a brilliant plan

267
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,670
is something

268
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,090
few people in this world could devise.

269
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,200
However, these tactics

270
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,910
may work in business,

271
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,380
but in the official circles,

272
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,200
they're far too dangerous.

273
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,120
You are

274
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,510
too conspicuous.

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,120
As they say, the nail that sticks out
gets hammered down.

276
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,660
When the time truly comes

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
for execution,

278
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
exile, or confiscation of property,

279
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,330
it will be too late for regrets.

280
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,390
Stop frightening him.

281
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,530
Go about your business.

282
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,910
Be it beheading, exile,
or property confiscation,

283
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,840
I'll be with you.

284
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,910
If you restrict him

285
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,840
from making any move,

286
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,750
he'll just stay at home every day

287
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,600
watching me embroider.

288
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,530
I won't stand it.

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,350
It's a good thing

290
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,480
he knows now.

291
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,160
[Liangjiang Viceroy's Office]

292
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,200
These are banknotes
from the Four Major Banks.

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,460
They have no markings.

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,670
Each is worth 10,000 taels.

295
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,200
They can be cashed anywhere.

296
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,580
200,000 taels in total.

297
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,200
Please accept them.

298
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,700
My good nephew,

299
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,490
this money

300
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,360
is truly a great help to me.

301
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,610
This money is nothing.

302
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,870
If it can solve

303
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,390
your urgent problem,

304
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,600
I will feel much relieved.

305
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,720
And my matter

306
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,210
will naturally be easier to resolve.

307
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,750
Today, I've received
from benevolent merchant Li Qin

308
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,720
a donation of

309
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,480
200,000 taels of silver.

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,660
This is the receipt
from the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

311
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,000
[Donated by Jiangning]

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,460
It bears my official seal.

313
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,390
When I report to His Highness,

314
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,040
there will surely be imperial rewards.

315
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,670
For rebuilding Nanjing,

316
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,960
all merchants who donate

317
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,630
will have their names
carved on stone tablets

318
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,150
placed at the entrance
of the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

319
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,050
This is an enormous merit indeed.

320
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,880
Uncle,

321
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,910
my father instructed

322
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,910
that no receipt
is necessary for this money.

323
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,700
No, no.

324
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,670
This is money for Nanjing.

325
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,770
Uncle,

326
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,930
you truly are

327
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,440
the renowned Neo-Confucian master,

328
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,900
as clean and pure as water,

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
with impeccable integrity.

330
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,070
I admire you greatly.

331
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,510
As clean and pure as water,

332
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,110
with impeccable integrity?

333
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,720
I'm not so sure.

334
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,290
When you say these things,

335
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,080
you must mean what you say.

336
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,670
I speak these words

337
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,810
not to flatter you.

338
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,410
I hope you understand.

339
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,130
A few days ago,

340
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,120
I heard you went with that brother

341
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
of mine, surnamed Gu,

342
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,840
to drink by the Qinhuai River.

343
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,270
You've devoted your life
to Neo-Confucianism,

344
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,270
yet could tarnish your reputation.

345
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,850
I'm sure the imperial court

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,600
will understand your difficulties.

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,050
I never expected

348
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,600
that Li Million would have

349
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
such a fine son.

350
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,150
I'm truly envious.

351
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,210
You're certainly no ordinary person.

352
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,390
You've seen these little schemes of mine

353
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,280
through quite clearly.

354
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,170
Not at all.

355
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,790
Uncle, you are half a sage.

356
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,600
Until death,

357
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,690
I must practice virtue with caution.

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,670
Do you think

359
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,720
being a sage is so easy?

360
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,200
I understand.

361
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm very cautious myself.

362
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,320
About my matter...

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
In Nanjing now,

364
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,720
nothing can be done.

365
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
The army can't be disbanded.

366
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,740
The soldiers become disgruntled,

367
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
and discipline breaks down.

368
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,620
If trouble breaks out someday,

369
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,180
that would be disastrous.

370
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,550
Years of hard work

371
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
will be ruined in an instant.

372
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Uncle,

373
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,270
there's already a solution at hand.

374
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,320
Look.

375
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,270
These

376
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,270
are the title deeds for salt fields

377
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,330
and management rights to salt stores,

378
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,480
[Tax Receipt]

379
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,290
mortgaged or sold

380
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,220
to my father,

381
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,670
when he was doing business with others.

382
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,240
[Li Million shall have
10 and a half shares.]

383
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,550
Now that peace has returned,

384
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,550
you should give us instructions

385
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,080
on how to proceed with them.

386
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,550
I'll follow your orders.

387
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
If this matter is settled,

388
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,100
that small amount of money for you

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,500
is certainly nothing.

390
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,110
Can Li Million handle

391
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
all these businesses?

392
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,480
Doesn't he find it exhausting?

393
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,340
When my father's business grows,

394
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,910
helping you with your affairs

395
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,770
will make us stand even stronger.

396
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,360
Merchants stabilize the realm

397
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,100
by only using gold and silver as weapons,

398
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,330
nothing compared to your dominance.

399
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Your Excellency.

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Your Excellency.

401
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,450
Where did you go this morning?

402
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,690
I just delivered an elegiac couplet.

403
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,990
At the madam's grave,

404
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,050
I cried a bit.

405
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
You didn't even know her.

406
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,660
How could you possibly cry?

407
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,960
Well, Your Excellency,
you wrote the elegiac couplet.

408
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,870
I just shed a few tears.

409
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,000
Consider it a complimentary service.

410
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,790
Besides,

411
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
I was genuinely moved.

412
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,830
Moved by what?

413
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,150
She was old enough

414
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,510
to be your mother.

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
You're so kind

416
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,630
to give me all the credit.

417
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,150
Yesterday,

418
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,200
half the girls from the brothels

419
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
all rushed to my house.

420
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,310
It made my mother so angry

421
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,940
that she told everyone to ignore me.

422
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,870
My wife directly

423
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,080
banished me to sleep
in the hall for the night.

424
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm toiling for our country,

425
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,720
which is one thing,

426
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,580
but to end up with such a result...

427
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,720
When I think about it,

428
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,200
I feel so wronged.

429
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,520
You set me up,

430
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,080
so I had to get back at you.

431
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,320
Alright,

432
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,810
I'll write a letter soon

433
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,000
to explain everything clearly.

434
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,340
I'll tell your mother

435
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,600
it was official business.

436
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,460
Don't feel wronged because of me.

437
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,670
But my mother also said

438
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,600
if it's truly for the benefit
of Jiangnan's people,

439
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,860
then it's acceptable.

440
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,210
As long as you

441
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,240
can ensure my family's safety,

442
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm willing to sacrifice myself completely

443
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,800
without hesitation.

444
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,840
Of course.

445
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,050
Confucius said,

446
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,410
"How do we know the future
won't be better than the present?"

447
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,460
[1,000 taels]

448
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,600
Li Qin

449
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,720
has delivered 200,000 taels of silver.

450
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,630
I'm thinking

451
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,270
of allocating 100,000 taels

452
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,670
to the Jinling Publishing House

453
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,360
to ensure the "Complete Library
of the Four Treasuries"

454
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
is properly printed.

455
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,390
As for the remaining 100,000 taels,

456
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,510
I'll keep 30,000 to 50,000

457
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,790
to renovate the Qinhuai River

458
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,720
by widening the waterway,

459
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
dredging it, and repairing buildings.

460
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
The money that's left

461
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,390
will be used to repair examination halls

462
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,460
and fix roads.

463
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,000
As you mentioned,
the way of pen and sword demands

464
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,960
a balance between tension and relaxation.

465
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,560
That's what it means, right?

466
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,360
You're brilliant, Your Excellency.

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,550
I'll definitely keep a close eye on

468
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,570
the Jinling Publishing House.

469
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,680
I plan to—

470
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,510
Wait, wait.

471
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,950
Don't try to avoid work.

472
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,390
No,

473
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,850
how is this avoiding work?

474
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,550
Proofreading catalogs.

475
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,480
Comparing editions.

476
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,790
It's an important task.

477
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,790
This isn't something you need to do.

478
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,000
There are plenty of idle scholars around.

479
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
Don't worry about it.

480
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,069
Let me ask you.

481
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,329
Do you understand salt administration?

482
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,119
Not at all.

483
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,810
You can learn if you don't.

484
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,750
Before you came, I heard

485
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,470
that you were excellent at selling tea.

486
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,270
A master in that field.

487
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,550
How hard could it be
to understand salt administration?

488
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,859
This Li Million,

489
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,680
using the military expense
reimbursement issue,

490
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,010
wants me to support him.

491
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,750
He spent several years

492
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,349
and has actually managed

493
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,920
to get all of Jiangnan's salt stores

494
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,510
and salt fields

495
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,200
under his control.

496
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,790
He's forcing me

497
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,570
to approve it.

498
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,980
Isn't this equivalent
to putting all the nation's taxes

499
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,640
into

500
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
his hands?

501
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,920
How dangerous!

502
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,390
But this Li Million

503
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,000
really has an eye for business.

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,550
Impressive.

505
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,550
Very impressive.

506
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,550
Why?

507
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,340
Are you scared?

508
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,610
The state has always used salt licenses

509
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,670
as monopoly rights

510
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,640
given to salt merchants.

511
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,160
They pay taxes every year.

512
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,860
In the past,

513
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,180
this was a good method.

514
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,290
But after years of peace,

515
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,160
these salt merchants
have become extremely greedy.

516
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,030
They just appease the imperial court

517
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,000
while raising prices as they please.

518
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,310
In provinces affected by war,

519
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,570
salt prices are higher than rice prices.

520
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,820
In my opinion,

521
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,640
we shouldn't hand these things

522
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,310
over to him.

523
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,750
The people's money
should be earned by the people.

524
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,810
The state shouldn't create a monster

525
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,760
that devours everything in sight.

526
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Your Excellency.

527
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,160
If it's about capital

528
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,310
or ability,

529
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,070
I'm truly no match

530
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,930
for Li Million.

531
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,070
I appreciate your favor,

532
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,070
but I really

533
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,770
can't handle this matter.

534
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,400
Desertion in the face of duty

535
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
is punishable by death.

536
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,030
I know

537
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,320
you two are old acquaintances.

538
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,500
If you handle this matter well for me,

539
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,030
I'll grant you an official rank.

540
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,420
Well...

541
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,510
If you fail,

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,800
military law will deal with you.

543
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,400
[Righteous and Diligent]

544
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Please, no formalities.

545
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,130
Let's go through things one by one.

546
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,270
[Righteous and Diligent]

547
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,960
Now,

548
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,920
Westerners from over a dozen countries

549
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,070
have sent official documents
to Liangjiang.

550
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,720
First,

551
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,000
they demand the restoration
of their churches.

552
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Second,

553
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,320
they want to conduct business here.

554
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,140
Ever since the "Treaty of Nanjing"
was signed,

555
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,200
[Righteous and Diligent]

556
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,060
all countries have demanded
equal trading rights.

557
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,590
This is a massive change

558
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,190
unprecedented
in our thousand-year history.

559
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,770
No one knows

560
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
what we should do.

561
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,680
Which of you has experience

562
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,740
in foreign affairs

563
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,840
and can negotiate with them?

564
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Your Excellency.

565
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,720
I'd like to try.

566
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,440
Mr. Li.

567
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,650
Your family has done business
with Westerners before.

568
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,450
But Mr. Gu has experience too.

569
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,000
Why don't you two

570
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,350
take on this matter together,

571
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,010
so you can support each other?

572
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,350
Yes.

573
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:20,980
Yes.

574
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
The main principle lies in

575
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,450
equal treatment
and upholding proper dignity.

576
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,570
Please instruct me, Your Excellency.

577
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,350
When dealing with them,

578
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,880
you can't use that superior attitude

579
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,830
of the Celestial Empire

580
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,850
or be arrogant.

581
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,880
Their ironclad warships and cannons

582
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,120
are not just for show.

583
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,020
But there's no need to fear them blindly.

584
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,150
Reasonable matters

585
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,960
must be handled properly.

586
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,160
As for doing business...

587
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,270
When trading in Liangjiang,

588
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,060
I have just one rule

589
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,040
for you

590
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,310
that you must win;

591
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
losing is not an option.

592
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,510
Set boundaries for them.

593
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't let them do as they please.

594
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,780
Li Qin,

595
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,590
since you're an imperial court
candidate intendant,

596
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,550
you should wear your official robes.

597
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:09,920
Yes.

598
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,790
[Righteous and Diligent]

599
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,190
As for the second matter,

600
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,440
the imperial court has issued an edict

601
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,570
to restore the salt and iron monopoly.

602
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,540
Most of the national tax revenue

603
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
comes from salt administration.

604
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,060
So we need to quickly calculate,

605
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,530
in the Jiangnan region,

606
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,470
whether these salt fields have title deeds

607
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,720
and their owners are still alive

608
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,760
and how many salt stores there are.

609
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,790
Currently
in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan,

610
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,590
salt is more expensive than rice.

611
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,520
This is absolutely unacceptable.

612
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,230
Except for these two,

613
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,880
the rest of you go immediately

614
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,680
and form groups

615
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,480
to investigate the situation

616
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,480
in each province and county.

617
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,940
Don't delay the imperial court's business.

618
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes.

623

Who knows how many eyes

624
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
are watching you?

625
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,260
Do you realize?

626
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,100
That old fox wants us
to fight like roosters.

627
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,240
He wants us to fight to the death.

628
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,510
And when we're both exhausted,

629
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,350
he'll be even less likely

630
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,810
to give up the salt fields.

631
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,060
You have shops and title deeds,

632
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,310
all purchased with your hard-earned money.

633
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,570
What are you afraid of?

634
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,920
If the imperial court were reasonable,

635
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,790
I wouldn't be afraid at all.

636
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,270
But the problem is they're not reasonable.

637
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,530
These papers in my hand

638
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,750

the cockfighting arena yet,

and we're already
suspicious of each other.

655
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,360
Exactly.

657

703
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,930

724
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,370

in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan

727
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,380

Don't have to worry about.

730
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,590
We need a lot of workers.

731
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,680
He says they can come

732
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
to work for us.

733
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,680
We also have pharmaceutical, printing,

734
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,350
manufacturing, and metallurgy industries.

735
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,720
We need a large workforce.

736
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,850
This is outrageous!

737
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,830
Is this what you call
a business negotiation?

738
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,790

Destroying Chinese factories

742
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,160
and buying Chinese people

743
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,020
as cheap labor?

744
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Getting angry with them won't help.

746
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,830
has no solution.

747
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,200
That's why they passed the buck to us.

748
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,660
If we just leave like this,

749
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
will they have any solution?

750
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay.

751
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,070
And what's your final word

752
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,310
of this negotiation?

753
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,160
Please give us

754
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,030
a final answer.

755
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,720
Because this

756
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,120
is the last negotiation.

757
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,570
I can give him an answer right away.

758
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,520
But I need to confirm one thing.

759
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,070
As for so-called equal opportunity,

760
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,680
does it mean our merchants

761
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,200
can be fully permitted

762
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,350
to go to your country to do business?

763
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,070
Since we have equal opportunities,

764
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,310
does that mean

765
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,240
they can also

766
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,270
do business in your country as well?

767
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,550
You're welcome

768
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,200
in London,

774
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,350
all over Africa.

775
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,350
The opportunities are equal.

776
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,100
God will always give money

777
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,560
to the greediest people.

778
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,590
Tell them to spare us this nonsense.

779
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,340
No need to translate this.

780
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,810
I want to clarify one more thing.

781
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,790
What if these industries

782
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,050
they want to operate in

783
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,680
have no business opportunities left

784
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,790
in our country?

785
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,350
You are officials.

786
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,210
You're not businesspeople then.

787
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,940
He says

788
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,240
you are officials, not merchants.

789
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,160
Tell him

790
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,240
these two people before him

791
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,570
are not officials at all

792
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,380
but genuine merchants
from the Qing Empire.

793
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,130
The silk industry,

794
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,510
the pharmaceutical industry,

795
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,830
and the tea industry they want

796
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,640
have no room

797
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,000
for further investment

798
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,270
in our country.

799
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,920
Even if Jiangnan makes an exception,

800
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,520
in the end,

801
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,130
they'll still return empty-handed.

802
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
You go ahead. Come on.

803
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm so angry at them,

804
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,980
you know?

805
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,370
Can this be called a negotiation?

806
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,110
Isn't this just

807
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,310
a routine notification to us?

808
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,160
It's like a robber

809
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,640
telling us

810
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,070
if they can take some money to spend!

811
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,270
Isn't that the point?

812
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,400
I want to...

813
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,800
I want to shoot them dead.

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,790
No, help me walk.

[Liangjiang Viceroy's Office]

819
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,150
In the 22nd year
of the Daoguang reign (1842),

820
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,920
the 13 Trading Houses were abolished.

821
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,160
The country's doors were thrown open

822
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,030
with Westerners rushing in for profit.

823
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,310
Western merchants are backed by gunboats,

824
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,910
like wolves wanting to devour
our Qing Empire.

825
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
If these Westerners open their factories,

826
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,880
all the weavers
in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan

827
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
will be ruined.

828
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,030
They'll all have to go

to their factories

830
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,050
and become their slaves.

With our large population,

832
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,750
how could everyone willingly

become their slaves?

Have you seen these photos before?

835

What's the point of
whether I've seen them or not?

836
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,920
If these words are said

837
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,640
to those officials in the capital,

838
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,790
they'll definitely say,

"You only value frivolous skills."

Who would talk about this?

They all stick to Neo-Confucianism
as it's the safest.

I'm a businessman.

854
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,130
The quickest way

855
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,610
is to spend money

856
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,810
to buy the machines

857
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,270
and set up factories.

858

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,440
been outflanked by Westerners.

947
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,810
The Westerners...

948
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,380
The Westerners in Darjeeling

949
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,880
have planted hundreds of thousands
of acres of green tea.

950
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,680
The seedlings

951
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,000
were stolen from us.

952
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,380
I was completely shocked.

953
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,710
And over there,

954
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,070
they don't care about pre-Qingming picking

955
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,340
or roasting at all.

956
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,230
They just dry fresh leaves

957
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,850
in the sun

958
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,050
and give them a quick bake.

959
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
That's not so bad.

960
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,890
What do you mean by "not so bad"?

961
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,720
Do you know

962
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,060
the Westerners

963
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,150
brew tea with hot milk?

964
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,090
They even add sugar

965
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,440
and rose petals.

966
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,170
It made my mouth so sour

967
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,460
I couldn't even tell what I was drinking.

968
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,920
But

969
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,510
Indian tea is cheap

970
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,350
and sold in large quantities.

971
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,550
The Westerners prefer their products.

972
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,590
If you ask me,

973
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,730
we need to find another way.

974
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
The war just ended,

975
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,370
and the Westerners want
to take over the tea, silk,

976
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,830
and medicine businesses.

977
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,030
The Liangjiang government

978
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,960
wants us to fight a commercial battle

979
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,270
against Westerners
on Liangjiang territory.

980
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,330
They say we must win

981
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,540
and can't lose.

982
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,350
What does that mean?

983
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
What they are doing now

984
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,680
is buying in bulk

985
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,630
and driving prices down.

986
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,070
Do you know?

987
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,550
Today at the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office,

988
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,110
I was looking through the accounts.

989
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,310
Their foreign agents

990
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,440
have bought up 70-80% of cocoons

991
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,969
from Lianghu, Liangguang,

992
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,010
and East and West Zhejiang.

993
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,630
Do you understand

994
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,690
what 70-80% means?

995
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,840
So many.

996
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,370
They're making such a big move

997
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,110
just to set their own prices.

998
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,150
If in the future,

999
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,770
tea, silk, and medicine

1000
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,760
are all priced by Westerners,

1001
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,760
how is that any different

1002
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,260
from generals surrendering our territory?

1003
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,070
That's why I say we're in imminent danger.

1004
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,710
The crisis is upon us.

1005
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,420
This is no joking matter.

1006
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,840
You mean

1007
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,880
the imperial court is in imminent danger?

1008
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,090
It's the entire country

1009
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,490
that's in imminent danger.

1010
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,620
I hold no love for this regime,

1011
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,970
but my heart belongs to this land.

1012
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,400
Whenever I see

1013
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
those Westerners' spinning machines

1014
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,540
and steam engines,

1015
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,030
I feel deeply alarmed.

1016
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,610
One of their spinning machines

1017
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,360
is equal to 80 of our weavers.

1018
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,840
Their efficiency
is more than 10 times ours.

1019
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,300
Powered by steam engines,

1020
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,360
they can operate year-round,

1021
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,790
day and night without stopping.

1022
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,530
You know,

1023
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,070
for Westerners
to build factories in China,

1024
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,730
the costs are incredibly low.

1025
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,090
In the future, our workers

1026
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,880
will be

1027
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,710
slaves in their factories

1028
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,040
for their entire lives,

1029
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,030
or

1030
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,110
there will be

1031
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,610
an even greater disaster.

1032
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,770
This is just the textile industry.

1033
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,710
As for all the others,

1034
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,690
I dare not imagine.

1035
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,030
Mr. Gu,

1036
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,800
you truly haven't

1037
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,660
wasted your time in officialdom.

1038
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,840
Every word shows your concern
for our country and people.

1039
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,240
You make me feel ashamed.

1040
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,280
When I was growing tea in Anhui before,

1041
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,480
I was still fighting with the head
of the Tea Merchants' Association,

1042
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
squabbling among ourselves.

1043
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,840
Back then, I thought

1044
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,760
I was so clever.

1045
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,190
But when I went to Jiangning,

1046
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,030
in less than 10 days,

1047
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,550
I felt completely inadequate.

1048
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,880
The French, the British,

1049
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
and the Portuguese

1050
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,070
mobilize their entire nations

1051
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,330
to do business with us,

1052
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,030
using the most advanced technology,

1053
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,360
the finest weapons,

1054
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,040
and the toughest attitudes.

1055
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,590
What do they want?

1056
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,080
They want to hollow out the Qing Empire.

1057
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,710
And what about us?

1058
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,800
We're still in a daze,

1059
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,150
not taking them seriously,

1060
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,670
fantasizing the Qing Empire,

1061
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,880
and looking down on everything.

1062
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,030
There is no future.

1063
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,670
There are no draft banks anymore.

1064
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,230
And there's no Li Million anymore.

1065
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,640
Can't you see?

1066
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,690
They're now using guns and cannons

1067
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,170
to force us into business.

1068
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,820
Either we lose, or we win.

1069
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,230
There's no room

1070
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,980
for benevolence and morality.

1071
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,070
The Jiangnan region

1072
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,710
hasn't yet recovered its strength.

1073
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,770
There are many Westerners there too.

1074
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Whether we can survive in the future

1075
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,480
depends on whether we can establish
ourselves in the south.

1076
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,550
I've taken over

1077
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,630
all the salt industry in Lianghuai.

1078
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,360
Next,

1079
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,630
I'll monopolize

1080
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,360
tea, silk,

1081
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,480
and medicinal materials.

1082
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,680
When that time comes,

1083
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,360
I'll need suppot
from the Four Major Banks.

1084
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,670
If you invest more,

1085
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,820
you'll get more profit in the future.

1086
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,550
Isn't it nice to count money at home?

1087
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,400
Master Li.

1088
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,180
How many salt fields

1089
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,510
have you acquired in Lianghuai?

1090
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,590
142.

1091
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,170
I've been quietly taking them over

1092
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,510
while having to guard against

1093
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,760
the viceroys and governors
of Liangjiang undermining me.

1094
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,220
In the future,
when I need to mobilize funds,

1095
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,320
my old friends,

1096
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,520
you'll need to continue supporting me.

1097
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,550
The Four Major Banks can support you.

1098
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,760
However,

1099
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,630
as for the profits from your salt fields,

1100
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,200
the Four Major Banks

1101
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,830
will take at least 30% in the future.

1102
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,800
Everyone's in it for the money.

1103
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,060
I think this deal works for me.

1104
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,110
Great.

1105
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,880
Mr. Li.

1106
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,890
We are just merchants.

1107
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,030
We can't make decisions

1108
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,360
for the imperial court.

1109
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,880
But I think

1110
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,480
at this moment,

1111
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
we can join forces to save the market

1112
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,230
and delay the Westerners' entry

1113
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,510
into the Qing Empire.

1114
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,310
As for other matters,

1115
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,290
we'll have to leave them

1116
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,170
to more capable people.

1117
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,760
Good.

1118
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,360
Great.

1119
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,630
When you decide to act,
we'll act together.

1120
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,230
Gu,

1121
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,800
why do I feel so uncomfortable

1122
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
in your house?

1123
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,070
I...

1124
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,810
I feel like I'm being watched.

1125
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,120
What are you all doing?

1126
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,960
If you want to look,

1127
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,420
come in and look properly.

1128
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,470
My friend Mr. Li

1129
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,550
has just returned from India

1130
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,670
after selling tea there.

1131
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,230
Are you not used to his appearance?

1132
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,030
I think he looks quite handsome.

1133
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,440
Fine, look then.

1134
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,710
What do you think?

1135
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,520
Isn't it quite special?

1136
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,330
Who would dress like this?

1137
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,730
Looks like a long-legged chicken.

1138
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,650
Westerners' knees don't bend.

1139
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,130
Hit them with a stick,

1140
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,320
and they fall to the ground.

1141
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,740
Who told you that, old man?

1142
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,550
Why are you wearing

1143
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,880
a spittoon on your head?

1144
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,230
Alright, that's enough.

1145
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,770
Move along, move along.

1146
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,590
Nothing to see here.

1147
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,120
Fine, everyone, disperse.

1148
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,490
I want one of those too.

1149
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,730
Go away, all of you.

1150
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,580
Mother,

1151
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,800
why are you here too?

1152
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,010
Old Madam Gu.

1153
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,360
You're here.

1154
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,270
Do you need anything?

1155
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,440
They were all gathered at the door.

1156
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
I didn't see that.

1157
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm fine.

1158
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,160
Y-You continue talking.

1159
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,030
In recent years,
there's been fighting in the south.

1160
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,320
Rebels often take stones
from the coastal embankment

1161
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,070
to build their fortifications,

1162
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,000
causing severe damage to many sections
of the coastal embankment.

1163
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600
With the treasury depleted,

1164
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,960
the coastal embankment
has gone unrepaired for years.

1165
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,000
I got reports yesterday—
Nantong's coastal embankment collapsed,

1166
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,320
causing countless casualties.

1167
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,190
We're currently calculating
the number of victims

1168
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,440
and the taels of silver and food

1169
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,630
needed for disaster relief.

1170
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,150
We can't count on

1171
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,320
the imperial court anymore.

1172
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,780
We need to find a solution.

1173
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,510
Your Excellency.

1174
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,630
The Li family is willing to help you.

1175
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,150
Before I came, my father instructed me

1176
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,080
to serve you in every way possible.

1177
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,330
If you agree,

1178
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,150
I can return to the capital immediately

1179
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,070
to raise funds

1180
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,000
to repair the coastal embankment.
What do you think?

1181
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Your intentions are admirable.

1182
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,510
But there's one thing.

1183
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,000
I don't do business blindly.

1184
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,110
After repairing the coastal embankment,

1185
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,570
what do you want in return?

1186
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,800
I submitted a list to you.

1187
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,230
The list of over 140 salt fields

1188
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,960
in Jiangnan.

1189
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,920
If you can help me

1190
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,090
settle this matter,

1191
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,610
it'll be more convenient
to access funds in the future.

1192
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,350
Well, well.

1193
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,090
That...

1194
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,280
That's quite a blunt statement.

1195
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,550
Why would the salt fields and stores

1196
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,950
your Li family purchased

1197
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,480
require the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

1198
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,470
to intervene?

1199
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,660
For some,

1200
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,510
we can find the original owners.

1201
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,800
But there are others

1202
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,360
that have been seized

1203
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,710
by local bullies.

1204
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,960
And for some,

1205
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,880
we only have the title deeds,

1206
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,110
but the people who could claim them

1207
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,150
are all dead.

1208
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,940
My father said

1209
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
if the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

1210
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,240
could lend a hand to the Li family,

1211
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,960
we would certainly
do everything in our power

1212
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,630
to serve you in the future.

1213
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,870
Why aren't you saying anything?

1214
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,300
This isn't like you.

1215
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,280
Your Excellency,

1216
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,480
I know nothing about the salt business.

1217
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,630
The salt industry
is a government monopoly.

1218
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,630
If this power

1219
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,320
is placed in the hands of merchants,

1220
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,030
it will inevitably weaken
the court's authority,

1221
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,290
which is not good for the imperial court.

1222
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,510
How about this?

1223
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,360
Why don't you two

1224
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,840
both go repair the coastal embankment?

1225
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,950
Split it into east and west sections.

1226
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,550
Each of you repairs one part.

1227
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,320
Then I'll judge which is better.

1228
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,360
After the repairs are done,

1229
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
I'll request recognition
for your achievements

1230
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,960
and mention the salt field matter
in my report.

1231
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
If you win, Mr. Li,

1232
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,630
then the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office
will be duty-bound

1233
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,800
to step in

1234
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,760
and resolve this matter for you.

1235
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Your Excellency,

1236
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,440
I don't understand
what repairing the embankment

1237
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,100
has to do with the salt fields.

1238
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,150
My good nephew,

1239
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,590
you have no idea how much pressure

1240
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,550
I'm under.

1241
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,480
Everyone thinks I've made

1242
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,400
a fortune in this position.

1243
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,960
If I were to oversee

1244
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,110
giving the Lianghuai salt business

1245
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,280
to your family,

1246
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,150
those memorials against me behind my back

1247
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,760
would be piled higher than the city walls.
