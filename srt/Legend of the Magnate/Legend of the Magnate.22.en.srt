[Grand Vision for Long-Lasting Prosperity]

4
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,479
Everyone,

5
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,120
I behaved arrogantly and rudely
in Anhui before

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,650
and offended Old Master Hu.

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,680
Today Old Master Hu

8
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,039
wants to apologize to me,

9
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,640
and I'd also like to apologize

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,910
to the entire

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,070
Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

12
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,590
Old Master Hu is a man of noble character,

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,990
and I respect him deeply.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,820
Let's turn the page

15
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,960
on everything that happened before

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,500
and not bring it up again.

17
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,000
However, the gold-lettered plaque,

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,120
"Top Tea Under Heaven,"

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
belongs to Anhui,

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
not to me alone,

21
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,150
and it should hang in the hall

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,480
of the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,840
This

24
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,329
is my first gift

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,329
to Old Master Hu.

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
My second gift

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,210
is the recipe for our Orchid Snow tea.

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,320
Old Master Hu, please accept it,

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,710
make copies,

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,640
and distribute them
to all tea merchants in Anhui.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Mr. Gu,

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,079
this...

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,020
this gift is far too valuable.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,000
Not even a fortune could buy it.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
If you don't explain your reason,

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,820
I cannot accept it.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,430
The reputation of Orchid Snow tea

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,680
has already spread far and wide,

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,700
but with just

40
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,120
my brother and me

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,590
and a few dozen mu

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,750
of poor farmland,

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,760
we can't produce much in a year.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm afraid that in the future,

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,430
all kinds of counterfeits

46
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,930
might appear on the market

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,840
and damage its reputation,

48
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,400
and the blame

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,330
would fall on
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
So, Old Master Hu,

51
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,270
you must take this recipe

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,540
no matter what.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,710

54
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,240
You...

55
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,640
You left me

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,310
no room to refuse.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
Mr. Gu, rest assured.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,050
If the Gu family's Orchid Snow tea

59
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,800
becomes popular throughout the land,

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,090
it will be thanks to you.

61
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,390
The Anhui Tea Merchants' Association
is at your service.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,990
I can't take this position.

63
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,910
You see, I'm the kind of person

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,120
who can't stand hassles.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,590
I'm used to an easy, leisurely life.

66
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,750
Looking after my tea plantation,

67
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,560
free and easy,

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,810
suits me just fine.

69
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,280
You should be the one in this position.

70
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,270
Mr. Gu, you're being too modest.

71
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm not being modest at all.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,130
In these chaotic times,

73
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
hundreds of thousands of tea farmers
in Anhui

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,960

Orchid Snow tea

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,310
might be our one ray of hope.

78
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,520
If we can

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,450
promote this tea

80

the people of Anhui

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
can live more easily.

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,150
This would be a great deed

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,060
has restored the honor

If it weren't for Gu,

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,800
could our tea

Mr. Gu.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,310
How did those Anhui tea merchants

112
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,370
kowtow and admit their faults to you?

113
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,560
You must not let them off easily.

114
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,750
Thinking about it,
I was too young back then,

115
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,270
insisting on making this Orchid Snow tea.

116
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,730
I can't really blame them.

117
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,920
You were simply lucky.

walks out their door

119
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,680
and runs into the Empress Dowager?

120
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,110
And who else

121
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,950
could earn her favor,

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,270
with a single word from her

123
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,870

124
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,720
Why do you think His Highness

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,830
was so accommodating?

126
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,870
He had no choice.

127
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,070
That plaque granted by the Empress Dowager

128
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,870
has him completely pinned down.

129
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,360
When you invited me to that banquet,

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
that was also
at the Empress Dowager's behest,

131
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,000

will be split between the two of us.

to kill everyone in the city,

Mr. Gu,

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240

You should know this clearly.

Since ancient times,

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560

151
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,310
is

152
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,000
a rank gained.

My people are everywhere out there.

158
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,930
Without my orders,

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
if anyone suddenly sees you coming out,

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,300
you'll lose your head.

161
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,120
You really do look like

162
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,250

of the imperial court.

164
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,070
How did you know?

165
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Did you plant people

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
around Qiao Song too?

167
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,680
We were planning to kill Qiao Song,

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,000
but then we suddenly learned

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,750
that he brought someone

170
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,920
even the Empress Dowager

171
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
valued.

172
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,040
I was wondering who that could be.

173
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
So it's an old friend.

174
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,480
You came all this way

175
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,340
just to bring your head back to me.

176
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,820
What a waste of effort.

177
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,870
I'm no friend to you.

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm a dead man.

179
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,200
That's right.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,030
Keeping someone like you around

181
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,360
would only get in my way.

182
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,669
Tell me,

183
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,290
do you have any last wishes

184
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
or messages?

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,100
I want you to persuade Li Cheng

186
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,810
that Hefei can no longer be defended.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,460
Tell him to withdraw early

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,600
and not drag down

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,270
the innocent people of the city.

190
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,000
And I'd also like to remind you:

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,840
when a great structure is collapsing,
a single beam can't hold it up.

192
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,910
Your schemes

193
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,900
won't amount to anything.

194
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,150
You won't win.

195
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
You still can't change

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,530
that sharp tongue of yours.

197
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,510
Aren't you afraid of dying?

198
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,000
I am.

199
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,670
Aren't you?

200
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,820
Since I

201
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,550
ruined your plans before

202
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,150
and you almost got me killed,

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,890
I'd say we're even now.

204
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,700
Time to talk business.

205
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,110
I didn't expect you to be a businessman.

206
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,760
I want every

207
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,320
innocent civilian in Hefei

208
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,510
to survive.

209
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,470
Can we make that deal?

210
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,290
Go tell Li Cheng

211
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,020
that Hefei is now

212
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,500
surrounded on three sides.

213
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,760
He still has one last chance of survival.

214
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,240
Even heroes can't escape love.

215
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,630
You're still thinking about Miss Bai,
aren't you?

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm not doing this for Miss Bai.

217
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,510
I'm doing this for all the citizens.

218
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,040
A real man does what he must.

219
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,500
You've severely underestimated me.

220
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,240
You want him to withdraw,

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,300
but where can he go?

222
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Under the walls of Jinling,

223
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,200
the court's northern
and southern camps are stationed.

224
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,240
There are troops in the Zhejiang region
as well.

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
As for Suzhou,

226
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,670
it depends on whether the prince there

227
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,070
is willing to take him in.

228
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,930
So we must work together.

229
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,060
You help him plan a way out.

230
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,550
Whatever you need from me,

231
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,610
I'll do my best.

232
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,720
I can't believe

233
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,850
you still dare to speak to me like this.

234
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll remember your life for now.

235
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,890
I'll come back for you.

236
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,480
Greetings, Lord Gu!

237
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,500
[Hefei, Qing Army Station]

238
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,810
Mr. Gu,

239
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,050
act just like me.

240
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,030
If you treat them well

241
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,340
and see them as equals,

242
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,030
they'll only walk all over you.

243
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,860
That's how the bureaucracy works.

244
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,530
Mr. Qiao,

245
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,930
I'm hardly an official.

246
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,270
I don't need to learn those tricks, do I?

247
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,440
Lords, you must be tired

248
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,870
from the long journey.

249
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,910
Greetings, Pacification Commissioner.

250
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,640
Mr. Bao Qing,

251
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm not an official.

252
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
You don't need to salute me.

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,300
How can that be?

254
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,550
Mr. Gu,
you are the Pacification Commissioner,

255
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,870
personally appointed
by the Empress Dowager.

256
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,000
That's far above my rank

257
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,600
as a fourth-rank military attaché.

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,550
How dare I break imperial protocol?

259
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,510
Come on.

260
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,150
Please.

261
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,750
The food and wine are already prepared.

262
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,510
Music!

263
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,270
Come on, everyone.

264
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,980
Let's toast to Mr. Qiao.

265
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Qiao's arrival

266
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,810
is like the rising sun driving away evil.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
The siege has lasted so long,

268
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,150
and today we finally see hope.

269
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
With the Pacification Commissioner here,

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,840
the local people feel
as if blessed with a new parent.

271
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,670
The banners and umbrellas of gratitude

272
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,150
are too many to count.

273
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,030
The Empress Dowager's
exceptional promotion of you

274
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,490
couldn't be more fitting.

275
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,590
We would also like to toast you.

276
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,110
Wait.

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
What banners and umbrellas of gratitude?

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,360
I haven't done anything.

279
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,090
How could there be such things?

280
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,150
You guys are so good at this.

281
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,750
Of course.

282
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,120
We had to prepare early.

283
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,870
You can't really wait

284
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,600
for the commoners
to bring these things, can you?

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,170
Mr. Bao Qing,

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
there's one thing I don't understand.

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
I'd like to ask you about it.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,510
Please, Pacification Commissioner.

289
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,710
I heard Hefei is about to run out of food.

290
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,670
When are you planning

291
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,930
to launch the assault?

292
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,510
We were waiting for your order.

293
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
As soon as you command it,
I'll marshal the troops and attack.

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,510
I don't understand military affairs.

295
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,570
I'm just saying—

296
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,550
if you keep the siege going like this,

297
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,360
the people inside the city

298
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,600
really will starve to death.

299
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,720
That's nothing to worry about.

300
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,840
Only when those traitors

301
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,860
are too hungry to lift their swords

302
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,180
can we achieve victory in one battle.

303
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,120
Remind me—

304
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,810
what is my post again?

305
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,770
I've forgotten.

306
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,030
You're the Pacification Commissioner.

307
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,670
So does what I say carry weight?

308
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
Of course.

309
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,870
When you first arrived,

310
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,700
I said

311
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,990
everything would follow your command.

312
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,200
That is how the court

313
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,080
shows its care for the people
and its defense of the realm.

314
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,790
Right, exactly.

315
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,270
In that case,

316
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
if you starve everyone to death,

317
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,890
who am I supposed to pacify?

318
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,440
Or...

319
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
are you trying to take my job from me?

320
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,350
Besides,

321
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,510
most of those so‑called enemy troops

322
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,000
are actually

323
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,790
common folk in Hefei

324
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,320
who were dragged into this.

325
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,440
If they end up

326
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,480
starved to death by you,

327
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,150
or cut down

328
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
by your swords,

329
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,600
wouldn't that tarnish

330
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,660
the Empress Dowager's benevolence?

331
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,030
Have you

332
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,330
ever seriously thought this through?

333
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,720
Mr. Gu,

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,930
I truly admire

335
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,440
what you just said.

336
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,870
I think

337
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,380
they've been starved long enough.

338
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,580
It's time we attack.

339
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,320
Right.

340
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,550
Mr. Qiao,

341
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,340
I've made my decision.

342
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll go home to inform my family first.

343
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,280
In a few days,

344
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,150
I will personally go to Hefei

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,510
to persuade them to surrender.

346
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,320
That won't do.

347
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
If anything happens to you,

348
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,840
I don't have enough heads

349
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
to pay for it.

350
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,110
Rest assured.

351
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,750
Once this battle is over,

352
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,320
I'll make sure your military merits
are recorded

353
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
and that you're granted an official post.

354
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,190
Mr. Bao Qing,

355
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,000
how could you forget what you just said?

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,630
"everything would follow
Pacification Commissioner's command."

357
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,000
"That is how the imperial court"

358
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,330
"shows its care for the people
and its defense of the realm."

359
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,820
I'll head back now.

360
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,850
Well...

361
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,150
[Marshal]

362
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,490
Pacification Commissioner.

363
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,530
Pacification Commissioner.

364
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,600
Qiao,

365
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,490
this Mr. Gu is indeed
cut out to be an official.

366
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,870
That's what you get
for being so careless with your words.

367
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,330
How was I supposed to know?

368
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,540
He learned so fast.

369
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,240
With just a few lines,
he had me speechless.

370
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,060
Don't underestimate him.

371
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,670
We'd better

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,940
not offend men like him.

373
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
Why do you think the Empress Dowager

374
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,200
suddenly gave him
the title of Pacification Commissioner

375
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,480
out of nowhere?

376
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,480
Why?

377
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,880
She's long been displeased

378
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,790
with the Sixth Prince.

379
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
You and I both work for His Highness.

380
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,270
So she gave Gu

381
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,870
a nominal post
as Pacification Commissioner.

382
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
Though it's just a nominal post,

383
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
if you dare to disobey his orders,

384
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,480
that becomes a real problem.

385
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,480
Also,

386
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,480
You must

387
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,940
keep him here.

388
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,000
Why?

389
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,580
Who gets the credit if he achieves merit?

390
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,940
And if he causes trouble—

391
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,140
who will be blamed?

392
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,480
You are wise.

393
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,840
But there's one thing

394
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,300
I still don't understand.

395
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
Since we're holding him in high regard

396
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,970
and giving him credit for free,

397
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,830
why is he still insisting on

398
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,670
going into the city
to persuade them to surrender?

399
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,030
That's a suicide mission.

400
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,360
Why didn't you stop him?

401
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
Did you try to stop him?

402
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,080
I did.

403
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,570
And?

404
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,550
I couldn't stop him.

405
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,840
Then he's choosing death himself.

406
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,910
Nothing we can do.

407
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,750
He's the Pacification Commissioner.

408
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,160
That's his duty.

409
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,490
[Gu's Mansion]

410
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,160
Why aren't you wearing the tiger skin?

411
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

412
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
I waited half the night

413
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,430
hoping to see you in it.

414
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,310
Pingyuan, you know the Empress Dowager.

415
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,640
Why don't you talk to her?

416
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
You don't want to be an official anyway.

417
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Get me

418
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,640
a tiger skin to wear.

419
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,440
Just imagine me
walking around the village—

420
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,700
how majestic I'd look.

421
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
What do you need a tiger skin for?

422
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,070
When I was chased by wolves
beyond the pass,

423
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,790
I didn't see you coming to save me.

424
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,160
All you ever do is borrow my power.

425
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,220
You're so heartless.

426
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,070
I searched everywhere for you.

427
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,480
I can't even remember

428
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,740
how many times I cried.

429
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,900
Try to be stronger from now on.

430
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,670
Stop crying all the time.

431
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,450
Pingyuan, seriously—

432
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,500
someone's offering you an official post.

433
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,720
Why won't you take it?

434
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,480
Enough.
Don't talk to me about being an official.

435
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm already annoyed.

436
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,160
They say,
"Even the prime minister's relatives"

437
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,060
"hold seventh-rank posts."

438
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,400
If you became an official,

439
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,920
I could become a magistrate.

440
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,070
Anyone who dares disobey me,

441
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,790
I'd slam the table

442
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,720
and have them punished.

443
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,250
Get lost!

444
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,960
Mother,

445
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,160
I'm back.

446
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,940
If you're resting,

447
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,030
I'll come pay my respects in the morning.

448
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,790
Come in.

449
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,720
Pingwen said you almost lost your life.

450
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,510
I was scared to death.

451
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
A friend dragged me beyond the pass.

452
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,740
I left in a hurry

453
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,030
and didn't have time

454
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,960
to tell Pingwen.

455
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,510
I don't believe that.

456
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Mother, I promise you

457
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,310
I won't go that far away again.

458
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,880
Mother,

459
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,110
I have some good news for you.

460
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,640
This time in the capital,

461
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,700
I handed a note to Sixth Prince.

462
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
He promised to have people

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
in Nine Gates Infantry Commander's Office

464
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,700
help me look for my father.

465
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,180
If even they

466
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,130
cannot find him,

467
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,140
then he really can't be found.

468
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,680
Don't be too upset.

469
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm not upset.

470
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
I just can't help

471
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,750
holding onto a small hope.

472
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,940
I just feel like he's

473
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,510
still alive somewhere.

474
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,480
If he is,

475
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,880
knowing that you

476
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,470
and his two sons are waiting at home,

477
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,210
how could he not come back?

478
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,610
Please don't say that anymore.

479
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,150
It only brings more pain.

480
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,620
If you're safe,

481
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,480
and if you have the chance,

482
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,360
continue searching for him.

483
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,800
Even if he's dead,

484
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,510
at least I'll be able to cry at his grave,

485
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,150
and that would give me peace.

486
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm going to sleep.

487
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,150
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

488
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,140
I'll stay right here with you.

489
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,900
Sleep well.

490
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,940
[Hefei City]

491
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,460
I am Gu Pingyuan,
Pacification Commissioner of Anhui.

492
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,570
I want to see General Li Cheng!

493
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,030
Yimei.

494
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
How have you been?

495
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,000
Why are you here?

496
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,100
Am I not allowed to be here?

497
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,830
I didn't know you had become

498
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,690
the Pacification Commissioner.

499
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,160
Life is unpredictable.

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Who can guarantee

501
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,740
what role they'll play tomorrow?

502
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,230
Yesterday you were Bai Yimei,

503
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,000
and today you're playing
the Princess Consort, aren't you?

504
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
I can never win a debate with you.

505
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,310
Tell me,

506
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,960
why are you here?

507
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,030
Tell me and then just leave.

508
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,430
This is a dangerous city.

509
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,230
I need to see Li Cheng.

510
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,480
He's busy with military affairs
and won't see you.

511
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,110
If there's nothing else, just go now.

What military affairs do you still have?

513
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,550
Right now in Hefei,

514
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,750
people are starving.

515
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,850
If you don't escape now, when will you?

516
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,090
Do you want to drag everyone in the city
down with you?

517
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,270
You really do

518
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,950
speak for the imperial court.

519
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,270
Yimei,

520
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,130
now that you are a Princess Consort,

521
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,730
your heart has hardened too?

522
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,580
Do you really want that many people
buried with you?

523
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,270
Why make things difficult for me?

524
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,030
I'm not.

525
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,370
I'm begging you.

526
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,090
Even if you choose

527
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,550
to go down a dead‑end path,

528
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,770
at least
spare the innocent people of Hefei.

529
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,600
Leave them a chance to live.

530
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,350
If Mr. Bai

531
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,790
saw you like this,

532
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,320
he would be heartbroken.

533
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,980
Gu,

534
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,500
you can't talk about me like that.

535
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,770
Even if I wanted to leave,

536
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,500
this isn't my decision to make.

537
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
What's going on here?

538
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,500
How come you two old friends are arguing

539
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,750
the moment you meet?

540
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,930
What he just said

541
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
was for our own good.

542
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Brew some tea.

543
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,000
Please.

544
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,990
In these circumstances,

545
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,020
this is the best

546
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,550
I can offer you.

547
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,470
Is this

548
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,440
what you're eating now?

549
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,280
This is good stuff.

550
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,880
I tore out the gardens
in the Prince's Mansion—

551
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,750
front and back—

552
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,710
and planted a lot of peanuts.

553
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,250
I haven't asked you yet—

554
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,650
should I call you Gu,

555
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,000
or Lord Gu now?

556
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,990
Just call me Gu Pingyuan.

557
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
It was petty of me.

558
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
My apologies, Gu.

559
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,310
I'm here today for...

560
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,030
I heard the title
"Pacification Commissioner"

561
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,550
just now when I got here.

562
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,680
Good.

563
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,920
Very good.

564
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,280
In this entire world,

565
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,960
among all the civil
and military officials of the Qing court—

566
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,640
plus that old emperor—

567
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,800
not one of them

568
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,030
deserves that title.

569
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
But you...

570
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,380
you're the perfect person

571
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,030
for it.

572
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,110
Now that you're here,

573
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,510
it puts my mind at ease.

574
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,090
Oh right, Yimei.

575
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,070
Go to the storeroom.

576
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,310
There's a good bottle of wine

577
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,510
under the blade rack.

578
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,310
Bring it here.

579
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,190
I want to have a drink with Gu.

580
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,790
You haven't eaten anything yet.

581
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,720
We have peanuts.

582
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,830
Go on.

583
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,980
Given the state of Hefei right now,

584
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,880
Gu,

585
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,800
do you have any advice for me?

586
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,750
Hefei is now surrounded

587
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,670
on three sides.

588
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,080
Why don't you withdraw?

589
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,200
Once you cross the Yangtze River,
you'll reach Jinling.

590
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,510
It seems

591
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,070
you really haven't been in office
for long.

592
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,550
Yes.

593
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
If we leave Hefei,

594
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,370
where can we go?

595
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,960
Zhejiang?

596
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,410
The regime's troops there
are waiting for us.

597
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,070
Suzhou?

598
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,880
My old brothers

599
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,160
won't agree to that.

600
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,310
Jinling?

601
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Outside Jinling,

602
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,600
there are hundreds of thousands
of troops in the north and south camps.

603
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,460
Even if I fight my way into the city

604
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,750
and sit with my brothers,

605
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,590
my end...

606
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,480
may be even worse.

607
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,000
Why?

608
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,980
Do you know about Jinling's

609
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,110
current situation?

610
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,160
I don't.

611
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,620
My brothers are fighting among themselves.

612
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,360
The crisis will unfold
in a matter of days.

613
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,510
Our death is near.

614
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,290
Gu,

615
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,020
this toast is for you.

616
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,880
You were right earlier.

617
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,790
I shouldn't drag

618
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,830
everyone in Hefei down with me.

619
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,810
After this drink, you should go back.

620
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,980
Tomorrow morning,

621
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,110
I'll open the gates and let the people go,

622
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,920
without harming a single soul.

623
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,550
As for my wife and me—

624
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,550
we will repay your great kindness

625
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,550
in our next life.

626
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,200
Gu,

627
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,190
I'd like to toast you as well.

628
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,580
I was rude earlier.

629
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,850
Please forgive me.

630
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,350
Thank you for always treating me kindly

631
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,960
and for helping me bury my father.

632
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,880
My husband and I

633
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,600
will repay your kindness in our next life.

634
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,030
Fine.

635
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,160
One of you chooses loyalty,
the other chooses love.

636
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,090
But have you thought about others?

637
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
Who are you referring to?

638
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,070
Your brothers.

639
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,700
What are you trying to say?

640
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
They've never been princes,

641
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
nor lived in a mansion as large as yours.

642
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,040
What do you think
they're eating right now?

643
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,750
I doubt they're willing

644
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,110
to die with you.

645
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,880
Do you know

646
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,010
what you're talking about?

647
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,970
We're all born and raised by our parents.

648
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,420
As long as a man can fill his stomach,

649
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,020
who would choose rebellion?

650
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,480
Yes.

651
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,430
You chose righteousness

652
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,590
and loyalty—

653
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,840
but did you ever ask them?

654
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,150
Do you dare ask them this question

655
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,030
and let those who don't want to follow you

656
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,550
leave the city with me,

657
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,310
leaving you to die alone?

658
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,110
Anyone who disrupts the army's morale
before battle

659
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,370
deserves execution.

660
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,970
Don't hurt Gu.

661
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,360
Why did you say that?

662
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,030
Leave now!

663
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,430
Did I say anything wrong?

664
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,280
Your lives matter,

665
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,740
but theirs don't?

666
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,750
If you can't accept that,

667
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,650
then kill me!

668
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,310
Guards!

669
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,070
Yes!

670
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,200
Honey!

671
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,160
Honey!

672
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,440
Pass my order.

673
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,640
I'll address the troops before the battle.

674
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,400
-Yes!
-Yes!

675
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,820
Come with me.

676
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll show you

677
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
if any of my men are cowards.

678
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,110
[Li]

679
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,720
Heaven soldiers have descended!

680
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,460
Peace will come to all lands!

681
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,550
[Li]

682
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,110
Heaven soldiers have descended!

683
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,730
Peace will come to all lands!

684
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,580
Heaven soldiers have descended!

685
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
Peace will come to all lands!

[Weiwu Gate]

687
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,210
I joined the Resistance Army when I was 6.

688
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,540
[Weiwu Gate]

689
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,420
Back then my brothers asked me,

690
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,210
"Why do farmers toil all year"

691
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,660
"only to starve by the roadside?"

692
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,460
"Why do laborers
work themselves to the bone"

693
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,790
"only for their bodies"

694
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,840
"to be thrown into the fields
as fertilizer?"

695
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,370
[Weiwu Gate]

696
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,710
The officials and nobles of this world

697
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,510
lie to us

698
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,730
and whip us with their lashes.

699
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,130
They oppress our parents,

700
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,770
abuse our children,

701
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,790
and drain us completely.

702
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,740
In a world like this—

703
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,750
how could we not rise up?

704
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,710
[Weiwu Gate]

705
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,590
Kill!

706
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,270
Kill!

707
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,070
Kill!

708
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,000
Kill!

709
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,120
Many of you are my old brothers

710
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,750
who came from Guangxi.

711
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,000
And some of you

712
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,590
joined us in the past year or two.

713
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,980
Now we're trapped here

714
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,570
in Hefei

715
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,020
with nowhere to go.

716
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,060
The great battle is imminent.

717
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
I won't force anyone.

718
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,710
Those who choose to stay,

719
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,820
finish the remaining food

720
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,280
and sharpen your blades.

721
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,130
After we die,

722
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,520
we'll continue to be brothers.

723
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,080
Those who don't wish to stay—

724
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,980
tomorrow morning

725
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,740
the Qing Army will pull back 10 miles.

726
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,960
They've sent a Pacification Commissioner.

727
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
You can go with him

728
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,930
and return home.

729
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,870
No one is allowed to stop you.

Our blades

731
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,130
will never fall upon our own brothers!

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,490
Satisfied now?

741
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,350
Would you like to ask

742
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,210
the rest of your brothers as well?

743
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,750
Do you really think

744
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,080
I don't dare to kill you?

745
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,330
Since I left Ningguta,

746
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,270
I've been walking on the edge every day.

747
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,960
If everyone in the city

748
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,310
can be saved because of me today,

749
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
my death will be worth it.

750
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Look at these people.

751
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,520

What difference does it make
if they leave the city?

756
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,240
Everyone's fate

757
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,390
is already written by heaven.

758
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,290
Is there really

759
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,690
an all‑powerful heaven?

760
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,460
I don't believe it.

761
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,440
If there really was one,

762
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,350
there'd be no war,

763
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,270
no disasters.

764
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,680
And your rebellion—

765
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,920
was that heaven's idea too?

766
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:35,960
Sir.

767
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,080
Please invite Mr. Gu.

768
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,820
Mr. Gu, please.

769
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,960
Mr. Gu, you risked your life

770
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,370
for the country.

771
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,360
Thank you for your hard work.

772
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,960
I don't deserve such praise.

773
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,800
These men...

774
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,800
Everyone who has returned
to the rightful side,

775
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,400
listen up!

776
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,390
Lay down your weapons

777
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,070
and gather at the North Camp!

778
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,800
Weren't you supposed to send us home?

779
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,000
We have no weapons left!

780
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
What do you need weapons for?

781
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,370
-I want to go home!
-I want to go home!

782
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,940
We want to go home!

783
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,510
I want to go home!

784
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,110
I want to go back!

785
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,280
Sir,

786
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,800
don't!

787
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,670
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

788
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,840
Since they've already surrendered,

789
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,370
they're still citizens of the Qing Empire.

790
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,370
You can't do this.

791
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,860
You misunderstood.

792
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,510
It's a misunderstanding.

793
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,510
I'll talk to them.

794
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,030
Fellow brothers,

795
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,400
I am Qiao Song, the Governor of Anhui.

796
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,590
Since you've surrendered,

797
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,960
you're still good subjects
of the imperial court.

798
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,620
Therefore,

799
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,030
we've cleared out the North Camp
to house you.

800
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,650
First,

801
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,110
you've been under siege too long.

802
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,480
Your bodies are weak

803
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,000
and need food.

804
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Second,

805
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,440
you need to shave your heads.

806
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:08,880
Third,

807
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,030
you need to
change out of your military uniforms.

808
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,320
The area around for hundreds of miles

809
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,800
is filled with
the imperial court's troops.

810
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,530
You can't just go out like this.

811
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,110
If you think

812
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,930
I have any ulterior motives...

813
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,190
Come on.

814
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,690
Put down your guns!

815
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,880
Clear the way!

816
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,330
If anyone still wants to leave,

817
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,400
I...

818
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,880
will respectfully see you off.

819
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,360
Let's go, brothers!

820
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,280
The food is ready!

821
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,090
The water is boiling!

822
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,720
After eating,

823
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,760
you can bathe and get a shave.

824
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,220
Tomorrow,
you'll all get your travel money!

825
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,030
Let's go!

826
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,440
Come on.

827
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,830
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

828
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,830
Gu.

829
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,420
Come on.

830
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,320
Let's go for a drink.

831
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,840
Sir,

832
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,340
I apologize
for my offensive words earlier.

833
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,760
Now you're being too formal with me.

834
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,440
Gu, your loyalty and bravery
are unmatched.

835
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,150
Alone, risking your life,

836
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,510
you rescued
so many civilians and soldiers.

837
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,590
I've already had the adviser
draft a memorial

838
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,120
and rush it to the throne
to report your merit.

839
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,450
Yes.

840
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,320
The Empress Dowager and Sixth Prince

841
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,760
will be very pleased when they see it.

842
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,880
You'll certainly be promoted.

843
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,290
We must have

844
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,220
a preemptive celebration drink.

845
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,800
That won't be necessary.

846
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,280
Let's go.

847
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,710
Please.

848
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,480
Please.

849
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,450
Your Highness.

850
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,840
Who allowed the Princess Consort
to come up?

851
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Don't blame them.

852
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,230
I insisted on coming.

853
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,920
Stand back.

854
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,090
I'll keep you company.

855
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,750
What were you thinking about?

856
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,670
I was thinking...

857
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,030
if we weren't in wartime,

858
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,190
you and I

859
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,710
standing up here on the city wall
enjoying the view

860
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,840
would be wonderful.

861
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,040
If there were no war,

862
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,800
you'd still be mining coal in Guangxi.

863
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,200
I wouldn't even know you.

864
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,710
Yes.

865
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,920
Perhaps

866
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,170
you've already married Gu Pingyuan.

867
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,000
What?

868
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,190
Are you still angry with him?

869
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,830
A real man distinguishes
between gratitude and grudges.

870
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,500
He treated you well.

871
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,450
Even though he offended me,

872
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,080
I won't hold it against him.

873
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,370
This Gu—

874
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,320
he's first‑class
in both character and ability.

875
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,150
I'm just worried

876
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,230
that being around those corrupt officials,

877
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,890
he'll get himself into trouble
sooner or later.

878
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,000
What do you mean?

879
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,930
Never mind.

880
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,590
Not understanding this makes life easier.

881
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,060
I'm just curious.

882
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,150
You still care about him, don't you?

883
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,920
Look.

884
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,190
All those densely packed

885
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,850
Qing troops outside the city—

886
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,670
they know we're short

887
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,150
on food and ammunition—

888
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,850
so why haven't they attacked?

889
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,030
Because they want to make money.

890
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,110
As long as we're still alive,

891
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,580
they can

892
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,670
keep asking the imperial court for men,

893
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,360
money,

894
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,400
and weapons,

895
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,580
and the imperial court will keep giving.

896
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,880
Once the imperial court
can no longer provide,

897
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,080
then they'll attack.

898
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,440
In their eyes, we're nothing

899
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,790
but a tool for promotion and profit.

900
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,880
Gu came to persuade us to surrender

901
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,540
because someone was trying to kill him.

902
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,360
They wanted to use me

903
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,760
to take his life.

904
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,590
There are no good people

905
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,870
around him.

906
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,940
You mean

907
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,400
they sent him here to die?

908
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,700
But Gu is

909
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,900
extremely clever.

910
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,090
He must have seen through this.

911
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,220
That's also his weakness.

912
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,880
What?

913
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,470
Being too kind-hearted.

914
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,370
In these chaotic times,
good people don't survive.

915
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,550
Honey,

916
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,010
it's windy up here. Please go down now.

917
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,030
Guard!

918
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,120
Send the Princess Consort down.

919
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,070
Yes.

920
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,890
They're about to attack.

921
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,570
Brothers!

922
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,550
There's food, brothers!

923
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,180
Don't rush, brothers!

924
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,760
There are stir-fried dishes over there!

925
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,600
And wine too!

926
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,410
There's plenty!

927
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,480
Don't fight over it! Don't fight over it!

928
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,110
There's enough for everyone!

929
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,120
Don't rush!

930
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,160
Slow down! Slow down!

931
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,910
Give me one! Give me one!

932
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,320
Mr. Gu.

933
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,400
Mr. Gu.

934
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Mr. Gu!

935
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,930
You deserve the most credit!

936
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,130
A toast to you

937
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,660
from the two of us.

938
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,360
-Here.
-Fill it up.

939
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,440
-Fill it up.
-Sirs,

940
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,070
I really can't handle alcohol.

941
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,320
Please stop forcing me to drink.

942
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,000
Alright.

943
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,440
Gu, that's absolutely unacceptable.

944
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,110
Come on.

945
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,920
Come on.

946
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,260
If I give you one reason,

947
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,710
I can skip this drink.

948
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,800
What is it?

949
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,920
When you

950
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,490
sent me into the city today,

951
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,270
you didn't think

952
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,350
I wouldn't make it back alive, right?

953
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,540
Mr. Gu,

954
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
what makes you say that?

955
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,640
What qualifications do I have

956
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,440
to be this Pacification Commissioner?
