It seems to have a hint of

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,530
pine needle fragrance,

191
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,200
like the scent of morning sunlight

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,060
streaming through a pine forest.

193
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Father.

194
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,490
You heard that?

195
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,610
You know what this is called?

196
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,450
This is called
"goods find their discerning buyer."

197
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,600
So stop boasting about

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
no one understanding you.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,750
There is a pine needle fragrance.

200
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,210
You're absolutely right.

201
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,440
This cast iron wok of mine,

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,390
do you know how old it is?

203
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,300
No idea.

204
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,900
Made during the Jiajing era
of the Ming Dynasty.

205
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,140
It's this old?

206
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,200
This has been passed down
from the elders.

207
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,380
The older a wok is, the better it works,
you know?

208
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
It's just it rusts easily.

209
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,650
And it gets hot to the touch.

210
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,940
You need to use it often

211
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,510
and maintain it regularly.

212
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,660
Do you know how

213
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,050
our elders maintained these woks?

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,060
With pine needles?

215
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,830
That's right.

216
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,600
Stir-frying pine needles
serves two purposes:

217
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
first, to let the young ones
practice their craft;

218
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,970
second, to extract the oil
from the pine needles

219
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,100
to season the wok.

220
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,900
This wok has been used for
hundreds of years,

221
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
so naturally the tea takes on

222
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,180
that subtle pinewood aroma.

223
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,950
You can savor it subtly,
yet can't quite catch it.

224
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,270
That's the beauty of it—

225
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670
in its subtlety.

226
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,140
Combined with the way
I control the heat when frying the tea,

227
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,520
it makes the tea

228
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,310
taste fresh on the palate

229
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,460
with a lingering, delicate aftertaste.

230
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,850
Alright, Father.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,460
Stop weighing yourself up

232
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,170
and singing your own praises.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
How is

234
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,850
Mr. Bai's health?

235
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,240
He's gotten better.

236
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,970
That's good.

237
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
After I finish processing this tea,

238
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,210
I'll go check on him.

239
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,130
Bring some more fresh tea leaves.

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,690
I-I'll help.

241
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,440
Hurry up.

242
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,910
Listen, Pingyuan.

243
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm just like Mr. Bai,

244
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,830
with only one daughter.

245
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,340
If anyone tries to take my daughter away,

246
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,600
I'll kill him.

247
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,230
I think Pingwen

248
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,280
is a good man.

249
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,090
To save his life,

250
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,140
how about letting him be
my live-in son-in-law?

251
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,400
What's going on with you guys?

252
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,100
Chop-chop.

253
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,470
[Gu's Mansion]

254
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,040
Mother.

255
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,780
It smells wonderful.

256
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,370
Give it a taste.

257
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,320
What's the rush?

258
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,840
I haven't finished enjoying the aroma yet.

259
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Drinking it now

260
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,010
would be a waste.

261
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,790
Mrs. Gu,

262
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,150
you're an expert.

263
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,170
I've grown tea my whole life

264
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
and have only managed to
understand a little.

265
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,570
I wouldn't dare show off
in front of you, Mr. Liao.

266
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,980
It's truly excellent.

267
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,860
So tell me,

268
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,880
what makes it so good?

269
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,060
As this tea goes down

270
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,330
from my lips to tongue,

271
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,540
and then to throat,

272
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,010
the aroma changes at every point.

273
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,370
The fragrance is also quite peculiar.

274
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,750
There's the fresh scent of pine needles

275
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
and also a hint of orchid fragrance.

276
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,390
But I'm clearly drinking

277
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,870
our family's Silver Bud tea.

278
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,110
What's going on here?

279
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,680
Why don't you take a guess?

280
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,260
Well, I think

281
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,570
since they burned the tea plantation,

282
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
the soil got strong fire energy.

283
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,560
And before harvesting the tea,

284
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,170
there were two rainfalls.

285
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,650
The rain before Qingming Festival

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
is heavy with yin energy.

287
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,150
The bright fire meets the yin water.

288
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,210
Tea growers

289
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,670
call this fragrance
"the aroma of providence."

290
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,510
I don't know if I'm right.

291
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,460
That's exactly it.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Mrs. Gu.

293
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,630
I'm truly impressed by you.

294
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,750
You're a real expert.

295
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
So here's what I'll do.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,920
From now on,

297
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,950
I'll process tea for your family

298
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,520
without charging a single penny.

299
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,670
This won't do.

300
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,480
Mr. Liao.

301
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,090
Since we've obtained this fine tea,

302
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,620
why don't you give it a name?

303
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,390
Then I'll respectfully oblige.

304
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,860
I've been processing tea my entire life,

305
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,630
and this is the masterpiece of my life.

306
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,270
There's an ancient book

307
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,000
on tea processing in my house.

308
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,420
The book says,

309
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,140
"its fragrance resembles orchids,

310
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,220
and its buds whiter than snow,

311
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,940
thus named Orchid Snow."

312
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,250
What do you think

313
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,240
of the name Orchid Snow?

314
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,870
It sounds beautiful.

315
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,440
Great.

316
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,400
Orchid Snow.

317
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,240
That's it then.

318
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,900
Alright.

319
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,550
I'll go check on Mr. Bai.

320
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,750
I'll go with you.

321
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,320
Let's go.

322
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,220
Mr. Liao.

323
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,720
I've asked Pingwen

324
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,510
to inform everyone in the village.

325
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,890
I'm thinking about selling all the tea

326
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,290
of our village this year.

327
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,910
Are you crazy?

328
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,220
As you said,

329
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,840
this tea has a unique aroma,

330
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,030
which is truly extraordinary.

331
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,790
I think it's a great business opportunity.

332
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,450
So you know how to do business?

333
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,750
I didn't realize that.

334
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,580
Do you know who

335
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
all this tea is for?

336
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,610
I do.

337
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,080
Isn't it that Master Hou?Mr. Hou Er

338
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,080
He always buys

339
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,760
our tea at

340
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,980
the lowest price,

341
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,030
[Gu's Mansion]

342
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,750
and he often

343
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,200
delays paying the tea farmers.

344
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,060
So I want to take this opportunity

345
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
to sell it myself,

346
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,510
so as to give back to the villagers

347
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,370
and let them make some profit too.

348
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,080
You... Sell it yourself?

349
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,680
Let me tell you something.

350
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,160
Tea

351
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,220
is just like a young lady—

352
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
once this period passes,

353
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,580
it won't be worth much.

354
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,530
Thinking about

355
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,080
doing business.

356
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,390
I mean, you...

357
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,600
I beat those 10 people so badly

358
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,670
that they even called me "father."

359
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,270
"Father."

360
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,300
What are you doing?

361
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,510
Why don't you

362
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,460
consider my suggestion?

363
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,960
Pingwen!

364
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,120
I asked you to collect tea buds.

365
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,550
How many have you collected?

366
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,410
5,000 catties.

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
5,000 catties?

368
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,680
You bought the whole village's tea?

369
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,970
You think I was joking?

370
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,050
I really bought it.

371
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,390
That's quite a move.

372
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,030
You're young, yet quite ambitious.

373
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,820
This time,

374
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,829
you'll have to fight it out with them.

375
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,960
Want to make a bet

376
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,910
and see who wins?

377
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,069
No.

378
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,440
Father.

379
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,480
I've been thinking.

380
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,550
Those tea-processing utensils of ours,

381
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,940
let's not take them back.

382
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,400
So you won't pawn them again.

383
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,550
Otherwise, you'll even have nothing
to brag about.

384
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,770
Not taking them back?

385
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,790
Then who's going to maintain the wok?

386
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,790
You had it pawned for half a year.

387
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,160
I didn't see you maintaining it either—

388
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,069
just left it in the pawnshop to rust.

389
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,099
Don't always say things

390
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,290
I don't like to hear in front of others.

391
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,330
What do we do
if we don't take the wok back?

392
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,590
Leave it at his house.

393
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,190
We'll come back to process tea again
next year.

394
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,880
Gu Pingwen.

395
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,870
Let's talk.

396
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,770
I can see right through

397
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,800
your little schemes!

398
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,490
Ouch, ouch.

399
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,710
Control your father!

400
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,400
Stop it.

401
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,300
Alright.

402
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,900
We still need to visit Mr. Bai.

403
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,210
I'm watching you.

404
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,270
The boiling water

405
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,660
has different stages.

406
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,200
Right now, it's at the "crab-eye boil,"

407
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
when it looks like the eyes of a crab.

408
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,420
At this point,

409
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,440
the water is 70% cooked

410
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,480
and 30% raw—

411
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,800
perfect for

412
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,240
brewing aged tea.

413
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,700
Look,

414
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,930
now

415
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,770
it's at "lotus-flower boil."

416
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,100
From bottom to top,

417
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,590
it forms a column of water,

418
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,450
and the water bubbles grow larger
as they rise.

419
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,110
The temperature now

420
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,250
is 90% cooked

421
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
and 10% raw.

422
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,980
For brewing fresh tea,

423
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,020
this is the perfect timing.

424
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,250
This water temperature

425
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,940
can also remove the grassy smell

426
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,240
from the tea leaves.

427
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,310
Look.

428
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,790
This is what we call "lotus-leaf boil."

429
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,520
It's 100% cooked.

430
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,420
When a person gets old,

431
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,210
everything clears up—

432
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,730
except the blood vessels.

433
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,270
They lose interest

434
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,740
in worldly matters.

435
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,070
Living on in good health is alright,

436
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,350
but if they're alive
and constantly sick and frail,

437
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,880
then there's no point in it.

438
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,400
Might as well die early
and reincarnate sooner.

439
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,940
Father.

440
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,910
You're talking nonsense again.

441
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,410
This snow you preserved last year

442
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,750
is really excellent.

443
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,380
If you like it, drink more.

444
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,380
It was Yimei's doing.

445
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
I could never manage that kind of

446
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,820
slow, meticulous work.

447
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,640
This snow was collected so well.

448
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,340
I really can't bear to use it.

449
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,410
If it's all gone,

450
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,610
what will you drink?

451
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,050
I won't be drinking it for much longer.

452
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,000
That's true.

453
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,810
Just drink it all.

454
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,810
That kid is quite skillful.

455
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
Every winter she would store

456
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,870
dozens of jars of snow in the cellar

457
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,470
for me to use for brewing tea.

458
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,400
Those days are gone now.

459
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,110
People can't possibly drink good tea

460
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,700
for a whole lifetime.

461
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,550
When we have good tea, we drink it—

462
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
there's no need to hold back.

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,750
And when it's gone, don't dwell on it.

464
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
If you dwell on it,

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,060
you're just making yourself suffer.

466
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,790
That's true.

467
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,200
I've enjoyed more than 10 years

468
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,510
of my daughter's care.

469
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
How can I still be clinging to
these things?

470
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,410
You see things more clearly than I do.

471
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,830
What's wrong?

472
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,630
Nothing.

473
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,110
Nothing?

474
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,900
You know, a gambler's eyes

475
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
are as sharp as scissors.

476
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,080
Saying nothing's wrong?

477
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,460
Mr. Bai...

478
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
He's suffering greatly.

479
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,200
Who in this world doesn't suffer?

480
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,920
Even the Emperor himself—

481
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,680
he used to be that happy,

482
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,560
yet he died in Rehe,

483
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,520
becoming a ghost in a foreign land.

484
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,200
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

485
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,920
Hurry up and plug

486
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,380
that hole under your nose.

487
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
Mr. Liao isn't wrong though.

488
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,370
Mr. Bai's pulse

489
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,320
has actually already stopped.

490
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,680
Sometimes I can feel it, sometimes not.

491
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,650
He's hanging on by a single breath.

492
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,920
I know

493
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,240
there's resentment in his heart

494
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,350
and can't let go of certain matters.

495
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,930
He always talks

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,680
as if he sees through everything,

497
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,010
but that may not be true.

498
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,480
People all have

499
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,050
their own attachments.

500
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,100
Think about it—

501
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,270
if anyone dares to
run off with my daughter,

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,390
I'll slaughter him with my own hands.

503
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,630
Listen to yourself.

504
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,650
These past days,

505
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,160
Mr. Bai can still occasionally

506
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,440
crack a joke or two,

507
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,960
but I know

508
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,490
he's just forcing himself.

509
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,780
My friend Bai spent his whole life
doing good deeds.

510
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,270
He doesn't deserve to suffer like this.

511
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,970
Mr. Liao,

512
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,300
what are you doing?

513
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,540
I'll go see him off.

514
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,470
What are you trying to do?

515
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,240
Bai.

516
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,640
This cup is already old.

517
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
It's okay to replace it.

518

519
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,380
Holding onto it is pointless.

520
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,310
Thanks a lot.

522
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,620
Have a peaceful journey.

You're a scholar,

570
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,220
there isn't much wine.

571

Catch your breath first

585

00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,400
Is he the Almighty or something?

Do you need to be this scared?

594

This year, he heard you bought it all,

599

and he's a bit... A bit upset.

600
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,310
He's resting at the ancestral hall now.

601
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,710
He sent me to ask you over.

602

Then tell me. Scare me.

and sold it to you.

this is the kind of thing
that can bring trouble.

so we can prepare accordingly.

[Old Master Hu, Head of
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association]

733

734
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
of transporting southern tea to the north,

735
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,060
just to make everyone's lives

736
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,840
a bit more comfortable.

He'll surely find a way.

752
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,400
Speaking of this Grand Tea Competition,

753
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,690
it's organized by the greatest merchant

754
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,520
under heaven,

755
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,310
the capital's biggest tycoon,

756
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,270
Li Million,

757
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,400
Master Li Wantang.

758
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,220
It just so happens that

759
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,400
the Empress Dowager's birthday
is approaching,

760
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,270
and the young Emperor

761
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,960
wants to please his mother.

762
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,480
That's why Master Li Wantang

763
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,680
came up with this idea

764
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
of gathering all the famous types of tea

765
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,320
from across the land

766
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,530
to Beijing

767
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,670
for a competition,

768
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,230
to rank them in order.

769
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,340
In recent years,

770
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,230
tea in the capital

771
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,150
has been as precious as gold.

772
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,820
One tael of ordinary Maojian

773
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,610
costs two strings of cash,

774
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,639
and one tael of fine Hou Kui

775
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,590
or Longjing

776
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,630
costs one tael of gold per tael.

777
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,920
Still in short supply.

778
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,280
And now,

779
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,000
the finest teas from across the land
gather in the capital.

780
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,320
competing for the top position

781
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,050
and fighting for market share.

782
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,840
The top-quality teas

783
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,000
are offered to the two Empress Dowagers,

784
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,440
with His Majesty himself
inscribing calligraphy

785
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,480
on a grand plaque,

786
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,320
making them famous throughout the world.

787
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,110
Wouldn't you agree

788
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,480
that this is truly
a once-in-a-millennium event?

789
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,960
But there's something I don't understand.

790
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,550
How do they rank these teas?

791
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,420
Hou Kui has its own merits,

792
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,150
and Silver Bud has its own charm.

793
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,510
Some people prefer fresh tea,

794
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,840
others prefer aged tea.

795
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,110
Thousands of people

796
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,710
have thousands of different tastes.

797
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,000
So how do they determine
the top tea under heaven?

798
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Well...

799
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,460
I've got it.

800
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,030
Whoever holds the higher rank

801
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,100
gets to decide.

802
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,620
If His Majesty

803
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,030
declares something the best in the world,

804
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,760
you can't exactly disagree, can you?

805
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,490
That's true.

806
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,230
Indeed.

807
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,880
Wholeheartedly convinced.

808
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,400
That's great.

809
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,360
I've got something to say!

810
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Are you crazy?

811
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,110
I can't hold it in any longer!

812
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,780
Excuse me, everyone.

813
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,610
This is a distant cousin of mine

814
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,070
from another family line
who's not very capable.

815
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,070
His name is Hou Er.

816
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,810
He usually helps me manage
the tea collection.

817
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,050
My apologies

818
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,270
if he's offended you.

819
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,070
What do you have to say? Just say it.

820
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,490
If there's someone who doesn't cooperate,

821
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,030
who doesn't take

822
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,070
our Tea Merchants' Association seriously,

823
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,880
what should we do?

824
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,410
What do you mean they don't
take us seriously?

825
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,220
Hoarding goods—

826
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,960
just refusing to sell to us.

827
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,920
Our Tea Merchants' Association
isn't a government office.

828
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,760
If they don't sell,

829
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,090
of course someone else will buy from them.

830
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,920
Did you run your mouth

831
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,320
and offend someone?

832
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,630
Absolutely impossible.

833
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,290
Please have a taste of our tea.

834
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,250
It's excellent.

835
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,330
That guy is just an exile.

836
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,030
He's been inciting the villagers,

837
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,670
telling them not to sell tea
to our association.

838
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,030
You know,

839
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,360
it would be one thing
if he just refuses to sell.

840
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,480
The problem is he said
all those nasty things,

841
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,800
insulting you.

842
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,550
I really couldn't stand it.

843
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,340
How would he even know who I am?

844
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,670
D-Don't talk nonsense.

845
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,960
I'm not! You...

846
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,080
Everyone's here.

847
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,570
About this matter,

848
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,760
Old Master Hu may be able to tolerate it,

849
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,210
but I, Hou Er, cannot.

850
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,790
From today on,

851
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,850
if anyone buys

852
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,840
even a single leaf of tea
from that village,

853
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
it will be showing disrespect
to Old Master Hu

854
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,540
and to me, Hou Er.

855
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,710
I'm telling you

856
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,110
that guy's name right now.

857
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,940
His name is Gu Pingyuan.

858
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,540
Gu Pingyuan.

859
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,380
Gu Pingyuan.

860
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,360
You're Mr. Gu Pingyuan, right?

861
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,820
And you're Mr. Gu Pingwen.

862
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,650
Mr. Hou Er

863
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,470
has warned every shop

864
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,360
that if any tea from Shanjian Village

865
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,830
comes in, even one tael,

866
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,190
that shop will be shut down.

867
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,970
So as for the Huizhou area,

868
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,180
don't expect to sell any tea here.

869
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,110
The Tea Merchants' Association

870
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,770
has such powerful influence.

871
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,490
Indeed.

872
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,980
For hundreds of years,

873
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,380
all the tea transported north and south
by river has been under their authority.

874
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,920
Merchants' associations
across the country

875
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,320
communicate with each other,

876
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,190
and in this trade,
they're the ones at the top.

877
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,550
Whatever grievances we have,

878
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,780
we can't speak it out.

879
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,250
How's that?

880
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,440
You heard all that?

881
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,210
What's the use of me hearing it?

882
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
You're the one who offended him,

883
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,400
not me.

884
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,310
Pingyuan.

885
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
What are you thinking about?

886
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,440
Tea.

887
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,070
Come up with an idea then.

888
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,160
Do you have any ideas?

889
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
If you ask me,

890
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,670
just apologize and admit you were wrong.

891
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,630
Why insist on butting heads like this?

892
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,230
So you also think I can't win?

893
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,980
What makes you think you can win?

894
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,810
We've visited so many shops—

895
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,840
which one of them dared to buy our tea?

896
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,800
I believe there must be a place
in this world

897
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,130
where reason prevails.

898
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,120
Let's do this.

899
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
When we get back, sort out

900
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,550
the best of our Orchid Snow tea.

901
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,840
I'm going to the capital

902
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,240
to compete against them.

903
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,510
You're going to the Grand Tea Competition?

904
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,190
You think you can bring back

905
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,360
His Majesty's gold-lettered plaque?

906
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,630
Even with a knife at your neck,

907
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,690
you still won't miss a chance to brag.

908
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
Old Master Hu.

909
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
You've got a visitor.

910
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,710
I, Gu Pingyuan,

911
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,980
pay my respects to you, Old Master Hu.

912
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,360
Mr. Gu,

913
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
please sit down and talk.

914
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,060
So you're the one

915
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,150
leading the others in refusing to sell tea

916
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,150
to our Tea Merchants' Association?

917
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
I wouldn't say I led them.

918
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,000
Mr. Hou Er haggled too ruthlessly.

919
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,210
I was upset at the time

920
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,920
and ended up speaking rather harshly.

921
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,710
Old Master Hu, I know you are

922
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,760
the head of
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association,

923
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,020
so I've come specifically to apologize.

924
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,320
This Hou Er

925
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,320
is indeed a distant relative of mine

926
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,780
from another family line.

927
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,670
However,

928
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,050
since everyone

929
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,380
recognizes me as

930
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,940
the head of
the Tea Merchants' Association,

931
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,630
they all say

932
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,070
I'm quite fair in my dealings.

933
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,090
If Hou Er was in any way

934
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,180
remiss in his words,

935
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,150
please forgive him, Mr. Gu.

936
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,990
Please trouble yourself

937
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,690
to tell the villagers

938
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,570
to deliver the tea leaves

939
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,240
directly to
the Tea Merchants' Association.

940
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,390
Old Master Hu.

941
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,840
This is the new tea our family has grown.

942
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,670
I've specially brought it over

943
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,600
for you to taste.

944
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,610
[Orchid Snow]

945
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,710
Isn't this Silver Bud?

946
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,670
What do these words

947
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,220
"Orchid Snow" mean?

948
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,110
This tea is blessed by heaven and earth.

949
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,920
After it's grown,

950
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,280
it has a unique aroma—

951
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,490
a subtle fragrance of orchids,

952
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,160
yet also like green pines after snow:

953
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,800
crisp, pure, and noble.

954
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,130
That's why we renamed it

955
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,210
"Orchid Snow."

956
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,550
The name of the tea

957
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,230
was decided by our ancestors.

958
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,890
By changing its name randomly like this,

959
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
aren't you breaking

960
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,540
the ancestors' rules?

961
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,010
No wonder Hou Er wouldn't take it.

962
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,040
Change it back to Silver Bud,

963
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,370
and then I'll taste it.

964
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,630
Old Master Hu.

965
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,030
This tea's fragrance

966
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,190
is truly different from
ordinary Silver Bud.

967
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,520
It's a brand new flavor.

968
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,360
Why don't you give it a try?

969
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,840
New or old, what nonsense.

970
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,070
I've been in the tea business

971
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,410
my entire life.

972
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,840
How could I allow
such disrespect for tradition?

973
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
If I let you get away with this today,

974
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,970
what if everyone

975
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,080
starts renaming them randomly?

976
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,000
Should I discipline them or not?

977
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,050
Change it back.

978
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,180
I'm sorry. No can do.

979
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,460
What are you doing?

980
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,650
I can walk by myself.

981
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,590
Let's go. Hurry.

982
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,370
Let go.

983
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,770
They're finally back.

984
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,030
Come on.

985
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,030
Sit.

986
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,710
Everyone's here.

987
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,660
Tell us what happened.

988
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,030
I don't quite understand yet.

989
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,890
What happened?

990
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,270
The Tea Merchants' Association

991
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,000
has officially announced

992
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,150
they won't buy our village's tea anymore.

993
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,610
Was it Hou Er who said that?

994
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,800
Not just Hou Er.

995
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,450
If it were just Hou Er,
that would be fine.

996
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,710
But if the Tea Merchants' Association

997
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,970
refuses to buy our tea,

998
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,190
then it would be

999
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,120
a disaster for our entire village.

1000
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,360
Indeed.

1001
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,430
Come on.

1002
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,960
Bring the stuff up here.

1003
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,840
Tomorrow, you two brothers

1004
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,900
carry these briers

1005
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,670
and come with me to
the Tea Merchants' Association.
