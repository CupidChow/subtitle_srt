Mr. Zhao.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,680
It's for self-defense.

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,040
I heard you like thrills.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,920
How did you know that?

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,000
Turn around.

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
What new game are we playing?

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
Are you ready?

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,600
Ready.

A stand-in dancer at Ciro's Club.

20

Years ago, she went undercover here

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,640
to gather information
on the Haitang Society.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Shoot.

23
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,960
What grudge does she have
against the Haitang Society?

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,080
Ten years ago,

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,880
her father was killed by members
of the Haitang Society.

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,800
The murderer remains unknown.

27

No!

Stop! Don't run!

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,960
She looks a lot like you.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Young Lady, what do you think?

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,760
Do you wish to meet her?

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
If she survives.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,760
Split up and find her.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
Persistent as a ghost.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,990
If you don't want to get caught,
cooperate with me.

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,080
Go.

44
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640

You're finally here.

47

I thought something happened.

48
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,990
Why are there so many members
of the Haitang Society here tonight?

49
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,680
Did you mess up the intel?

50
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Don't question my intel.

51
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,390
Do you know how hard it is
to gather intel?

52
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,480
Get to the point.

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,280
The president of the Haitang Society
was assassinated tonight.

54
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,720
They're hunting the culprit.

55
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
This.

56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
I found it on Mr. Zhao.

57
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,280

This is insider information
about a Haitang Society gathering.

63
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Manli,

64
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
you absolutely must not act impulsively.

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Without the right identity,

66
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
you can't even get in.

67
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,680

I've contacted an informant.

71

Let's go meet them first.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
Excuse me, sir,

73
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600

let's get straight to the point.

88

How can you help me get close
to the Haitang Society?
