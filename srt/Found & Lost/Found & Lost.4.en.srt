1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,800
(Tango.)

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,960
(A game where
passion and restraint intertwine.)

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,640
(Do you advance?)

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,240
(Or retreat?)

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
(Resist)

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,440
(Or surrender?)

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,480
(You'll never know what happens next.)

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,180
(Ciro's Club)

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,680
(Like a love)

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,720
(that's both dangerous and romantic.)

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,320
(And the greatest love)

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,960
(often end in death.)

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,500
=Found & Lost=

14
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,460
=Episode 4=

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,080
Let me take a look.

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Miss!

17
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,560
Are you all right?

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,280
Take it slow.

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,960
Here, have a seat.

20
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,920
(Lu Fengtian)
If I'd known you were here, Mr. Yang,

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,860
(Young Master of Ciro's Club)
I would've given you a toast myself.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
I apologize for my oversight.

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Not at all.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm afraid it's me
who disturbed Ciro's Club's business,

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
causing trouble for you, Mr. Lu.

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,640
Business is the least of my concerns.

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,800
However, there was a murder
at Ciro's Club recently.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,240
We had to close
for a few days before reopening.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,600
I hope

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,600
you will forgive the chaos
and not frighten off other...

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
My business here is done.

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,880
But your club certainly
has some glaring security issues.

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,000
Too many pests have sneaked in.

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
You should do well to tighten security.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Your advice is duly noted.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Let's go.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,440
This lady's leg is still bleeding.

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,490
Does she need medical attention?

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,000
I noticed
Ms. Chen Bi's exceptional dance skills.

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,400
Could she be a regular
at Ciro's Club?

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
Mr. Yang, you jest.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
Anyone who comes
to Ciro's Club is my guest,

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,990
and I make sure
to take good care of them.

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
A beauty like her

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
is unforgettable.

46
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,760
If I'd met her before,

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I'd surely remember.

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,960
(This man is no easy opponent.)

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
True.

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Ms. Chen, having narrowly escaped death

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
and just recovered,

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
likely hasn't had time

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
for nightly revelry.

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,680
Come on.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
(Manli,)

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
(keep yourself safe.)

57
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,780
(Haitang Society Internal Documents)

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,590
- Young Master.
- I'll get them.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,920
Important documents?

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,320
Ms. Chen, you're too careless.

61
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Your wounds weren't properly treated,
and now you've soaked them in water.

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
It's bound to get infected.

63
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Leave us.

64
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,720
That's not necessary.

65
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
I can do it myself.

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,600
You didn't have to go that far.

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
Weren't those important documents?

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Drop the act.

69
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,080
Why did you really come back?

70
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,760
Don't you know about the rumors?

71
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,240
They're saying I'm the one
who orchestrated your family's massacre.

72
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Is it true?

73
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
If it were,

74
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,320
what would you do?

75
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,960
I'd kill you.

76
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
I was just teasing you.

77
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
A helpless woman like me.

78
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,800
Who else in this world can I depend on?

79
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
If you say it wasn't you,

80
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,440
I'll believe you.

81
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
The wounds were cleaned.

82
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
You can bandage it yourself.

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
(It's her.)

84
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
Young Madam,

85
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,920
Young Master
sent some gifts for you.

86
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,000
Come in.

87
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,200
What are all these?

88
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,680
These are the latest fashions
from Yong'an Department Store.

89
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,520
It's a token
of Young Master's care for you

90
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Young Madam,

91
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
hurry and dress up.

92
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,720
Young Master is waiting downstairs
to dine with you.

93
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,720
(What's going on here?)

94
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
Clear this away.

95
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,720
She doesn't like sweets.

96
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
How do you know she doesn't like sweets?

97
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Young Madam.

98
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,040
Why are you suddenly
giving me so many things?

99
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,680
My wife has just returned.

100
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,190
It's only right to prepare
some proper clothing for her.

101
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
(His sudden change in attitude)

102
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,760
(is definitely suspicious.)

103
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Young Master,

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,650
Master has requested your presence
at his mansion with Young Madam.

105
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I'll go change the color.

106
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,100
You only have ten minutes.

107
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
I'll wait for you downstairs.
