is worth a thousand gold.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
And Yang Ziqin?

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,360
He's been waiting patiently
by Lu Zekai's side.

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
If we join hands with him,

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,480
we can learn the truth
of the Chen family's massacre.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
You want to work with him?

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Are you listening to yourself?

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800

How can you believe

49

he is still your childhood friend?

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
I can be my own judge in this matter.

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,880
There are things too complicated
to be explained.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
I thought you'd understand.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,440
I do not trust anyone
working for the Haitang Society.

after all the mysteries we unravelled,

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,360
we can prove Yang Ziqin has nothing
to do with the Chen family's death.

62
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,120
How can you ignore this fact?

63
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,400
You're a coward.

64

The Chen family

189
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,080
has a priceless treasure.

190
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
It was a heliotrope seal
from the Ming dynasty.

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
If you can show us,

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,120
I'll acknowledge your identity.

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Torture and interrogate me
however you want.

194
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,440
I will always be Chen Bi.

195
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,680
Officer,

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,600
stop wasting your time.

197
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Punish her.

198
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,160
Beat her up

199
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
until she admits her crime.

200
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,360
Raid this location.

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
We've been here many times

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
and never found any opium.

203
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,440
The building is just a front.

204
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,480
The opium is hidden in the coffins.

205
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
I see.

206
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I knew it.

207
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,080
Opening a funeral shop in downtown

208
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,000
disregards the fengshui.

209
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
Something must be off.

210
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,800
What's wrong?

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,920
Look at this.
