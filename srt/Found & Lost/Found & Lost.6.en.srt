00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,760
(Wait for me.)

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,800
You promised to show me the sunset.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,200
Look at us now.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,080
Caught up in the rain

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,280
and completely lost.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,480
Your leg is hurt.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,880
That knot

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,200
looks hideous.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,360
It's nothing like the one
my dad taught me.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,040
I invented this.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,200
Of course it's one of a kind.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
Let me show you.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Look.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,880
First we...

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,840
And then...

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,760
The cloth goes around here.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,680
And then, through this gap.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,080
See?

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,280
It's done.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
I remember the way now.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
I can carry you.

You're back.

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,000
How did you get hurt?

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
I've been in Mei Garden for some time.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,160
But I barely talked to you.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
So,

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,920
why are you in the mood to talk now?

31
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,360
You and Commander Yang acknowledged me.

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
It's my duty to care about you more.

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,440
Besides,

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,360
you resemble someone I used to know.

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,680
What kind of person?

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
A kind gentleman

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,640
with a gentle demeanor.

38
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,480
Well, you two aren't that similar.

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
You may go and get some rest.

43
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,880
(He uses the power
of the warlord)

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,480
(to rule over government officials
and the underbelly.)

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
(He smuggles firearms,)

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
(deals with opium,
and commits the worst sins.)

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,160
The Young Master was captured
and sent to a POW camp.

48
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Supply was running low,

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,220
so the warden let them
kill each other.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,200
(Only the Young Master survived.)

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
It will be nightfall soon.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Are you sure you can carry me home?

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,320
Don't worry.

54
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,040

I thought all doctors

took an oath to do no harm.

You save lives,

80
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,680
not take lives.

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,160
The Hippocratic Oath.

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,760
Yes.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Won't giving me this

84
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
earn you a ticket to hell?

85

I'm already there.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,760
But you, however,

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
you are quieter than usual.

88
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,120

Nothing.

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
I just thought

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,880
we've become people

92
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,760
we can't even recognize.

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Every change in us

94
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
is the result of our consent.

95
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
There are two types of people.

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Those who want to win

97
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,720
and those who are afraid to lose.

98
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
If they can't accept defeat,

99
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
they usually can't win anything.

100
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,640

you can choose to press on

103
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
or back out.

104
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Hesitation

105
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,600
is the worst option.

106
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,160
You worry too much.

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
Anything else you wish to tell me?

108
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Don't die.

What brings you here?

113
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,080

of the Ciro's Club.

114
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,920

121
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,520

You don't owe me any explanation.
