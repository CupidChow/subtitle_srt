1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,880
What do you have to say?

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,920
For ten years,

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,880
I've treated you like a son.

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,920
I trusted you.

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,880
You let me down.

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,640
You trusted me,

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,800
so you had me followed?

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,880
Did you really think I'd be that naive?

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,440
That you had nothing to do
with what Hao did?

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
I didn't want to believe it,

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,480
so I tested you
by killing him as a warning.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,040
Until today,

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,280
The son

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,880
who was once willing
to take a bullet for me

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
has betrayed me.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,240
No matter what,

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,040
considering our ten years

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
as father and son,

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
I'll leave you

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,360
some dignity.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm grateful for you too,

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Father.

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,865
=Found & Lost=

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,340
=Episode 22=

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
It's true when they say

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,680
raising a tiger is to court calamity.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
You don't have any bullets left, do you?

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
The father-son bond between us

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
was just a joke in the end.

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,240
Take this pen.

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
From today onward,

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,880
you are officially one
of the Yang family.

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,840
From now on,

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
you will be my most reliable weapon.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,880
As long as you work word,

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
I'll ensure you enjoy wealth and glory

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,040
beyond measure.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
Thank you, Father.

40
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
(From then on,)

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
(I always carried that pen with me,)

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,040
(a reminder of my sins.)

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,840
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,520
You acted on your own
and killed Commander Yang!

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,880
How do you expect me to explain this?

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,120
You're coming back with me
right now to confess!

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,420
What is the meaning of this?

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,440
Are you defying orders?

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not going back.

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,480
You…

51
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,680
Have you forgotten why you joined
the Pingyuan Army in the first place?

52
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,240
It's because I remembered

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
that I'm leaving.

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,240
I want to be a sheath again.

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,160
Huaijin,

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,080
do you know the true purpose
of a sheath?

57
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
It's not just to protect the blade.

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
Without

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,440
the sheath,

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,680
the blade has nowhere to hide.

61
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,520
It will be dark soon.

62
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,240
Are you sure you can get me home?

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
Don't worry.

64
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll get you home.

65
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,840
(Yang Ziqin, Su Manli,
Haitang Society Internal Member Records)

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
It's been tampered with.

67
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
I made sure she saw it.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
It's almost time for the funeral.

69
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,240
Notify the other four elders.

70
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
The raw opium they're looking for

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
is hidden in the warehouse
at Ciro's Club.

72
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,400
It'll be delivered tonight.

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
(Mourning)

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
(Yang Ziqin.)

75
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,000
(Three days ago,)

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,520
(my brother was killed
at Chengxiang Hall.)

77
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,307
(A noble spirit admired by all)
(The murderer Manli)

78
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,720
(gone too soon to the grief of friends)
(is confined in Puyu Hall.)

79
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,680
(If you wish to see her,)

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,280
(three days from now)

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,880
(at my brother's funeral,)

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
(I await)

83
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
(your arrival.)

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,720
How does it feel to attend

85
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,760
your enemy's funeral?

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
Not much of a feeling.

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,720
Even

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,680
if I got my revenge,

89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,440
my family and friends won't come back.

90
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,280
How coincidental.

91
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
I feel the same way.

92
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,710
Second Young Master,

93
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
Mr. Lu's raw opium

94
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,920
has been split among the four elders.

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Now they're celebrating at Ciro's Club.

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
Let's begin.

97
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,240
Let the funeral begin.

98
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,340
(A noble spirit admired by all,
gone too soon to the grief of friends)

99
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,080
You had a chance to escape.

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Why didn't you?

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,680
I'm the cause of all this.

102
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
If you want to kill or torture,
come for me.

103
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
Don't hurt anyone else.

104
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
I told you.

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
There's no way
I'd let you off that easily.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
I deliberately showed you

107
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
that board.

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,920
Or else

109
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,480
how would I get you to stay
and finish this last act with me?

110
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
You!

111
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Lu Fengtian!

112
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
One gave up her freedom.

113
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,640
One gave up his ideals.

114
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,280
How touching.

115
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't…

116
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't do it!

117
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Manli.

118
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,320
I've been thinking of how
to take revenge on you.

119
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Tell me.

120
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Should I let you trade your life

121
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,000
for the other's?

122
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Or should I kill him

123
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,080
right before your eyes?

124
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,440
Lu Fengtian!

125
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
Actually,

126
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
I came to take her away.

127
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
You still think you can take her away?

128
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,800
Lu Fengtian!

129
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Lu Fengtian!

130
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
Don't shoot!

131
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,640
Don't shoot!

132
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,880
Please don't shoot!

133
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,920
You do the honors.

134
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Manli!

135
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,920
Manli!

136
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,760
No…

137
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
I don't want to.

138
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't want to…

139
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
