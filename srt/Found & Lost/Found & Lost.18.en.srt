1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,520
Mr. Lu,

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,280
why did you

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,040
buy another set of building blocks?

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,000
When Tian was little,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
he loved playing with blocks.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,520
But back then, we were poor,

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,240
and he could only play
with what others threw away.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,680
I promised him

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,680
that when I had the money,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,400
I'd buy him the biggest
and best set of blocks.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,480
But I got too busy.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,280
Over ten years passed,

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,320
and I never got around to it.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Second Young Master will understand.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
You've worked so hard all these years,

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,040
all for his sake.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,480
To me,

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,480
these blocks are like the bond
between the two of you.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Look.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,440
These pieces represent you,

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
and this one

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,440
represents Second Young Master.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,520
Second Young Master
will surely be elated

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,920
when he sees
such a beautiful set of blocks.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
Let's hope he likes it.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,480
I have an appointment to get to.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,280
Tonight's Tian's birthday celebration.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,320
Make sure
there are extra dishes prepared.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,200
The kitchen's already been informed.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,960
But this morning,

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,640
when Second Young Master left,

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,120
I asked if he'd be back for dinner.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
He didn't say a word before leaving.

34
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:52,900
=Found & Lost=

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,860
=Episode 18=

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,940
(Chengxiang Hall)

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,360
You two,

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,040
guard the main gate.

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,940
(Lu Family Ancestral Hall)

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
Come out.

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,400
You don't seem surprised at all.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,000
I already knew it was you.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,880
Tian would never arrange
to meet me here.

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
Then why did you still come?

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,880
Because I'm curious about you.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
I thought you were
just a gold-digging performer,

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
but lately,

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,280
every major incident
has your involvement in it.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,680
A stand-in singer,

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
yet you're just like a rat.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
Impossible to get rid of.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
So, I wanted to meet you myself.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
I see you're not afraid of death.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Tell me,

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,440
what's your purpose in approaching Tian?

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
My meeting with Mr. Lu

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,520
was a coincidence.

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,280
But after what happened at Chen Garden,

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
I found out

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
that you two are brothers.

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
Ten years.

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,800
Ten years ago, on Qingbao Road,
you killed my father, Su Nianzhen.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,560
For every moment since then,

64
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,720
I've endured,

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,160
waiting for the chance to kill you
with my own hands.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Well,

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,360
I appreciate the sentiment.

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Though, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,520
Who is your father again?

70
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,520
Manli!

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
(Three, two,)

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,160
(one.)

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
(I've taken)

74
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,400
(countless lives.)

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
(I don't have time)

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
(to remember all their names.)

77
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
So, to you,

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
my father,

79
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Chen Bi,

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
Mr. Kun,

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
and all those lives

82
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,800
are just meaningless weeds?

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
You could say that.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,080
You animal!

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,520
Listen.

86
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,800
You're just like your friend.

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,800
Always using the weak's logic
to guilt-trip others.

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,320
Let me ask you this.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,160
If tears and pity were useful,

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
how did my brother and I

91
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
end up with nowhere to turn?

92
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't need anyone's pity.

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
All I ever wanted was to survive.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,840
To live with dignity,

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
together with my brother.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,960
That's my way.

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
Zekai!

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Tian.

99
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
You've gotten

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
stronger again.

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Fengtian!

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,800
What's wrong?

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,080
What happened?

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
Nothing.

105
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,040
You've gotten stronger lately.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Everything I've done,
risking my life to climb to the top,

107
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,400
has been to ensure that no one
would ever look down on you again.

108
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Zekai.

109
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Zekai…

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,800
You must harden your heart

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,600
to survive.

112
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,040
Zekai…

113
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,320
Zekai…

114
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,360
If my brother ever wronged you,

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
I apologize on his behalf.

116
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,080
An apology won't fix anything.

117
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,360
Do you really want to know
what's between me and your brother?

118
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Then come with me.

119
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,360
(Manli,)

120
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,080
(have you really thought this through?)

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,120
(Lu Zekai may be evil,)

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,960
(but Mr. Lu has never hurt you.)

123
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,960
(I don't have a choice.)

124
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
(Some people's happiness)

125
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,600
(is built on tearing apart others'.)

126
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
(So, I understand.)

127
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
(My revenge will be built the same way.)

128
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,400
(I'll repay what I owe you)

129
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,960
(in another way.)

130
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Why are you only reporting this now?

131
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,800
My apologies, Commander.

132
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
The news just came in last night.

133
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
What's the damage?

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
We've lost over a hundred men.

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,240
All opium plantations
in the Songhu region

136
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
have been destroyed.

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,440
We're short 10,000 guns

138
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,520
and 5,000 rounds of ammunition.

139
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
Did you find out who did it?

140
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,560
Not yet.

141
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,680
But the only ones
who know all the locations

142
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,080
of our opium fields and armories
are our own people.

143
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
So,

144
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
there's a mole.

145
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
Young Master!

146
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,160
What do you think will happen

147
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,160
after we get our revenge?

148
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,840
I've read countless stories
about revenge,

149
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,920
but I've never heard one
about what happens

150
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
after it's achieved.

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
There's no story

152
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,520
about what comes after revenge.

153
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Why?

154
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
Because after revenge

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,920
comes emptiness.

156
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,480
People think revenge will bring

157
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,280
the protagonist happiness,

158
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
but aside

159
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,160
from that momentary rush
of satisfaction,

160
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,360
nothing changes.

161
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,280
It might even get worse.

162
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,360
But I'm not worried about that.

163
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,680
I might not even be around by then.

164
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
