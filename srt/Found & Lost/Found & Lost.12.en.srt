00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
Quick! Keep him down!

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,720
I'm here to escort you
down the mountain!

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,040
Young Master Yang sent me.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,600
Over there is a...

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,040
That path is...

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,160
Go on!

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,040
Say something!

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Wake up!

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
Finish your sentence!

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,640
Wake up!

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,060

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,740
(Pingyuan)

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,080
So you infiltrated the Haitang Society
and the Commander's manor

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,880
to provide intelligence
to the Pingyuan Army,

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,490
and look for an opportunity
to dismantle them.

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,880
It's a sensitive identity.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,120
Anyone who knows about it
faces extreme danger.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,520
That's why I didn't plan to tell you.

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,500
(Pingyuan)

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,240
Since Master's passing,

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
I've been looking for you,

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,400
but every lead vanished into thin air.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,280
It wasn't until
I joined the Pingyuan Army

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,990
and went undercover
in the Haitang Society

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,160
that I learned
what really happened back then.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
It was Lu Zekai's doing.

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
The forces behind him are extensive.

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,360
Even the Chen family massacre
you're investigating

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,240
is connected to him,

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
so we can't act recklessly.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
For years,

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
he's colluded with the military,
financial tycoons,

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
and other factions

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
to expand the opium trade.

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I've been tracking
their transport routes

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
and backers.

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Right now,

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,040
they've stockpiled another
1,000 crates of opium from Persia.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm still trying to locate
where they're hidden.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Give me more time.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll unearth everyone involved.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
I'll agree to delay dealing
with Lu Zekai for now,

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
but you must promise

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
to help me rescue everyone.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
I'll save them, but I'm taking you
down the mountain first.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm not going anywhere
until I've saved everyone.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,240
You're unarmed. How will you save them?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,680
Are you sure?

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,320
Right now,

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
I hold the advantage.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,320
It's my life.

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
I decide where to go.

54
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,940
I'm not doing this for you.

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm doing it for myself.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,760

To survive,

you need trust and cooperation.

A common phenomenon in graveyards.

76
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,480
This area used to be
a paupers' cemetery,

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,520
a burial ground for the poor.

78
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Zhao Rong colluded
with the Haitang Society

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,320
to build a manor here,

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
turning it into a dumping ground
for murder victims.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,560
Now, the mountain is filled

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,520
with wronged souls

83
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,600
and wandering ghosts.

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's go.

85
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
(Baoyao Apothecary)

86
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Mr. Kun,

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
get someone to develop these photos

88
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
and make flyers
combining them with the text.

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Distribute them for free
through the paper boys tomorrow morning.

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,560
All right.

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,360
Ms. Chen,

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,120
Manli is still on that cursed mountain.

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,600
You need to get them to save her!

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,320
The situation is unclear.

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Acting rashly

96
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
would only burden her further.

97
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,240
What...

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
What does that mean?

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Are you going to leave her to die?

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,920
Don't you understand?

101
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,280
It's because of your impulsive actions
every time

102
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,840
that she ends up in danger!

103
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,240
I trust her.

104
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
Even if she's caught up
in this hunting game,

105
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
there's no guarantee

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
who is the hunter

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,240
and who is the prey.

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,520
Mr. Lu,

109
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
it's almost four hours.

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
Should we head back?

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,680
Mr. Lu,

112
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,890
we're entering
Inspector Zhao's territory now.

113
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Be alert.

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
Well, well, Mr. Lu.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Inspector Zhao.

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
Time's almost up.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,680
How's your score today?

118
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,320
Shameful, truly.

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,880
My aim was off today.

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,840
Just this many.

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
And you, Inspector Zhao?

122
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
Same here.

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
The prey today

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
is cunning indeed.

125
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,400
I think we'll need overtime

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
to settle this.

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
Shall we continue the hunt until dawn?

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Gladly.

129
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
