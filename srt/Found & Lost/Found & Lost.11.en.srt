=Episode 11=

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,200
Go!

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,920
Hurry!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,440
Quickly!

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,200
Mr. Lu,

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,440
isn't that Ms. Chen Bi?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,760
Well,

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,400
this is a pleasant surprise.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,720
Su Manli.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,280
A stand-in dancer at the Ciro's Club.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,780
Second Young Master removed her records

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,720
(Ciro's Club Dancer Profile)
from the Ciro's Club

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,480
(Name: Su Manli)
to protect her.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Tian is close to her.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,760
According to my investigation,

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,240
they are old acquaintances,

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,600
but the nature of their relationship

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
or their motives

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,000
are unclear.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,280
Run!

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,440
Move!

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,080
Move it! Go!

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go!

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,520
Go!

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
(It's the same bullet casing.)

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,760
Manli!

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
Manli!

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
Ten years.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,480
These beasts are still playing
the same hunting games.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,360
This place isn't safe.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,320
Head down the mountain.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Go!

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
Come on! Move it!

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
Let's go! What are you doing?

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,840
Leave me behind.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Go on without me!

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,280
Come on!

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Keep going!

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
Don't worry about me!

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Come on!

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Leave me!

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,080
Just go on your own!

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
You guys should leave me here.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
Shut up.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
You talk too much.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,880
What's this?

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
This is how hunters

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,400
mark their territory during a hunt.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,560
But if both sides drive prey
in the same direction,

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
they eventually form an encirclement.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
A trap, ensuring nothing escapes.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,920
You.

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,760
Take the other three
and keep heading west.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
All right.

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
What about you?

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
Running away won't work.

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,840
We need to fight back.

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,560
Mr. Lu,

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,160
the light's fading fast.

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,720
It will be hard to search now.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,080
Move down.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,480
The one with the most kills

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,480
will be generously rewarded.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,440
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,920
Go.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,000
Mr. Lu, you're the falcon.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,600
No one but you could take first place.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
(It's him.)

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
(Take a deep breath.)

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
(Exhale 30%.)

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,280
(The body will stabilize
for five seconds.)

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
(During this time,)

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,640
(breathing won't affect
the body's motion.)

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
(This is the perfect moment
to pull the trigger.)

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,800
Mr. Lu!

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,480
Protect Mr. Lu!

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,280
Be careful!

79
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Your wound has reopened.

80
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,040
No use hiding.

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,720
Your position is already exposed.

82
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
As reckless as ever.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
You haven't changed.

84
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,200
If this were real combat,

85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,080
(Ten years ago)
both of you would be dead.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,160
Do you know why you failed?

87
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Huaijin,

88
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
you overthink,

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
which delays your action.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,240
Manli,

91
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,120
you're too impulsive.

92
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
You need patience

93
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
and strategy.

94
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,920
Both of you are only
focused on yourselves.

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
Always remember.

96
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,840
To survive,

97
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
you need trust and cooperation.

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,960
Out of bullets now.

99
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
If Master saw how skilled you are,

100
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
he'd be very proud.

101
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
If my father knew what you're doing now,

102
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,890
he'd be furious enough
to come back to life.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,720
Let's call a truce.

104
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
In your dreams!

105
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,640
(Pingyuan)

106
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,080
