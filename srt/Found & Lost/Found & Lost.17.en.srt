1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
Who's there?

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,560
Someone told me they saw you here

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,320
and I didn't believe them at first.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,920
Look at you now.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
Are you even the same person?

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,600
Manli.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
Get a grip!

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,640
There's still so much for you to do.

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,480
Do what?

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,000
Chen Bi and Mr. Kun are already dead.

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,040
Don't turn into this pathetic,
self-destructive version of yourself.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,600
You've never been the type
to give up so easily.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,280
Stop acting like you know me so well.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,440
What do you even understand about me?

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,240
Just leave!

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,040
Go!

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,400
This morning,

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Mr. Lu sent this over.

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,760
With the way you're acting now,

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,840
do you think
you're living up to their sacrifice?

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
Take it away.

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
I can't face them.

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,700
=Found & Lost=

24
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,660
=Episode 17=

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Tell me,

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,480
why were you at Chen Garden that day?

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Zekai,

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
do you remember?

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
Our parents died young.

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,480
You took me and fled to Shanghai.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,120
You raised me by selling fruit.

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
Your special skill back then
was peeling rotten pears.

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
No matter how bad they looked,

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
once you worked your magic,

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,120
twisting, slicing, peeling,

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
they'd turn out flawless and gleaming.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,640
Here.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,480
Try one.

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,280
Why are you bringing up the past?

40
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,040
You've been

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,640
carrying too much
on your shoulders for so long.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,560
I don't want you
to keep sacrificing for me.

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,920
Since I was a child,

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
you've been running around,

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,320
claiming it was all for business.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,160
But even when you became successful,

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,760
you never acknowledged
our connection publicly.

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,320
At first, I thought
you were trying to toughen me up,

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
to let me learn to stand on my own.

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,360
(Haitang Society Internal Documents,
Name: Yang Ziqin)

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,280
(Yang Ziqin's Profile)
But in truth, you joined Haitang Society

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,440
and made too many enemies.

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
To protect me,

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
you deliberately cut me
out of your life.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Zekai,

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
stop this.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,440
I know there's a reason
behind everything you've done.

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
We can find a way
to leave Haitang Society

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,760
and make things right.

60
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:32,380
(Land Deed)

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
I sold Ciro's Club.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,520
We can use the money

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,600
to compensate the survivors of Puyu Hall
and the families of those

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
who were senselessly killed
by Haitang Society.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Kneel.

66
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,120
Kneel!

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
I'll tell you this.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,320
It's because I've protected you too well

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,320
that you've turned out so naive.

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,760
Make amends?

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Survival of the fittest.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
The strong devour the weak.

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
That's the law of nature.

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Everything I've done,
risking my life to climb to the top,

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,040
has been to ensure

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
that no one
would ever look down on you again.

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
What dignity is there in stepping on

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,760
this blood-stained fortune?

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
What did you say?

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,400
Without power or wealth,
one is spineless and helpless.

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
Dreams of righteousness are a joke!

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,400
What good are they?

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
Can they keep you fed?

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Now, tell me.

85
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,440
Was this nonsense Su Manli
put in your head?

86
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,240
Speak!

87
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,360
Answer me!

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
It has nothing to do with her.

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Still won't talk? Fine.

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
The one I want to stop is you.

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
You're the one I want to stop.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,000
Zekai.

93
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
We've finally received news
from Mei Garden.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,240
(Yang Ziqin is critically injured)

95
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
(and still unconscious.)

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
Family, please step outside.

97
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Doctor,

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,800
how is my young master?

99
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,120
He hasn't passed the critical stage.

100
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,440
He may not wake up.

101
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
Surviving such an ordeal

102
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,640
and making it back alive

103
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,160
is already a miracle.

104
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,120
Fortune-telling and face reading.

105
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
Only five wen per session.

106
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
Fortune-telling and face reading.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Only five wen per session.

108
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,400
Fortune-telling and face reading.

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Only five wen per session.

110
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,360
Fortune…

111
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
It's all your fault!

112
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,880
Sooner or later,

113
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
one of you two is bound

114
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,151
to cause the death of the other.

115
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you even know that she's already…

116
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
Why did you say that?

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,000
Why?

118
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
All things have their karmic course.

119
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,880
Transient, like dreams and shadows.

120
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,680
Ephemeral, like dew or lightning.

121
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,320
Such is how you must perceive life.

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,240
What nonsense are you spouting?

123
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,920
Mourn with acceptance.

124
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,087
In Buddhist teachings,
thoughts are like clouds in the sky.

125
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,880
All actions are impermanent.

126
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
Everything is suffering.

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,440
Miss,

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,040
whatever path you choose,

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
the end will be the same.

130
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
The same end,

131
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,560
is it?

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,800
Then let me show you
what your end will be.

133
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,460
(Baoyao Apothecary)

134
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
What a disgrace.

135
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
Chen Bi?

136
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
How are you even standing?

137
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
I must be drunk.

138
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
Not used to seeing me like this?

139
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
I was worried about you,

140
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
so I came back to check on you.

141
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,080
And as expected,

142
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,040
you're still useless.

143
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Yes.

144
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm useless.

145
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,760
If only

146
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,040
I hadn't hesitated that day…

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,840
If I'd killed Lu Zekai in the forest…

148
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,360
If we hadn't fought that day…

149
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
If I'd gone to save you
just a bit sooner,

150
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,000
you wouldn't have…

151
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,120
You wouldn't have…

152
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
There are no "ifs".

153
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
Don't blame yourself.

154
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
Don't feel guilty.

155
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,120
If I could do it all over again,

156
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,080
I'd still make the same choice.

157
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,800
So…

158
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,640
No matter how many times we try,

159
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
the ending will always be

160
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,760
the same?

161
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,800
The outcome doesn't matter.

162
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
What matters is choosing the path

163
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
you want to walk.

164
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,720
Study hard. Be a good person.

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
Get in! Move it!

166
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
(Do what you want to do.)

167
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,680
(I'll always be behind you.)

168
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,240
I won't let this world fall

169
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,280
