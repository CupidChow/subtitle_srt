00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,340
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,480
What took you so long?

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,120
Madam,

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,680
did you break
into the commander's vault?

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Where did you get these trinkets?

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,760
These are gifts from
that piece of trash Yang Ziqin.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,320
If he found out you sold everything,

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,880
he'd chop you into pieces.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,280
I have other priorities.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,320
I need money for revenge.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,280
Besides,

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,200
I suspect he already knows
my true identity.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
What?

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll get a different color.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
You have ten minutes.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
I'll wait downstairs.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
His illogical affection

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,760
and behavior...

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
I think he is trying to lower my guard

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
so he can finish me off.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,440
That makes sense.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Time is of the essence.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,320
We must act at once.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,960
My circumstances make
seduction impossible.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,200
Otherwise,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
I would've done it.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,520
Get to the point.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,120
Oh, right.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,960
Look.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,520
I made a copy
of Haitang Society's invitation

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
with the sample I got.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,760
(Welcome, Lu Zekai)
A seal will make it authentic.

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,480
I bet Yang Ziqin
has the official stamp.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,360
Anything else?

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Most of the info we uncovered
about your dad

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
couldn't be uncovered.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,480
But according to Ms. Chen,

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
Haitang Society has a codebook

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,920
that is used to decipher
the highest level of encryption.

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,200
It should be in the archive
of Puyu Hall.

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
In that case,

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,040
I need the blueprint of Puyu Hall.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,240
Come on.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
Manli.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
This mission is risky.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Be extra cautious.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't worry.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,160
By the way,

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,640
remember to get
Mr. Kun's pocket watch back.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,200
Maybe I should give it a shot.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Commander, Young Master is here.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Father.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,320
Sit.

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,160
The shipment will arrive

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,840
at the port and be unloaded.

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Thanks for the favor.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
Have you learned more

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
about Chen Bi's background?

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
I have an opinion

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
about this person.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
Do tell.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
You may dismiss the people

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
you sent to monitor her.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Haven't you always been interested
in the missing seal

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,800
of the Chen family?

67
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,040
Why not keep her around
to lure the bigger target out?

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
How tactful of you.

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,440
We'll follow your plan.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
Why isn't the Young Master

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,280
in any of the photos?

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,200
Perhaps you didn't know.

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,320
He is not

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Commander Yang's son by birth.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
Why did the commander adopt him?

76
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,390
The Young Master was captured
and sent to a POW camp.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,720
Supply was running low,

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,290
so the warden let them
kill each other.

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Only the Young Master survived.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Seeing how he was remarkably brave

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
and tactful

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
for his age,

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,480
Commander Yang was fond of him
and adopted him.

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,480
(This man has a violent nature.)

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
(He is a heartless fiend.)

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,560
Ms. Chen.

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Sorry for the wait.

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
It's all right, Mr. Yang.

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,440
I should've visited sooner.

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
You are my daughter-in-law.

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
We are a family here.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,200
Look.

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
This jade bracelet was

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,600
originally a token of engagement
between our families.

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
And now,

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
you're finally back.

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,960
It shall be returned
to its rightful owner.

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,280
Here, take it.

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,000
Hold onto it.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Good girl.

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,680
You've been through hell
over the years.

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Not at all.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,240
Father.

105
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,240
I have work to tend to.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
I must get going.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Very well.

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm heading to Liyuan Theatre
for the show.

109
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,000
Collect the shipment.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Yes.

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh no.

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
We've been made.

113
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,900
