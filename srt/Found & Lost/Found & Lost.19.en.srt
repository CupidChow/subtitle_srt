1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,300
(Three years ago)

2
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,560
I didn't realize
he was a friend of yours, Ms. Manli.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,360
Leave.

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,320
(The moment I first met you,)

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
(I knew you were dangerous.)

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
(It felt like stepping off)

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,440
(the edge of a ship's plank.)

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,040
(Unwittingly,)

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,760
(I plunged into the river.)

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,160
This is a notorious alley.

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,840
It's full of drifters and idlers.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
You're dressed

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,440
like someone from high society.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
You were bound to get targeted.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,040
Thank you for saving me.

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm not familiar with this area,

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,880
so I ended up here by mistake.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,440
Take a right up ahead,
and you'll be out.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,600
Be more careful next time

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,240
you go out.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,640
I ruined your flowers.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,720
Let me buy you a new bouquet.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Maybe another time.

26
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:33,140
=Found & Lost=

27
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,100
=Episode 19=

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
You're finally awake.

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Why didn't you just strangle me?

30
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,640
That'd be far too easy a death for you.

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
Ziqin.

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
Father.

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
What brings you here?

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've been tied up

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
with military matters lately.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
When I heard you were injured,

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,600
I couldn't make time to visit until now.

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
Well?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
How are you feeling?

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Much better now.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Good to hear.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Why haven't you taken your medicine yet?

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Don't tell me you're still as stubborn

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
as when you were a child.

45
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:04,887
Take it.

46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,080
Thank you for your concern, Father.

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
By the way, Father,

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,960
I heard

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,240
there's been some trouble
at the opium plantations in Songhu.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
You're still recovering.

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,400
Why trouble yourself
with matters of the camp?

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,080
Recently, there's been

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,960
an outbreak of rebels

54
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,640
in the Longhua region.

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
They call themselves

56
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,000
the Pingyuan Army.

57
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,560
Ridiculous.

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,840
I've already devised a plan
to crush them.

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
It'll be executed this weekend.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
I'll take care of it

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
on your behalf.

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,800
You focus on recovering.

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,720
Thank you, Father.

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,320
Commander,

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,560
should we have someone monitor him?

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,040
No need.

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
What do we do now, Young Master?

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,040
Do you think Master has started
to suspect us?

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
Should we send a message?

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,240
Stay calm.

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Making a reckless move now

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
will only give us away.

73
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,120
Still no word on Manli?

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,100
(Justice! Notorious criminal dead!
20 heinous crimes of drug lord Lu Zekai)

75
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Haitang Society

76
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
and the French

77
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,800
pinned all the blame on Mr. Lu.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,080
This is Mr. Lu's birthday gift to you.

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
Take these blocks home.

80
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
I'll sort out the rest here.

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,680
Second Young Master,

82
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,880
aren't you going back?

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,040
There are matters at Haitang Society
that need to be dealt with.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll return once I'm finished.

85
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,720
Wait.

86
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,120
That's a pretty pendant.

87
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,280
It must be valuable.

88
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Mr. Lu, please have mercy!

89
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,360
I swear I'll never do this again.

90
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
Lu Fengtian, what are you doing?

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,280
Let go!

92
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Let him go!

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Let go, Lu Fengtian!

94
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,480
Let him go!

95
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
Whoever helps you next time

96
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,400
won't leave here alive.

97
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,960
Thank you, Mr. Lu…

98
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,600
What's with that look?

99
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,120
You think I'm a monster?

100
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
Don't forget.

101
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
You're the one who made me this way.

102
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
I've asked everyone.

103
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,920
No one at Puyu Hall knows
anything about Ms. Manli either.

104
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Maybe

105
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,280
- Ms. Manli's already…
- You didn't even ask, did you?

106
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Mr. Lu sent me the obituary.

107
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,720
He told me everything.

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Hao, why did you…

109
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
It's time to let this go, Young Master.

110
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
Even if you found her,
what would it change?

111
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
Commander already has his eyes on us,

112
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,960
and our superiors won't allow us
to act without orders.

113
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,760
Opposing them now

114
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
is a death sentence.

115
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,960
I can't watch you throw your life away.
