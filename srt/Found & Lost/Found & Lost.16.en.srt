(and handed it over to the anti-opium
commissioner sent from Nanjing.)

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,080
Mr. Chen,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
why must you get involved
in this trivial matter?

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,560
Lives are at stake.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,680
This is no trivial matter.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
There are 3000 crates of opium.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,880
That is 13 million silver coins.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,680
It's not just my wealth.

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,400
My brothers' wealth is there as well.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
His life matters,

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,760
but what about our lives?

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,760
Mr. Lu.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,280
This concerns the pride of this nation.

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,920
I will never back down.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,040
Mr. Chen.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,440
Hand over the seal.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,800
I'll give you a 30 percent cut.

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,520
My daughter is getting married today.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,200
We are not

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,280
discussing this anymore.

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
Kun.

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,480
Show him the door.

37
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:57,500
=Found & Lost=

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,460
=Episode 16=

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
The Chen family owed me

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,160
that cursed seal.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
So,

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,720
you killed the entire Chen family

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
to cover your losses.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,680
You sold their assets off
to purchase more opium.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
It wasn't just me.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
When Commander Yang found out
his in-laws were killed,

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,840
he brought his troops
to loot the place the same day.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,320
He robbed you of
a good portion of your wealth.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
What I got

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680
was only a meager amount.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
Commander Yang?

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,680
Indeed.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Everyone thought
it was Yang Ziqin's doing.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
However,

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,760
it was Commander Yang
who spread the rumor.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,960
He was Commander Yang's pawn.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
He was just a scapegoat.

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,880
One of you killed.

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,280
The other plundered.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
You two are a great match
for each other.

61
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,080
He was blatantly breaking the law.

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,760
But I had no other choice.

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,200
Listen up.

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
It was your father's fault.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,640
He was too stubborn

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,720
for his own good.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
I hate moral crusaders like you
more than anything.

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
Look at the bigger picture.

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
Everyone is a victim.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,440
Stop playing the victim so righteously.

71
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,760
Not everyone becomes a monster like you
after suffering losses.

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
I've known someone who continued
to light up the path for others

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,400
despite walking in darkness.

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
And you?

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,040
You are a selfish fiend
through and through.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Ms. Chen.

77
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
The bombs you planted
around the Chen Garden

78
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,280
have been diffused.

79
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,520
As for your butler...

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
He is a real man.

81
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
He endured for four hours.

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
He left without giving up.

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't be sad.

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
Your impostor

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
is coming here as we speak.

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Don't you dare harm her!

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
Perhaps she can be your company

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,800
on the way to hell.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,560
Drive faster.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Mr. Yang.

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,320
Let's speak in private.

92
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
You knew Manli's identity
from the get-go.

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,240
Tell me,

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
why is my brother going after her?

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,280
What is going on
between the two of them?

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Is everyone lying to me?

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
Am I the only one kept in the dark?

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
There are things
I can't disclose to you.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
But if you want to keep her safe,

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
you should stop your brother

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,640
instead of waiting here.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Time is of the essence.

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Maybe you're the only one

104
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
who can save us all.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Chen Bi!

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Forget about me.

107
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
You are endangering yourself.

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,680
Shut it.

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,520
The whole building is locked down.

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
There are guards everywhere.

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,440
We won't get far from here.

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll die before I leave you behind.

113
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
Very well.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
Do as I say.

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,720
The second floor!

116
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,400
Go after them!

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
- Quick!
- Go!

118
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,560
Turn left.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,200
Into the kitchen.

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,440
Go, quick!

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,520
After them!

122
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,240
In front of us!

123
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,160
Hurry!

124
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
- Hurry!
- Go!

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,800
Break it down!

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Break the door open!

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,560
Open it!

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Open it!

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Break the door open now!

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
What now?

131
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
No one knows about this door.

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,440
We'll escape from here.

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
What about you?

134
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Just go.

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Catch me.

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Sure.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Open the door!

138
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Come.

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Give me your hand.

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Come on.

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,360
Come on! We can't stay here!

142
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
You won't go far
dragging me along.

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
Mr. Kun is dead because of me.

144
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
I can't get you killed too.

145
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't be silly.

146
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,440
Hurry!

147
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Let's go!

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,680
Manli!

149
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,720
After meeting you,

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
my life stopped feeling so lonely.

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,080
Chen Bi!

152
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Chen Bi!

153
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
(I hope)

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,560
(we meet again in the next lifetime.)
