00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,660
have you seen this person
in the past couple of days?

Mr. Zhang!

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,240
He went to Puyu Hall

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,960
three days ago for a feature,

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,720
but I haven't seen him since.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,800
Thank you.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,640
Don't mention it.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
I think

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Young Madam has noticed us.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,600
Follow her.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,800
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,240
Where's Ms. Chen?

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
You must be joking.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,800
How could Ms. Chen be here?

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Cut the nonsense.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,320
I just saw her come in.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,120
Did any of you

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,880
see someone enter just now?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, we didn't.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
If you don't believe me,

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,720
feel free
to search the entire Ciro's Club.

26

Then don't mind if I do.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,600
Search.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,750
There's a small alley out back
that leads to the main street.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,360
You best hurry.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,200
Okay.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,280
You've helped me so many times,

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,060
but I still can't
explain everything to you.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
No need for words between us.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,480
Just keep yourself safe.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
If you ever need anything,

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
just ask.

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,280

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Puyu Hall is too dangerous.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
You can't go.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
You're overstepping.

Mr. Yang,

47
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,580
there's no need for us
to continue playing house, is there?

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
I'm not acting.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Why have you been avoiding me
these past few days?

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
There's no need

51

What happened that day

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
was a mistake.

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,240
A mistake?

55

That's your business.

61

you're looking for is.

I had them specially brought here
for you to practice on.

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,960

If you can convince the colonel

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,000
to join this raw opium deal,

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,920
Xinhong will split the profits equally

102
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
in three shares.

103
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720

Risk-free and high-profit.

110
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,400
It's a deal you can't pass up.

111
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,360
However, since Vice President Lu

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
hasn't informed me about it,

113
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm afraid I shouldn't participate.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
Why say that?

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
The forces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,760
are intertwined,

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
and all the warlords

118
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,240
have a hand in the opium trade.

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,520
For Xinhong to dominate Shanghai,

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,640
we need the military's support.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,960
Without President Yang's mediation,

122
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
this deal won't happen.

123
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
Vice President,

124
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,320
what do you say?

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Inspector Zhao is absolutely right.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,960
I would be thrilled

127
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,400

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320

And...

135
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
And the opium shipment was stolen.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800

Thank you.

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm telling you,

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
search the entire mountain if you must,
but get it back.

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Or you'll be the one

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
taking this bullet.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,800
Yes.

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,320

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
for the mess.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
No worries, Mr. Lu.

151
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,760
This area

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,920

Those feeble refugees

154
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,360
won't get far.

155

Whoever dared to act on my turf

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
will learn their lesson.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
Bring our men.

158
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
It's time for some exercise.

159
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,240

161
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
same rules as before?

163
