00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Huaijin.

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,390
Your wounds aren't healed yet.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,320
Why aren't you resting?

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,240
This is nothing.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,880
It's because I was too weak

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,920
that she got hurt.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,680
You little brat.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,750
There's a limit
to how much you should push yourself.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,960
Manli only got a minor injury.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,720
You?

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,880
You almost lost your life.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,640
You should know

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,440
your life is important too.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,760
I'm fine.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,280
Master,

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,640
I've never had parents.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,520
From the day you took me in,

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,360
I decided

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
I'd be the sheath
that protects you and Manli.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,120
Huaijin.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
Do you know

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
the true purpose of a sheath?

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,640
It's not just to protect the blade.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,040
Without

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
the sheath,

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,720
the blade has nowhere to hide.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,240
Young Master.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Young Master.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Our people haven't sent word
in a long time.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
Don't act recklessly.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Ziqin.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,760
Father.

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,080
How's your recovery?

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Thanks to you,

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,720
much better.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
Good.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
I called you here today

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,640
to share some good news.

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
Someone sent me a letter.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,680
Guess what was in it?

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,520
For all these years,

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,360
I never doubted you.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
But it seems some people

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,080
bite the hand that feeds them

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000
and collude with outsiders.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,400
So tell me,

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,680
are you loyal to the Yang family army
or the Pingyuan Army?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,280
Ziqin.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,520
If those around you

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
harbor disloyalty,

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
they cannot stay.

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,040
I've set an example for you.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,040
Mistakes like this

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
must never

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,440
happen again.

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,600
I understand, Father.

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
Hao is gone.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
The organization

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,760
will honor his sacrifice.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
Always the same words.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,040
Is that all you can say?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
Don't get emotional.

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,360
He's already the fourth one.

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,560
I've told you before.

67
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,320
Sacrificing blood and life
for a great cause is noble.

68
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,240
They were prepared for this.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,200
A great cause?

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,440
You mean the ten years I've been
the enforcer for the commander?

71
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,480
Or the five years I've spent
aiding and abetting the Haitang Society?

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,840
I've gathered intelligence,

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
raised funds,

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
all for the day we could uproot them.

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,760
Not to watch my comrades die in vain.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Do you think

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,080
our cause is a game?

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
Then tell me.

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
The commander is on his last legs.

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,000
Haitang Society is falling apart.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Why haven't you acted yet?

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,080
The higher-ups have their reasons.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,760
It's not your place to question.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm already breaking protocol
by meeting you.

85
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
What more do you want?

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,280
I can't protect my comrades.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,040
I can't save the one I love.

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,120
What's the point of living like this?

89
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Your work

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
over the past ten years
has been exceptional.

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
The organization values you.

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,760
Just hold on a little longer.

93
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
The end is near.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,160
Remember.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,440
Focus on your role.

96
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,850
Don't cause unnecessary complications.
