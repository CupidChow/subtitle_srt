=Episode 8=

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,840
President Yang?

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,440
President Yang?

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,880
Everybody,

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
I just received a report

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,520
of someone breaking into our archive.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,440
We even captured
a ruthless female thief.

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,000
Guess what?

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,400
She claims to be
President Yang's wife.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,440
She just walked into this building
to rob us

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,360
and disrespected Haitang Society.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,280
Therefore,

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
I made sure to teach her a lesson.

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,840
As for how we deal with her...

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,760
President Yang.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
That's up to you.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
President Yang.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
What is the meaning of this?

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
She is my fiancee.

21
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
Your fiancee?

22
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Why would President Yang's fiancee

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,560
steal from our archive?

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,560
Where's the evidence?

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
You claim she's stolen from you,

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
but can you prove it?

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
A trained thief like her can hide it

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
on her body.

29
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,840
President Yang.

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,160
Since she is your fiancee

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,160
and you're eager to prove her innocence,

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,360
why not do a thorough search

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
with all of us

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
as your witnesses?

35
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
- Yeah!
- Search her!

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,520
Well?

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Do a thorough search!

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,680
Search her!

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
We need to search her.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Search!

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,120
She is a criminal we just apprehended.

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
She is a nameless thief.

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,960
You are blatantly disregarding the law.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,600
The people will not accept this!

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Are you going to kill me?

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
You want to kill me.

47
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,520
Who would've thought?

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
The President would go as far

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,320
as to kill me over a thief!

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
All the more reason to detain her.

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,480
Bring it on!

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,040
Vice President Lu,

53
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
you don't understand me at all.

54
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,040
I know someone from Ciro's Club.

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
You wouldn't want

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,080
the person to be harmed.

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
That's a bluff.

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,840
Will you

59
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
take the risk?

60
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
When this thing sounds...

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Hold on.

62
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Have some water.

63
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Stay away.

64
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,720
Have some water.

65
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
Leave me alone.

66
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
Manli!

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
What did you call me?

68
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,440
Manli?

69
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm not Manli.

70
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,200
I am

71
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
Chen Bi...

72
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,120
Who are you?

73
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Who are you?

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
I am Yang Ziqin.

75
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,120
Yang Ziqin?

76
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
You're Yang Ziqin?

77
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Come on.

78
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Why did you save me?

79
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,160
Why did you save me?

80
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,680
Why did you save me?

81
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
You are drunk.

82
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,120
I'll send someone
to help you get some rest.

83
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
Fu Huaijin!

84
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,640
Liar.

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,160
Why did you lie to me?

86
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,080
What did you call me?

87
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,800
When did you find out?

88
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
My husband,

89
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,960
you resemble someone I used to know.

90
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,600
What kind of person?

91
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,920
A kind gentleman

92
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
with a gentle demeanor.

93
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
I thought keeping it to myself

94
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
could make everything seem

95
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,680
like an illusion.

96
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,760
I was afraid that telling you

97
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,360
would make me...
