1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,000
Young Master Lu.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,080
We caught her.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,400
But she wouldn't tell us

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,080
the whereabouts of the missing seal.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
The Patrol Office asked

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
if we should kill her instead.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,520
We can wait.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,280
Catching the fraud is a front.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,000
The real Chen Bi
must have the seal.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,920
An astute judgment.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
What about the pawn shop owner?

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,040
We are investigating the lead.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,680
We will catch the owner soon.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
Take me to your master.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,440
I expect nothing less
from a veteran like you, Mr. Kun.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,800
You are as skilled as always.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,760
I was told you've been looking
for Ms. Chen, Mr. Lu.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,760
She is eager to meet you too.

19
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:35,860
=Found & Lost=

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,820
=Episode 15=

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Pretty lady?

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,960
Pretty lady?

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
Do you remember now?

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Yes.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,600
So,

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,640
where is it?

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Come closer.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
Come closer.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,760
Where is it?

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,320
That thing

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
is...

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,240
Do you have a death wish?

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Start talking.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
What is your goal?

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,760
No?

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
Who is your cousin now?

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,920
Didn't you call me your cousin?

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,000
My relative?

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Manli!

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Manli!

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,360
Where is Ms. Chen?

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
Put me down.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
I can walk on my own.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,240
No, you are injured.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
Mr. Lu, what brings you here?

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
Shanghai News is attacking Ms. Chen.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
It's serious.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Even Ciro's Club was involved.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,560
I came here to clarify
the misunderstanding.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
I brought her back.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,360
You may go now.

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Mr. Yang.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's speak in private.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Drive.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,160
What did you talk about?

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,880
Secrets among the boys.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Manli.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,640
It's not safe out here.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
I found you a hideout.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,920
Wait it out there.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
When the problem is solved...

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
You know how I'd react.

63
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
I knew it.

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Hao.

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,160
To the clinic.

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
There's no one there.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,800
When Lu Zekai gave the order
to capture you,

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
he located Ms. Chen
through his informant.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
But by the time he arrived,

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
Ms. Chen was already gone.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,280
They are relentless.

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,280
Is it about the seal?

73
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
The seal is linked

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
to the Chen family's death
three years ago.

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,120
These hideouts

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,440
are opium warehouses and dealing spots
controlled by Lu Zekai.

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
We managed to track down
where the money came from.

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,280
It's all the Chen family's wealth.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
The biggest batch among them

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,600
is sealed away in Defeng Trading,
which the Chen family controls.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
It can only be retrieved

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,440
with the heliotrope seal.

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,480
Stop the car.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,120
I knew you wouldn't come willingly,

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,160
so I was one step ahead of you.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,200
They've been watching us
since we left the Patrol Office.

87
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,200
I bet they are reporting back
to Lu Zekai.

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,680
Hao.

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
Send her to Chen Garden.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes.

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Chen Bi is meeting Lu Zekai there.

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,960
What about you?

93
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,400
Don't worry about me.

94
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,200
My men will be there.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
Do what your heart tells you.

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll always have your back.

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
Wait.

98
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,360
Go now.

99
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,800
Make sure you bring her back.

100
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
Your reputation precedes you.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,840
Your beauty matches your talents.

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Spare me the formalities.

103
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,320
Let's get down to business.

104
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Your claws reach far and wide

105
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,240
because

106
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
you want my seal.

107
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,280
Father!

108
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Father!

109
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,480
Keep the seal safe.

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
Father!

111
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,680
Indeed.

112
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
But how can you prove

113
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,440
its authenticity?

114
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
The Chen family's seal

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
is an artifact from the Ming dynasty.

116
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,120
The heliotrope is different

117
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,000
because the gem will become transparent

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
with light.

119
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
The pale red patterns

120
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
will grow darker.

121
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
It looks like blood flowing in vessels.

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
But the seal can be shattered easily.

123
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,960
Mr. Lu, let's not be rash here.

124
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,000
Calm down, Ms. Chen.

125
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
If you give me the seal,

126
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,040
I'll give you anything.

127
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,680
Spare Manli.

128
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
We've gone our separate ways.

129
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
She has nothing to do

130
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,480
with the Chen family.

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
I find that hard to comply with.

132
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
After all,

133
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
there are some personal grudges
between us.

134
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,520
However, I can accept your terms.

135
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,760
Ask Shanghai News
to retract the article.

136
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
Publish a clarification.

137
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
Anything else?

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,040
This seal

139
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
was the last effect
my father left me.

140
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
I came here

141
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,760
to trade the last piece
of our family wealth

142
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
for the truth.

143
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,960
Could you enlighten me

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,320
as to how you slaughtered
the entire Chen family?
