00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,040
why are you here?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,960
What's wrong?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,200
What happened?

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,040
Nothing.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,960
You've gotten stronger lately.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,660
Don't you have
a social engagement today?

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,990
It ended earlier than expected,

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,480
so I came to pick you up.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,790
You've always avoided coming here
to avoid suspicion.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,120
Why now?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,360
Has there been any unusual personnel changes
at Ciro's Club lately?

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,080

I'm Zhang Mingrui,
a reporter from Shanghai News.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,360
The paper sent me here to Puyu Hall

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
for a feature report.

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,480
This way, Mr. Zhang.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,480
The Vice President
has already instructed us.

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,200
We'd appreciate it if you could
give us a favorable write-up.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
Of course.

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,140
Please, this way.

There were 13 people in my family.

50

The date at the bottom also matches.

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
So

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
these animals

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
must be the codenames of the operatives.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
What do the numbers represent?

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,480
(Huage Road No. 128, Falcon 5, Snow Wolf 4)
And who do these animals refer to?

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,400
Falcon?

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,640
Yang Ziqin?

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,680
No.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,840
It's unlikely it's him.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,800
This "1"

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
should refer to my father.

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,200
I caught a glimpse of a page about him
in the archives.

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,400
He joined the Haitang Society
less than five years ago.

65
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,480
That's not enough time
to carry out these missions.

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
So this "Falcon" executed

67
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
both my father's assassination

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
and the Chen family massacre.

69
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
What's your problem?

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm running late.

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,520
I have to work overtime
at the paper tonight.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
I've got to go.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm leaving now.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Just as well.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,640
Mr. Kun needs to ask me
about some herbs.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,520
Wait…

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
You'll be in charge

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,400
of securing the opium shipment.

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,640
I heard you made a big splash

80
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
at the banquet over a woman.

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,280
Didn't expect that from you.

82
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,180
Let's get to business.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Of course.

84
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,450
If you want to play
the knight in shining armor,

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
that's your choice.

86
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,600
However,

87
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
the higher-ups asked me to remind you

88
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,160
not to forget who you are.

89
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
One wrong move

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
and the whole game is lost.

91
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,080
After all,

92
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,000
you know better than anyone
the cost of recklessness.

94

You guys…

98
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
I almost gave it away just now

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,400
with my terrible acting.

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,640
I went out of my way to ask Mr. Zhang

101
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,480
for your favorite dishes and recipes.

102
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,640
I made some myself. Hope you like it.

103
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Kun.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,520
Here's my gift.

105
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
It's modest

106
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
compared to Mr. Yang's,

107
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,160
but it's from the heart.

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
Not bad.

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,840
Forget fancy jewelry.

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,040
This suits you better.

111
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,080
Wait.

112
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm not taking your gifts anymore.

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,640
It cost me a month's salary.

114
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,460
Can't return it now.

115
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
Why?

116
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,180
Do you have something for me too?

117
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Why?

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,760
Can't I?

119
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,120
This is hand-embroidered
by the Young Lady herself.

120
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,520
Mr. Kun.

121
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,560
Spare the unnecessary details.

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,800
I noticed you always carry one with you.

123
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,800
Don't you like it?

124
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I do.

125
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,320
Very much.

126
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,640
Come.

129
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,360
Let's dig in.

130
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,600
Wait a second.

131
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,320
We can't let a moment like this go
without a photo!

132
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,120
Then what are you waiting for? Go!

133
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
Mr. Kun, get in there.

134
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Come on.

135
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Get ready.

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
Inform everyone.

The hunt is set for this Saturday.

140
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,600
Come, Mr. Gu.

141
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,560
Have a seat.

142
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Very well.

143
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,190
Vice President,
your brilliance is unmatched.

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
Coming up with such a clever plan.

145
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
Puyu Hall doesn't have many people.

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,360
Taking care of it won't be hard.

147
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,960
Leave the dirty work to me.

148
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,320
As for fundraising,

149
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,080
I'll leave that to you, Mr. Gu.

150
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,640
Rest assured, Vice President.

151
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,200
The funds will be in your account
within a week.

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Good.

153
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,600
It's been a while

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
