00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,000
Little lady,

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,680
let me give you some fun

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,680
on your wedding night.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,280
Is that all you can do to kill me?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
You're crazy!

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,680
Madwoman!

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,480
Mother!

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Mother!

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,160
Mother!

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Father!

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
Take the seal and keep it safe.

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,640
Father!

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,680
Father!

14

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,300
=Episode 2=

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
I was brought up in a house of honor.

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,080
At 16, I went abroad
to study in Britain.

18
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
After returning,

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,640
everyone who knew my identity was gone.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,640
Even with Yang Ziqin,

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
we only ever exchanged information.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
If you go to him with my token,

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,680
no one will suspect you.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Of course,

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
I didn't invite you here out of charity.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
I'll lend you my identity.

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
You kill Yang Ziqin for me

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,430
and uncover the truth behind
the Chen family massacre.

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,120
Since he's the one
who killed your family,

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,840
pretending to be you

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
is just walking into death's door.

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
You've lived
in Shanghai's underworld for years.

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,080
You should know better than me

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,280
that the Haitang Society
is always on high alert.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
For an ordinary person,
getting close to them

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,400
is a near-death mission from the start.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,520
If you don't even have this resolve,

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
how can you avenge your father?

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Forget it.

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
Go home.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,440
Drive.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,300
We're going back and packing up.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,600
What happened?

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
The job's done, sir.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
All taken care of?

48

(Lu Zekai,
Vice President of Haitang Society)

49

Announce it.

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,080
Fellow members,

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,190
our president was unfortunately
assassinated yesterday.

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
President Yang

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,340
was also tragically killed
during the struggle with the assailant.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
I just saw him yesterday.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
Given the circumstances,

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
we must decide
on the next president quickly.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
You must step up.

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,560
Take charge, Mr. Lu.

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
President Yang is gone.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
Haitang Society relies on you now.

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,120
That's right, Mr. Lu.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
Take the lead!

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
President Yang is here.

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,400
(Yang Ziqin, Executive
Council Member of Haitang Society)

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Vice President Lu.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
Your information seems a bit off.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm still alive.

68
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
Yang Ziqin,

69
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,120
the wreath has Mr. Lu's name on it.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,640
What's your intention?

71
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,620
(Mourning, solemn tribute to Lu Zekai)

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Is that so?

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Let me see.

74
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,780
(Mourning, solemn tribute to Lu Zekai)

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,080
I wanted to send some wreaths

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
under the Vice President's name.

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Who would have guessed
these fools wrote the wrong name?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
Vice President Lu,

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
you wouldn't mind, would you?

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
Of course not.

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,960
Everyone,

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,080
it seems the news was mistaken.

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
President Yang,

84
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,990
it's a relief that you're unharmed.

85
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,320
Thanks to your subordinates.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,480
Just some minor wounds.

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
Nothing serious.

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,640
My men were simply following orders
to hunt down the killer.

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,420
If there were any mistakes,

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
I apologize on their behalf.

91
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,490
What are you waiting for? Serve the tea.

92
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,000
Very inefficient of him.

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
How embarrassing.

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,680
I hope you won't hold
a grudge against me.

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
With the president gone,

96
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,610
the Haitang Society is like
a dragon without a head.

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,650
You, as the Executive Council Member,

98
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,690
and I, as the Vice President,

99
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,080
both bear heavy responsibilities.

100
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,960
We must work together

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,760
to catch this mole as soon as possible.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
Don't you agree?

103
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,950
Have you thought it through?

104
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
If you want to become the real Chen Bi,

105
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,120
you must forget your past self.

106
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
From posture,

107
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
clothing, makeup,

108

speech habits,

109
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
to your actions,

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
you must be indistinguishable from me.

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Let's begin.

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,520

Useless.

115

Useless.

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,960
Useless.

117
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
This is Yang Ziqin.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
This is Commander Yang.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,880
Commander Yang is Yang Ziqin's father.

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,600
Whose father?

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Useless.

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,840
Ms. Manli, how goes your training?

123
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
The destruction of the mind

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,680
is far worse than the body.

125
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,840
Our Young Lady

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,080
wasn't always like this.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,920
She used to be innocent and carefree,

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
often pestered me

129
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
to buy her crisp candy

130
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
on Baochang Street.

131
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
Innocent and carefree?

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
Her?

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
Ms. Manli,

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,680
could you do me a favor?

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,640
I have a house call this afternoon.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,040
Could you take this to the pawnshop

137
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
and exchange it for some coins?

138
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,920
Cute.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Is this your daughter, Mr. Kun?

Is it worth it

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,960
to gamble your life for a scum like that

154
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,880
when you've barely survived

155
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,800
the disaster?

156
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,520
I thought you'd understand

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,350
even if no one else in the world did.

158

Is it worth it?

I don't need your pity.

If you have this much energy,

163
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
spend it on your training instead.

164
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,360
Fine.

huh?

Wait.

168
