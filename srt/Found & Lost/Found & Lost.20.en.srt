00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,800
She's cold.

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,880
(She hasn't eaten for days,)

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,040
(and her wounds are infected.)

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,440
(It might be)

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,640
(acute shock.)

(Shanghai News)

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,760
You're awake.

11
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,920
If you die now,

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,480
the game can't go on.

13
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
That's more like it.

14
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,480
Save your strength.

15
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
This place is filled with my men.

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,520
Don't think you can escape.

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
(Don't worry, Manli.)

18
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960
(I won't kill you.)

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,680
(I'll make you feel
the same pain I did.)

20
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,120
(And then, burdened with that pain,)

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,840
(you'll neither live)

22
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,520
(nor die.)

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,960
She's covered in wounds.

24
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,600
Make sure to call a doctor.

25
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,760
(Down with the wretched Lu!)

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,560
So his memorial tablet

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,760
can't be placed in the ancestral shrine?

28
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,320
How could he possibly have a place
in the ancestral shrine?

29
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,200
(Memorial Tablet of Lu Zekai)

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,480
Lu Zekai's actions

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,320
have brought shame to our family.

32
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
Two days ago,

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
the clan council unanimously decided

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
to expel him from the Lu family lineage.

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,080
My brother built the ancestral shrine.

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,000
The clan council was his creation too.

37
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,640
He made countless offerings here

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
without a trace of sin.

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
And now that he's gone,

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,200
he's only remembered as a stain?

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Don't use offerings
as leverage against me.

42
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,200
The four elders of Haitang Society
have already promised

43
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,600
continued funding for our offerings.

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
I

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,280
don't care about your money.

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
You know as well as I do.

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Not only is there no place
for him in the shrine,

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,280
you won't even find anyone willing

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
to officiate his funeral.

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,960
Calm down, Elder.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm only here

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
to deliver his obituary.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
As for the so-called Lu family,

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
without Lu Zekai,

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,480
it's nothing to me.

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,520
You…

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,080
Consider this ancestral shrine
as charity from my brother

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
to you.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
You and your brother are cut
from the same cloth.

60
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,120
(Chengxiang Hall)

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,880
I hereby declare

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
that you, too,

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
are expelled from the family lineage.

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,120
(Resignation Letter)
Second Young Master,

65
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,080
I don't mean to abandon you
while you are down.

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
But my family refuses

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,000
to let me continue working here.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
You should go.

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,880
Scum!

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,480
It's him!

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Beat him to death!

72
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,280
Down with the tyrant!

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Punish the wicked!

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,560
(The tyrant will die a painful death!)
Down with the tyrant!

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,480
Punish the wicked!

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,480
Down with the tyrant!

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,400
Punish the wicked!

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,320
Ms. Manli,

79
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,640
the doctor is here.

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Ms. Chen.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
Allow me to check your pulse.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,200
The pulse is floating and tight.

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
There's wind in the lower burner.

84
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,640
Bowel movements are blocked.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,080
(What nonsense are you talking about?)

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,160
It's nothing serious.

87
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,960
A few prescriptions will fix it.

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Second Young Master Lu,

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,600
what brings you here today?

90
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,680
A few days ago,

91
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
my people took some interesting photos.

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,320
Take a look, Commander.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
This is a personal family matter.

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,880
You need not concern yourself.

95
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm surprised, Commander, to see you

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
so protective of Yang Ziqin.

97
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,800
But let me remind you.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
If your trust is misplaced,

99
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,080
all you'll gain is heartbreak.

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,640
I know what I'm doing.

101
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,640
Pardon my intrusion.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, right.

103
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
You've been searching high and low

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,640
for that seal, haven't you?

105
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,240
That's the seal my brother left for me.

106
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,760
I won't give it to anyone.

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Well, well.

108
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,520
Who would've thought

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,000
that the kind and gentle-natured

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Second Young Master Lu

111
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,880
could be so ruthless?

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,480
If kindness comes
at the cost of my brother's life,

113
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
I'd rather not have it.
