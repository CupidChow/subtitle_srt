00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,560
Wearing new clothes.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,240
Putting on new shoes.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,760
Take off the ragged hat.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
We share our wealth.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,560
Puyu Hall

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
brings salvation.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Kids,

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,400
let's thank our benefactor,

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,360
Mr. Lu.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,040
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,680
Boys and girls,

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,880
listen to me.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,440
Obey your teacher.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,880
Study hard.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,160
Be on your best behavior.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Will you?

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
Study hard.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
Be on your best behavior.

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,560
Study hard.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,440
Be on your best behavior.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,360
Study hard.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
Be on your best behavior.

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,080
(Study hard.)

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
(Be on your best behavior.)

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,720
(Study hard.)

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
(Be on your best behavior.)

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,320
(Study hard.)

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,120
(Welcome, Lu Zekai)

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,680
Is there a problem?

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,920
Come in.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,520
(Study hard.)

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,600
(Be on your best behavior.)

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,480
(Study hard.)

34
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:45,820

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,640
Young Master,

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,840
someone saw your wife coming in.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
Locate her immediately.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Yes.

41
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,420
(Archive)

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
Miss, you're not allowed to...

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Eliminating the root cause.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
It's just one grape.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,680
When did you become so stingy,
Vice President Lu?

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,240
You know what I mean.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,040
When will you return

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,720
what's rightfully mine?

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
I don't think it's yours.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,120
You use Adrian's name

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
to ship 100 crates of opium
from Yunnan.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Forty crates were secretly

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
shipped to Northeastern China.

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,680
I wonder how the colonel will react

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
when he finds out.

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,720
What do you want?

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,640
A negotiation?

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
What do I want?

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,400
I want

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
to keep it professional.

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
But the spoils,

62
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,480
the construction costs
of Puyu Hall that you owe,

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
the materials,

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
and management fees

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,520
will be an astronomical amount.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
President Yang,

67
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
if you're in need of money,

68
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
I can point you to it.

69
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Instead of taking pennies from me,

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,760
you should focus your effort
on finding the Chen family's seal.

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
Or perhaps

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
you already have the seal?

73
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,720
Vice President,

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
I like your sense of humor.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Cheers.

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,100

77
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,020
(Top-secret codebook)

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,760
This is it.

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,140
(Record)

80
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
Even a small dose

81
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
can knock an elephant out cold.

82
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
(Zhang Mingrui)

83
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,840
(you could've gotten me killed.)

84
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Manli!

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Manli!

86
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Manli!

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
(Manli!)

88
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,880
Where is the list?

89
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Is it ready yet?

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,680
(Yi Shengjie, Zhao Deyun, Rong Yingzhuo,
Zu Hanxue, Si Haoda, Jin Xinghua)

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Is this a joke?

92
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
Where is he now?

93
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
He took his life
after finishing the list.

94
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
I couldn't stop him.

95
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,400
Our men defected to his side,

96
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,920
but his men would die

97
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,400
before they confessed anything.

98
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,400
What's so great about Yang Ziqin?

99
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,840
Young Master Lu,

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,160
perhaps

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
this is the so-called

102
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,240
charisma.

103
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Charisma?

104
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,480
Charisma?

105
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,560
Charisma?

106
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,080
I dare you to say that again!

107
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,100
Please! Stop hitting me!

108
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,560
Come in.

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Thanks for your hospitality.

110
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,720
We'll have each other's back
from now on.

111
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,360
Certainly.

112
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Yes.

113
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,480
Everyone.

114
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
Everyone,

115
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
thanks for coming today.

116
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,760
Without your support,
I couldn't have

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
secured the necessary funding

118
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,360
for the charity project

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,800
to build Puyu Hall.

120
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,800
Puyu Hall has only one motto.

121
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,760
We help the impoverished

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,360
so the elderly may live in peace
and the children are not neglected.

123
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,560
Yes!

124
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,040
Today is the 24th anniversary

125
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,960
of the prestigious Haitang Society.

126
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,320
Tonight is an opportunity
to gather around

127
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
and celebrate this milestone.

128
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
I raise a toast

129
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,960
to your health.

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
Young Master, we searched for her,

131
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
but we couldn't find her.

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,560
Mr. Yang.

133
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Why the hurry to leave?

134
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,440
I prepared a grand gift for you.

135
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,360
(They say God created humans.)

136
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,280
(But it's actually)

137
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
(the other way around.)

138
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,880
(Humans commit heinous crimes)

139
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
(in the name of God.)

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,240
Where is the thing you stole?

141
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,320
Tell us now!

142
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,160
Talk, or we'll frisk you!

143
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
You drank a lot of wine.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
You're not getting out of here.

145
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Stay still!

146
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
Feel awful right now?

147
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,720
I'll make you feel better.

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,290
(Three seconds to activate the poison.)

149
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,220
(It could save your life
at a critical moment.)

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,520
Why you...

151
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,400
You...

152
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
Much appreciated, Vice President.

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
President Yang.

154
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
This is just the intro.

155
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,680
