=Found & Lost=

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,340
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,360
Ms. Chen disappeared two years ago.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
Why come to me now?

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,290
A sudden catastrophe
struck the Chen family.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,240
I was unconscious for over half a year.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,040
Thanks to a kind soul,

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
I narrowly escaped death.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
Now I'm awake,

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,200
but I've lost everything,

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,840
and I have no one to rely on.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
Young Master,

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,790
both the marriage contract and the jade
betrothal bangle have been verified.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,170
They're indeed heirlooms
of the Chen family.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,660
(Marriage Certificate
Yang Ziqin, Chen Bi, Witness)

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Prepare a room in the east wing for her.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,280
Escort her there.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,360
Understood.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,440
Young Master.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,290
Is that all the questions you have?

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,640
Why?

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,740
Is there something
you're hiding from me, Ms. Chen?

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Hao,

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,880
find her suitable clothes.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Tomorrow, she will accompany me
to Ciro's Club to meet guests.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,260
(Ciro's Club)

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,960
Ciro's Club is one
of the Haitang Society's strongholds.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
(The distribution of territories
in Shanghai concessions)

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
The world of the streets
is divided into the "eight factions."

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
The bright.
Jin, Ping, Cai, Gua,

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Pi, Tuan, Tiao, Liu.

33
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,200
And the dark.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
Feng, Ma, Yan, Que,

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,480
Lan, Hua, Ge, Rong.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,360
The bright eight factions represent
open and legitimate trades,

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,690
often including fortune-telling,
street performances, and entertainment.

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,640
Meanwhile, the dark eight factions,

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,880
usually involve illicit
or deceptive practices.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,440
Every business and roadside trade
in the area operates

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,200
within an intricate
intelligence network.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
Every piece of information

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,600
eventually flows to the Haitang Society.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,480
(The distribution of territories
in Shanghai concessions)

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
If you're not careful,

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
Yang Ziqin could easily have you

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
quietly eliminated here.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,960
Hesitant to go in, Ms. Chen?

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,690
(What a coincidence.)

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
(I also have people
within Ciro's Club.)

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,900
(Ciro's Club)

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,800
Have you considered my proposal
to redevelop the racetrack

53
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,600
into a commercial district, Mr. Yang?

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,720
Mr. Yang,

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,880
think long-term.

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
It's not just the commercial district
that will rake in profits.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Clearing out the refugees

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,360
near the racetrack

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
will free up valuable land too.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,680
That's another lucrative deal.

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
After the project succeeds,

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,920
we'll split the profits 50-50.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,600
It's a minor issue.

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
How about this, Mr. Gu?

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,880
If you can beat her,

66
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,240
the land is yours.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
And this is?

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Chen Bi.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,000
My fiancee.

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,360
She's the one from the stories?

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
An honor to meet you.

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Gu.

73
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,920
One chip per acre.

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Ms. Chen,

75
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,200
no need to hold back.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,960
Although this game
is still niche in China,

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,040
we might need it someday.

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,680
It's best

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,840
we learn now.

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,840
Let's start with the basics of betting.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,800
(It's all right.)

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,800
(Everything's within range.)

83
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,840
Bet.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Apologies.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Pair of Aces.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Check.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Full house.

88
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Good game, good game.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
Your skills are rusty

90
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
after such a long hiatus,

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
Ms. Chen.

92
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,760
Excuse me.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
I need the restroom.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,960
I was signaling you earlier.
Didn't you notice?

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
I asked for the One Circle.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
Your gesture meant Nine Circles.

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
This is how you signal One Circle.
Got it?

98
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,990
Sorry to keep you waiting.

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
You've finally returned.

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,520
Shall we continue?

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Of course.

102
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,080
Wait.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,320
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

104
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm a little superstitious.

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
After losing so many rounds,

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,320
I suspect it's bad Fengshui at play.

107
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,240
Miss,

108
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,920
please switch to a new deck.

109
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Sorry,

110
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
I'm still uneasy.

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,200
Let me shuffle them myself.

112
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
Ms. Chen,

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,640
satisfied now?

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,440
(Gambling might not be my forte,)

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,080
(but if you're going to cheat,)

116
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,280
(don't blame me for doing the same.)

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,640
All-in.

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Are you sure, Ms. Chen?

119
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,440
They say fortune favors the bold.

120
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
After so many losses,

121
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
it's time for my luck to turn.

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,200
Very well.

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Since you're so confident,

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,760
I'll match you

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,080
wholeheartedly.

126
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Show.

127
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
(The positions of the cards
were set when I shuffled them.)

128
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
How dare you!

129
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,360
This is outright fraud!

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
Mr. Gu,

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
this is called bluffing.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,760
At the card table, there's no such thing
as a permanent winner.

133
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,800
You!

134
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,720
Mr. Gu, a true gambler honors their loss.

135
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,480
Who would've thought Ms. Chen,

136
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,160
a renowned socialite, knows street cons?

137
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
It seems there's much
you don't know about me, Mr. Yang.

138
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,880
Aside from Texas hold 'em,

139
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
I've mastered many other skills.

140
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
Such as?

141
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,400
