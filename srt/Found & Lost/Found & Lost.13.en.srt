1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,800
They have the advantage
in numbers and ammunition.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,120
A head-on confrontation is impossible.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,200
But it's night now.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
They're in the light,
and we're in the dark.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,800
In that case,

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,760
I have a plan.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,300
=Found & Lost=

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,220
=Episode 13=

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,760
Don't fire recklessly!

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,240
Don't shoot our own!

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,240
(Step one.)

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,720
(Use signal flares)

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,160
(to distract them)

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,920
(and disrupt their formation.)

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,600
(Step two.)

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,080
(Once their formation is scattered,)

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,680
(we'll take them down one by one.)

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Mr. Lu! What are you doing, Mr. Lu?

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,720
Come on.

20
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,440
She's safe.

21
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
How do you know it's her?

22
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Remember.

23
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
You owe me one.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm off.

25
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,560
For you.

26
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,800
A heart-lock pendant?

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
It's a birthday gift.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,760
Wear it,

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
and it means you've agreed.

30
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Depends on my mood.

31
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Manli!

32
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
Don't act on your own again.

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,320
That's right.

34
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,880
You have no idea
how worried I was about you.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,840
Get back.

36
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Mind your leg.

37
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,280
This just in!

38
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Breaking news!

39
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,560
Puyu Hall is murdering refugees

40
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,760
on the outskirts of town!

41
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,320
Trying to silence witnesses!

42
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Mr. Lu,

43
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
I've verified it.

44
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,040
This didn't come

45
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
from Shanghai News.

46
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
It was leaked by that journalist

47
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
surnamed Zhang.

48
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,880
Now it's spreading like wildfire

49
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
through the city.

50
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
The colonel and Mr. Gu

51
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
are overwhelmed

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
and demanding an explanation from you.

53
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,480
Playing two roles, huh?

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,080
Creative.

55
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,280
There is a piece of good news.

56
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
A pawnshop owner sent word.

57
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
He claims

58
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,240
to have seen
the Chen family's old butler.

59
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
If we can connect this lead,

60
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,040
we might finally locate

61
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,480
that Chinese bloodstone seal.

62
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,180
(Three years ago)

63
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,360
Mr. Lu,

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
our men have searched everywhere

65
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,560
but couldn't find the bloodstone seal.

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Useless!

67
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,520
A bunch of useless fools!

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
If you can't find it,

69
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
burn the whole place down!

70
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,600
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Perfect.

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
Then let's settle old scores together.

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,640
No money,
yet you dare to default on your debt?

74
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
I'll teach you a lesson!

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
You had this coming!

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
Let's go, Si.

77
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,240
We'll feed him to fish
in the Huangpu River.

78
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Leave the man here.

79
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm sorry. I didn't recognise you.

80
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Forgive us, sir.

81
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
Chen Hongliang,

82
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
you owe 30,000 dollars at my casino.

83
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
How should we settle this debt?

84
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
Raise your head.

85
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
Don't be afraid.

86
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm here to give you an opportunity.

87
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
Here.

88
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,000
Chen Bi. Who is she to you?

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,800
Chen Bi?

90
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,080
She's my distant cousin.

91
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
She's been dead for many years.

92
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
Do me a favor,

93
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,000
and not only will I

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,280
wipe out your gambling debt,

95
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,000
but you'll also get
a sizable inheritance.
