=Episode 22=

19
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,723
Someone once taught me a thing.

20
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:54,924
When you encounter difficulties,

21
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,924
you can run away or endure them.

22
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:00,163
If you can't tough it out,

23
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:01,883
there's no need to keep enduring.

24
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,964
Escaping is shameful.

25
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:05,404
Procrastination is useless.

26
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:07,844
The person who told me that

27
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,284
was Zhu Jincao.

28
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,483
He told me,

29
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,203
there is a kind of heroism in the world.

30
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,684
It's to see the world as it is,

31
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:17,644
and to still face it bravely,

32
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:20,124
without escaping or procrastinating.

33
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,964
When provoked by someone,

34
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:23,684
it's best to respond

35
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,804
with a swift kick to their head.

36
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:35,757
(The Counterattack)

37
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,524
Everyone, get active and serious!

38
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,244
Don't get too anxious.

39
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,844
Wait.

40
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,684
The makeup is too thick.
Take it off and redo it.

41
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,284
Mr. Liu,

42
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:49,723
heavy makeup looks good on camera.

43
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:51,084
That's how we usually do it.

44
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,443
Why are you talking back?

45
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,684
Do you know what her image is?

46
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:57,124
Don't you know the makeup should
match the style of the live stream?

47
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:58,923
She doesn't need to be pretty.

48
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:00,443
She needs to be genuine
and approachable.

49
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,964
What's needed is an everyday face.

50
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,483
I'll give you 15 minutes.

51
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:04,763
Leave if you can't.

52
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:05,763
Understood, Mr. Liu.

53
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:06,684
Keep it up.

54
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:07,644
Remove her makeup.

55
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,323
(Come to the study.)

56
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,284
(I'm coming.)

57
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,364
Can this be used to live-stream?

58
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,883
With the lighting on
and the filter applied,

59
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,564
regardless of being 60 or 70,

60
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,763
all your wrinkles
are instantly smoothed out

61
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:45,844
and you become a young girl.

62
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,284
It's quite magical.

63
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,043
It's like becoming an old witch.

64
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:50,364
What old witch?

65
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,684
You'll be a beauty.

66
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:52,723
Do you understand?

67
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,844
Do you remember
everything I've taught you?

68
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:55,964
What have you taught me?

69
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:58,684
All that I've taught you was in vain?

70
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:00,364
I memorized it so well yesterday.

71
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:01,364
But you suddenly asked me,

72
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,084
and now I can't recall a single word.

73
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:03,603
Come on.

74
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:04,364
Three,

75
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,203
two,

76
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,003
one,

77
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:06,923
action!

78
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:08,923
Hello, everyone,

79
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,603
I am Gao Xiajing.

80
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,323
During the last live stream,

81
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:14,964
something happened,

82
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,884
which led to some misunderstandings
among the audience.

83
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,243
After careful consideration,

84
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,243
I have decided

85
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:23,644
to explain the truth to those

86
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:25,723
who care about me today

87
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,243
to clear the air.

88
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,923
(Kind people are bullied.
My heart goes out to you.)

89
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,803
(I'm also a single mother.
I support you.)

90
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,764
(For the other woman
without even knowing it.)

91
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,004
(Keyboard warriors, wake up.)

92
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:37,284
(Go expose that scumbag.)

93
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,243
(What is wrong
with a woman bravely pursuing love?)

94
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,603
My ex-husband

95
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:43,444
cheated on me when I was pregnant.

96
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:48,563
That's why I abhor infidelity.

97
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,603
Keeping a distance from married men

98
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,644
is my bare minimum standard of morals.

99
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,563
When I met Zhu Jincao,

100
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,043
he was already divorced.

101
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,404
So even though we fell in love,

102
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,324
I was not the other woman.

103
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:07,352
(Expose)

104
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:09,964
I didn't know

105
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,884
Zhu Jincao had agreed to remarry

106
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:12,923
his ex-wife Gu Moli.

107
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,404
He deceived me by saying

108
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,524
that he wanted a family with me.

109
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,284
Zhu Jincao's ex-wife, Gu Moli,

110
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,923
has abused me verbally and physically.

111
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:32,284
This is the surveillance footage
near my place.

112
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,803
It can't be fake.

113
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,123
Isn't this utter nonsense?

114
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,603
Gao Xiajing, you are spouting nonsense.

115
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,444
She can't hear you.

116
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,004
She can't hear me.

117
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:50,844
Because I liked Zhu Jincao,

118
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,123
for the greater good,

119
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:54,923
I did not make a scene

120
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:56,923
or tell him.

121
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,563
I kept it to myself.

122
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,483
Zhu Jincao also promised me.

123
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,324
He said he had stopped
loving Gu Moli long ago.

124
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,803
As long as he could get promoted,

125
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,404
he could be free from Gu Moli's control

126
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,524
and marry me.

127
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,644
I believed him.

128
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,444
(Oh, my, such a malicious ex-wife.)

129
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,204
(She even hit people.)

130
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:18,644
(Who says the legal wife
stands for justice? Nonsense.)

131
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,243
(That couple is still clingy
even after their divorce.)

132
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,043
(It's no wonder they were married.)

133
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:26,043
(That ex-wife, Gu Moli,)

134
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,404
(isn't she involved in
a scandal with a painter?)

135
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:29,803
(She even had the nerve to hit someone.)

136
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:31,803
(Dox her and expose her online.)

137
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:34,204
(Right, and expose Zhu Jincao online.)

138
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:35,524
(He deceived a single mother)

139
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,644
(and promised empty dreams to a woman.
He's not good either.)

140
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,844
(Expose the couple together online.)

141
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:41,563
(Send them blades
and smash their windows.)

142
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,844
(Teach their whole family a big lesson.)

143
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:46,424
(50,000+, inspirational)

144
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,004
No one wants to reveal

145
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,844
their own scars
to act pitiful on purpose.

146
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,363
Talking about these things
is heartbreaking,

147
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:00,803
but

148
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,844
I will say goodbye to the past.

149
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,043
Because I have a child.

150
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:11,844
I have to live on.

151
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,603
I've clearly seen through

152
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:19,004
Zhu Jincao now.

153
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:26,284
The reason I'm saying all this today

154
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:28,324
is to hope

155
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,683
that more single mothers like me

156
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:33,123
won't make the same mistakes I did

157
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,404
or fall for scumbags again.

158
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:37,524
Women

159
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,483
must stand on their own.

160
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,803
Oh, my god.

161
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:47,603
S-S-She is just too shameless.

162
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,803
A-And these netizens

163
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,764
are so gullible

164
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,324
and believe whatever she says.

165
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:54,563
Why don't you...?

166
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,004
She cursed your daughter
one moment and my son the next.

167
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,444
I curse her, but she can't hear me.

168
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,243
What should we do?

169
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,483
Hurry up. You...

170
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,123
Stay calm.

171
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,483
I was explaining the whole situation

172
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,204
to help you understand

173
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,923
and make things clear.

174
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:17,004
This is Gao Xiajing's live stream.

175
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,964
As a single mother,
I'm officially starting my business.

176
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:23,644
Now I'm going to provide everyone
with products at a discount.

177
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:24,683
(Gao Xiajing,)

178
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:26,764
(why didn't you tell everyone)

179
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,483
(you spread rumors, slandered Moli)

180
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,724
(and sent her
anonymous messages to sow discord?)

181
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,563
(If you don't, I will.)

182
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,043
(Everyone,)

183
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,443
(please come to the live room
of Zhu Jincao's former mother-in-law.)

184
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,589
(300,000+, good opportunity,
challenge her!)

185
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:50,524
Are you ready?

186
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:51,923
Yes.

187
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,124
Let's start the fight.

188
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:55,484
What's wrong?

189
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:56,923
My mind is all muddled right now.

190
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:57,923
What if I say something wrong?

191
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:58,884
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

192
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,443
You can't flee now.

193
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:02,124
Wait.

194
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,764
All the preparation we did
would be wasted.

195
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,923
It's okay.

196
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,244
Bring the same fiery energy
you had when we were arguing

197
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,203
and you would take down
Gao Xiajing completely.

198
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,563
I've never done a live before.

199
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,083
I'm dizzy now.
My blood pressure is high.

200
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,004
It's okay. Look...

201
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:15,923
Let me go have some water.

202
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,764
You go ahead and start.

203
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,963
Such a wimp!

204
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,124
Hello, guys.

205
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,764
Guys, hello.

206
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,404
Welcome to Yulan's live stream.

207
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,284
Welcome.

208
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:36,884
Guys,

209
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,563
I am Zhu Jincao's former mother-in-law

210
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:42,244
and Gu Moli's mother.

211
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,120
Gao Xiajing.

212
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,163
Guys,

213
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,524
please don't let Gao Xiajing fool you.

214
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,443
I have evidence.

215
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,443
I have a recording of Gao Xiajing.

216
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:54,364
When you hear it,

217
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,803
you will know

218
00:09:55,803 --> 00:10:00,323
she is accusing us of what she did

219
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:04,004
and that she's truly a home wrecker.

220
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,884
My assistant will play the recording.

221
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:09,843
Play it.

222
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,083
Let me do it.

223
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:18,323
Zhu Jincao,

224
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,843
you really don't understand
why I did it?

225
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,724
Because I like you.

226
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,524
I posted the photos online

227
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,484
because someone wanted to slander you,

228
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,083
and I wanted to speak out for you.

229
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,284
Did you hear that?

230
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,604
Guys,

231
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:32,803
you all heard that, right?

232
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,963
This is Gao Xiajing's voice.

233
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,404
She admitted herself

234
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:40,244
she intentionally posted
the photos online.

235
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,284
Guys,

236
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,083
you must keep your eyes peeled.

237
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,443
My daughter, Gu Moli,

238
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,083
is the real victim.

239
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:51,843
Play the second part.

240
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:55,884
I also admit

241
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,644
I sent the anonymous messages online.

242
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,563
I just wanted Gu Moli to understand

243
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,404
who is truly right for you

244
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:05,043
and who truly loves you.

245
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,124
You are so good, so outstanding,

246
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,683
but she doesn't cherish you at all

247
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,963
and won't let you go.

248
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,404
I wanted to make her give up.

249
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,803
Guys,

250
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,284
she knew

251
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:17,604
all Zhu Jincao thought about
was my daughter,

252
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:20,803
but she still deliberately
approached him

253
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,803
and said so many cheesy words.

254
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:25,724
It's truly unbearable.

255
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:30,004
Now I'm here to expose

256
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,163
Gao Xiajing's five wrongdoings

257
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:34,124
so you're fully informed.

258
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,923
The first one,

259
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:41,484
sneaky photography.

260
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:48,043
She took photos secretly of my daughter

261
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,284
and her friend in the gym

262
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:51,083
and deliberately posted them online

263
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,923
to frame my daughter
for having an affair.

264
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,043
Despicable.

265
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:58,923
The second one,

266
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,963
anonymous texts.

267
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:08,203
She posed as a netizen and laid a trap.

268
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:10,323
On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival,

269
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,244
she sent anonymous messages
to my daughter

270
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:14,884
to drive a wedge between the family.

271
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:16,364
Vulgar.

272
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,480
(Counterattack)

273
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:23,004
Everyone, don't listen

274
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,963
to Gu Moli's mother's side of the story.

275
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:26,404
I admit

276
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,203
this is my voice,

277
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:30,004
but this recording

278
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,644
has been edited.

279
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,004
It was taken out of context.

280
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,083
I took photos of Gu Moli working out

281
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,323
because I thought she had a good figure.

282
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:39,364
Everyone loves beauty.

283
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:40,524
Am I wrong?

284
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,404
I posted her photos on my account

285
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:46,284
because she was already rumored
to be involved with someone else.

286
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,563
Couldn't I just make a comment?

287
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:52,043
But it was true that Gu Moli hit me

288
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,484
and Zhu Jincao bullied me at work.

289
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,484
Everyone, do not regard the perpetrator

290
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,244
as the victim.

291
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,043
Gao Xiajing.

292
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,764
Gao Xiajing, you're slinging mud!

293
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,803
Gao Xiajing, you're slinging mud!

294
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:10,163
You are just a scheming woman.

295
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:12,244
Don't you know what you have done?

296
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,644
My son gave you a chance.

297
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,124
Is this how you repay him?

298
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:17,124
Sooner or later, you'll get
what's coming to you.

299
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:20,083
You are a viper!

300
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,043
Great.

301
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,323
Guys,

302
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:27,244
the one who just expressed her opinion

303
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,203
is Zhu Jincao's mother.

304
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,443
His own mother.

305
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,083
(Thanks to them, we've hit 300,000+)

306
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,524
So fierce. Look.

307
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,043
She's not usually like this.

308
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:42,484
Mr. Zhu.

309
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:43,404
Come on.

310
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:44,683
Something big happened to your family.

311
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:48,724
Something big happened to my family?

312
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:49,923
Just look.

313
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:50,923
Gao Xiajing,

314
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,083
don't think

315
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,803
you can bully my daughter-in-law

316
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:56,524
just because she's not speaking out.

317
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:58,724
She has two mothers supporting her.

318
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,404
I told you long ago

319
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,364
my daughter-in-law is
1,000 times better than you.

320
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:04,083
I was too soft.

321
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:05,284
I saw from the start

322
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:06,923
you were a bad person.

323
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:09,124
I should have taught you a good lesson

324
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:10,764
and hit you badly back then

325
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,163
so that all this mess
wouldn't happen today.

326
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:14,604
Well said.

327
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:20,163
Mr. Zhu,

328
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,484
your wife is usually harmless,

329
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,644
but she is quite fierce
at cursing online.

330
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:27,244
This post-millennial painter

331
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:28,764
is Zhang Ting.

332
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:31,323
But what's particularly special

333
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,764
is that he is an individual with autism.

334
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,683
So not many people know him.

335
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:40,004
Excuse me, are you Gu Moli?

336
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:41,404
Yes.

337
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,364
Two live streamers

338
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,963
are going crazy over you.

339
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,683
Take a look. Is this about you?

340
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:48,364
I would very much like
to invite Ms. Gu Moli

341
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,803
to show up and respond.

342
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:52,163
You clearly have divorced Zhu Jincao.

343
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:53,724
Why do you still want to control him

344
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:55,323
and even let your family

345
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:58,004
join in to slander and vilify me,

346
00:14:58,004 --> 00:14:59,803
a single mother?

347
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,163
Why?

348
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,124
She is confronting you.

349
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,284
Do you want to respond?

350
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,043
What are you doing?

351
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,323
Sorry about that.

352
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:12,563
Zhou Yu.

353
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:13,720
(Boxing gym)

354
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:18,884
Why did you take me here?

355
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:20,524
I'm quite busy right now.

356
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:21,923
I don't have time for this.

357
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:23,683
You are still in the mood to work?

358
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:25,803
A woman at your age

359
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,563
should vent your anger.

360
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,803
Otherwise, you can easily
get thyroid nodules.

361
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,043
It could also be hyperthyroidism.

362
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,323
And if it's more serious,

363
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,563
it could be thyroid cancer.

364
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,043
What exactly do you want to do?

365
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:42,004
Gao Xiajing's live stream

366
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,963
is currently trending
on the hot search list.

367
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,043
I don't believe
your ex-husband doesn't know.

368
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,124
Moreover, I can tell

369
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,043
you are about to explode with anger.

370
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,124
The boxing gym
is right next to the gallery.

371
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:54,923
If you want to go back, be my guest.

372
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,043
But you have to beat me first.

373
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,284
That is my affair.

374
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:06,244
I'm not in the mood
to do it with you now.

375
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:07,683
What about her?

376
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:11,604
Do you have time to play with her?

377
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,043
How old are you?

378
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,524
Can you act more maturely?

379
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:16,803
I'm not mature?

380
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,524
Are you then?

381
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,963
Adults should face challenges head-on.

382
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:24,244
Don't be a sore loser.

383
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,163
You and your ex-husband

384
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,563
both are ostriches

385
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:31,724
and wusses.

386
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,644
Just a woman defeated both of you.

387
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,683
Is this what you've got?

388
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:38,404
Are you afraid of her?

389
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:51,683
Stop drinking.

390
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,724
What's the matter with your son?

391
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,923
He's involved.

392
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,203
We were fighting desperately
with Gao Xiajing,

393
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,803
but he disappeared and hid.

394
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,604
Is he even a man?

395
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,203
Well.

396
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:05,004
My son has his own reasons

397
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,083
for staying silent.

398
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,363
What reasons?

399
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,323
If this matter isn't clarified now,

400
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,244
he'll never be able to clarify it.

401
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:14,643
What are you blustering about?

402
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:16,843
Stop.

403
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:21,484
(I am Zhu Jincao.)

404
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:22,964
My son is here.

405
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,244
(Gao Xiajing,)

406
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,603
(I'm giving you another chance)

407
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,123
(to tell the truth.)

408
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:28,524
(If you still insist,)

409
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:29,524
(I'll make you regret it.)

410
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:31,684
(I mean it.)

411
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,484
(Come out. I want to see you.)

412
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:49,764
Gao Xiajing, where are you going?

413
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:50,803
I have an emergency.

414
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:53,883
Over 400,000 fans are watching.

415
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,323
Is there anything more important
than that?

416
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,403
I told you before,

417
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,083
if you hurt my family again,

418
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:20,964
I'd never let you off.

419
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:25,724
I shouldn't have posted the photos

420
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,883
of Gu Moli in the gym online.

421
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,684
I apologize to you.

422
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,643
I am willing to accept the consequences.

423
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,924
That's not what I am talking about.

424
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,403
Take a look at this.

425
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,123
Thank you.

426
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:41,724
You're welcome.

427
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:47,843
Then have another one.

428
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,724
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

429
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:01,803
Hey, watch it!

430
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:02,924
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,043
Ms. Gao, water.

432
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:04,684
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:05,803
Ke, are you okay?

434
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:06,964
I'm really sorry.

435
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,323
Mr. Zhu, I've missed you so much.

436
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,964
I miss Ke too.

437
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:18,284
I don't like the new kindergarten.

438
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,964
They are not nice to me.

439
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,883
I miss you too.

440
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,244
I came today

441
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:26,043
to ask you about something.

442
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,643
But promise

443
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,323
you'll answer me honestly

444
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,444
and not lie.

445
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,484
Okay.

446
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,004
Where did you and your mother

447
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,403
spend the night
of the Mid-Autumn Festival?

448
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:37,083
I can't say.

449
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,724
Mom told me

450
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,724
to say we went to Dad's place.

451
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:42,403
It's been a very long time

452
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,164
since I last saw my dad.

453
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:46,164
I spent the night

454
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:48,164
at home.

455
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:51,444
Very good.

456
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:53,444
Guo,

457
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,403
you are an honest child.

458
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,803
Mr. Zhu,

459
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,004
will you come to visit me in the future?

460
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:01,444
I hope that when you grow up,

461
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,284
you will always be an honest person.

462
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:16,843
Don't push me.

463
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,964
Guo is an honest child.

464
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,363
He is still young.

465
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:23,803
I don't want to hurt him.

466
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,123
Gao Xiajing,

467
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,444
hurry to continue the live stream.

468
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,563
I don't care what happened to you.

469
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:51,563
Don't forget

470
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:53,204
you have signed.

471
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,684
You have to listen to me.

472
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:57,244
Otherwise,

473
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:00,883
I will hold you accountable
for the losses caused by you.

474
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:03,284
Do you understand?

475
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,244
Everyone,

476
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,524
could I have
your attention for a second?

477
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:43,764
I must

478
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:46,123
admit

479
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,323
that what I just said

480
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,563
was all made up by myself.

481
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:58,083
I've falsely accused
Zhu Jincao and Gu Moli.

482
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:01,004
Here,

483
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:04,924
I would like
to sincerely apologize to them.

484
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:17,883
What are you looking at?

485
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:18,883
Turn it off.

486
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,524
Guys, the play is finished.

487
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,244
Bye.

488
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:26,484
Let's go have some tea.

489
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:29,764
Alright.

490
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,764
Zhang Shanya, you really did well.

491
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:42,484
It would be a pity
if you don't be a live streamer.

492
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:43,964
Come work with me.

493
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:45,603
I can't.

494
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:47,363
I was just angry.

495
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,284
I don't even know what I was saying.

496
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,284
Such a rare talent.

497
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:52,323
Cheers.

498
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,204
Cheers.

499
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:58,684
But I'm curious.

500
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,403
What did Zhu Jincao say

501
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:02,284
to Gao Xiajing?

502
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:04,284
Why did she suddenly apologize?

503
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,363
Let me tell you.

504
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:08,484
Her apology

505
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,204
was witnessed by all the people, right?

506
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,524
My son definitely had
some kind of ace up his sleeve.

507
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:15,043
What could it be?

508
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,043
Gu.

509
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:23,204
Gu, can you not even remember
your own home's password?

510
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:30,403
Why are you here?

511
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,843
You've come here to spout nonsense?

512
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,043
N-N-No, I haven't said anything.

513
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,563
No?

514
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:48,403
Thinking I'm deaf and blind?

515
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,363
The whole world knows

516
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,643
you and her

517
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,724
were fooling around online.

518
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,284
Isn't it shameful?

519
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,603
Isn't it?

520
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,524
Zhu Dali, what are you talking about?

521
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,764
Who was making a fool of themselves?

522
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,284
Your son caused the trouble

523
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:04,724
and made my daughter suffer.

524
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:07,563
I was seeking justice for Zhu Jincao.

525
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,323
You...

526
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,764
Do you understand?

527
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:12,363
You're an ungrateful snake.

528
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,004
You call me a snake,
and he called me an ox.

529
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,403
Is your home a zoo or something?

530
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:19,403
You're worse than animals.

531
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:20,403
What are you saying?

532
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:21,363
No, don't.

533
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:22,524
Wu,

534
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,883
he didn't mean that.

535
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:25,843
What are you doing?

536
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,164
Wu is trying to help us

537
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:28,204
and Jincao.

538
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:29,403
Help us?

539
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:31,964
Help her daughter
and our son get a divorce.

540
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,484
Ruin your son's reputation.

541
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:37,724
How did this whole thing start?

542
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:38,603
Don't you have any idea?

543
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:39,563
Wait.

544
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,603
Zhu Dali,

545
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:41,883
I see now.

546
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,684
It's fine if you don't appreciate
our kindness.

547
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,284
But you can't slander my daughter

548
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,403
or my wife.

549
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,684
Put your hand down.

550
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,004
Go lecture your wife.

551
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:51,403
I...

552
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:51,964
What's that?

553
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:53,684
Zhu Dali, this is my home.

554
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:55,244
It's not your place to lecture us.

555
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,403
Be reasonable!

556
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,004
Fine.

557
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:58,123
Don't you want to be reasonable?

558
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,603
Then make yourself clear today.

559
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:00,764
You go first.

560
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:01,524
What should I say?

561
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,444
Start with your daughter.

562
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:03,724
You came to our home.

563
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:04,724
Start with your son.

564
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:06,484
Start with your daughter first

565
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:07,724
and then your wife.

566
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,643
What's wrong
with my daughter and my wife?

567
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:15,883
Moli,

568
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:18,724
I've done what I promised you.

569
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,603
Gao Xiajing has shut up.

570
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:21,964
From now on,

571
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:23,444
she won't harass us anymore.

572
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:25,924
I have a question.

573
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:27,803
What have you done

574
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,244
to make Gao Xiajing shut up?

575
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:31,924
Don't talk to me like this, okay?

576
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:34,924
Sorry.

577
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:38,043
Hello.

578
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:40,244
Moli, it's bad.

579
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:41,643
Hurry back.

580
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:43,964
Better with Zhu Jincao as well.

581
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,164
Something happened at my home.

582
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,803
(Don't you want to be reasonable?)

583
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:47,764
(Nothing to say now, huh?)

584
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:48,563
Right?

585
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:49,643
Alright.

586
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:50,643
I don't want to talk

587
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,484
or hear any more of it anymore.

588
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,004
You're such a savage.

589
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,083
I can't reason with you.

590
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,484
Don't say anything more.

591
00:25:56,484 --> 00:25:57,843
Leave this place.

592
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,204
Leave our home. You're not welcome here.

593
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:02,164
Before I leave, I must tell you.

594
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:04,204
Discipline your daughter well.

595
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:05,684
Look what she's turned into.

596
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:07,964
She's stirred up trouble
in her in-laws' home.

597
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:09,883
Don't you as parents
have any responsibility?

598
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:12,724
You were once a general manager,
and this is what you're like?

599
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:15,643
Being a general manager
has nothing to do with character.

600
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,643
You were a section chief in a factory.

601
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:19,444
How do you treat your daughter-in-law?

602
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:21,123
You didn't put her name
on the property deed.

603
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,444
The couple was living well,

604
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:24,484
but you interfered
and got her kicked out.

605
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:26,323
Is that how a section chief should act?

606
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,164
At least, I'm better than you.

607
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:29,043
Mr. Gu,

608
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:29,883
say it louder.

609
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:32,083
Let your neighbors, let everyone
living in this building hear it.

610
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:32,684
What's wrong?

611
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,803
You've really got nerve. Shameless!

612
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,043
What did you say?

613
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:36,484
Who?

614
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:37,363
It's you. And you!

615
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,043
It's the two of you.

616
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,204
Dali!

617
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,083
This is their home.

618
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:44,924
Do Jincao a favor.

619
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:46,524
How's he gonna face them?

620
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,643
They are the ones
who need to be reasonable.

621
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:52,204
What do you want?

622
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:53,883
Do you want me to kneel before you?

623
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:08,244
Demao, Yulan,

624
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:10,123
I'm really sorry.

625
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,164
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:12,603
You don't have to apologize. It was him.

627
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,603
What's the matter?

628
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:16,764
Zhu Dali, what are you doing?

629
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:17,524
What happened?

630
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,363
It was their fault.

631
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:20,924
They need to apologize to me!

632
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:21,603
Are you okay?

633
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:23,843
You've totally disgraced us.

634
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,803
Zhu Dali, you stop it!

635
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:36,843
You rascal.

636
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,004
What did you call me?

637
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,764
Try hitting my mom again. Just try.

638
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,164
J-J-Jincao, I'm okay.

639
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,284
Let him go.

640
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,563
Jincao, I'm okay.

641
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,403
Mom, let go.

642
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,524
Zhu Dali, I'm warning you.

643
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,484
If you lay a hand on my mom again,

644
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:05,803
I'll take you on today.

645
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:09,244
Hello, police.

646
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:13,164
(Team Quarterly OKR Meeting)
The meeting starts now.

647
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:15,883
It's the end of the quarter again.

648
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:18,323
It's time again to present

649
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,444
your objectives and key results.

650
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,764
If you want to get
the bonus for this quarter,

651
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,004
you have to put in extra effort.

652
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:24,964
- Yes.
- Yes.

653
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:26,724
Now each team

654
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,083
has its own issues.

655
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:30,363
I'll talk about Team One's issues first.

656
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,444
Team One,

657
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:32,643
your...

658
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:40,603
Wait.

659
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:42,883
What's wrong with Shen Liuliu?

660
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,563
She's like this

661
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:45,924
whenever there's a meeting.

662
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:49,524
Is what I say that repulsive to her?

663
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:51,403
Mr. Wang,

664
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:54,403
she hasn't been feeling well recently.

665
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,204
Who allowed you to talk?

666
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:57,004
Sit down.

667
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:02,524
I'm sorry, everyone.

668
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,083
I'm feeling a little unwell.

669
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:07,724
Can we start the meeting now?

670
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:10,363
Look.

671
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,363
We have to get Ms. Shen's approval

672
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:15,323
for a meeting.

673
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:19,323
Ms. Shen, are you tired
from working overtime?

674
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,563
I haven't seen you
working overtime recently.

675
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:24,323
Listen.

676
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:26,724
Some colleagues need
to realize they can't rest on

677
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,444
their laurels
and coast on their seniority

678
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,684
just because they have achieved

679
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:35,164
something for the company before.

680
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,843
If they do not continue
to provide value for the company,

681
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:40,363
whoever they are
or whatever position they hold,

682
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:42,244
they can be replaced at any time.

683
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,684
Mr. Wang, there's no need
for insinuations.

684
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:45,643
I understand.

685
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:48,204
You don't need to change
the company's pace for me.

686
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:50,323
I'm officially quitting my job.

687
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:52,284
I'm done with this.

688
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:58,244
Liuliu.

689
00:29:58,244 --> 00:29:58,724
Shen Liuliu.

690
00:29:58,724 --> 00:29:59,323
Liuliu.

691
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:01,164
Shen Liuliu.

692
00:30:02,764 --> 00:30:03,764
What does she mean by that?

693
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,964
I'm resigning too.

694
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:06,924
Huang Qianniu,

695
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:08,603
what's wrong with you?

696
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:10,964
I've been displeased
with you people for a long time.

697
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,004
I'm not working for you anymore.

698
00:30:15,323 --> 00:30:16,164
(Usually,)

699
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:18,043
(in cases of such family disputes)

700
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,444
where there hasn't been
significant harm to individuals

701
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,164
or property loss,

702
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:25,083
we recommend resolving it
within the family.

703
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:27,204
After all, harmony
in the family matters most.

704
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:29,123
But

705
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,643
if you insist on suing,

706
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,204
you must follow the legal procedures.

707
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:35,643
Thank you so much.

708
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:36,883
It's our duty.

709
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:38,843
Sir,

710
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:40,524
don't be so impulsive in the future.

711
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:43,403
Have a calm talk with your son.

712
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,883
You've really brought honor to us.

713
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,043
You're the first to send your own father

714
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,363
to the police station in our family.

715
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,004
I'm sorry

716
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:16,764
for letting your parents
witness a farce just now.

717
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,123
Can you apologize to them for me?

718
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,284
You should hurry home
and check on your mom.

719
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:37,843
Doctor, how is the baby?

720
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,643
The baby is very healthy.
You don't have to worry.

721
00:31:40,803 --> 00:31:42,403
Just one thing.

722
00:31:42,803 --> 00:31:45,204
Don't come alone
for prenatal check-ups again.

723
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:47,524
It's best to have
the baby's father accompany you.

724
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:49,284
You are a mother now.

725
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,524
Don't try to be tough.

726
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:52,164
You can go back

727
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,083
to being an independent woman
after having the baby.

728
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:55,684
Your belly

729
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,164
isn't showing the pregnancy yet.

730
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:58,563
When it gets bigger,

731
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:01,164
it's unsafe for you
to be going around alone.

732
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,684
The baby has no father,

733
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,244
and I don't have any other family.

734
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,403
It's just me.

735
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:12,164
You need to learn
to take care of yourself even more.

736
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:14,244
Thank you.

737
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,912
(Gynecology Examination Room)

738
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,204
Liuliu.

739
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:40,363
I heard my aunt telling
my mom that you were sick,

740
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:41,803
and you suddenly said you'd resign.

741
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,363
I really couldn't stop worrying,

742
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:44,244
so I followed you.

743
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:45,284
You followed me?

744
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:46,363
For a whole day.

745
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,603
What did you see?

746
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:48,883
Everything

747
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:52,643
I should've seen.

748
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,123
Listen carefully.

749
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:57,244
If you leak any bit of it,

750
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,684
you'll die.

751
00:32:58,724 --> 00:32:59,444
Understood.

752
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,964
But I have one condition.

753
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:02,964
What condition?

754
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:05,484
You're an adult.

755
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,724
Shouldn't you bring
some chocolate when you go out?

756
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,603
You are not just one person anymore.

757
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:10,843
It's two lives.

758
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:12,123
The doctor is right.

759
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,924
You need to learn to protect yourself.

760
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:15,204
Eat it

761
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:16,724
to replenish your energy.

762
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,284
Double energy.

763
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,164
Look at what this little apartment
has become.

764
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:36,204
It's quite cozy.

765
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:40,563
Be careful.

766
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:41,524
Come up.

767
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:42,684
Down.

768
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:44,803
Please stop moving, okay?

769
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,363
Go sit over there.

770
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:48,403
Leave it to me.

771
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,484
You've got a little life inside you,

772
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:55,684
but you don't rest
and are going to start a business.

773
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,284
That really makes me

774
00:33:57,643 --> 00:33:59,204
feel for you.

775
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,603
Why?

776
00:34:00,964 --> 00:34:03,043
Didn't I do the same in the office,

777
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,043
making phone calls and preparing slides?

778
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:08,204
I'm gonna earn some money to afford milk

779
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,684
for Liulian in my belly.

780
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,084
OK, I'll keep you company at all costs.

781
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:12,363
Okay.

782
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:13,803
Give me that.

783
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,244
Do you love your work so much?

784
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:16,843
Can't you take a break?

785
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:21,244
I've made the right choice following you

786
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:23,363
and resigning.

787
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:26,244
Later, when you're the boss,
I'll be the deputy.

788
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,284
It's all leading us down the right path.

789
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,523
You want to be the deputy?

790
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:31,843
With your ability,

791
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,284
at most you'd be
a general manager assistant.

792
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,124
An assistant is okay.

793
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:36,883
Give it to me.

794
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,483
Here?

795
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:39,764
Right across the door.

796
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:40,684
Okay.

797
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:43,684
If my performance is good,

798
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:46,843
would I get promoted?

799
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,363
At least, I am a founder.

800
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:51,443
Could I get some founder's shares?

801
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:53,284
Alright.

802
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:55,963
Just wait for it to go public.

803
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:58,483
I'll wait until the end.

804
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:01,003
Ms. Shen,

805
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,523
it's about to go public.

806
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:03,883
Shen...

807
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:05,883
Ms. Shen,

808
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,604
the stocks won't be
on the New Third Board.

809
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:11,523
They'll be on the A-share market, okay?

810
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:25,204
Thank you.

811
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,523
How did you even find your way here?

812
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:28,644
I was about to ask you.

813
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,604
You and Liuliu both resigned.

814
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:31,963
What are you up to?

815
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,084
It's none of your business.

816
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:37,803
Open the door.

817
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:39,764
I won't open it. She's not at home.

818
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,644
You're at her place.
How can she not be home?

819
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:43,564
Tell me honestly,

820
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:44,724
why did you resign?

821
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:46,044
Has something happened?

822
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:47,164
Not at all.

823
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:48,684
Otherwise, would we start
a business together?

824
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:49,523
Starting a business?

825
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,003
With you?

826
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:53,483
Oh, no.

827
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,323
Liuliu must have encountered
something awful.

828
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:58,084
Why would starting a business

829
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,684
with me mean that?

830
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:01,084
Don't look down on me.

831
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:03,644
I don't doubt her.
I just don't trust you.

832
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:05,403
Let me go up and ask her in person.

833
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:06,803
Open the door.

834
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:07,803
I won't open it.

835
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:08,564
Well...

836
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,124
You don't have to repay
the money you owe me, okay?

837
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,403
You're always like this.

838
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,284
Should I agree or not agree?

839
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:18,604
So do you?

840
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,204
The door is now open.

841
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,684
Liulian Education Consultancy.

842
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:30,724
Impressive, isn't it?

843
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:32,644
Lingxiao,

844
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:34,084
take a look around.

845
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,564
Mr. Wang,

846
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:47,443
Ms. Shen is very busy
starting up her business.

847
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:50,604
She has no time for idlers like you.

848
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:51,923
If there's nothing,

849
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:52,724
you can...

850
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:53,843
You can go back.

851
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:55,963
I'm an idler?

852
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:57,604
I can't believe I'd be called an idler

853
00:36:57,604 --> 00:36:58,604
by you in this lifetime.

854
00:36:58,604 --> 00:36:59,843
Times change.

855
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:01,724
Ms. Shen.

856
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:05,963
Hi.

857
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:08,523
Hi.

858
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:11,523
I just went to your office.

859
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,963
They said you resigned,

860
00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:14,323
so I came to see you.

861
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:17,523
How's your health?

862
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:19,084
Do you need help?

863
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,523
Thank you for your concern.

864
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:22,204
My resignation wasn't for rest.

865
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:23,923
It was for starting a business.

866
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:25,843
If you need anything for your startup,

867
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:26,684
I can help.

868
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:27,483
No need.

869
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,684
The shares have already been allocated.

870
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:30,883
No need for outsiders.

871
00:37:31,564 --> 00:37:32,963
I am an outsider?

872
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:33,764
I...

873
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,443
Ms. Shen, you'll have

874
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:38,323
an important video conference
with a client in five minutes.

875
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,764
Why don't you go back now

876
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:41,244
if there's nothing?

877
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:42,724
Pay me back.

878
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,003
If you're about to be in a meeting,

879
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:49,764
I'll take my leave.

880
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,403
Let me know anytime
if you face any difficulties.

881
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:04,124
Thank you.

882
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:09,923
Take care.

883
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:15,644
I was so freaked out.

884
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:16,724
Lingxiao

885
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,764
can always tell when I'm lying.

886
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,883
Those are some sharp eyes.

887
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,483
A little more time

888
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:21,963
and he'd have discovered
what was going on.

889
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,483
(Shanghai Maternal Health Handbook)
He almost found this.

890
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:33,044
Huang Qianniu, aren't you curious
who the baby's father is?

891
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:38,923
If you don't tell, I won't ask.

892
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:42,124
As a man, it's right for me
to take good care of women and kids,

893
00:38:42,124 --> 00:38:43,684
especially since I'm its uncle.

894
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:53,963
Don't overthink it.

895
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,644
I'm not going to be the dad
of another man's kid.

896
00:38:58,523 --> 00:39:00,284
My most important task right now

897
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:02,963
is to be a good assistant to you

898
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:04,963
and your good friend.

899
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:08,244
Isn't there a saying,

900
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:13,084
"May all lovers
turn out to be relatives"?

901
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:14,644
That's us it's referring to.

902
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,323
I'll just contentedly
be Liulian's uncle.

903
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:20,164
Give it to me.

904
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:23,403
Such an important thing
shouldn't be misplaced.

905
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:24,523
I'll keep it safe for you.

906
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:50,124
What's going on?

907
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,443
The gallery is turning into a nightclub?

908
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:54,523
Hurry up and get in position.
The new boss is coming soon.

909
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,644
The new boss?

910
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,803
Mr. Zhou has arrived!

911
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:58,963
- Mr. Zhou.
- Mr. Zhou.

912
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:01,084
Thank you for your hard work.

913
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:03,323
- For our clients.
- For our clients.

914
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:04,164
Thank you for your work.

915
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,523
Thank you.

916
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:06,363
Thank you.

917
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,403
Thank you.

918
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:08,244
Thank you.

919
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:08,644
Take it.

920
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:09,244
Thank you.

921
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,084
Thank you for your work.

922
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,403
Let me introduce him formally.

923
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,483
This is Mr. Zhou Yu,
the new largest shareholder

924
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:18,764
of the gallery

925
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,483
and the newly appointed CEO.

926
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:22,044
Let's give him a big round of applause.

927
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:30,124
Thank you, all shareholders
of the Flying Bird Gallery,

928
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:31,323
for your trust in me.

929
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:32,923
My passion for art

930
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:34,564
has finally found its home.

931
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:36,883
Starting today,

932
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:39,923
the Flying Bird Gallery
is everyone's home.

933
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:40,883
Great!

934
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,363
Mr. Zhou,

935
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,443
you're the CEO,

936
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:49,443
- and your gift is only 100 yuan?
- Quiet

937
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:53,363
Everyone's position is retained,

938
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:56,443
and all of you get a ten percent raise.

939
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:11,124
Any other requests?

940
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,403
I want to resign.

941
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:18,323
Why?

942
00:41:18,883 --> 00:41:20,323
Do you hate me that much?

943
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:23,323
We've got
such an unreliable boss like you.

944
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:24,843
Shouldn't I get off

945
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:26,764
the sinking ship in time?

946
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:30,284
Your EQ.

947
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:32,204
If you're not gonna kiss up to me,

948
00:41:32,684 --> 00:41:34,084
can't you at least say

949
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,843
something positive on my first day?

950
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,363
I hope

951
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,084
you won't get fooled
when buying paintings.

952
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:55,363
What on earth are you up to?

953
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:17,284
Where did you get this from?

954
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:19,483
This is your graduation work.

955
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,564
I bought it from your alma mater.

956
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:24,403
How amazing.

957
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,164
After so many years,

958
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:27,883
after having children
and getting divorced,

959
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:30,644
your temper didn't change at all.

960
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:33,644
What exactly do you want to do?

961
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:36,164
I've collected all the works you did

962
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:38,204
during your time in school

963
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:39,244
and as an agent in the gallery.

964
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:42,564
They're all here.

965
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,244
What do you think?

966
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:48,044
Moved beyond words?

967
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,244
Don't get excited yet.

968
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:55,284
Another piece of good news.

969
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:58,764
I want you to become a painter.

970
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:01,564
I'll organize a solo exhibition for you.

971
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,003
Would you like that?

972
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:08,124
Mr. Zhou,

973
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:11,323
thank you for your kindness.

974
00:43:11,644 --> 00:43:13,244
You don't have to make great efforts

975
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:15,084
to collect these failed works.

976
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:16,644
Just let me resign.

977
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:18,644
I have a suggestion for you.

978
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,764
Get a reliable assistant in the future

979
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:22,284
