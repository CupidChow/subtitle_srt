00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:40,106
Hello, property management?
My water pipe has burst.

21
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:42,266
Please send someone to fix it.

22
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,425
Sorry, the maintenance worker
has already finished for the day.

23
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:46,946
Would it be alright to fix it tomorrow?

24
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:50,465
Definitely not.
My home is completely flooded.

25
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,786
Well, the repairman isn't here.
There's nothing we can do.

26
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,826
Don't you have any on-duty repairmen?

27
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:58,465
I pay my property management fees
diligently every year.

28
00:02:58,465 --> 00:02:59,585
I am really sorry.

29
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:00,865
I am very truly sorry.

30
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:01,506
Come on, drink.

31
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:07,506
What kind of attitude is this?

32
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:35,506

A great flood, symbolling prosperity.
There's a flood?

35
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:52,585
Liuliu, your place is flooded?

36
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:55,585
What happened? Is it serious?

37
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,025
You're everywhere.

38
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:08,786
Liuliu.

39
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:17,665
Liuliu, I saw that address
below your Moments post.

40
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,986
I know where you live.

41
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:23,386
What's your building number?
Which department on what floor?

42
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,386
Send it to me.
I'm coming over right now.

43
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,665
What's the matter with him?

44
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:42,785
Liuliu, are you busy?
Send me a message back.

Is everything okay?

00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:13,545
Liuliu, this is Niu.

50
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:16,866
Liuliu, I'm coming to rescue you.

51
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,306
I asked the security guard.

52
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:22,866
You live in building 20, apartment 201.

53
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:26,866
Liuliu, please open the door.

54
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,386
You have nowhere to hide.
Just open the door.

55
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,266
Huang Qianniu, stop knocking already.

56
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:35,266
I've fixed the pipe.
You should go back now.

57
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:36,826
It's fixed?

58
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:40,105
I don't believe you.
Don't try to be tough.

59
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:41,465
Believe it or not, it's true.

60
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,306
Liuliu, I came all this way.

61
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,946
Aren't you going to invite me in
for a cup of coffee?

62
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,626
Are we gonna do this, really?

63
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:53,186
Huang Qianniu, I appreciate the thought.
Now go home.

64
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,186
I've made myself very clear.

65
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:58,266
After all, you are my friend's
ex cousin-in-law.

66
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,386
I don't want to be too harsh.

67
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,426
Yours sure is an interesting family.

68
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:03,986
Every one of you is so special.

69
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:09,506
Liuliu, you are forcing me
to take drastic measures.

70
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:14,986
Liuliu, open the door, will you?

71
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,905
Liuliu, open the door.

72
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,626
Liuliu, open the door.

73
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:19,386
Liuliu, open the door.

74
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,306
Stop shouting. Just stop it.

75
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:25,105
Shen Liuliu, just answer him.

76
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,025
Otherwise, the whole building
won't be able to sleep.

77
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,905
You answer him.

78
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,866
I won't shout. You shouldn't, either.

79
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,426
I can wait here forever.

80
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,665
Liuliu, did you hear what they say?

81
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:42,585
Open the door. I...

82
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,145
You are Huang Qianniu, right?

83
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:45,785
Yes.

84
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,785
I've found her. Don't worry.

85
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:50,386
Miss Shen said you were disturbing her.
You must leave.

86
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:53,386
I'm trying to win this girl over.
You think it's easy?

87
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:55,465
I'll be quick. Don't be a buzz kill.

88
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,626
Security, please take him away.

89
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,345
Liuliu.

90
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,905
You heard it. Off we go.

91
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:03,426
Liuliu, I will come back again.

(Jinshan International Creative Park)

93
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,306
So, are we clear about that?

94
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,105
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,826
Based on the three points
that I just mentioned,

96
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:15,705
make a new plan.

97
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:17,186
Put it on my desk
at 8 a.m. tomorrow, okay?

98
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:17,705
Make it quick.

99
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,306
Okay.

100
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,105
Organize the data for the beauty section
and give me a copy.

101
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:22,145
Within the past 48 hours.

102
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,345
- Okay.
- Thank you.

103
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,426
Also, I need to remind everyone.

104
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:33,186
Kittens cannot drink cow's milk.

105
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:37,105
Be sure to choose the appropriate
sheep milk powder for them.

106
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:46,705
(Consider this my donation
of canned meat for the kittens.)

107
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,345
Thank you, Jincao, thanks.

108
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:56,506
Everyone who cares for small animals
has a tender heart.

109
00:07:57,025 --> 00:08:00,105
May all your worries be soothed.

110
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:04,785
Jincao.

111
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:08,986
How are the guild streamers I signed
performing here?

112
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:09,986
Do you want the truth?

113
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:10,826
Of course.

114
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:11,785
Not so good.

115
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:16,626
Jincao, I fear you might say
something stupid at the meeting.

116
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:20,306
I consider you one of us,
so let me be honest with you.

117
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,705
Data is supposed to be
managed by people.

118
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,785
A little adjusting hurts nobody.

119
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,025
This is data-cooking
and it's against the company's rules.

120
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,106
Rules are rigid but people are flexible.

121
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,226
Jincao.

122
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:40,226
You're good in every way except

123
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:41,905
that you don't know how to adapt.

124
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,226
After all,
the company belongs to the boss.

125
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,626
No matter how much we earn,
it doesn't go into our own pockets.

126
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,785
Our salary is earned through hard work.

127
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,626
You know what I mean?

128
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:57,106
I don't.

129
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,305
You need to learn to be flexible.

130
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,945
I will not treat my brothers unfairly.

131
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:13,506
Jinying Live, our company,

132
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,825
isn't doing so well operation-wise.

133
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,866
Our performance doesn't live up
to the headquarters' expectations.

134
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,425
The main reason is that
we have some fierce competitors.

135
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,785
Of course, there are also
problems of our own.

136
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,185
Currently, channels such as
beauty, pets and technology

137
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,665
are still far from achieving the KPI.

138
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,586
For the guild streamers we signed,

139
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,266
there is still much to improve.

140
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:39,065
Could you be more specific
about the issues with streamers?

141
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:50,305
Running Bunny, Gold Pea and Hot Rain

142
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,545
are not generating good rating.
I suggest not to follow up.

143
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:53,746
What's the problem?

144
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,506
Where did you gather your data from?
Is it accurate?

145
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,386
Me and my team's tech staff

146
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,586
checked three times before the meeting.

147
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,226
Can't be a mistake.

148
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,545
Then how come the data you've collected
is different from mine?

149
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,466
Running Bunny, Gold Pea and Hot Rain

150
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,866
are all performing wonderfully.

151
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,785
Each one of them has
more than one million followers.

152
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,545
I just saw it before the meeting.

153
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:14,386
What's going on?

154
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:18,025
All bots.
They paid to boost their popularity.

155
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,746
The real stats look pretty bad.

156
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,145
Mr. Zhu, are you trying to use stats

157
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:25,226
as a tool to get rid of competition
for your streamers?

158
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,665
Since we both stick to our own words,

159
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,145
how about we let
a third-party verify it?

160
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,785
I think that's a brilliant idea.

161
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:34,506
We'll run an inspection
and whoever cooked the data gets fired.

162
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:36,866
I agree.

163
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,386
It seems Jincao
hasn't fully adapted himself

164
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,706
to the corporate culture
here in Jinshan.

165
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:49,506
We often divide into two sides
and debate with each other.

166
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,866
Truth only becomes clearer
through debate.

167
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,466
Everyone should learn from Liu Zhi.

168
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,706
Dare to criticize, dare to question.

169
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,785
If one can't face criticism
from one's own people,

170
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,305
how will they handle the competition?

171
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:03,185
Since Mr. Zhu disapproved
the streamers I recommended,

172
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:06,626
then let's take a look
at Mr. Zhu's recommendations.

173
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,905
Here, it's all on the big screen.

174
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,025
There are many kind-hearted people

175
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,466
who want to adopt stray animals.

176
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,545
But I need to remind everyone here...

177
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,825
It's Gao Xiajing, right?

178
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:20,506
Those numbers aren't very good.

179
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,825
The online user count is
less than ten thousand.

180
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,825
Poor presentation
and the content lacks distinction.

181
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:30,706
Streamers as such will only
diminish the value of our website.

182
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:34,185
Gao Xiajing has been the streamer
with the fastest-growing data this week.

183
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,425
And it's all solid data, no cooking.

184
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,506
Her current fan base
may not be large enough,

185
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,825
but I'm optimistic about
her potential for growth.

186
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,905
I see Mr. Zhu likes
the gentle and healing type.

187
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,665
Won't the man of your house object?

188
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,425
Not at all.

189
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:53,706
I recruit by professional judgment,
not personal preferences.

190
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:58,545
Truly professional.
A happily divorced woman.

191
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,665
A rare type in the market.

192
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,160
(Insomniac Gale:
Ready for battle today?)

193
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,425
(Can't stay up late.
Too much to do tomorrow.)

194
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:44,056
(Insomniac Gale:
True, ours is a tough age.)

195
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,808
(We can't get sick or worn down,
with no one to take care of us.)

196
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,466
(And it's not like we can talk
to parents about troubles at work.)

197
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,506
(Nor can I tell the wife
lest she gets worried.)

198
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,904
(Insomniac Gale: Life is too short.)

199
00:12:54,904 --> 00:13:00,486
(Having someone to talk to is great,
even just to escape for a while.)

200
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,266
(I feel the same,
but let's not talk about it today.)

201
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:16,025
You wanna know what holidays mean to me?

202
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:20,185
They're just milestones
for reporting work.

203
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,305
I don't know when it started,

204
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:28,586
but we all tacitly agree that
holidays mean overtime.

205
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,626
There's always a project
waiting for you during the holiday.

206
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:37,986
Hang in there. It's exhausting.

207
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:43,305
Holidays mean just one thing.

208
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:46,746
Spending some quality time
with your parents.

209
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,905
As for whether you are happy yourself,

210
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:51,305
whether you like the programs on TV,

211
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,025
whether you are with your parents
or someone else's,

212
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:57,466
none of this matters as long as
the formality is fulfilled.

213
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:00,825
You're just a prop. Why ask for so much?

214
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,346
Right, I misspoke earlier.

215
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:04,945
Let me say it again.

216
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:09,586
I am grateful for all the holidays
marked on the calendar.

217
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,905
Because, without their reminders,

218
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:13,905
my days would just flow by like water,

219
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:17,425
passing day by day,
slowly becoming a routine.

220
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:23,746
Getting used to being busy and tired.

221
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:26,185
Life is as bland as water.

222
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,466
Then let me say it again, too.

223
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,945
I like every holiday.

224
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,626
Because holidays mean reunion.

225
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:37,305
They mean being together with you.

226
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,665
As long as I'm with you, I am happy.

227
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,145
I am happy too.

228
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:53,613
(Reunion)

229
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,665
You silly child.

230
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,945
I can just take pictures with my phone.

231
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,185
Why did you buy me a camera?

232
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,226
How much does this cost?

233
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,825
You wanna show off now that you're rich?

234
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,626
I know you are happy.

235
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,706
Just say, "Thank you, son."

236
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,025
Thank you, son.

237
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,025
You're welcome.

238
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,106
Your daughter has assigned you a task.

239
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,266
We must spend
the Mid-Autumn Festival together.

240
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,025
I know. We'll have the team building
on the Mid-Autumn Day at our headquarters.

241
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:15,706
On the next day,
we spend time with clients.

242
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:20,266
Veto. We should also
spend the next day together.

243
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,986
One must not be too greedy.

244
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:27,665
Why are you here?

245
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:30,586
I have a thing at the headquarters,
so I figured I'll drop by.

246
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:38,986
Hi, Jincao.

247
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:45,025
You're here to check on me, aren't you?

248
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,466
Sort of. How is it?

249
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,866
Have you seen enough?

250
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,425
We agreed that it would be
just the three of us this time.

251
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,106
Don't worry. It's all taken care of.

252
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,986
First we'll have dinner,
then take Ke to the amusement park.

253
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:04,065
Finally, just the two of us
will go see a movie.

254
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,625
Approved.

255
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,176
Zhang Shanya.

256
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:25,944
Here.

257
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:30,266
Someone's selling mangoes outside.
Your favorite fruit.

258
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,666
So, I've bought some for you.

259
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,186
What are you doing?

260
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,666
Nothing.

261
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,105
Is that a camera?

262
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:51,466
Yes, our son signed me up

263
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,666
for a photography course
at the Elderly University.

264
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:58,186
So, this is for taking photos
for my home assignments.

265
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,785
When did he come back?

266
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,545
The company sent him back
to handle some matters.

267
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,946
He took the opportunity
to bring the camera to me.

268
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:12,825
He just left.

269
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,426
He came while I wasn't home?

270
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:20,666
No, he just had work to do later.

271
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,065
Zhang Shanya.

272
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:27,625
I think there's something off
about you attending this university.

273
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,065
Look, you're a housewife.

274
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:33,785
Why attend an Elderly University?

275
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:38,986
Not only have you not
educated your daughter-in-law well,

276
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,065
but you let her lead you astray.

277
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:43,266
Picked up all sorts of bad habits.

278
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,385
I'm just attending
the Elderly University.

279
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:51,585
Why are you bringing up
educating our daughter-in-law?

280
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:55,666
Isn't that what you said?
Live and learn.

281
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,785
Right, I said that. Is there a problem?

282
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,946
But I never told you
to urge our son to spend money.

283
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:06,746
Buying you all kinds of things.
How is this good home economics?

284
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,025
I'm not urging him. That is the truth.

285
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,825
Our son enrolled me into the university.

286
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,266
He paid the tuition fees.

287
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:16,345
He bought me this camera
without me asking.

288
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,746
Calm down. It's the same.

289
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,266
Do you have a receipt?

290
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,105
Here it is. I forgot to put it in.

291
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,146
It's not cheap, huh?

292
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:36,146
Our son is just showing that he cares.
Accept the thought, not the gift.

293
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:40,585
Jincao still has a mortgage to pay off.

294
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:45,065
As parents, we should
have his best interest at heart.

295
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,345
Save where we can to help him.

296
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:52,186
You can take photos with your phone.

297
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,986
I'll go and return this camera.

298
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,065
What if Jincao...

299
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:05,906
Right, don't tell Jincao about this.

300
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:08,706
Have some mangoes.

301
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,785
This lobster is pretty good.

302
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,825
This fish is nice.

303
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,986
Sir, I think the fish look quite good.

304
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:34,385
I'd like to buy a live fish.

305
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,906
Do you have something fresh
with good price?

306
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:39,105
Fresh crucian carp.
Just arrived this morning.

307
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,105
Let me see.

308
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,506
How much?

309
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,706
18 yuan per jin.

310
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:46,186
18? Can you go lower?

311
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,746
I can't do that.
It's been this price all along.

312
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,585
A little lower, please.
I'll just take one, okay?

313
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,065
Alright, pick one then.

314
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,105
Okay, this one.

315
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,946
It seems particularly vigorous.

316
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,345
- Good choice.
- This one.

317
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:59,746
You've got a good eye. Here.

318
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:08,146
How much is it?

319
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,065
15.3 yuan.

320
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:11,906
- 15.3.
- Just give me 15, spare the change.

321
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:13,625
Thanks you. That'd be great.

322
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,065
- Please scan the code.
- Okay.

323
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:16,625
Do you want it prepared?

324
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,146
Sure, please.

325
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,146
Alrighty.

326
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,506
(Everyone, don't forget the assignment
is about flowers and birds.)

327
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,986
(I'll check during class tomorrow.)

328
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:38,706
Don't move.

329
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:43,506
Keep scraping.

330
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:44,226
Okay.

331
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,825
Let me take a picture.

332
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,706
Are you one of them live streamers?

333
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,865
No.

334
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,785
Everyone, gather around.

335
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:11,506
Mr. Zhu.

336
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:12,545
Mr. Zhu is back.

337
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,466
Can we go home
for the Mid-Autumn Festival?

338
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:16,226
Mr. Jiang said

339
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,825
that he believes that our team
has the spirit of wolves.

340
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:22,865
Therefore, the new product will launch
on the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

341
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,426
We have to work overtime
on the Mid-Autumn Festival?

342
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,746
I know the main frame
is already well established.

343
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:33,706
Let's all work a little harder
to ensure there is no missing link.

344
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:35,146
Jie.

345
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,986
I need the progress sheet
in half an hour.

346
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:42,385
Kang.

347
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:47,305
Please, determine our
splash screen plan ASAP.

348
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:51,625
I know.

349
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:55,266
It's been tough for everyone
working overtime with me lately.

350
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,585
But we've all come to Jinshan.

351
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,345
We can't leave empty-handed, can we?

352
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,785
Since headquarters has presented us
with a challenge this time,

353
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,385
we'll take on the challenge.

354
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,146
We have to show them

355
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:11,906
that our team really does have
the spirit of wolves, all right?

356
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:29,746
Let's go.

357
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,385
Bad day. My boss had this crazy idea

358
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:44,065
that besides mooncakes and hairy crabs,
we should also give away

359
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:45,345
art albums as Mid-Autumn gifts.

360
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:48,345
I argued with
the printing factory all morning.

361
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,385
Finally got it settled.

362
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:51,585
It's exhausting.

363
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:56,865
I feel bad for you, honey.
I've had bit of a situation as well.

364
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:59,105
What do you mean "as well"?

365
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,105
Because it happened
right after our meetup.

366
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,186
My boss was acting crazy, too.

367
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:09,146
He's moved the new product launch
to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

368
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,186
Which means I definitely
won't be able to go home.

369
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:16,585
So I can't make it
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

370
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,545
But I'll be back the next day.

371
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:20,105
Isn't there a saying?

372
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,986
The moon is rounder on the 16th
than on the 15th, right?

373
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,986
Hello? Honey, are you listening?

374
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:33,305
It's okay. The mountain won't come,
so I'll go to the mountain.

375
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:34,746
What do you mean?

376
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:39,305
I mean I'll bring Ke over
and keep you company on the Mid-Autumn Day.

377
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,345
Great.

378
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:43,666
In that case,
I'll book a family suite at the hotel.

379
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,466
We must keep Ke happy.

380
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:48,666
No need, we'll stay wherever you stay.

381
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:50,105
Family should stick together.

382
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:53,025
You've been doing your part
for our family in Jinshan.

383
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,986
Can't I make a long trip
to be with my husband?

384
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:57,305
Tell me, honey, how can you be so sweet?

385
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,226
Seriously. How?

386
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,345
Your words even motivated me
to work harder.

387
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,146
Okay, give me a kiss.

388
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:10,986
Let's do that.

389
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:28,585
Everyone.

390
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:34,186
Flowers and birds are common subjects
for elderly photographers.

391
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:37,305
But the works tend to be cliché.

392
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,105
How do we avoid this problem?

393
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:43,266
The key lies in the angle and light.

394
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:46,105
Let's all have a look at this piece.

395
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:48,146
It's a great picture per se.

396
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,226
We must remember the key...

397
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:51,466
Did you finish your assignments today?

398
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,506
No, I'm not as free as you are.

399
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:56,426
I have a whole family to take care of.

400
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:01,065
Amazing. You were so good
that they ended up divorced.

401
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,305
Wu Yulan.

402
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:03,266
Don't be angry.

403
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,506
I'm actually thankful to you.

404
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:11,305
Pay attention to the coordination
between the flowers and the birds.

405
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:14,385
That is, the importance of composition.

406
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,146
Didn't your son buy you a new camera?

407
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:19,065
Why didn't you bring it to class?

408
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,506
I can't bear to. It's so expensive.

409
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,305
Most of the class managed

410
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:28,545
to achieve the three-part composition.

411
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:33,065
Often, it serves to balance the scene.

412
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,146
We need to pay special attention
to the ones with poor ratings.

413
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:49,368
(Live Room)

414
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:52,706
Why has he disappeared?

415
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:00,865
Friends, today we will learn
how to make baguettes.

416
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:04,025
(Gao Xiajing)
We only need four ingredients.

417
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:08,706
Flour, water, salt, and yeast.

418
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:12,146
There are many types of flour.

419
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:15,825
There's T45, T55, and T65.

420
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:18,706
What I'm using here is T45.

421
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,146
You call that streaming?

422
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:22,625
This is even more serious
than a high school lecture.

423
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:24,545
Who watches this kind of stuff nowadays?

424
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,466
Mr. Zhu, her stats
are indeed pretty bad.

425
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:35,305
Then we pour the starch
into a container like this.

426
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:08,946
Thank you.

427
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:16,585
Listen, here is the situation.

428
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:20,105
The company has
assigned a goal to each team.

429
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:22,906
It allows us to support
some new uploaders.

430
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,946
I think you're quite suitable.

431
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,305
So, I have asked the company
to give you a spot on the homepage.

432
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,986
During evening rush hour
for three consecutive days.

433
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,065
Thank you so much.

434
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:38,266
However, your stats
came back unflattering.

435
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:41,625
As your recommender, I am quite worried.

436
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:44,305
If the numbers don't improve
for three days in a row,

437
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,746
according to company policy,
you will have to be replaced.

438
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,746
I will try not to let you down.

439
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:54,625
I have watched your livestream.
It has a homely approach.

440
00:28:54,706 --> 00:28:57,585
The style is gentle and intellectual,
and your image is good too.

441
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,746
But it's just somewhat lacking in fun.

442
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,865
Fun?

443
00:29:03,746 --> 00:29:06,666
People watch livestreams for relaxation.

444
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,545
Your delivery is fine but too rigid.

445
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:11,385
It's like you're reading from a book.

446
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:16,345
Therefore, the audience might not
be intrigued to keep watching.

447
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:20,345
It's probably owing to my personality.

448
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:21,986
So, what should I do?

449
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:27,226
I think you can
make good use of this cat.

450
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:32,986
I always include Mimi when recording.

451
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,986
You can't just see it as a cat.

452
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:37,746
You have to treat it as a human.

453
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,785
As your student, even.

454
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,266
Learn to interact with it.

455
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,186
Like that cartoon, Tom and Jerry.

456
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,625
Perhaps you can create a star out of it.

457
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:53,105
Try your best to personify it.

458
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,666
I've made you a plan.
You can give it a shot.

459
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,625
I'll be simpler if I just
walk you through it.

460
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,466
This plan consists of three parts.

461
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:06,345
First, the content
for the first three days.

462
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,625
It is also the most important part.

463
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,666
Remember that
within the first three days,

464
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,385
you must build up your character.

465
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:13,385
A consistent persona, alright?

466
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:15,946
You need to lock in your own fan base.

467
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:17,186
Don't be greedy.

468
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:18,426
Not everyone will be your audience.

469
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,625
You must have a clear idea as to
what you're best at.

470
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,785
Position yourself accordingly.

471
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,545
I'll leave that to you.
Decide for yourself.

472
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,065
What's the most crucial thing here?

473
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:28,506
Will those people stay after three days?

474
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,385
And how many?

475
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,146
That Zhang Shanya is ridiculous.

476
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:55,146
Today, she came to school empty-handed.

477
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,506
No homework, no camera.

478
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:59,226
She even talked back to the teacher.

479
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:01,186
It can't be.

480
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:04,785
Zhu Jincao said he bought her a camera
a long time ago.

481
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,226
Why? Are you still concerning yourself
with the Zhus' affairs?

482
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:09,466
Who do you think you are?

483
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,186
Doesn't all this
trivial business bore you?

484
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:23,466
You can take photos with your phone.

485
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,345
I'll go and return this camera.

486
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,146
Don't tell Jincao about this.

487
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:37,585
Have some mangoes.

488
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:42,345
Well played.

489
00:31:56,545 --> 00:32:00,385
Mom, this is the camera I used
in my art class before.

490
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:01,825
I don't need it anymore.

491
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:04,146
Take it to school tomorrow
and give it to Ke's grandma.

492
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,706
Why, Gu Moli?

493
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,625
You're still in contact with Zhu Jincao.

494
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,706
I understand. It's for Ke's sake.

495
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:13,585
But now you are troubling yourself with
signing Zhang Shanya up for a class?

496
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:15,466
And giving her a camera?
What are you getting at?

497
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,746
Are you planning to go back to being
a good daughter-in-law of their family?

498
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:29,865
You think their divorce was my fault?

499
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:31,506
Mom, stop peeling for a moment.

500
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,466
Take a look at this.

501
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:34,666
What's this?

502
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:36,466
- Since you came,
- CCTV footage at our place.

503
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,426
you've been busy setting rules.

504
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,986
And you drove Moli out.

505
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,906
You only made it worse by doing so.

506
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:44,625
You're talking nonsense.

507
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:49,585
Let me tell you, I'll always be the one
calling the shots in this house.

508
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:54,986
Zhu Dali hit her.

509
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,426
This is domestic violence.
We must call the police.

510
00:32:58,385 --> 00:33:00,305
I hate wife-beaters more than anything.

511
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:02,746
I despise those who
abuse their power to bully the weak.

512
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,946
Exactly. I hate men
who beat their wives, too.

513
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,946
So, now that I'm aware of this,

514
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,146
can I just watch and do nothing?

515
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:12,226
No, you must intervene.

516
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:17,946
But, you're not a part
of their family now.

517
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,305
How do you intervene?

518
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,065
Well, I can't just be a bystander.

519
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,025
Even if I can't talk her
into fighting back,

520
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,906
I'll at least open her eyes.

521
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:28,186
- So I signed her up for that university.
- We're home.

522
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,506
My little girl is the kindest.

523
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,506
Luckily, she got herself out of
that bottomless pit of a family.

524
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,146
Our sweet Ke is home.

525
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,385
Grandma.

526
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,466
Pumpkin, you're home.

527
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,266
What bottomless pit?

528
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,226
A bottomless pit is what it is.

529
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:47,426
So, where were you calling
a bottomless pit?

530
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,785
Grilled mutton skewer.

531
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:53,906
Get off now.

532
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,585
Come on.

533
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:56,226
Don't let grandpa carry you on his back.

534
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:58,706
Have you been good today?

535
00:33:58,825 --> 00:33:59,625
I have.

536
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:03,065
Then, as a reward, Mommy will take you
to Jinshan to see Daddy for Mid-Autumn.

537
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:03,585
Okay?

538
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,506
Okay.

539
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,825
You're not spending the holiday with us?

540
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:10,666
Moli, you're not gonna be at home?

541
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,465
I've made preparation for the occasion.

542
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,945
I'm doing this for Ke's sake.

543
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:18,385
Besides, the moon is rounder
on the 16th than on the 15th.

544
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:20,385
I will be here with you on the next day.

545
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,666
Come on, Ke, let's go wash our hands.

546
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:25,825
There you go.

547
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:28,746
Here, open the door.

548
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:30,146
Ungrateful brat.

549
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:31,985
How am I ungrateful?

550
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,345
I've already planned everything.

551
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:35,026
You know that pork mooncakes
that have gone viral?

552
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,186
I will go queue up and get them
first thing tomorrow morning.

553
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:38,746
Look at me.

554
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:40,746
Do I look convinced?

555
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,266
I mean it. It's a promise.
I will get up early tomorrow morning.

556
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:45,785
As if I'd believe that.

557
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:57,546
(From then on, he never slept in again.)

558
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,865
And never did he return
to Giants Mountain.

559
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:26,746
(OMG. It's so cute.)

560
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:29,066
(Can I get a dozen of such cats?)

561
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:32,226
(I knew this cat. It sat in front of me
during the college entrance exam.)

562
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:35,305
(No way.
I could say it was my deskmate.)

563
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,945
(Gao Xiajing)
(Did you see that?)

564
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,706
Not bad. You catch on fast.

565
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,706
I told you I won't let you down.

566
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:36,865
(The moon hangs in the sky,
its edges faintly lit.)

567
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,345
(Like a mooncake
with a bite taken out of it.)

568
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,904
(Insomniac Gale:
Are you busy right now?)

569
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,626
(Working.)

570
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:11,256
(Insomniac Gale: You work too much.)

571
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:15,128
(What are your plans for Mid-Autumn?
Not working overtime, I hope?)

572
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:19,586
(You guessed it right.
Holidays only mean more work.)

573
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:22,072
(Insomniac Gale: LOL. Me too.)

574
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:26,296
(We both spend the holidays alone.)

575
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:32,066
(Not me. My wife and daughter will
come to Jinshan to keep me company.)

576
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:47,825
Everyone, today,

577
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:51,425
we've learned about the three elements
of portrait photography.

578
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,345
Now, let's move on
to the practical session.

579
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,746
We'll pair up in twos.

580
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:02,825
Take a portrait of each other
that is expressive.

581
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,186
Once again,

582
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,345
remember the big three.

583
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:11,865
Light, angle, and composition.
Are we clear?

584
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:13,305
- Yes.
- Yes.

585
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:15,026
Okay, that's all for today, then.

586
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,865
Hang on. You and I are a team.

587
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:30,066
What for?

588
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:33,746
We have an extra camera at home.
It's second-hand. Hope you won't mind.

589
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,626
I know your family has everything.
I just don't want any.

590
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,026
Suit yourself.

591
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:42,066
But...

592
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:47,345
Wu Yulan, Wu, wait for me, will you?

593
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,586
Why are your hands so dirty?

594
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:54,465
All good.

595
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:58,586
Go ahead and eat.

596
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:06,505
Hello, Ma'am. Hi, Guo.

597
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:10,425
Ke, why hasn't your mom
come to pick you up yet?

598
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,626
No, my grandma hasn't arrived yet.

599
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:15,706
It's okay, come and sit.

600
00:39:16,425 --> 00:39:18,666
How about me and Guo keep you company?

601
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:19,626
Thank you.

602
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:20,825
You're welcome.

603
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:26,026
Guo, what are you eating?

604
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:28,026
Ice cream mooncake.

605
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:33,146
Ke, do you want some?

606
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:36,746
My mom says I shouldn't
eat things offered by strangers.

607
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:40,666
Well, I'm not a stranger.

608
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:44,546
Come on, wipe your hands.

609
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:53,066
You can have one if you want.

610
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:02,146
Come on.

611
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:04,865
Thank you.

612
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:06,305
Don't mention it.

613
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:10,026
Is it good?

614
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:11,186
Yeah.

615
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:17,266
Then have another one.

616
00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:20,026
Thank you, Auntie.

617
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:37,066
Guo.

618
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:40,425
The ice cream mooncake was so yum.

619
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:42,226
My mom made it.

620
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,666
Why don't you watch where you're going?

621
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:47,385
Sorry about that.

622
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:48,066
I'm really sorry.

623
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,146
Auntie, water.

624
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,546
Oh my. I'm so sorry.

625
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:54,505
Ke, are you okay?

626
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:57,666
I'm fine.
I'm just afraid my mom will find out.

627
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:01,106
Auntie.

628
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:04,345
Could you not tell my mom

629
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,106
about me eating the mooncake?

630
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:09,465
Because I'm going to Jinshan
to see my dad today.

631
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:17,226
Don't worry, Ke. I won't tell your mom.

632
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:19,465
Can you promise me something, too?

633
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:23,825
Don't tell your mom
about the water spill, either.

634
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:26,305
Otherwise, I won't be able to
explain it to her.

635
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:27,425
Okay.

636
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:30,785
Ms. Li.

637
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:31,785
Coming.

638
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:33,345
Can I borrow your dryer?

639
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:34,546
The child is all drenched.

640
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:35,066
Come quick.

641
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:35,865
Come on.

642
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:38,465
Grab your bag.

643
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:44,666
Let's go.

644
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:52,146
Ke is the bravest.

645
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,865
When a child has a fever,
it means they're growing taller.

646
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:58,066
Once your fever goes down,
we'll go ride the merry-go-round.

647
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,546
Mom, how is Ke?

648
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:01,666
Not bad.

649
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,905
Mommy.

650
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:06,186
Let me sleep a little longer.

651
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:09,226
Remember to wake me up in a while.

652
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,825
I want to go see Daddy in Jinshan.

653
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:13,905
Okay, Ke, sleep tight.

654
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:16,385
Once you wake up,
we'll go to Jinshan to see Daddy.

655
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,666
Go to sleep, close your eyes.

656
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:21,305
Just took some Tylenol.

657
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,706
What's the matter with the kindergarten?

658
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,586
I was caught in traffic
and arrived a little late.

659
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,226
And they let the kid get wet.

660
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:28,226
What's the use of just apologizing?

661
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,746
It's okay, Mom. Go do your thing.

662
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:31,066
I'll take care of Ke.

663
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:18,186
Hello, Jincao.

664
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,905
Mr. Jiang, have you seen
our splash screen advertisement?

665
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:23,505
Yes, I have. It's impressive.

666
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:27,425
On time and on point, as you requested.
The new product is launched.

667
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:33,186
Look, shifting pressure into energy
has indeed worked miracles.

668
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:36,106
But tonight is critical.

669
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:39,026
You must keep a close watch for me.

670
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:41,865
Keep those numbers growing.

671
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:42,865
