19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,279
(Music and Gym Room)

20
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,279
Come on, please draw a lot.

21
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,678
Queen. You'd play the queen.

22
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,238
Then you'd play the witch.

23
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,678
I don't want to play the witch.

24
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,678
Just give it a try.

25
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:14,199
It's all for the kids.

26
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,439
Why don't you play?

27
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,199
I'm a man, so I can only play the king.

28
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:19,798
Alright, hurry up
and change your clothes.

29
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:21,479
Here you are.

30
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,919
- And yours.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,039
Follow me, come on.

32
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,278
Come on.

33
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:30,439
A long, long time ago,

34
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,599
in a beautiful and distant land,

35
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:36,558
the noble king and the beautiful queen

36
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:39,359
gave birth to a beautiful princess.

37
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,278
So the king and queen

38
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,879
held a grand banquet every year

39
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,118
to celebrate the princess' birthday.

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,039
Welcome you
to our princess' birthday party.

41
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:16,319
Your Majesties,
thank you for your invitation.

42
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,238
I am greatly honored.

43
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,998
Please allow me

44
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,998
to offer the sincerest blessings
to the beautiful princess.

45
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,439
I wish the princess to be healthy,

46
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,159
beautiful and lovely,

47
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,278
and with a kind heart.

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,518
And most importantly, I wish her
to be loved by everyone in the world.

49
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:40,719
At this moment, a sudden chill wind
blows through the palace.

50
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,359
A dark figure flows over.

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,118
It's the witch
who didn't receive the invitation.

52
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,359
The witch has come.

53
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:54,479
How dare you!

54
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,439
How dare you not invite me
to such an important party!

55
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,518
I am the most powerful witch
in the world.

56
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:05,118
You look down on me.

57
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:07,639
Your Majesty, protect our daughter.

58
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,238
You two, separate.

59
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,398
Is that line in the script?

60
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,319
Y-You'd better stick to the script.

61
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,558
Then I shall
give the beautiful princess a gift.

62
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:24,638
I curse you to sleep and never wake up.

63
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:25,599
No!

64
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,959
Princess! Princess!

65
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:28,878
Our princess!

66
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,839
This is what you get
for looking down on me.

67
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,238
Princess! Princess!

68
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,198
Oh, my daughter.

69
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,519
How shall I save you?

70
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:46,878
Your Majesty, what should we do?

71
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,359
My queen.

72
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:51,998
Though my powers cannot
break the witch's curse,

73
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,159
I know

74
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:55,878
she will only wake up
when she finds someone

75
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,758
who truly loves her.

76
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,798
The poor princess has been asleep

77
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,519
for a very long time.

78
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,359
Until one day,

79
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,839
a handsome prince has arrived.

80
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,678
What a pitiful princess!

81
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:18,279
Let me save you.

82
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:25,558
One kiss will do.

83
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,798
Don't go too far.

84
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,318
Ke, wake up.

85
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,079
Wake up, Ke.

86
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,959
Our princess is awake.

87
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,959
Great!

88
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,878
Great, the princess is awake.

89
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,959
Brave prince,

90
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,279
you have saved me and my kingdom.

91
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,079
I sincerely thank you.

92
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,238
You're welcome.

93
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,079
The terrible curse
is lifted by the brave prince.

94
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,998
The princess follows the prince
back to his kingdom

95
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,318
and becomes his bride.

96
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,159
Nice acting.

97
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,638
So is yours.

98
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,638
I thought you would
tell Jincao everything.

99
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:51,399
Don't think too highly of yourself.

100
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,878
You're nothing.

101
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:59,438
Maybe you're just not confident.

102
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,839
To be honest,

103
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,638
even if you tell Zhu Jincao everything,

104
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,318
I wouldn't mind it.

105
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:09,279
Because what I saw are the facts.

106
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:13,079
What are the facts?

107
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,279
The rumors?

108
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,238
Or the slanders?

109
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,438
Don't get too immersed.

110
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,438
Do you really think of yourself
as a queen?

111
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,558
Are you being jealous?

112
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,399
This is fate.

113
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,118
I can draw a lot for a queen.

114
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,758
Let me make myself clear again.

115
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,798
Zhu Jincao and I are single.

116
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:36,959
Even if we are in a relationship,
there is nothing to hide.

117
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,438
I want to pursue him.

118
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,198
I've seen those who are shameless,

119
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,798
but I've never seen anyone
that shameless like you.

120
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,798
Goodbye, Prince.

121
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,318
Goodbye, Princess.

122
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,288
- We are leaving now, bye.
- Bye.

123
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,118
Goodbye, Guo.

124
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,438
Goodbye, Ke. Bye.

125
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,519
Bye.

126
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:12,678
Ke.

127
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,798
Let me tell you.

128
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,359
Keep your distance

129
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,998
when playing with boys in the future.

130
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,279
Never let a boy kiss you here.

131
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,959
Do you understand?

132
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,998
I understand.

133
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:21,638
Mom.

134
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:24,279
Can you come home with us today?

135
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:26,479
Yes.

136
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,678
I won't stay
with grandpa and grandma today.

137
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,238
I'm going home to be with you, okay?

138
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,679
Mom's going home.

139
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,959
The sun rises from the west?

140
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,599
Aren't you afraid of my mom's nagging?

141
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:40,079
I am quite afraid of your mom,

142
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,719
but I'm more afraid of you
running into that old acquaintance.

143
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,839
Ke, be careful.

144
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,439
There's also a stew.

145
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,479
We didn't know you are coming back,

146
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,679
so we didn't prepare much.

147
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,398
You just make do.

148
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:08,799
Mom.

149
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,398
Grandma says you don't like stew,

150
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,719
so she specially made fried prawns,

151
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,839
stir-fried loofah,

152
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,278
and steamed yam for you.

153
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:19,359
You know much.

154
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:21,719
Thank you, Ke's Grandma.

155
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,038
It's okay.

156
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,839
Our Ke loves my stew the most.

157
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:27,918
Okay.

158
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,559
Who is it?

159
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,479
It's me.

160
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,199
Your dad.

161
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,238
How come you're here?

162
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,359
Grandpa.

163
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,679
Ke.

164
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,839
Do you miss me?

165
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,679
Yes.

166
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,918
I bet you forgot about me.

167
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:54,679
No.

168
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,878
Grandpa, you haven't come
to see me for so long.

169
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,679
Then why don't you give me a kiss?

170
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,038
Alright. Ke, come down now.

171
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:02,679
Go wash your hands and have dinner.

172
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,038
No rush.

173
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,278
Zhang Shanya.

174
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,998
How dare you

175
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,719
keep such a big deal from me.

176
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,118
I heard from that crazy sister of yours

177
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,038
that my son is divorced.

178
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:30,518
Mom.

179
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:33,439
You and Dad got divorced?

180
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,679
Come here.

181
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,439
Ke, listen to me.

182
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,638
There are things
you don't understand yet.

183
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,398
I will explain it to you later, okay?

184
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:03,839
Ke's Grandpa.

185
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,839
The two of them

186
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,518
have some disagreements.

187
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,758
A-And they just got
the divorce certificate.

188
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,559
I thought they have room

189
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,038
to be together again,

190
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:17,398
so I didn't tell you.

191
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:21,038
You did it wrong. No excuse.

192
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,238
Dad, this is my business.

193
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,359
I can handle it well.

194
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,118
I haven't dealt with you,

195
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:27,719
but you jump out first.

196
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,359
When you got married, you came to me

197
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,719
to flatter me,

198
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,079
asking me to give you money

199
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,319
and make arrangements.

200
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,038
Now you've grown bold.

201
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,918
Ask her out to explain clearly.

202
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:42,439
Be good, Ke.

203
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,758
Now that you're divorced,

204
00:11:57,638 --> 00:12:00,479
let's abide by the national laws.

205
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,278
All three of you, listen.

206
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,559
Gu Moli.

207
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,998
First, starting from today,

208
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:11,238
you can't get in my house.

209
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,199
You have no right to get in here.

210
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:15,599
Why do you speak so harshly?

211
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,319
She is Ke's mom, after all.

212
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,518
Second,

213
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,479
the divorce scandal
is all over the place.

214
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,118
Don't slander me.

215
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,839
Jincao knows about my business.

216
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,878
Besides, I am Ke's mom.

217
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:30,158
I gave birth to her.

218
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:31,359
Let alone you,

219
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,839
even Jincao has no right
to keep me from seeing Ke.

220
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,839
Get out.

221
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,998
Mom, please don't go.

222
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,559
Mom.

223
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,959
Grandpa, I don't want mom to leave.

224
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,398
Grandpa, please.

225
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:54,439
Grandpa, I don't want mom to leave.

226
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,758
Grandpa.

227
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,518
You'd go take care of Ke.

228
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:48,038
You can let her go now.

229
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:03,479
Gu Moli.

230
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:09,839
Today is the last time
I allow you to get in my house.

231
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,079
Don't come again.

232
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,518
I'll say it again.

233
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,638
She is Ke's mom.

234
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:15,599
You can't drive her away.

235
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,599
Nor can I.

236
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,959
She's paying off the loan with me.

237
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,398
She still owns part of the house.

238
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,878
If she needs to take that money,

239
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:22,398
I'll give her the money right now.

240
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:25,238
No need, I don't want that money.

241
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,559
I'm leaving.

242
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:29,998
Moli.

243
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,559
Stop right there.

244
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,518
You've gone too far!

245
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:40,199
Jincao.

246
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,359
What are you doing?

247
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:42,959
The kid is here.

248
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,398
Don't scare Ke.

249
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,878
How dare they!

250
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:54,959
I'll go to them tomorrow.

251
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:57,839
I am still here.
How dare they bully my daughter!

252
00:14:57,878 --> 00:14:59,679
I can't believe it!

253
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,599
What kind of people are in this family?

254
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,998
What kind of people are they?

255
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,998
Mom, don't add fuel to the fire.

256
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,398
I don't want to hurt Ke.

257
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,359
Jincao will talk to his dad about this.

258
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,679
I'm sure he'll be on my side

259
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,199
and solve this.

260
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,158
Moli.

261
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,679
I support your mom this time.

262
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,679
The Zhu family is so arrogant.

263
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,719
They can't distinguish right from wrong.

264
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,359
They've gone too far.

265
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,238
I thought

266
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:33,398
if they can take good care of Ke,

267
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,559
I'll let the rest of it go.

268
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,918
But now it seems,

269
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,878
if Ke grows up in that family,

270
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,998
the consequences are unthinkable.

271
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,359
Gu Demao, don't just talk the talk.

272
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,359
Don't you know many people?

273
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,238
Get a lawyer right away

274
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,918
and get Ke back.

275
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,839
Don't worry, I will call right away.

276
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,038
Don't worry.

277
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,679
How can I not be worried?

278
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:56,878
Dad, Mom.

279
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:00,079
I'm really tired today.

280
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,319
I'll go to rest.

281
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,878
Wait, I...

282
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,680
(Nanpu Bridge)

283
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,758
Susan.

284
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,638
Mr. Zhu.

285
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,359
About the three-year medical insurance
for the families of senior executives,

286
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:32,199
your wife's information
was not approved.

287
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:33,278
What happened?

288
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,679
How is that possible?

289
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,998
I filled out her information myself.

290
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,518
I know her ID number by heart.

291
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:39,799
It's impossible.

292
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,559
Are you sure?

293
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,559
I'm sure.

294
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,799
The information is correct,
but the spouse didn't pass.

295
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,638
There's only one reason for that.

296
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,758
Did you two get divorced?

297
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,278
Yes.

298
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:53,839
Sorry.

299
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,439
It's okay.

300
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,319
Susan.

301
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:58,439
Please

302
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,679
keep my divorce a secret.

303
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:03,118
Okay.

304
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,478
Line up.

305
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,478
Come on, stand in line.

306
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,478
Miss Sun, Class One is ready.

307
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:16,519
Yulan.

308
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,478
Yulan.

309
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:21,398
I think it's inappropriate for us
to pick up Ke this way.

310
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,039
What's inappropriate?

311
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,718
Special circumstances
require special measures.

312
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,799
Besides, the Zhu family
are not reasonable people.

313
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,839
When we meet someone like them,

314
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:33,158
we have to use some tactics.

315
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,039
Ke.

316
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,638
Ke.

317
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,198
Grandpa, Grandma.

318
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:40,999
How come you're here?

319
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,678
I-I miss you.

320
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,158
I will take you
to eat something delicious

321
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,239
- and buy you pretty clothes, okay?
- Okay.

322
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,718
- Okay.
- Let's go. Let's go!

323
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,279
Are you happy?

324
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,799
Happy.

325
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,438
Happy?

326
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,958
I know you have a little secret.

327
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,239
- You know, right?
- I know it too.

328
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,999
Your favorite food is...

329
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,878
What are you doing?

330
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,759
Today is our turn to pick up Ke.
Why are you here?

331
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,478
Exactly.

332
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:05,239
- Why can't we pick her up?
- Exactly.

333
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,638
You're not picking her up,

334
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,519
but snatching her.

335
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,158
What do you mean?

336
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,559
Her last name is Zhu.
She's one of our Zhu family.

337
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,878
You're not taking her today.

338
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:14,918
Yes. Ke, come to me.

339
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:15,958
- I can't believe it.
- Come.

340
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,039
I'm telling you. I'm her grandma.

341
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,319
It's only right that I pick her up.

342
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,999
Her last name is Zhu?

343
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,158
I'll change her last name to Gu
once I take her home.

344
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:23,999
How dare you!

345
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:24,799
What do you mean?

346
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,999
If you take her, I won't let you go.

347
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:26,958
- So what?
- Alright.

348
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,638
If you take her...

349
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:28,279
Don't scare Ke.

350
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:28,799
Don't force me.

351
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,398
Want to hit me?

352
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,158
- Let go.
- What?

353
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:30,759
Want to hit us?

354
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,079
Zhu Dali.

355
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:33,999
We are on the street.

356
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,359
Can you calm down?

357
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,438
We are all elderly people.

358
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,319
We can be shameless,

359
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,478
but Jincao and Moli need to save face.

360
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,638
So does Ke.

361
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,638
We're the grandparents.

362
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,638
Legally speaking,

363
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,799
we can see the child at any time, right?

364
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,438
But you should at least inform us,

365
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:50,678
no?

366
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:51,839
Let me tell you.

367
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,039
You're not going to win in court.

368
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,638
What did you say?

369
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,478
Why would we go to court?

370
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:57,718
Snatching a child in public.

371
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:00,319
H-How did you
raise your daughter yourself?

372
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,878
If Ke is raised by you,
then she'd be ruined.

373
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,438
Like father, like daughter.

374
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:04,398
What?

375
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,839
What do you mean?

376
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,039
You know well yourself.

377
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,958
What do you mean, Zhu Dali?

378
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,599
Go away.

379
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,039
- Stop fighting.
- What are you saying?

380
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:10,718
Come here.

381
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:11,599
Move.

382
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,279
I don't want to argue with you.

383
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,478
You're being so unreasonable.

384
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,279
Alright.

385
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,198
Make yourself clear.

386
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:17,999
Yulan, stop.

387
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:18,599
We're not done.

388
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,198
Let's just stop.

389
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:19,878
What?

390
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:21,279
Don't cast pearls before swine.

391
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,319
Cast pearls before swine.

392
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,718
What?

393
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:26,039
You're a swine.

394
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,599
Zhu Dali.

395
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,359
- Alright.
- Don't stop me.

396
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,438
Stop fighting.

397
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:30,519
We'll see in court.

398
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,478
Sure.

399
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,158
Alright, let's take Ke and go.

400
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:33,799
- Let's go.
- Go.

401
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,319
Ke?

402
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,478
Ke?

403
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,398
(Moli, how come you're here?)

404
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:56,438
Jiang Haitao, I came
to see you today on business.

405
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:57,799
Then take a seat.

406
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,398
No need.

407
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,359
Just a couple of words,
and then I'll leave.

408
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,118
Thank you for the public account.

409
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,678
I asked about your firm's rates.

410
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:05,958
Here's the lawyer's fee.

411
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,398
Moli, we're old acquaintances.

412
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,398
Don't be that polite.

413
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,958
Mr. Yan is a contracted painter
for our gallery.

414
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,519
Although he is your friend,

415
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:15,958
this is business.

416
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,878
If it makes you feel better...

417
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:25,368
(Mom)

418
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,359
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

419
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:29,918
Mom.

420
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,039
Ke is missing?

421
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:37,918
Mom, what's the matter?

422
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,239
Miss, please help me.

423
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,759
Don't go inside there.

424
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,878
She's not there.

425
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:48,999
They sell snacks.

426
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,279
I didn't expect my parents
would go pick up Ke.

427
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:57,039
Where can we go look for her now?

428
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,158
Don't worry.

429
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,438
Near the kindergarten.

430
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,398
Go search all the places Ke has been to.

431
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:04,519
Go to Little Sun Kindergarten.

432
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,079
Okay.

433
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,559
There's a crowd over there.

434
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,279
Ke.

435
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,279
If the child is lost, I'll fight them.

436
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,799
What's wrong?

437
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,759
I'm okay.

438
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,559
You take it easy.

439
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,839
Y-You'd take it easy.

440
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,398
I'm okay.

441
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,559
Ke.

442
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,398
It's all your fault.

443
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,279
What?

444
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,438
You argued with them,

445
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,359
and now the child is gone.

446
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,878
Guo.

447
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,519
How did it feel
when your parents got divorced?

448
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,878
Feels like not having a dad.

449
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,118
It just feels like not having a dad.

450
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:49,599
But I don't like my dad.

451
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,918
But I like my dad.

452
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,839
And I like my mom too.

453
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,438
What should I do?

454
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:57,799
I don't know.

455
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:02,118
I just know I can only choose one.

456
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,478
I don't want to choose at all.

457
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,118
Ke!

458
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:22,958
Ke!

459
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,478
Ke!

460
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,918
Ke!

461
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:44,718
Ke.

462
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,519
Ke.

463
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,519
Ke.

464
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,158
What's wrong? Let me take a look.

465
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,438
Ke.

466
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,759
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

467
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,079
Don't help her up.

468
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,958
Get up slowly. Take it easy.

469
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,319
Where are you hurt?

470
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,398
Tell me where it hurts, Ke.

471
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,039
I will take off your backpack.

472
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,678
Take it easy.

473
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:03,239
Take it easy.

474
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,839
I'm fine. Off you go.

475
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,158
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

476
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:08,638
Come on, let me see.

477
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:09,799
Let me check the arm.

478
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,079
Jiang Haitao, are you alright?

479
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,799
I'm okay. Not a big deal.

480
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,079
How is Ke doing?

481
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,359
Don't worry.

482
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,398
Don't worry.

483
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,678
Take a look.

484
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,678
Does it hurt? Tell me if it hurts.

485
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:24,999
- It hurts.
- It hurts?

486
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:27,718
Gao Xiajing, how come Ke is here?

487
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,958
Did you pick her up
from the kindergarten?

488
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,799
No.

489
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,039
When I went home,

490
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,599
I saw Ke walking alone on the street.

491
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,279
I found it strange,

492
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,438
so I asked her.

493
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,678
She said
she wanted to go home by herself,

494
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,678
so I just picked her up on the way.

495
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,438
Ke, tell me

496
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,279
if what she said is true.

497
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:47,438
Yes.

498
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:50,398
Ke said she wanted
to wait for dad downstairs,

499
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,158
so I let Guo play with her for a while

500
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,958
and went upstairs to get some food.

501
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:57,198
And all this happened
in such a short time.

502
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,839
I am really sorry.

503
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:01,039
No, it's not your fault.

504
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,559
I should thank you.

505
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,718
My wife was too anxious,

506
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:04,958
so she was a bit...

507
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,319
Don't take it personally.

508
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,279
It's okay. I can understand.

509
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,198
Guo, let's go home.

510
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,839
Goodbye, Ke.

511
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,839
Are you alright?

512
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,198
Ke, let me see.

513
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:28,878
Don't cry.

514
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,158
Moli.

515
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,799
I might have been a bit rough just now,

516
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,079
Ke took a hard fall.

517
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:39,239
You should take her
to the hospital to get checked.

518
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,158
Okay.

519
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:44,478
Jiang Haitao, is your hand okay?

520
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,118
I'm okay.

521
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,158
I'm leaving then.

522
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,718
Thank you.

523
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:34,198
Baby, eat something.

524
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,638
Ke, here.

525
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,319
Are you tired from running?

526
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,599
Have some water. Open your mouth.

527
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,678
Gu Demao.

528
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,599
I'm not done with you.

529
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,559
Alright, enough.

530
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,198
Let me tell you,
we found the child today.

531
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:00,759
If we hadn't found her,
I wouldn't let you go.

532
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,279
Enough. Can't you stop?

533
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,198
It's the hospital.

534
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,559
Ke, does it still hurt?

535
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,438
Come to me.

536
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:15,519
Stop.

537
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,718
Is it better?

538
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,279
Mom, I'm sorry.

539
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,158
I didn't do it on purpose.

540
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:38,958
I didn't want
to hear my grandparents fighting,

541
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,398
so I went back by myself.

542
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:42,878
You don't need to say sorry.

543
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:44,279
It's all my fault.

544
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,198
How is it?

545
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,839
The doctor said she's fine.

546
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,438
Ke just got scared.

547
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,118
Some rest will do.

548
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:57,918
Did you really get divorced?

549
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:07,279
If you get divorced,
will you still love me?

550
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,478
Ke.

551
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,599
You're still too young

552
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,239
to know such things.

553
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,039
When you're older,

554
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,638
we will explain it to you, okay?

555
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:25,799
Did you get divorced because of me?

556
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,519
It's my fault, Ke.

557
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,438
Remember.

558
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:33,079
No matter what happens,

559
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,039
Mom and Dad will always love you, okay?

560
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,878
Come here, Ke.

561
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:40,958
Come to me.

562
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,118
(Zhu Dali has arrived.)

563
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:58,638
(The unexpected things
follow one after another.)

564
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,799
(Ke knows about the divorce.)

565
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,519
(Then Ke got lost)

566
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,839
(and saved by Jiang Haitao.)

567
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,158
(For the first time I realized)

568
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:09,158
(divorce might be a wrong choice.)

569
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,438
All the children form a circle,

570
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:27,438
dancing happily in the spring breeze.

571
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,279
Especially Qiqi.

572
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,118
Her white cotton dress
flutters and shimmers,

573
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:39,279
becoming the most beautiful scene
of the spring.

574
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:40,878
Mom.

575
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,438
Can I send a WeChat message to Ke?

576
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,678
I am so worried about her.

577
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,239
Guo, don't worry.

578
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,438
Ke has her dad and mom with her.

579
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,198
Let's not disturb her today, okay?

580
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,718
But she cried so hard today.

581
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,759
Come on, speak.

582
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,398
Ke, how are you?

583
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,958
Mom and I are very worried about you.

584
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,878
Alright, lie down.

585
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,599
(Ke's Dad)
(Ke is fine.)

586
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:40,118
(Thanks for Guo
and Guo's mom's concern.)

587
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,878
(I'm really sorry about today.)

588
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:47,678
See. Ke's dad has replied.

589
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,559
He said Ke is fine. Don't worry.

590
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:52,478
Alright.

591
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,478
It's nothing.

592
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,319
How are you guys doing now?

593
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:00,799
Are you home?

594
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,678
Mr. Jiang, you want me?

595
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:25,319
Sit.

596
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,478
You haven't been doing well lately.

597
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,718
I'm okay.

598
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,158
What about going to Jinshan?

599
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,918
I think Jinshan is too far from home.

600
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:51,839
I knew it.

601
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,198
But someone has to take the lead.

602
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,559
It's an opportunity.

603
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,158
If you achieve something,

604
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,958
you can be transferred back
and promoted in several years.

605
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,158
Although conditions there are tough,

606
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,878
you can get an extra subsidy
of 8,000 a month.

607
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,279
I'm thinking of your best interest.

608
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:19,478
If you don't get promoted at your age,

609
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:23,958
you'll have to make way
for the younger ones.

610
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,999
The company is assigning you
to work in Jinshan,

611
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,359
and you can only come home once a week?

612
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,239
Well...

613
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,198
This is so sudden.

614
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,079
Son, can you not go?

615
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,958
If you go, it's just me and your dad.

616
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:45,239
Mom, that's just
how our industry is now.

617
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:47,718
We have to do it this way.

618
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,158
I'm already in my thirties.

619
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,799
If I can't get promoted,

620
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,198
and don't fight for more,

621
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:57,478
the newcomers will take my place

622
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,438
and I don't stand any chance at all.

623
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:00,599
That's the fact.

624
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:02,158
So what should I do?

625
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,519
What do you mean?

626
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:07,438
Jincao, I support you.

627
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:09,958
Don't listen to your mom.

628
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,878
Your mom is busy
in the kitchen all day long.

629
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,918
She doesn't know anything.

630
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:20,519
Many Internet executives
are being laid off.

631
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,759
You are right about that.

632
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,039
Besides,

633
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:32,478
now this divorce isn't such a bad thing.

634
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:35,438
First of all,
there's no one holding you back.

635
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,958
Let your mom take care of Ke.

636
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,519
You just go to Jinshan

637
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,198
and fight for your career.

638
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,559
A man is nothing without a career.

639
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,279
A good man can succeed everywhere.

640
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,638
So I thought,

641
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:56,279
when I go to Jinshan,

642
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,559
I couldn't take care of the family,

643
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,478
leaving my mother alone
in Shanghai with Ke.

644
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,559
Maybe...

645
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,279
I get it.

646
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:12,239
He's an ungrateful soul.

647
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:14,599
I got him the house.

648
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,839
Now he wants to drive me away, right?

649
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,359
Come on.

650
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,359
He's doing it for you and the family.

651
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,039
The cost of living
is so high in Shanghai.

652
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:26,599
It'd save more money with you gone.

653
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,239
Like mother, like son.

654
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:35,638
Wang Lingxiao?

655
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,599
I asked you to come here today
because I wanted to know

656
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,958
what kind of person Wang Lingxiao is.

657
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:42,958
Let me tell you.

658
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,398
This cousin of Jincao's
is truly a wacko.

659
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,438
He claims to be a celibatarian.

660
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:49,438
That is, no marriage, no buying houses,

661
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,039
no kids, and no savings.

662
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:52,599
Sounds like

663
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,638
he wants to live in the moment.

664
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,918
But in reality,
he is a financial analyst,

665
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,799
earning much more than Jincao.

666
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,039
What?

667
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,398
It must be the case of extremes meeting.

668
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,158
His parents sold the house

669
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:05,839
when he went study abroad.

670
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,038
After he finished his studies
and returned home,

671
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:11,199
his parents urged him to get married,
buy a house, and have children.

672
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,518
He sent money home because he's afraid

673
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,918
his parents weren't doing well.

674
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:16,279
And his mom didn't spend the money.

675
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,639
His family
had several arguments about it.

676
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,478
So Wang Lingxiao just let things slide,

677
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:23,038
saying he wouldn't get married,
have children, or buy a house.

678
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:24,518
He lives in the moment.

679
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,518
What's more?

680
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:26,558
Hold on.

681
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:29,199
Do you like Wang Lingxiao?

682
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
Is that okay?

683
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,598
Are you alright? Didn't you hear me?

684
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:34,319
He's a celibatarian.

685
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,759
What are you thinking?

686
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,319
I want to give it a try.

687
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:40,199
You want to challenge yourself?

688
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,038
Does he like women?

689
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:44,319
What? He likes women.

690
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,038
But for all these years,

691
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:48,279
he has never had a girlfriend.

692
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:49,998
It's hard to believe.

693
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,398
Did he tell you he's never had one?

694
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:52,598
No.

695
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,839
I heard from Jincao that he had one.

696
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,759
When he took the girl
back to his hometown,

697
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:00,359
standing in front of his old house,

698
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,119
the girl cursed outright.

699
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,119
She didn't even
go inside and just went back.

700
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,279
So he wasn't clear with this girl

701
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:07,998
about his family?

702
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:09,159
He did.

703
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,078
But she didn't believe it.

704
00:35:10,078 --> 00:35:11,639
She believed
he was born with a silver spoon

705
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,558
and was testing her.

706
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,319
I see.

707
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,239
Once bitten, twice shy.

708
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:21,839
He was scared off by a bad girl.

709
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:24,159
Hello, honey.

710
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,159
Okay, I'll be right there.

711
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,799
I'm leaving.

712
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:30,759
Where are you going?

713
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,438
Jincao wants me.

714
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,598
Hold on.

715
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,398
I haven't finished.

716
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:36,998
Once your ex calls, you run.

717
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,119
It is really urgent.

718
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,398
I have to warn you.

719
00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:45,159
Be careful of Wang Lingxiao.

720
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,319
Gu Moli.

721
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,239
Putting love before friendship.

722
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,719
We already have to be sneaking around

723
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,438
when we meet.

724
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,159
You're about to leave,
and it's so far away.

725
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:10,038
I don't agree with you going to Jinshan.

726
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,598
Can't you let someone else go?

727
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,359
I've been thinking
about this very clearly.

728
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,558
To get our family on its own fast

729
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,438
and live comfortably,

730
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,119
we must buy our own house
as soon as possible.

731
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:27,438
Buying a house without asking for help.

732
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,518
We can only make money,

733
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,239
more money.

734
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,119
Although Jinshan is far away,

735
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,359
I can get extra 8,000 a month
in salary and benefits.

736
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:40,639
That's a lot of money.

737
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,239
Most importantly,

738
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:45,279
if I work hard in Jinshan,

739
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,119
I would get promoted faster.

740
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,719
When I transfer back to headquarters
once I get promoted,

741
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:52,839
I'll get a big raise.

742
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,598
Even though Jinshan
is a bit far from you,

743
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,558
it brings us closer to our goal.

744
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:04,078
I've got it all figured out.

745
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,078
When I get a bigger house

746
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,679
the first thing I'll do is remarry you.

747
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:12,958
What about these few years?

748
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:13,958
I can just wait for you?

749
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:15,839
What do you mean?

750
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,199
You know,

751
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,799
we can be flexible.

752
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,639
Whenever I find the time,

753
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,119
I will come back to see you.

754
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,799
If you miss me,

755
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:31,359
you can come to Jinshan.

756
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,998
It's so far away.

757
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,199
With none of our parents around,

758
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,878
we can just be carefree

759
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,839
and do whatever we want.

760
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,078
The most important thing is
we won't need to book a room.

761
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,398
Think of it from a positive side.

762
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,239
It's not that bad.

763
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,918
And it saves money.

764
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,279
What a silly excuse.

765
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,398
Alright, I agree.

766
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,239
I've been really stressed out lately.

767
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,958
I need to grab some sleep.

768
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:09,199
There's still an hour and a half left.

769
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:10,679
Hurry up and rest.

770
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,319
(Did she just have dinner here
with a man?)

771
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:34,119
(Yes, they just left.)

772
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:37,199
By the way, that lady
left something in the room.

773
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,998
I wonder
if you need to take it back to her.

774
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:42,078
Room? Which room?

775
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,598
The one you used to stay in.

776
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:45,679
(1010.)

777
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,839
(Your daughter damaged
an expensive painting in our gallery.)

778
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,998
(And yet, Gu Moli managed to sell it.)

779
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,799
(Wait. Who's the one you mentioned?)

780
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,279
(Jiang Haitao.)

781
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,679
Two people who love each other
must keep pace.

782
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:52,239
Keep pace and keep harmonious.

783
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,119
It sounds simple,

784
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:55,438
but it's actually difficult.

785
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,719
Work, life, location, and object

786
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,159
can cause gap between two people.

787
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,878
Eventually, the physical gap
becomes the psychological gap.

788
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:09,038
When two people experience
a psychological gap,

789
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:11,878
they feel they're not getting paid
for their efforts,

790
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:15,918
and love gradually fades.

791
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:17,839
Love is not like flying a kite.

792
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:20,839
Once you fly one, you need
to worry about the weather.

793
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,719
Who says distance isn't a problem?

794
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,719
Distance is a problem.

795
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,860
(The Gap Between Two People)

796
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,078
Wipe your eyes. Don't bite.

797
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:43,279
Don't bite. I am just wiping your eyes.

798
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,719
Wipe your eyes.

799
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,478
Clean them.

800
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:51,199
What are you doing in the morning?

801
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,438
Okay, stop. I'm done.

802
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:55,918
Where did you get this cat?

803
00:40:57,478 --> 00:40:59,279
Look, is it cute?

804
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,799
I picked it up in the community.

805
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:05,639
Ke said she wants a pet.

806
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,359
So I picked up a cat for Ke.

807
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:12,119
You'd get whatever Ke wants?

808
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:13,799
A stray cat?

809
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,878
Does it have any bacteria?

810
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:17,759
She might get an infectious disease
from a scratch.

811
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:20,038
What are you thinking?

812
00:41:20,038 --> 00:41:22,078
Look, I've bathed it.

813
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:24,199
Besides,
I'll take it for vaccination today.

814
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,958
The neighbor even gave me a cage.

815
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:27,759
No need. Don't bother.

816
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:29,639
Just take it back to where you found it.

817
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,359
To where?

818
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,119
It's a stray cat.

819
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,438
It would starve to death

820
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:35,359
if we don't keep it.

821
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,759
What if it has any diseases

822
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:37,878
since it's a stray cat?

823
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:39,239
Just send it away.

824
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,359
We are going to get vaccinated...

825
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:41,359
- Alright.
- Get vaccinated...

826
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,878
Mom. Hold the cat.

827
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:43,958
I'll take a picture of it.

828
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:46,998
Come on, look this way.

829
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:50,639
Pretty good.

830
00:41:51,438 --> 00:41:53,679
Mom, we're not keeping this cat.

831
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,078
I'll put it in the cage.

832
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:09,078
Wait.

833
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,518
Son, where are you taking it?

834
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:15,558
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

835
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,438
You can't let Ke touch it.

836
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,078
You are really something.

837
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:29,119
You don't even allow me
to keep a cat for Ke.

838
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,398
If you don't allow me to keep a cat,

839
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:33,038
I'll pick up a dog next time.

840
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,878
It's a small place.

841
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,839
Keeping cats and dogs.

842
00:42:41,598 --> 00:42:43,359
You might as well keep a cow.
