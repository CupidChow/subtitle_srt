19
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,968
It's not like you were here
for the first time.

20
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,195
Take a seat. Have some fruit.

21
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,076
Water or any drink?

22
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,115
Wine.

23
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,115
You drink wine in the day?

24
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,356
I'll just have a little drink.

25
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,275
Fine.

26
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:21,272
Installment payment. Here's
the first installment, 0.8 thousand.

27
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:24,516
Check it.

28
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,796
If you can't pay it back,
then just don't.

29
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,356
And I didn't expect you to.

30
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,916
If you really want to pay me back,
you would have transferred it to me.

31
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,512
Paying in cash feels more ceremonial.

32
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,592
As a man, I must repay what I owe.

33
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:47,196
From today on I will be a reliable man.

34
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:48,636
I won't borrow money from you.

35
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:52,916
Alright. You've set this goal
many times before.

36
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,875
Let's see how long
you can last this time.

37
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,928
This time it's different.

38
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,680
I've formed a team with someone I love

39
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,144
to strive for a common goal.

40
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,035
You're in love?

41
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:14,232
Not yet, but let me be clear.

42
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:19,608
The person I love is Shen Liuliu.

43
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:21,835
What?

44
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,236
Stop putting on a show.

45
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,016
I came to see you
and brought a pig's trotter.

46
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,236
I knew there was someone in your house,

47
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,516
but you didn't open the door.

48
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,040
I know something's wrong.

49
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:36,796
So I lurked outside your door

50
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:39,595
to see who was the reason
you didn't open the door.

51
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,956
I never expected

52
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:50,476
I was lied to by the two people
I trust and love the most.

53
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:01,956
Qianniu. That day, I just didn't
want you to misunderstand.

54
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:04,076
Lingxiao, don't worry.

55
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,555
We play fair.

56
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,916
You might not beat me.

57
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:14,275
People like you who don't take initiative,
don't make commitments, don't refuse,

58
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,352
don't marry or have children,

59
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,944
are typical scumbags in the TV dramas.

60
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,216
But me, Huang Qianniu,

61
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:23,320
who longs for a warm family life,

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,084
likes cute children,

63
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,144
without hesitation,
I am a warm and sweet man,

64
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,856
definitely the top choice
for a good husband.

65
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:40,516
I'm ready
to start fighting alongside Liuliu.

66
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,795
I'll work hard starting from today.

67
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,688
I can definitely surpass you in career.

68
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,035
I have advantages that you don't.

69
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:53,595
I can soon have the advantages you have.

70
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,436
Qianniu, you have ambition,
which is good,

71
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,756
but please don't influence Liuliu, okay?

72
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,876
Don't hold her back in her work.

73
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,516
I want to help her.

74
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:07,116
The company puts a lot of pressure
on Liuliu because of the forum issue.

75
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,632
Just tell me
if you're going to be the guest.

76
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,904
Okay. I don't care.

77
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:15,800
My job now is
to find someone to replace you.

78
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,275
There's only one Aventador parked there.

79
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,168
If you find it, you can find him.

80
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:25,196
Aventador?

81
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:30,155
What a flashy car!
Anyone can notice it immediately.

82
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,396
You need to have a good talk
with Mr. Zhou.

83
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,996
This is a good opportunity for you.

84
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:36,835
I will, thanks.

85
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,196
Miss Moli, what's wrong?

86
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,675
I told you to wait for my news, right?

87
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,556
No need. I know you won't choose me.

88
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,656
I'm waiting here
to tell you something else.

89
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:25,956
Go ahead.

90
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,656
That Big Ai is very likely a swindler.

91
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:33,316
He promises you anything

92
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,408
and flatters you, and then takes
your deposit and money for the painting.

93
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:40,056
In the end,
you might probably get nothing.

94
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm serious.
There's a lot of them in our circle.

95
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,675
You should be alert.

96
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,528
I understand you want to make the deal.

97
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:52,556
But you don't have
to badmouth others like that.

98
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:53,624
I didn't mean that.

99
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:56,275
I'm just giving you a heads up.

100
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,568
Thanks for that.
I understand, but I'm not a fool.

101
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,076
Do you want a ride?

102
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,116
No, thank you.

103
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:27,516
The person Jiang Haitao introduced
is indeed unreliable.

104
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:48,152
Ke's Grandpa. There's a new supermarket
on Fule Road, making big discounts.

105
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:52,516
For the first two hours,
eggs are one yuan per tray.

106
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:53,795
I'll go have a look.

107
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:55,992
Ke likes eggs.

108
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,556
Well, I'll go with you,
so we can grab more.

109
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:00,835
No, no need. I'll go by myself.

110
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:03,076
It's a long way. I'll be back later.

111
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:17,720
Why do you dress up
just to grab some eggs?

112
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,116
Hi.

113
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,236
What are you doing here?

114
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:35,704
I was going to tell you on WeChat.

115
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,035
But you've already deleted me.

116
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,216
I'm here to recommend myself.

117
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:42,136
Do you still need guests for that forum?

118
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,736
Actually, you don't have to do this.
Just keep it business.

119
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:50,836
You don't owe me anything.

120
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:55,000
You're just making me
feel even more awkward.

121
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,675
I-I didn't mean anything.

122
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,636
I did find it
very comfortable and interesting

123
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:05,208
to communicate with the audience
after I went to the forum last time.

124
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,396
It was also a form of growth for me.

125
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,155
I didn't mean to help you.

126
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,356
You know me. No one can force me
to do anything I don't want to.

127
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,195
I know.

128
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:18,315
That means you agree?

129
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,275
Well, tell me

130
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,356
the content of the forum
and the schedule,

131
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,716
so I can make a preparation in advance.

132
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:32,248
Okay. Le will organize the materials
and email them to you.

133
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:34,756
Thank you.

134
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:59,928
A black swan event is something
very unpredictable and unusual.

135
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,728
When a black swan event occurs,
it can cause a chain reaction

136
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,064
with huge negative effects.

137
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:12,344
It is characterized by occasional bursts
and extreme destructiveness.

138
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:18,168
But there must be a reason.

139
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:22,328
A person without foresight
must have immediate worries.

140
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:26,200
So each of us must be prepared

141
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:31,576
for the sudden arrival
of a black swan event.

142
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,376
(The Arrival of the Black Swan Event)

143
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,356
(Discerning Small Signs)
Discerning small signs.

144
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,075
Right.

145
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,915
It's quite formal.

146
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:53,435
Yulan, where is your work?

147
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:54,836
It might be inside.

148
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:56,504
Wu.

149
00:10:57,148 --> 00:11:00,824
Your husband is so elegant,
and your daughter is pretty.

150
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:01,624
Thank you.

151
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:05,035
Chen, you're really something.
I'm flattered.

152
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:06,936
I'm just telling the truth.
You go ahead inside.

153
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,435
Okay, okay.

154
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,275
Is it over there?

155
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,915
Look. No, it's not there.

156
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,155
Grandma!

157
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:13,876
My sweetie.

158
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:14,555
Did you take this?

159
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,212
Your granddaughter?

160
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:16,675
Yes, my granddaughter.

161
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,636
She's so pretty.

162
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,596
- So pretty.
- Say hello.

163
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,075
Hello.

164
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:20,636
Hello.

165
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:21,756
We'll be going then.

166
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,636
Look. This was taken by me.

167
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:29,275
Fish market, full of fish.
Look over here, there's more.

168
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,516
Shanya, this is your granddaughter?

169
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:34,275
Say hello.

170
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,876
Hello.

171
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:36,836
So cute.

172
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:41,356
I'm telling you,
your grandma gets No.1 here.

173
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:45,236
The teacher also said
her work is like that of Cezanne.

174
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,915
Thank you.

175
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,596
Who is Cezanne?

176
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:54,915
C-Cezanne is a great painter
from France.

177
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:55,996
That great?

178
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:57,795
Yes, that great.

179
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:01,624
Showing off. Look how proud she is.

180
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:05,356
Enjoy all beauties.

181
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,915
You are my little kitty.

182
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:07,636
Mine?

183
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:10,876
This one. I think it shows something.

184
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,555
Here, it's good that you make it.

185
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,435
I knew Ke's Grandpa wouldn't come.

186
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,756
Fortunately, you have a conscience.

187
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:18,356
Where's my mom?

188
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:19,356
Over there.

189
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,752
I'm telling you,
Ke's Grandma won first place.

190
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,876
Her work is hanging right in the middle.

191
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,516
Dad, Mom.

192
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:26,904
Mom, I'm here.

193
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:28,728
My son has come.

194
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,116
Come on. Over here.
This one was taken by me.

195
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,915
I took it once
while shopping for vegetables.

196
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,155
(Mitian Marketplace)
Fish market. This is my name.

197
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,675
And this tricycle
by the side of the road.

198
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,075
These are all names
given by the teacher.

199
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,116
How is it? Not bad, right?

200
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:42,636
Pretty.

201
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,880
That's great. Ke, come on.

202
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,795
Take a picture of the three of us
in front of my work.

203
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:53,144
Ke, you have
to take a picture with us first.

204
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,756
No, we'll take it first. Well...

205
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:58,236
Who should I take the picture
with first? I'm so busy.

206
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:02,675
Ke, take one with them first?

207
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,888
Otherwise,
let's take the picture together.

208
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:17,195
Why don't we take a picture together?
Right, Dad?

209
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:18,155
Let's take it together.

210
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,116
Together.

211
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,596
Right, right. We must take one.

212
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,116
(Discerning the Small Signs)
We must capture this beautiful moment.

213
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,955
Zhang Shanya's work is great.

214
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,955
That's the pride of your whole family.

215
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,955
And it's rare for in-laws
to be classmates.

216
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:37,155
Of course, Wu Yulan's aesthetic

217
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:39,035
is also one of the best in our class.

218
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:42,596
Look at your family standing together,
so harmonious and beautiful.

219
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:43,476
This is just perfect.

220
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:45,116
Come on, let me take a picture for you.

221
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,824
Mr. Dong, let me correct you.
We are not a family now.

222
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:51,356
Mr. Dong, please go ahead.

223
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:52,376
Just take the picture.

224
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay, I-I'll take it.

225
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:06,996
Could you two
please move closer together?

226
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:09,996
Yes, yes.

227
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,836
Let me tell you, Zhang Shanya.

228
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:16,636
As you won first place,
I show some respect on you.

229
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,360
Don't really think we're a family.

230
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:22,315
I know. Just take a picture.

231
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,116
Go ahead.

232
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:27,396
Okay. Yes, keep smiling.

233
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,516
Yes, keep smiling. Ready.
One, two, three. Cheese.

234
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,996
Cheese.

235
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,600
What cheese?

236
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,435
This is?

237
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:46,712
This is my Grandpa.

238
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:51,275
It's Grandpa. Perfect.
The whole family is here.

239
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,075
Then let's take a family photo.

240
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,315
Don't talk nonsense. What do you mean?

241
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,716
We are not a family.

242
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:08,636
Zhang Shanya,
you've come here to buy groceries?

243
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,608
How many lies have you told?

244
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,880
Did you ever tell me about
attending this university?

245
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:15,864
Did you tell me about buying a camera?

246
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:18,072
Even more so today.

247
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,104
You took a reunion photo with your son,
granddaughter, and ex-wife's family.

248
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,672
How dare you!

249
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:28,024
What are you doing?

250
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:32,996
Stop! Just go home.

251
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,275
There are so many people here.
Leave me some grace.

252
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:38,275
If I do it this time,
you'll expect it a second time.

253
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:42,155
I want you to remember
that's what you get for lying.

254
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,836
What are you going to do?
This is the school.

255
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,368
I signed up for a class for my mom.

256
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:52,996
I'm proud
that she won a prize for her work.

257
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,836
You don't have to come
if you don't like it.

258
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,795
You don't have
to embarrass yourself here.

259
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,336
You are really embarrassing.

260
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:30,360
How dare you!
Do you think I'm embarrassing you?

261
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,048
Just staying in Shanghai

262
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,836
makes you look down on me, huh?

263
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:37,275
Zhu Dali, what are you doing?

264
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,555
If you dare touch my son again,

265
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:41,275
- I will fight you.
- So what?

266
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,476
Hit me, go on, kill me!

267
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:50,552
Zhu Dali, I haven't lived
for myself in decades.

268
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,155
I came all the way from home for you,

269
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,116
for them, and for this family.

270
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:01,636
I enrolled in a photography class,

271
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:04,195
and my classmates like me and affirm me.

272
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,515
Have you ever affirmed me?

273
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:08,504
My work is placed right in the center.
And this is how you treat me.

274
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,755
My son just said something to defend me,

275
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:14,200
and this is how you treat him.
Are you a human?

276
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:18,968
From now on, if you dare to lay a finger
on my son again, I'll fight you.

277
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,796
You leave!

278
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:01,144
Son, does it still hurt?

279
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,195
I'm fine.

280
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:10,596
It's really my fault too.

281
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,016
He didn't let me go.

282
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,196
And I-I even lied to him.

283
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,276
And now this is what happened.

284
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:23,475
I embarrassed you

285
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:26,636
in front of Moli's parents.
It's my fault.

286
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:34,232
Mom, come with me.
I'll take you to Jinshan.

287
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:36,356
We'll rent a bigger house.

288
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,915
I can't when I was little,

289
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,235
but I can protect you now.

290
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:50,328
I can't leave.
What will happen to Ke if I leave?

291
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,460
Your dad's been like that.

292
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,900
He'll be fine in a couple of days.

293
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:06,264
Thank you, son.

294
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:10,116
You enrolled me
in this photography class,

295
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:14,392
so I realized that I can
have a different way of living.

296
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:17,752
It's so good, particularly wonderful.

297
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:26,264
Right. It was Moli
who asked me to enroll you in.

298
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,696
Don't worry.
Your dad has put Ke to sleep.

299
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,360
They scared Ke.

300
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,999
Zhang Shanya is quite pathetic.

301
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,519
That Zhu Dali was going too far.

302
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,999
He's being so rude!

303
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,280
He cursed and hit someone in public.

304
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,600
It's my fault
that I was not discerning enough.

305
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,552
Why did I marry you
into a family like that?

306
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,679
But it's fine now. You've divorced.

307
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,056
I can't even think about it.

308
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,128
I'm just worried
what'd happen with Jincao.

309
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,592
They might end up bad.

310
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,912
I'm warning you.
Don't consider remarrying Zhu Jincao.

311
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,320
You are unlucky to jump into a fire pit.

312
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,600
But you'd be a fool to jump into
the same fire pit for second time.

313
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,600
Hello. Okay.

314
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,352
Where are you going?

315
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,080
Is your mom okay?

316
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,000
She's fine.

317
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,496
He can hit your mom in public.

318
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,152
What would he do when no one's around?

319
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,688
I'm here to apologize
on behalf of my parents to you

320
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,864
and your parents.

321
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,679
Sorry that our family
has embarrassed you.

322
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,456
What for? You didn't hit anyone.

323
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:21,336
I'm glad you're not Zhu Dali.

324
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,704
You're nothing like his son.

325
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,928
When I watched you protect your mom,

326
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,640
I thought that
if something ever happened to me,

327
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,536
you'd do the same for me.

328
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,280
Since my dad did this to my mom often,

329
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,600
I swore from a very young age

330
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,000
that I would never be a man like him
when I grew up.

331
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,800
I have to treat my wife well
and love my children.

332
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,384
What kind of environment
did you grow up in?

333
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,372
Having such a dad,

334
00:21:57,372 --> 00:22:00,444
it's not easy for you to remain so kind.

335
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,728
Did you get beat up a lot
when you were little?

336
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,280
No pain, no gain.

337
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,024
When I was a kid, Zhu Dali always
vented his anger on me and my mom.

338
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,712
At the time, I thought it's because
I wasn't good or trying hard enough,

339
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,032
so I studied hard to be first in class.

340
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,432
Hoping that this would make him happy.

341
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:35,128
Then I went to college
and went to Shanghai.

342
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,199
I thought I had escaped.

343
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,999
And I thought he had changed.

344
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,999
But when something becomes a habit,
it couldn't go back.

345
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,759
The abuser takes it for granted,

346
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,040
and the victims
also take it for granted.

347
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:16,664
Moli, thank you.

348
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Thank you
for protecting my mom all this time.

349
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,539
(Overseas Education from International Perspective)
That's all for today's lecture.

350
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,576
I will continue
to give five more sessions here.

351
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,439
Hope to see you next time.

352
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,919
Liuliu, this is good.

353
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
Many of the audience
have been here before.

354
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,040
Mr. Wang is really something.

355
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,919
(Speaker: Wang Lingxiao)
This is the Q&A session.

356
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,400
Feel free to ask any questions.

357
00:23:55,239 --> 00:24:00,679
Mr. Wang, you mentioned that you are
a counter-example of overseas education.

358
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,759
So, when you talk about
studying abroad as an expert,

359
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,959
do you ever feel a bit contradictory?

360
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Because I am a counter-example,

361
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,632
so I can analyze the situation
of studying abroad with you calmly,

362
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:17,040
and create study abroad plans
based on your individual circumstances,

363
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,840
rather than blindly follow the trend,

364
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,120
so that the success rate will be higher.

365
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,919
Do you consider yourself
a success or a failure?

366
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,519
Sir, you are very humorous.

367
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,320
I can definitely tell you
that I am still young.

368
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,199
Are you trying to let me
do the final verdict now?

369
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,999
It might take me more years
to answer your question.

370
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm not...

371
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,800
This gentleman does look quite young.

372
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,592
Work hard and you will
surely succeed in the future.

373
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,679
Please answer my question directly.

374
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
Huang Qianniu, sit down.

375
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,600
I have to go now.

376
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,679
You'd take Mr. Wang back later.

377
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,560
Okay.

378
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,080
Whether I am a success or a failure,

379
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:10,439
I believe that all of you
who have listened to our lectures

380
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:14,640
and followed our recommendations
will succeed in the future,

381
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,239
at least do better than me.

382
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:22,616
(Shanghai Tianyou Hospital)
(Tianyou Hospital Tongji University)

383
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,600
What is the problem?

384
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,120
I should've come
for the check-up half a year ago.

385
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,448
I could only make time
after completing five lectures.

386
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,440
Just after the last one, and you want me
to nominate candidates for the next one?

387
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
Have you finished?

388
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,368
Sorry, just the last one.

389
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,040
Dear, I suggest not using Wang Lingxiao
for the next round anymore.

390
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,360
Nothing particular. I just think
that the audience will get bored.

391
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,320
Hurry up.

392
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,552
Okay, I have to hang up.
I'm doing the check-up.

393
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,239
Lift your clothes up.

394
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,199
Alright. Sorry.

395
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,479
A bit lower.

396
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,159
Okay?

397
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,560
It's so cold.

398
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,519
Gel.

399
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,160
You workaholics don't know
what's important.

400
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,959
If you ruin your body,
then money will be of no use.

401
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,520
What's worse, I ruin my body
and don't make much money.

402
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,280
You have uterine fibroids, right?

403
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,648
For many years.

404
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,640
Does your family have a history
of gynecological cancer?

405
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,199
My mother passed away
from uterine cancer.

406
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,240
Then you should pay attention.

407
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,472
Your uterine fibroids
have an irregular edge.

408
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,320
There's still a chance
it could get worse.

409
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,040
You'd better make an appointment
for a gynecological examination.

410
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,199
Qianniu, you are back.

411
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,792
Qianniu, come on.

412
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,200
No, no.

413
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,479
Making noodles?

414
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,560
Yes.

415
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
Bring me a bowl.

416
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,439
No problem.

417
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,352
Qianniu, landlord is looking for you.
Time to pay the rent.

418
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:04,479
I've paid it.

419
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:07,959
That was last month.
Let's split the utilities.

420
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,999
I've sent the group collection notice.
Take a look.

421
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,159
Okay.

422
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,792
Don't just say okay. Remember to pay.

423
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,519
Because I am a counter-example,

424
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,536
so I can analyze the situation
of studying abroad with you calmly.

425
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:30,936
Do you consider yourself
a success or a failure?

426
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:32,408
I am still young. Are you trying to

427
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:33,912
let me do the final verdict now?

428
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,640
Please answer my question directly.

429
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Huang Qianniu, sit down.

430
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,408
(No way. I can't beat Wang Lingxiao.)

431
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,999
(A head-on battle
will surely result in a terrible loss.)

432
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,759
(But I like Liuliu.)

433
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,479
(I have to think of something else.)

434
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,380
(Twin-tub Washing Machine)

435
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:09,560
Mr. Zhu.

436
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,768
Why are you moving
such a heavy thing alone?

437
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,840
The washing machine is broken,

438
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,679
and can't be fixed.
I have to buy a new one.

439
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,519
They put it to the courier station,
so I have to move it myself.

440
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:27,544
Mr. Zhu, can you help me?

441
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,704
Sorry, I can't.

442
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,696
Right. I see. Never mind then.

443
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,959
Okay, sorry.

444
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,840
Young man, thank you.

445
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,600
You're welcome.

446
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,999
Hello, are you Gao Xiajing?

447
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,792
Which building? I'll help you move it.

448
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay, thank you. Please come with me.

449
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Come on. Lift it up.

450
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
Take it easy.

451
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,256
Mom, give me your phone.

452
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,199
For what? Do you need it?

453
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,816
No. Your phone is old

454
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,864
and the camera is not good enough
to take nice pictures,

455
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,072
so I bought you a new one.

456
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,239
Although it's not as good as
those professional SLR cameras,

457
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,880
the results are not much worse.

458
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,040
You can use it
for the photography class.

459
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:06,296
Son, I'm glad you are so considerate.

460
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,479
But I can't take this phone.

461
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,688
Your dad returned that camera
you bought me last time.

462
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,479
And after that happened,

463
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:19,416
if you give me a new phone,
it would make him mad again.

464
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,840
Besides, Moli's mom

465
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,112
has brought me the camera
Moli used to use.

466
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,999
I think that's working pretty well.

467
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,528
Return this one, son.

468
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:33,280
No. We can't let him do everything.

469
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,320
You'd just use this one.

470
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,688
No, you...

471
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,479
I have a solution.
Well, you use this new one.

472
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,040
Give me the one you're using.

473
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,239
Your phone has a nice camera, right?

474
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,344
This way, your dad won't get mad, right?

475
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,479
Be good.

476
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Alright, Mom. Let me tell you.

477
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,759
If he tries to hit you while I'm gone,

478
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,040
you have to tell me.

479
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:22,200
No. Your dad won't lose temper often.

480
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,600
Don't worry.

481
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:53,840
Who is it?

482
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,999
Who is it?

483
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:05,304
Madam, who are you looking for?

484
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,112
Don't call me Madam. Call me Auntie.
I'm looking for you.

485
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,648
You're Shen Liuliu?

486
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,999
You know me?

487
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,360
Let me in first.

488
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,600
The apartment is nice.

489
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,384
It's not big, but quite functional.

490
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,272
It's also clean and tidy.

491
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,959
Auntie, I'm not selling the house.

492
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,159
I'm not buying it.

493
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,080
I'll have a place to stay when I come.

494
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,120
I think it's for commercial
and residential purposes?

495
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,239
Yes.

496
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,648
It could serve as a down payment
on a school district house.

497
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:46,264
Auntie, who are you?

498
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,936
Don't stand there. Come on, sit down.

499
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,224
Come on, sit down.

500
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,880
Auntie, what are you doing?

501
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,632
Take it.
We'll be family sooner or later.

502
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,536
It was given to me by Qianniu's grandma

503
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,000
when I married his dad.

504
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,120
It's a Huang family heirloom.

505
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,080
You're about to marry him.
Now I pass it to you.

506
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,080
You must take good care of it,
and never lose it.

507
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,576
Wait, you're Huang Qianniu's mom?

508
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,896
Right, my son has excellent taste.

509
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,192
The girl he has chosen is indeed smart.

510
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,520
Don't be shy. Just call me Mom.

511
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,136
I am straightforward.
I'll say what I want.

512
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,560
I like you. This ring is for you.

513
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,840
Qianniu's Dad and I are quite easygoing.

514
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,919
You don't need to give us anything back.

515
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,040
When you get married,
just have one child.

516
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,759
I would never force you
to have a second or third child.

517
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,519
Whether it's a boy or a girl, it's good.

518
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,752
I'll stay out of the child business.

519
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,999
I don't want to be like Shanya,
working hard but getting little result.

520
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:09,400
If you can, you can get a nanny.

521
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,439
See. I'm an open mind
mother-in-law, right?

522
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:15,039
Auntie, you speak so fast
that I can't get a word in.

523
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,160
Then it's your turn.
I came here today to get your opinion.

524
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,384
No opinion.
Huang Qianniu and I are just colleagues.

525
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,599
We've never talked about marriage.

526
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,240
I know. As an unmarried girl,
you're embarrassed.

527
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,544
If you haven't talked about it before,
you can talk about it now.

528
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,999
First, get engaged to Qianniu.

529
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,280
We can talk about the rest later.

530
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,160
But, I have to remind you.
You're not young anymore.

531
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,519
Few years later, you might be too old
to give birth to a child.

532
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,119
After all this talking,
my mouth is dry, and there's no water.

533
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,512
Pour me a cup of water.

534
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm back.

535
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Qianniu, you are back.

536
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,919
My mom.

537
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,840
Auntie, you look so young.

538
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,519
Everyone says she's like my sister.

539
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,959
This room.

540
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,840
I put the keys here.

541
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,519
Okay.

542
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,320
Having the meal?

543
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,919
Auntie, try my cooking.
Let's have some together.

544
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,039
Not bad.

545
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,079
Bring me a bowl.

546
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,696
Okay.

547
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,360
There's a step.

548
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,720
Let's eat.

549
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,680
This room? T-This is not as good as
the one you rented before.

550
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,559
Mom, this is the best room in the house.

551
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,760
I picked it right away.
You don't understand.

552
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,296
Living in a cramped space
makes me a complete Shanghai drifter.

553
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,400
Come on, mom. Give me a hand.

554
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,160
Where should I move it?

555
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,216
Just here. Okay.

556
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,079
Come on. Let's eat.

557
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,640
Son.

558
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,360
Just hold on. We'll soon
move into Liuliu's big house.

559
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,088
What do you mean?

560
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,984
I gave Liuliu Grandma's gold ring.

561
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,736
You gave it to Liuliu?

562
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,232
Oh my. Mom,
you've completely ruined my plan.

563
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,312
What's wrong?

564
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,712
Liuliu doesn't like someone doing so.

565
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,680
My plan was
that I would have a nice dinner party,

566
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,400
create an atmosphere of loving,

567
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,160
and then as soon as I take out the ring,

568
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,079
she would have to say yes.

569
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,119
What women value most is the process.

570
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,479
Besides, the enemy is so powerful.

571
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:38,959
Enemy? Who dares to compete
with my son for a woman?

572
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,720
I'll go to take down his arm.

573
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,280
You can't, since my aunt won't agree.

574
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,360
Lingxiao is my enemy.

575
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,519
Lingxiao?

576
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,096
The fortune-teller

577
00:36:55,704 --> 00:36:59,416
has warned me to defend against
someone within the family.

578
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,519
Lingxiao lives in the luxury apartment,
earning a high salary,

579
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,400
and you've paved the way for his career.

580
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,720
How dare he steals a woman from you!

581
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,519
It's not stealing.
Liuliu never accepts me,

582
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,800
neither nor him.

583
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,928
It's a draw in the first round.

584
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:18,639
Stop. Don't go for the second round.

585
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,200
A long delay may cause trouble.
Hurry and make Liuliu yours,

586
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,999
and then you'd move into the big house.

587
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:28,800
How vulgar. It's her
I'm interested in, not the house.

588
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,032
Well, when you go to
the company tomorrow,

589
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,552
check if Liuliu
is wearing that gold ring.

590
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,176
If she wears it, it is settled.

591
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:41,360
If she's not wearing it,
I will think of a plan B for you.

592
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,919
No plan B. Mom, eat now.
It's getting cold.

593
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,616
Just listen to me.

594
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,128
Wait, where am I going to sleep tonight?

595
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,800
Maybe you'd talk to Jincao.

596
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,680
Get him to book that hotel.

597
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,959
The one with the swimming pool will do.

598
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:09,880
Mom. Because of us, Jincao has divorced.

599
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,896
And you still want Jincao to pay?

600
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,816
Aren't you afraid Auntie will scold you?

601
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,639
Fine, I'll figure it out myself.
Let's eat.

602
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:32,120
(Study Abroad)

603
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,039
Morning, Liuliu.

604
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,760
Morning.

605
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,772
(Conference Room)

606
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,439
Liuliu, please take a look
at this proposal.

607
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:49,200
Bring it in.

608
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,848
Okay.

609
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,880
It's so difficult to get an appointment
on this hospital's official website.

610
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,919
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

611
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,919
Nothing, just a routine check-up.

612
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,696
I'll get one for you later.

613
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,400
Right, where is Huang Qianniu?
I haven't seen him.

614
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,720
We're about to have a meeting.
He's tidying up the conference room.

615
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,680
Call him over.
I have something to tell him.

616
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,240
Okay.

617
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,776
Liuliu, are you looking for me?

618
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:35,959
What are you looking for?

619
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,919
I think I left a pen here
when I was here yesterday.

620
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,800
Looking for this?
Here's your heirloom back.

621
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,648
This ring is too valuable.
I absolutely cannot accept it.

622
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,632
Please thank your mom.

623
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,032
Take this ring back.

624
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,688
I hope it won't happen again.

625
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,216
I can tell she loves you.

626
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,672
But she seems
to misunderstand our relationship.

627
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:58,232
What are you going to tell me?

628
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,639
Something serious is going to happen.

629
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,616
What's it again? You're always being so.

630
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,720
I went to Shanghai to look for Qianniu.

631
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,000
I heard that Lingxiao
is dating with a woman.

632
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,760
Dating?

633
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,119
As his auntie,
I must look out for my nephew.

634
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,760
So I checked on her in person.

635
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,352
Then I got truly startled.

636
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:31,352
That woman is named Shen Liuliu,
quite average-looking.

637
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,152
She's almost 40,
so she might not have a child anymore.

638
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,079
I also heard that her parents
have passed away a long time ago.

639
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,519
No wonder her face looks so lonely.

640
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,240
She's not a woman
blessed with good luck.

641
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:51,720
Lingxiao is cool, with a high salary,
and he studied abroad.

642
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,959
That Shen Liuliu

643
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,519
is completely not a match for Lingxiao.

644
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,800
When did this happen?
How long has it been?

645
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,048
Lingxiao never mentioned it.

646
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,200
It seems to be something recent.

647
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,296
Lingxiao never mentioned it, huh?

648
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:13,464
T-Then just pretend
I didn't say anything.

649
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I really mean well.
I want him to live well.

650
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,048
If they don't make it, don't blame me.

651
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,280
Alright. I'm leaving.

652
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,119
Tell me more.

653
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,720
I've told you everything I know.

654
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,432
I really think this is a big deal.

655
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,288
You have to take this seriously.

656
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:37,999
Enough. I have a lot to do.

657
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:38,880
I'm leaving.

658
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,776
Liuliu. I know someone
who's an expert at that hospital.

659
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,272
I'll ask for you. But what's wrong?

660
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:51,919
Are you feeling unwell?
You need to have a thorough check-up.

661
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:54,712
Nothing. Just want to find a hospital
for a better check-up.

662
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,320
That's good then.
