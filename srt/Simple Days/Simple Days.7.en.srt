=Episode 7=

19
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,012
Hello, Mom.

20
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,012
How are you doing?

21
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,612
I just sent you an address.

22
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,492
Come over now.

23
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,732
Daddy and Mommy have a gift for you.

24
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,971
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

25
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,172
What's going on here?

26
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,251
You rented a new apartment?

27
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,332
Weren't you just fine at Auntie's place?

28
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,651
You were paying rent.

29
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,851
Why come here?

30
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,251
It's not rented.

31
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:09,971
We bought it.

32
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,052
You bought it?

33
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,411
Let me show you around first.

34
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:17,691
This is a big living room.

35
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,052
This is an open kitchen.

36
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:22,572
This is an open walk-in closet.

37
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,212
And over here.

38
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:27,131
Your bedroom.

39
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,971
It's huge.

40
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,612
Look, the study.

41
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,091
This is the bathroom.

42
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:37,411
And this

43
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:39,411
is Daddy and Mommy's bedroom.

44
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,052
How much did you pay?

45
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,052
Is it nice?

46
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:47,892
Wait a minute, Wu Yulan.

47
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,851
You're not qualified to buy a house.

48
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,720
I got an early retirement
a few years ago

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,012
and came to help out
at my friend's company.

50
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:01,212
They paid my social security fee.

51
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,172
It's been over six years now.

52
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,012
So I am qualified

53
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,851
to buy a house in Shanghai.

54
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,371
It's just that you didn't know.

55
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,332
(Property Deed, Wu Yulan)
Take a good look. It's my name.

56
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,892
Wu Yulan. So secretive.

57
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,051
I was just being cautious

58
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,091
in case something went wrong.

59
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:25,692
See, it has come in handy.

60
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:27,531
You and Jincao

61
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:30,051
wanted to get a bigger house but failed.

62
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,851
That was when we started
checking out houses.

63
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,572
Now that you are divorced,

64
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:38,611
we can't let you live in any discomfort.

65
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,692
So we rushed to buy the one we picked.

66
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,051
Look around.

67
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,452
I know it's a showroom.

68
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,332
But it saves the time and money

69
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,091
on renovations.

70
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:53,012
We can move in right away.

71
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,692
Right, let's talk business.

72
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:55,692
Look.

73
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:58,971
I've already drafted the agreement.

74
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,531
Just sign on it and stamp it.

75
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:02,892
And tomorrow, all three of us

76
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,772
will go to the notary office

77
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,892
and the real-estate transaction center

78
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,772
to register it under your name.

79
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,452
And then guess what?

80
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,411
This house will be yours.

81
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,252
Wait, this...

82
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,531
Mom.

83
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,051
Pinch me.

84
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,851
It's real?

85
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:29,332
Aren't you surprised? Are you thrilled?

86
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:31,051
Mom.

87
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:31,932
Dad.

88
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,651
You are so good to me.

89
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,491
Alright.

90
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:39,332
Alright.

91
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:43,332
Mom.

92
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,332
When will you be back
from your business trip?

93
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:46,611
I miss you.

94
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,851
Mommy will be back soon.

95
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:50,411
Be a good girl.

96
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,171
Listen to Dad and Grandma.

97
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,051
Do you hear me?

98
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,932
Okay.

99
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:55,851
Ke.

100
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:57,851
Let me talk to your mom for a bit.

101
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,132
- Ke.
- Play by yourself.

102
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,132
- Dinner is ready.
- Okay, bye Mom.

103
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,772
Bye, darling.

104
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,772
How is it? Where are you now?

105
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:11,411
I was just about to tell you.

106
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,932
My dad and my mom
bought me a new apartment.

107
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,332
Look, this is my bedroom.

108
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,012
That's the living room.

109
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,252
Pretty, huh?

110
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,531
Good for you.

111
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,372
I'm relieved to know

112
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,372
you have a place to stay.

113
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,491
What's wrong?

114
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:34,692
It's nothing.

115
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:38,572
Why do I feel you're not very happy?

116
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,731
Not at all.

117
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,892
I just feel that

118
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,252
you've made the right decision.

119
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,012
The quality of life

120
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,692
improved a lot for you
after you left me.

121
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,372
Look at you. So full of jealousy.

122
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:55,372
My parents bought me a house so that

123
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,411
I don't end up on the streets.

124
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,372
Ke.

125
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,452
Who is your dad calling?

126
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,651
He's video-calling Mom.

127
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,372
Your mom didn't say anything

128
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,091
after I left, right?

129
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:12,051
She didn't.

130
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,291
She's quite cooperative.

131
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,692
Keep it a secret from Ke

132
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,372
that we're divorced.

133
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,372
Rest assured,

134
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,892
she knows what to do.

135
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,892
Moli.

136
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:25,491
Mom.

137
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,932
Hurry up.

138
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:28,992
Let's go out for a feast to celebrate.

139
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:29,651
Okay.

140
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:30,171
Hurry up.

141
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,531
Okay, I'll be right there.

142
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:35,171
That's it for now.

143
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,892
My parents are taking me out for dinner.

144
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,091
Take care of yourself.

145
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,172
(Wu Yulan)
(I want to see you.)

146
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:27,212
I-I ordered you a coffee.

147
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,572
Yulan.

148
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,851
Call me Ms. Wu.

149
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,091
Ms. Wu.

150
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,412
It's my fault.

151
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,652
I blamed Moli
for the fake purse by mistake.

152
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:55,052
My husband is still in our hometown.

153
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,212
I can't count on my youngest sister.

154
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:58,532
So I...

155
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:02,491
I'd like to apologize to you.

156
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,131
I sincerely apologize to you.

157
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,292
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,011
What are you doing?

159
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,771
Sit down.

160
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,091
Let bygones be bygones.

161
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:27,052
After all, Moli and Jincao
are no longer together.

162
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:28,692
But...

163
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,851
I don't understand, you see.

164
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,251
They were doing so well together.

165
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,891
How could they divorce over a purse?

166
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,091
The purse

167
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:41,731
was just the last straw
that broke the camel's back.

168
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,251
I don't think it's a big deal.

169
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,771
They were doing so well together

170
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,491
but got divorced just like that.

171
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,812
What about their child?

172
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,572
I'd like you to talk to Moli about it.

173
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,532
Tell her not to be headstrong.

174
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:00,652
A couple should stick to each other.

175
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,692
That's the best for all.

176
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:03,611
Right?

177
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,332
Let's not make a fuss.

178
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,091
They can get re-married.

179
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,932
I knew it, Zhang Shanya.

180
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:14,011
I was wondering
why you suddenly became so polite

181
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:16,851
and even stood up to bow for an apology.

182
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,251
So this is what you want.

183
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,572
You're doing this for your son.

184
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,412
Moli is headstrong?

185
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,652
Moli broke up with Jincao

186
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,851
and severed her tie with you people.

187
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,532
That's the best decision she has made.

188
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,971
I was against it when Moli

189
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,332
wanted to marry Jincao
in the first place.

190
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,412
They couldn't get by and got a divorce.

191
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,212
I'm welcoming my daughter home.

192
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,371
Don't lecture me about
how couples should stay together.

193
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:50,652
I don't believe in that.

194
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,052
I just want

195
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,091
my daughter to be happy.

196
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,692
That's what matters.

197
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:02,652
Moli may be young and naive.

198
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,572
But how can you be
so clueless at your age?

199
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,491
You're getting your daughter
into deeper trouble.

200
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,771
Yeah, she's divorced now.

201
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,692
She's free. She's happy.

202
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,400
But for how long?

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,491
Even young girls
can't get married these days.

204
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:18,891
She's a mother to a child.

205
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,452
I'm not worried about my son.

206
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,212
Plenty of young girls

207
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:24,491
will approach him once the word is out.

208
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:26,052
But it's different for women.

209
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:28,131
A woman doesn't get any younger.

210
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,240
Don't be so overconfident, alright?

211
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,011
Having a tiny apartment
is nothing to brag about.

212
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,572
Open your eyes and look around.

213
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:35,452
Where are we?

214
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:36,812
We're in Shanghai.

215
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,251
You're still looking down
upon our apartment.

216
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:42,491
Just give me a break.

217
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:45,491
No one is impressed
with your little house.

218
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:46,731
I told you a million times.

219
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,611
I'm telling you.

220
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:50,652
We got Moli a school-district house
with full payment.

221
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,851
It's close to two metro lines.

222
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,052
It's over 100 square meters
with three bedrooms.

223
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:57,971
The Premises Permit
has only my daughter's name on it.

224
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:01,412
Her good days have just begun.

225
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,532
You're totally unreasonable.

226
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:07,692
Other parents
advise their children to make up,

227
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,011
not break up.

228
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,212
Why did you
incite your daughter to get a divorce?

229
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,292
Don't blame it on me.

230
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,452
I don't even care

231
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,491
to mention those things

232
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,251
you and your relatives have done.

233
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,052
Fine, go ahead and be arrogant.

234
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,532
You're going to cry when Moli

235
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:23,731
ends up unwanted.

236
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,251
You don't have to jinx us.

237
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:28,371
My daughter is good-looking,
talented, and has a house.

238
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,891
She's a real lady.

239
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,532
I'm telling you,

240
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:32,292
she's going to be

241
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,131
highly sought after.

242
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:34,812
Fine.

243
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,251
Let's put it to the test.

244
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,572
Come with me to the matchmaking agency

245
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,251
and see who is more in demand.

246
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,332
Let's go then.

247
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,611
Hello, Auntie.

248
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,332
What can I do for you?

249
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,251
Marriage inquiry.

250
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,692
Come, Auntie, this way please.

251
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,812
Come, this way please.

252
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,332
Auntie, please have a seat.

253
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,208
Wei, bring some sweet soup.

254
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,212
Okay.

255
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:23,971
Auntie.

256
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:26,052
You've certainly picked the right place.

257
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:26,891
Thank you.

258
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,332
Auntie, are you divorced,

259
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,812
or widowed?

260
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,851
Don't talk nonsense.

261
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,812
Auntie, please don't mind it.

262
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,011
You should leave your past behind.

263
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:43,572
Your future will be
the greatest reward for you.

264
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,172
Look at you. You've got a temperament.

265
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,692
And you look so young.

266
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,292
You clearly seek more in life.

267
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:53,052
So, please tell me about
your requirements

268
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:53,932
for a partner.

269
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:55,251
I will do my best.

270
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:59,332
What's wrong with you kids?

271
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,572
Nonsense.

272
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:01,971
It's not about me.

273
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,172
I'm here to find a match
for my daughter.

274
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:07,452
My daughter is 32 years old,
and an only child.

275
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,812
She's a graduate
of the Academy of Fine Arts.

276
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:12,692
She has a car
and a school-district house.

277
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,332
She is an agent at a high-end gallery.

278
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:19,091
She's such a lady. You have no idea.

279
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,611
I also have a granddaughter.

280
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,704
So your daughter is divorced?

281
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,572
Yeah.

282
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,040
W-With a child.

283
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,851
Yeah.

284
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,971
I've been sitting here for so long

285
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,491
but no one has paid attention to me.

286
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,932
I'm also looking for a match for my son.

287
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,011
Auntie, I'm sorry.

288
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,491
My son is 33 years old.

289
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,851
He's 1.8 meters tall,

290
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,491
good-looking, and very kind.

291
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,771
He's a director
at a major internet company.

292
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,131
He has an apartment. Divorced.

293
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,771
Both his father and I have pensions.

294
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,292
My son also has a daughter.

295
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,984
But his father and I
can take care of her.

296
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,332
Auntie, excuse me for a second.

297
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:58,292
Auntie.

298
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,851
I've noticed you.

299
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:02,292
But we must greet our clients
one at a time, right?

300
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,672
Wei, bring some sweet soup now.

301
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,371
Okay.

302
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,932
Dad, I want this one.

303
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:17,971
This little bunny?

304
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:18,452
Yeah.

305
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,172
Okay.

306
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:21,052
And this one.

307
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:21,971
The racing car?

308
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:22,412
Yeah.

309
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,971
Alright, let's get both of them.

310
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:24,971
Really?

311
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:25,572
Yeah.

312
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:26,532
It's a father-daughter day.

313
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,172
Daddy will get you whatever you want.

314
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,332
Yeah!

315
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,412
Dad.

316
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:34,011
When will Mom be back?

317
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,412
Be patient. Mommy will be back soon.

318
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,052
Alright then.

319
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,452
Let's go pay.

320
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:42,692
Dad, I need to use the restroom.

321
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:45,091
Mom, I want the men's restroom.

322
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,932
I don't want to go to the women's.

323
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:50,611
- I don't want to!
- But Mommy is worried.

324
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:51,971
Be a good boy.

325
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,692
Mommy will watch the door for you.

326
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,771
Nobody is going to go in, okay?

327
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:56,611
Guo.

328
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:58,052
Guo.

329
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:00,771
Dad.

330
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,131
This is my kindergarten classmate, Guo.

331
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:04,372
Hi, Guo.

332
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:07,011
Mom, I can't hold it anymore.

333
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,011
Hurry up.

334
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,212
Dad, me neither.

335
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:09,731
Go ahead.

336
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,172
I'm not going to the women's.

337
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,452
I want to go to the men's restroom.

338
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:15,932
Dad, I'm not going
to the men's restroom.

339
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,971
How about we switch then?

340
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,531
You just said my son was such a catch.

341
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,892
Do we need to

342
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,412
get this membership?

343
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,331
This is even higher
than the dowry we gave when he married.

344
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:34,731
Now you know
how much of a bargain you got.

345
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,212
You see, Auntie.

346
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,652
It's because your son
is such a great catch

347
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:41,051
that our VIP membership service

348
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,291
suits him the most.

349
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,132
Think about it.

350
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:44,771
He's such a good catch.

351
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,571
We'll arrange so many dates for him.

352
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:47,172
Right?

353
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:48,612
There will be many applicants.

354
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,771
Their age, marital history,

355
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,212
criminal record,

356
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,692
the ability to reproduce...

357
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,811
Clients find it awkward
to ask those things.

358
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:57,491
We have to look into them

359
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,291
for a meticulous screening.

360
00:17:59,291 --> 00:17:59,932
Then you

361
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,811
get to pick the ones you like.

362
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,172
That's true.

363
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,132
Auntie, let me tell you.

364
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:06,692
Marriage is a big deal.

365
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,412
You've taken one wrong step.

366
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,372
You can't afford
to make a second mistake.

367
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,051
Yeah.

368
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:12,092
You are right.

369
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:14,811
We can't afford
to make a second mistake.

370
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:16,051
How about this?

371
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:17,612
This is what I think.

372
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:18,372
Why don't you

373
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,652
register my son on the list

374
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:21,652
first?

375
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,811
Then provide us with some information

376
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,011
to browse through

377
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,092
to see if the girls
you recommend are good.

378
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:27,971
Auntie.

379
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,971
If you only get registered without

380
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:30,971
joining the membership,

381
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,172
I can't recommend

382
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:34,092
the high-quality assets to you, right?

383
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:36,011
But how can I join the membership...

384
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:37,452
I'll join the membership.

385
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,251
I'm interested in this Package Seven.

386
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,132
I'll get this for my daughter.

387
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,731
Auntie, just a second.

388
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,412
Auntie.

389
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,372
You know what?

390
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,051
I'm leaving her files here.

391
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:52,771
We are not in a hurry.

392
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:55,811
Don't try to fool me with those words.

393
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,571
It's good enough to just

394
00:18:57,892 --> 00:19:00,571
screen through the candidates carefully

395
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,251
as you say.

396
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,212
Alright.

397
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,291
Shall we get it done today or...

398
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:06,412
Today, right now.

399
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:07,331
With card.

400
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,331
Alright.

401
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:10,491
We have a VIP room here.
I'll take you there.

402
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:10,971
Alright.

403
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,652
This way.

404
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:12,971
Let's go.

405
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,932
Auntie, sorry.

406
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:16,731
This way, please.

407
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:22,331
Zhang, I have to go.

408
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,251
What... You...

409
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,212
Get my son registered, at least.

410
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,291
I have to go back and cook.

411
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:37,692
Usually, my mom
takes me to the restroom.

412
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,491
Where is she?

413
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:42,251
She's on a business trip. She's busy.

414
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:43,571
On a business trip?

415
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:44,852
My dad keeps saying

416
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,652
he's married
the busiest fairy in the world.

417
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:48,932
Really?

418
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,692
Your dad is very humorous.

419
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:51,571
Did you memorize it?

420
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:52,251
Good for you.

421
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,372
Did you memorize it?

422
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:56,132
Do it yourself

423
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:57,291
once you get back

424
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,132
for practice.

425
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:00,571
Mr. Zhu.

426
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:02,892
You didn't have to do this.

427
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:03,771
It's nothing.

428
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:04,491
Thank you.

429
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:05,692
Did you thank Auntie?

430
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:06,892
Thank you, Auntie Gao.

431
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:07,892
You're welcome.

432
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:10,452
Guo, come play with us.

433
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,132
It's our father-daughter day.

434
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:14,731
What is that?

435
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,291
It's the day

436
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,331
when Dad buys me anything I want.

437
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,771
Doesn't your dad celebrate it with you?

438
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,331
I don't have a dad.

439
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,251
Ke, let's go get a cake.

440
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,051
Okay.

441
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:29,612
Sorry about that.

442
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:30,452
It's fine.

443
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,051
Say goodbye to Auntie.

444
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:33,372
Goodbye, Auntie.

445
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:34,291
Goodbye.

446
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:43,212
Come on.

447
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:45,372
Alright, time to change.

448
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,331
- Then...
- I'm not wearing this.

449
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,251
Why not?

450
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,251
Isn't it very pretty?

451
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:50,491
You wore it yesterday.

452
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:51,771
It's not dirty, right?

453
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:52,291
No.

454
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,571
My mom says we can't wear
the same outfit for two days.

455
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,372
Don't listen to your mom.

456
00:20:58,372 --> 00:20:59,652
Her clothes

457
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,811
are too costly. It's a waste of money.

458
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:02,720
So many clothes.

459
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,552
Don't learn from her.

460
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,692
Come on, put it on.

461
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:05,172
Moli.

462
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:06,331
I'm not wearing it.

463
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,051
Help.

464
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:07,892
What's wrong?

465
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,291
I'm not going to wear it.

466
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,892
Let me get you something else.

467
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:13,331
I'll get you something else.

468
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,132
Wait.

469
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,892
Ke is going to wear new clothes.

470
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:17,932
Take a look.

471
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,372
Bought it for you at the supermarket.

472
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:21,412
This is emerald green.

473
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:22,811
Isn't it nice? Put it on.

474
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,692
It's so ugly. I won't wear it.

475
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,771
It's not ugly. It's new.

476
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:29,932
Don't you want something new?

477
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:30,771
Put it on.

478
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:31,612
I'm not wearing it.

479
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:32,771
It's too ugly.

480
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,452
I want my mom.

481
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:35,771
Your mom is on a business trip.

482
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,051
Be good, hurry up.

483
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:37,852
Get dressed

484
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:38,731
for kindergarten.

485
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,092
It's too ugly.

486
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,452
I want my mom.

487
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,212
How come you're so naughty?

488
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,291
You saw that?

489
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,331
What should I do?

490
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,412
Go to the wardrobe.

491
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,372
The second shelf.

492
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,291
Get Princess Anna's

493
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,571
green dress from "Frozen".

494
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,412
Match it with white lace socks

495
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:57,692
and leather shoes with pearls.

496
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,612
Send me a photo.

497
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,652
Which one?

498
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,011
The green dress.

499
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,132
The socks?

500
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,452
The white lace socks.

501
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,172
White lace. Where?

502
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:11,011
This one?

503
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:11,971
No.

504
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,251
Those are stockings.

505
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,051
The short ones are in the front.

506
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,132
Short ones. Okay.

507
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:18,612
And the shoes?

508
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,291
Didn't you say pearl? What pearl?

509
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,932
The leather shoes with white pearls.

510
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:24,932
I see them. White pearls, okay.

511
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:30,011
Is it okay now?

512
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,852
Is it okay now, my princess?

513
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,932
It's pretty.

514
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:34,771
Alright.

515
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,011
Hurry up to kindergarten.

516
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:37,612
We're already late.

517
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,971
Your wife spoiled her,
giving her all these bad habits.

518
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,731
And she divorced you.

519
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,011
Let's go, Ke.

520
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,172
Come on, we're late.

521
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:50,372
Hurry, let's go.

522
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:56,612
What are you

523
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:58,452
after the divorce?

524
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,771
We're like a special couple.

525
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,852
We can't openly walk home hand in hand,

526
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,771
nor can we meet often,

527
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,092
but I know he won't leave,

528
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:12,771
and he knows I won't change.

529
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,491
Ke, he, and I

530
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,731
still form the most stable triangle.

531
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,051
That's all we need.

532
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:23,011
Zhu Jincao, what do you think you are?

533
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:25,452
One of us became a base,

534
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,011
and the other a satellite.

535
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,892
And Ke is like the signal

536
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,612
sent out by the base,

537
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,331
constantly reminding us

538
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,932
that even though we're apart,

539
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,971
we're still in the same orbit,

540
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,811
spinning and revolving.

541
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,291
Eventually, the satellite

542
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,331
will follow the program we've set

543
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,731
and return to the base.

544
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,412
Sometimes the program
can go wrong, you know.

545
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:50,852
No way.

546
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,612
Everything will proceed according to

547
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:54,771
the program.

548
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:56,212
Are you that confident?

549
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,692
Yeah, absolutely.

550
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:13,120
(Post-Divorce Era)

551
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,372
What I'm going to say
may not be pleasant,

552
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:33,892
but unpleasant as it may be,
you have to listen.

553
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,412
Sorry, Mr. Chen.

554
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,412
Something came up at home.

555
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,652
Married people are amazing,

556
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:41,412
coming late and acting justified.

557
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,172
Bad news.

558
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,051
Due to the market downturn,

559
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,212
the shareholders decided to

560
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:49,971
reduce expenses and boost efficiency.

561
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,092
So,

562
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:53,612
we're going to implement
an elimination system.

563
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:56,971
The one with the worst performance
every quarter will be advised to leave.

564
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,092
So, roll up your sleeves and work hard.

565
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:08,852
There's also some good news.

566
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,172
The agent contract
of the famous painter Yan Li

567
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,251
is about to expire.

568
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,092
Many galleries are vying for him.

569
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:16,731
But he refused them all.

570
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:17,971
You know,

571
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,771
Yan Li's paintings
are now worth their weight in gold.

572
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:21,932
Our gallery will make

573
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:24,892
a miraculous comeback
if we get him on board.

574
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,051
So?

575
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,731
Which brave soul
wants to take up the challenge?

576
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:33,212
Mr. Chen, can we be more practical?

577
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,452
Isn't Yan Li

578
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,932
way out of our league?

579
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:37,971
It's like me telling

580
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,771
the richest second-generation tycoon,

581
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,491
"You're my type. Marry me."

582
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:43,251
That's what I need you for.

583
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,452
Let me give it a try.

584
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:46,811
See?

585
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,132
That's the spirit.

586
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,811
That's the spirit.

587
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,372
Do you have any connections?

588
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,412
Mr. Yan Li and I are alumni.

589
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,331
There must be a way to reach him.

590
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:00,892
Bragging about it again.

591
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,771
There are only a handful of art schools.

592
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,571
Anyone can be his alumnus.

593
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,811
Let me warn you in advance.

594
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,372
Yan Li has a bad temper.

595
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:10,208
The last agent

596
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,132
was on call 24/7,

597
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:13,531
and almost lost it.

598
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,092
If you want to approach him,

599
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:17,771
don't ever say anything
like "I have a child"

600
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:18,771
or "I'm too busy".

601
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:24,771
Should I get you a partner?

602
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,372
I've never heard of
an agent needing a partner.

603
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:29,811
Who's going to take the credit?

604
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:31,811
Get him on board first.

605
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:33,291
I'll partner up with her.

606
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,412
Good, very good.

607
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:40,412
Moli knows art. Mi Na knows people.

608
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,051
Positive competition.

609
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:43,612
It's settled then.

610
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:58,932
What?

611
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,852
You took on a job for me?

612
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,051
Lingxiao, it's a simple forum.

613
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:05,212
It's just a few hours in the morning.

614
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:06,692
Don't rush to turn me down.

615
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,051
I'm turning you down right now.

616
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:10,452
Just do me a favor.

617
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:11,892
I promise.

618
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:12,811
For three months...

619
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,011
For six months,

620
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,372
I won't borrow money from you.

621
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:16,251
Just leave.

622
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:19,011
I'm too busy to even scold you.

623
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:22,491
Telling me to leave...

624
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,172
I just came.

625
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,011
How can I leave?

626
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:28,811
Lingxiao.

627
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:30,652
How about this?

628
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:33,652
You know I've been
deeply involved in online education.

629
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,452
You're also interested in it.

630
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:38,011
Do you have something on your computer

631
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,531
that can enlighten me?

632
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,652
Give a rookie like me a chance

633
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:47,051
to get close
to the leading expert in the field

634
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,652
and develop my insights.

635
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,011
Don't give me that.

636
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,771
Buttering me up won't work.

637
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,932
Just leave.

638
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:56,452
Leo.

639
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:58,491
Everyone is waiting
in the conference room.

640
00:27:58,491 --> 00:27:59,971
We can start at any time.

641
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,051
Okay. Be right there.

642
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:12,571
Don't stay here.

643
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,652
I'm off to the meeting. Leave.

644
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,251
Close the door on the way out.

645
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,092
When will you be back?

646
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,892
I'll wait until the end.

647
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:28,092
Who? Yan Li?

648
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:31,811
Girl, you really think highly of me.

649
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:32,852
Yeah.

650
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:35,291
I do know people.

651
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:36,932
But Yan Li?

652
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:38,331
A top-tier artist.

653
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:39,692
Aloof and mysterious.

654
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,571
I can't reach him.

655
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:43,692
Don't be modest.

656
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,412
I believe in
the Six Degrees of Separation.

657
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:48,251
You can connect to anyone

658
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,491
in the world in six steps or less,

659
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:52,932
especially when you're
the most sociable person

660
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,011
back in the university.

661
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,291
With your help,

662
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,971
I can meet him in two steps.

663
00:28:58,011 --> 00:28:59,652
But you can already reach him

664
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:00,811
in one step.

665
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:02,531
What do you mean?

666
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:05,051
Ask your ex-boyfriend
Jiang Haitao for help.

667
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,251
He knows Yan Li.

668
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:09,331
Didn't he post a photo of them
in his Moments?

669
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,331
You didn't see it?

670
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,491
I don't have his WeChat.

671
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:14,092
I'll find it for you.

672
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,011
Here.

673
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:23,731
See, I'm not lying.

674
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:30,692
Should I ask him on your behalf

675
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:32,212
if you feel awkward?

676
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:33,652
Don't contact him.

677
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,172
Liu.

678
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,372
Have you secured

679
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,331
that mysterious guest?

680
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,531
Almost there.

681
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,731
That's not good enough.

682
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:45,692
This is an emergency.

683
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:46,771
The clock is ticking.

684
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:47,731
Is he coming or not?

685
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:49,612
Let me ask him again.

686
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:53,011
Just a second, Mr. Wang.

687
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:56,692
(Email)

688
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,531
The mysterious guest is Wang Lingxiao.

689
00:29:58,932 --> 00:29:59,971
He's willing to come.

690
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,011
Wang Lingxiao?

691
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,571
He never gives speeches in public.

692
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:04,491
Are you sure?

693
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:06,011
Yeah.

694
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:15,852
Liu.

695
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:17,491
Mr. Wang...

696
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:18,172
I know...

697
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:19,132
Wait a bit.

698
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:19,971
Get in first.

699
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:29,888
(Wang Lingxiao)

700
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:37,011
Liu.

701
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:42,971
Why are you dressed like this?

702
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,291
Where is Wang Lingxiao?

703
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:45,892
Something came up at the last minute.

704
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:48,731
He's asked me to speak
on his behalf as his assistant.

705
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,011
Just say it.

706
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,372
He didn't agree to come, did he?

707
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:53,491
Stay calm.

708
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:54,971
My cousin is not coming,

709
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,852
but I carry his wisdom.

710
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:58,731
I've sent the slides to your email.

711
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,172
He made those by himself. Guaranteed.

712
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:02,011
Huang...

713
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:05,331
Liu.

714
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,852
Don't worry.

715
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,571
I'm also a lecturer
at Jinshi Open Lecture.

716
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:12,011
I can take his place.

717
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,892
I got this.

718
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:17,092
Besides, I'm more entertaining.

719
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:24,011
Explain it to Mr. Wang.

720
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:26,571
This is the standard template we have.

721
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:27,936
We don't change it.

722
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,731
Okay, I will explain it to him.

723
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:31,612
Hold on.

724
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:32,291
Okay.

725
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:45,212
(Hua)
Moli.

726
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,212
I forwarded Yan Li's
business card to you.

727
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,051
The rest is up to your luck.

728
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:54,692
That's great, thank you, my dear.

729
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:56,011
Love you, mwah!

730
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,571
I'll add him right away.

731
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,032
(Yan Li)

732
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,132
(I'm Moli.)
(I'm Yan Li.)

733
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:30,531
(Hello, Mr. Yan.)

734
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:31,840
(I am your alumnus,)

735
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,251
(Gu Moli from the Oil Painting Dept.,
class of 2008.)

736
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,971
(I am currently an agent
at the Flying Bird Gallery.)

737
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:40,092
(I wonder when you might be available)

738
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,491
(for a meeting.)

739
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,771
(Two in the afternoon
at the Peony Club.)

740
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,852
(Lecturer Wang Lingxiao)

741
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:02,932
Hello, everyone.

742
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,291
I am the director of this forum.

743
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,251
First of all, I'd like to thank you

744
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,331
for attending this forum.

745
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,491
Due to some issues on our part,

746
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,491
our keynote speaker Mr. Wang Lingxiao...

747
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:16,652

00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,092
They want Wang Lingxiao,

Hello, everyone.

789
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:59,251
I am today's keynote speaker,
Wang Lingxiao.

790
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:00,532
Applaud!

791
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:06,052
Many thanks to my two colleagues

792
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:07,731
for the warm-up.

793
00:35:09,012 --> 00:35:10,612
I have arrived.

794
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,012
You may take a rest now.

795
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:19,251
First off,
I'd like to explain to everyone

796
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,212
that I didn't mean to be late

797
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,692
or to act above my station.

798
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:25,371
It's just that the game last night

799
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:26,532
was too exciting.

800
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,612
I stayed up all night

801
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:29,612
and got up late.

802
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,291
I'm truly sorry.

803
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:35,811
I'm five minutes late.

804
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:38,492
I'll speak for an extra half hour

805
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,291
as an apology to make it up to you.

806
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,612
Alright.

807
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,212
Let's get started.

808
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,532
I have a question for you.

809
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:51,451
Why do people send their children
to study abroad?

810
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:52,612
To improve their resume.

811
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:53,891
To see the world

812
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:55,612
and experience something new.

813
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:56,652
Well said.

814
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,251
I believe you have
many positive things to say

815
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,731
about studying abroad.

816
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:02,451
But I believe

817
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:05,692
that it's quite pointless.

818
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:08,172
Many people

819
00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:11,492
see our generation as selfish,

820
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,972
rebellious and lacking in resolve

821
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:17,532
who'd give up and escape
when encountering

822
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,411
any difficulty.

823
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,052
I did everything my mom said

824
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,132
before I went to study abroad.

825
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,891
She would tell me when to get up,

826
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,371
what to eat,
and who to make friends with.

827
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:31,012
I had to obey her.

828
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:32,572
Then I failed the college entrance exam

829
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,612
and chose to study abroad.

830
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:35,972
My mom

831
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:38,092
sold the house we had

832
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,731
to support me.

833
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,972
But when I finally got there

834
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:43,451
where I couldn't speak

835
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,371
and couldn't fit into their culture,

836
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,291
I realized

837
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,172
that wasn't what I wanted.

838
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,931
I was only trying
to get away from my mom.

839
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,451
From then on,

840
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:54,371
I began to make new choices.

841
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:55,572
Starting from scratch,

842
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,931
I chose the life I wanted,

843
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,572
the courses I wanted,

844
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,532
and the friends I wanted.

845
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:03,172
I finally realized

846
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:06,931
one must make their own choices in life.

847
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:09,692
Studying abroad doesn't help you

848
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:11,851
or your children
bring glory to the family.

849
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:14,172
Nor can it secure
a career path for anyone.

850
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:15,492
However,

851
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,371
it can certainly
make your children tougher

852
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,052
so that they can face anyone

853
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,371
and anything

854
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:26,331
with great courage.

855
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:28,052
Most importantly,

856
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,972
it should be their choice,

857
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,012
and not an escape.

858
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:40,652
Come on.

859
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:41,411
Goodbye.

860
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:42,212
Thank you.

861
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:43,451
Thank you.

862
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:46,451
- Alright.
- Mr. Wang, please sign for me.

863
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:47,411
Here.

864
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:48,212
Thank you.

865
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:49,492
- Thanks, Mr. Wang.
- Goodbye.

866
00:37:49,972 --> 00:37:50,811
Want a photo?

867
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,972
- No, thanks.
- It's okay.

868
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:52,532
No, thanks.

869
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:53,331
No, thanks.

870
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,652
Mr. Wang.

871
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:58,371
Thank you.

872
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,811
I didn't expect you could make it.

873
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:02,532
Please don't thank me.

874
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,371
I owe you an apology.

875
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:07,692
My cousin is totally unreliable.

876
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:09,012
We almost made a mess.

877
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:11,132
Thankfully, we made it work.

878
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:13,891
Anyway, you're really one of a kind.

879
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,092
Other experts
present themselves as elites.

880
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:18,931
But you're willing
to share experiences of failure.

881
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:20,811
Reverse marketing.

882
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,532
It works really well.

883
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,731
It's not a strategy.

884
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,572
It's my life experience

885
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,851
and honest opinion.

886
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,052
Is it a bit negative?

887
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,132
No, not at all.

888
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,532
I used to find you mysterious.

889
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,291
And I was amazed by your speech today.

890
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:39,931
Anyway, I just can't

891
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,012
imagine you as that aloof handsome guy

892
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:43,172
in the bar.

893
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:46,251
Do you know each other?

894
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:30,092
What are you doing?

895
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:31,771
You contacted Yan Li?

896
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:33,851
Why do you care?

897
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,652
Of course, I care.

898
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,652
Apart from Yan Li, who else can

899
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,132
boss you around these days?

900
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:40,291
Get off.

901
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,012
We said it would be a fair competition.

902
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:44,172
I'm not getting off.

903
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,692
I'm coming with you.

904
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:47,612
Let's see who can

905
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:49,291
win over his heart.

906
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,771
You're like a plaster,

907
00:39:51,811 --> 00:39:53,451
always sticking around.

908
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:54,851
Think bigger.

909
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,291
Are you scared of competition?

910
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:58,092
Drive.

911
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:03,251
Dad.

912
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:05,291
I have some good news for you.

913
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,064
Let's eat something nice today, okay?

914
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:09,092
Okay.

915
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:14,291
Mom...

916
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,652
Don't be afraid, Mommy's here.

917
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:16,371
I'm here.

918
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:17,492
Mom.

919
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:18,612
Mommy's here.

920
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:19,771
Don't be scared.

921
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:20,972
Mom...

922
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,012
Dad, it's Guo.

923
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:22,851
Are you alright?

924
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,411
My leg.

925
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:25,371
What happened?

926
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:25,851
Come.

927
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:26,692
Get up.

928
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:27,212
Mom.

929
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:27,771
It's my fault.

930
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:28,371
Guo, are you okay?

931
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:29,931
I didn't mean to hit them.

932
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:31,451
- Mom.
- Are you okay?

933
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,291
I...

934
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,291
I'm fine.

935
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:34,851
Add me on WeChat.

936
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,931
Feel free to contact me at any time.

937
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:37,792
I will compensate you.

938
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:38,692
Wait.

939
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:39,931
You're going to run away?

940
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:41,371
Sir,

941
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:42,811
I have many orders to deliver.

942
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:43,771
I don't care.

943
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,572
Stay put.

944
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,731
Are you alright, Guo?

945
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:47,371
Stomp your feet.

946
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:48,492
This one.

947
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:50,092
And the arms?

948
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:51,052
Do they hurt?

949
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:54,012
Did you bump your head?

950
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:56,532
Mom, I'm fine.

951
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:05,172
I know you're in a hurry,

952
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,012
but you can't rush like that,

953
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,411
especially outside the kindergarten.

954
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,492
There are so many kids.
It's very dangerous.

955
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,532
Alright, you'd better get going.

956
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:17,811
You're letting him go?

957
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,532
It's alright. I'm fine.

958
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:20,931
Life is not easy for him.

959
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,572
Go on.

960
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:25,451
Thank you, it won't happen again.

961
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,411
Are you alright?

962
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,331
I think I'm fine.

963
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:34,371
Let me get you to the hospital.

964
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,731
No need for all that trouble.

965
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,251
It's no trouble.

966
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,291
It's better to be careful. Let's go.

967
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:48,851
Guo, let's go.

968
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:51,891
Give me your backpack.

969
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:55,532
He's inside. Please come with me.

970
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:56,212
Okay.

971
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,371
Hello, Mr. Yan Li.

972
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:24,012
I am an agent from Flying Bird Gallery.

973
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:25,052
My name is Gu Moli.

974
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:27,532
I didn't expect you to agree
to meet with us so soon.

975
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,052
It's my honor.

976
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:34,052
Hello, Mr. Yan.

977
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:34,848
I'm Mi Na,

978
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:36,572
Gu Moli's colleague.

979
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:43,331
Thank you.

980
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,132
Have some tea.

981
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:46,652
Okay.

982
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:01,092
I didn't invite you here.

983
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:02,811
Besides, I think

984
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,492
you've already disturbed us.

985
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:09,092
You must be Mr. Yan's assistant.

986
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:11,532
Didn't you confirm
the appointment with him?

987
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:14,172
I did.

988
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:17,291
I am his wife, Li Rui.

989
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,291
Sorry, Ms. Li Rui.

990
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,092
I-I didn't know. Sorry about that.

991
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:25,760
I apologize.

992
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,532
Mr. Yan.

993
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:28,931
You see, since we're here,

994
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:31,251
why don't we
talk about the collaboration?

995
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,012
Yeah, Mr. Yan.

996
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:35,492
You can set the terms as you like

997
00:43:35,492 --> 00:43:37,092
as long as you can join us.

998
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,731
Who said anything about working with you

999
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:42,331
