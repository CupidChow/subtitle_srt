19
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:54,972
My previous job

20
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,491
was very stressful.

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,851
We were often required
to work overtime and stay up late.

22
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,571
I got used to it.

23
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,371
No.

24
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:01,931
Please don't mention the former company

25
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,252
you worked for to me.

26
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:06,492
Don't pressure me with things
like tech giants in Shanghai

27
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,772
or anything of that sort.

28
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,692
We're a startup company.

29
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,692
No matter what experience
or qualifications

30
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:13,331
you had before,

31
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,652
they're all useless to me.

32
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,372
You've seen it.

33
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,891
Everyone here is young.

34
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:19,611
What we emphasize is competition.

35
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:20,812
In a word,

36
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,011
if you do well, you stay here.

37
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,252
If not, leave.

38
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,252
I think you might have misunderstood.

39
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,412
I don't take this company
as a place to relax.

40
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:29,291
Nor will I rely on seniority to coast.

41
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:31,092
The reason I chose it

42
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,372
is because I value that you're a startup

43
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,291
with great potential
and lots of opportunities.

44
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,571
Young and no internal strife.

45
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,492
It's easier for me
to show my capabilities.

46
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,571
Let me be frank.

47
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,932
Those so-called experiences
and qualifications I had before,

48
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,731
be they good or bad,

49
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,972
I've reset them all.

50
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,331
I am ready

51
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:53,932
to grow together with you.

52
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,252
Good.

53
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:05,252
We take on
outsourced software system jobs.

54
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:08,372
We are currently working on
an intelligent counter system for banks.

55
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,212
Completely different from
when you were working for

56
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,611
a big company on the client side.

57
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,972
From now on, you'll follow me.

58
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,171
I am your team leader.

59
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:15,812
Leader.

60
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,611
Let's go see your workstation.

61
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:26,131
This will be your workstation
from now on.

62
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,692
This one is a little separate.

63
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,331
Starting today,

64
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:36,291
you'll start with data collection work.

65
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:38,372
Leader,

66
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:39,532
data collection

67
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:41,972
is usually done by interns
who just graduated.

68
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,051
I mean nothing.

69
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,131
I just feel that my work

70
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:47,932
should be worthy of

71
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,812
the salary the company will pay me.

72
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:52,372
Aren't you a newcomer now?

73
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,652
Who just mentioned
starting from scratch?

74
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:56,891
That's true.

75
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:57,731
Right?

76
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,131
Yes.

77
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,092
Everyone.

78
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,932
Stop your work for a moment.

79
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,492
Let me introduce
a new colleague to everyone.

80
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,652
Zhu Jincao.

81
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,331
You can call him Zhu.

82
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,212
Hello, everyone.

83
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,776
(Restroom)

84
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,092
Welcome, all of you.

85
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:33,432
(Signing Ceremony)

86
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,611
Ladies and gentlemen,

87
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:40,251
today, we are fortunate
to have you here.

88
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,092
We're going to introduce

89
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,652
the promising artist we've just signed.

90
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,811
Ms. Gu Moli, please come.

91
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,291
Hello, everyone.

92
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,291
Although I've been
in the industry for many years,

93
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,171
I have always been an agent before.

94
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:23,491
It is a great honor

95
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,532
to meet so many painters, critics,

96
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:27,931
and curators today.

97
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,811
I'm grateful to the Flying Bird Gallery

98
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,611
and Mr. Zhou Yu.

99
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,092
We

100
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,892
will soon hold a solo exhibition

101
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,652
for Ms. Gu Moli.

102
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,291
I hope you'll come

103
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:48,572
and help spread the word.

104
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:49,811
Thank you.

105
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,532
Thank you, everyone.

106
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,212
Please do not hesitate to offer

107
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,452
your comments when the time comes.

108
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,452
Thank you.

109
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,251
Please feel free.

110
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,171
I'll introduce you to some people later.

111
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,051
Mr. Zhou.

112
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:31,532
Dr. Li.

113
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,291
Just a moment. Wait for me.

114
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,212
Liuliu,

115
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,851
one of my friends

116
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,772
is an international recruiter
of the Western Alliance.

117
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,491
They are looking for an expert

118
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,931
who understands Chinese students

119
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,652
and overseas consultation
for a long-term collaboration.

120
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,691
The expert will help with

121
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,611
the communication
between students and the school.

122
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,532
I think you are quite suitable,

123
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:53,491
so I've recommended you.

124
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,171
Are you interested?

125
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,532
Let me ask

126
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,652
how much the salary is.

127
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,051
Is it that serious?

128
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,332
She's been like this recently.

129
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:21,532
Don't worry. I'm here.

130
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:22,892
I can take good care of her.

131
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,772
This is really suffering.

132
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,132
Sorry about that.

133
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,491
Are you okay?

134
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:49,772
Yeah.

135
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,731
Stomach discomfort.

136
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,132
Have some water.

137
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,652
Do you not want to accept
my recommendation?

138
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,931
I really think you're quite suitable.

139
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,012
I will consider it seriously.

140
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,371
We will consider it seriously.

141
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:09,291
I'll come later.

142
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,132
Take your time.

143
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,211
Trust me.

144
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:16,171
I will make them impressed by you.

145
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,211
It's okay.

146
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,691
After being an agent for so many years,

147
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,492
I certainly understand it.

148
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,211
They haven't seen my work.

149
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,331
Their attitude
towards me is quite normal.

150
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,372
Besides, I don't care.

151
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,372
I only want to paint.

152
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:31,892
I've been acting

153
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,492
like a painter by your side these days.

154
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,252
I barely have time to paint.

155
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:37,211
I've been to so many banquets.

156
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,211
Has anyone seen my work?

157
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:41,811
Aren't they just
attracted here by your money?

158
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,171
You've been an agent for so many years.

159
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,811
Don't you know the rules yet?

160
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,291
Without capital backing

161
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:50,931
and pulling the strings,

162
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,852
making a name with just your work alone

163
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,211
is next to impossible.

164
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,252
Why not take the shortcut
if there is one?

165
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,732
Everything is business.

166
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,252
Art is no exception.

167
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:03,772
I don't disagree with what you said.

168
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,931
It needs proper marketing,

169
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,691
but the paintings
must have value themselves.

170
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,892
Don't put the cart before the horse.

171
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,252
It's admirable

172
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,012
how clear-headed you are.

173
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,091
My dad has been
in the art business for so many years.

174
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:16,652
Now, he has finally relented
and let me take over.

175
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,372
You are the first treasure I've nailed

176
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:19,732
after being deceived by Big Ai.

177
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,772
You represent me in front of my dad.

178
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,571
You've got to win some honor for me.

179
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,252
Let my dad know my judgment is sound.

180
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,652
I'll work hard.

181
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:31,051
Where are you going?

182
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,412
Didn't you just say so?

183
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:36,691
You've staked
your entire fortune and reputation.

184
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,652
How can I still continue to drink?

185
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:40,132
I need to go back to painting.

186
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,652
Thank you for valuing me.

187
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,612
But it's all about the actual work.

188
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,291
Yes.

189
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,451
You paint very well.

190
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:48,451
You do a great job painting.

191
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,571
You are an artist.

192
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:50,372
I promise.

193
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:52,051
This is the last time.

194
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,931
I will let you focus on
painting in the future.

195
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:55,652
Alright?

196
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:59,211
Now,

197
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,732
please follow me

198
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,652
and toast others one by one.

199
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,091
622, delivery, seven take-outs.

200
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,732
622, delivery.

201
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:21,892
Just give them to me.

202
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:25,732
Thanks.

203
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,132
Your take-outs have arrived.

204
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,051
Come and get them.

205
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,012
Okay.

206
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,811
Time to eat.

207
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,331
My dumplings.

208
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,492
What did you all order?

209
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,211
A preserved vegetable pancake.

210
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:42,331
What did you guys get?

211
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,252
This must be mine.

212
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:45,811
This one is mine.

213
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,211
This one's quite a bargain.

214
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:50,252
Bros,

215
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,171
I've joined a take-out coupon group.

216
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,931
There are daily discounts.

217
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,331
I got a 5-yuan discount on the noodles.

218
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,252
What group? Add me to it.

219
00:11:58,971 --> 00:11:59,892
Ding,

220
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:02,412
you were born into
a wealthy family after 2000.

221
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,171
Does this little money
even matter to you?

222
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,571
Ding, you were born after 2000?

223
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,532
Which year?

224
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:08,412
You guess.

225
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,252
Huang, can you stop teasing me again?

226
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:13,691
The house belongs to
my grandfather, not to me.

227
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,571
With my little salary,

228
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,412
I don't have much left
after paying off credit cards

229
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:17,772
and online loans every month.

230
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:18,811
Come on.

231
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,532
I can't even afford the rent.

232
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,211
I'm still living in the company dorm.

233
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:23,732
Huang, that's not right.

234
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:24,852
I remember

235
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,331
I introduced a woman to you.

236
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,772
She's from such a good family.

237
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:28,852
She could afford you a place.

238
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,051
Didn't you add her on WeChat?

239
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,451
Please don't mention that woman.

240
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:33,691
We met several times.

241
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,252
She said she didn't like my type

242
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,652
and told me to get plastic surgery.

243
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,211
How could I endure such hardship?

244
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,811
Moreover,

245
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,691
she hangs out in nightclubs every night.

246
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,492
We have nothing in common.

247
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,171
Leader, do you know anyone else
from the nightclub

248
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,252
that you can introduce to me?

249
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,012
Alright.

250
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,532
Or we can go to a nightclub next time.

251
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,931
I think that's a good idea.

252
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,532
Alright, enough.

253
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:55,691
No nightclub.

254
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,051
Haven't I already got you all

255
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,571
a way of entertainment
just like going to nightclubs?

256
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:01,412
What?

257
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,252
Working overtime continuously.

258
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,051
Have you stayed up?

259
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:06,811
Yes.

260
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:07,852
Have you got dark circles?

261
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:08,451
Yes.

262
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,652
Is your health collapsing?

263
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:10,372
Yes.

264
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,892
Are you feeling dizzy for several days?

265
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:13,492
Yes.

266
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,732
How good is that!

267
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:16,331
And you can still make money.

268
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,412
No wonder you're the team leader.

269
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:23,091
Bring me some chili sauce.

270
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:29,573
♪We need to know how to stay refreshed♪

271
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:37,718
♪The streets are crowded.
Time rushes by♪

272
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:45,788
♪Shadows dance
in the streetlamp's cold light♪

273
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,161
♪The story has just begun♪

274
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,252
♪Our simple days are ahead♪

275
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,091
What is this thing? It's all wet.

276
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,892
D-D-Don't touch my clothes.

277
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:58,691
They just got washed.

278
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,732
Zhu.

279
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,132
Turns out middle-aged people

280
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,612
do have the habit of soaking their feet.

281
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:25,971
Did you put goji berries in it?

282
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,772
I don't have that habit.

283
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,091
I haven't been sleeping well lately,

284
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,412
so I wanted to give it a try.

285
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,412
Okay, take your time.

286
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,652
As a senior, you have good habits.

287
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,691
Ke, I'm here.

288
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,652
(Daddy, why is it so messy there?)

289
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,732
Yes, it is.

290
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:03,732
I missed you.

291
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,091
Did you miss me?

292
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,892
You didn't keep your word.

293
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,051
Why haven't you video-called me
for several days?

294
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,252
I'm now living

295
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,331
with a few men.

296
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:15,412
Calling you at night

297
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,652
may disturb others' rest

298
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,091
and yours.

299
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,532
Let's turn off the main light.

300
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,412
(It attracts
so many mosquitoes every day.)

301
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:23,931
Daddy, who is talking?

302
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,331
Ke, wait a second.

303
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:29,612
Can you see me?

304
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,931
Yes.

305
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,811
Ke.

306
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:34,772
(Daddy is tired.)

307
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:35,811
(Let him rest.)

308
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,291
But I still want to talk
to Daddy for a little while.

309
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,532
Be good and say goodnight to Daddy.

310
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,372
Goodnight, Daddy.

311
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,571
(Goodnight, Ke.)

312
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:45,931
Come on.

313
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,012
(Moli.)

314
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:55,571
(How have you been lately?)

315
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:57,051
I'm alright.

316
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:00,571
You must be quite busy in Wuxi, right?

317
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,331
(I'll have Ke call you
less often in the future.)

318
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,892
(Take good care of yourself.)

319
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:05,971
Thanks.

320
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,012
You should take good care of
yourself too.

321
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,291
Something on your mind?

322
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,571
Drinking alone?

323
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:42,892
Why aren't you asleep yet?

324
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,852
Is it because Zhu Jincao
isn't doing well in Wuxi?

325
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:48,051
You were eavesdropping again.

326
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,211
Do I need to do that?

327
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,571
You are my child.

328
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:54,051
Your thoughts are all shown

329
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,852
on your face.

330
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,132
You're a painter now

331
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,451
with a good daughter.

332
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,051
Besides your ex-husband
who troubles you,

333
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,052
what else could keep you awake

334
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,531
and drinking alone at night?

335
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:08,372
I think he went to Wuxi

336
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,372
in a huff

337
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,372
just to avoid me.

338
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,531
I think he's rather self-aware.

339
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:18,251
He was reaching
above his station with you before,

340
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:20,812
and now he can't even do that.

341
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,251
He can only hide.

342
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:23,892
Sit down.

343
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,372
I have another question.

344
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:29,372
Last time,

345
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,572
Jiang Haitao drove you to Jinshan.

346
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,771
What's going on between you two?

347
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,211
Nothing.

348
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,812
What about Mr. Zhou?

349
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,531
The one called Yu or something?

350
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,691
What's going on?

351
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:41,451
Well.

352
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,531
I'm open-minded.

353
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,491
I don't oppose relationships
with younger men.

354
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,092
Mom,

355
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:48,412
if I don't get married in the future,

356
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:49,531
what would you think?

357
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:50,612
I support it.

358
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:51,731
Really?

359
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:52,812
Yeah.

360
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:00,892
Let me apologize to you.

361
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:02,372
I

362
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,011
shouldn't have put
your name on the dating site.

363
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,652
I did it just to spite Zhang Shanya.

364
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:08,691
It was irrational.

365
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,251
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

366
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,812
Life

367
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:17,092
has no fixed pattern.

368
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,171
As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

369
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:20,971
But

370
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,171
marriage is not a must.

371
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,052
A romantic relationship is a must.

372
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:28,332
If a woman is without love,

373
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:30,251
she will age quickly.

374
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,332
Wu Yulan,

375
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:35,372
you've grown up.

376
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,211
I am still young.

377
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,491
The wine is not as good as the last one.

378
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:57,560
(Bloom Alone)

379
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,011
Look at this red silk ribbon.

380
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,771
Doesn't it look like
some sort of ceremony?

381
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,451
It's just an art exhibition.

382
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,171
Getting so many people to attend.

383
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,132
I think this ceremony is unnecessary.

384
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,771
Come on.

385
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,287
(Bloom Alone)

386
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,412
I now announce

387
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:23,251
Bloom Alone,

388
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,251
the solo art exhibition of Ms. Gu Moli,

389
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,612
starts now.

390
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,491
Zhu, you gave me a fright.

391
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,412
The leader wanted
the trial version in three days.

392
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,092
You still have the leisure
to play games now.

393
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,451
I'm just taking a break
to refresh my mind.

394
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:02,691
I can't finish it anyway.

395
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:04,612
I-I-I plan to pull three all-nighters.

396
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,251
I'll help you with a part of it.

397
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,771
What about your work?

398
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:11,652
I'll stay up with you.

399
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:12,931
Only this time.

400
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:14,931
Thank you, Zhu.

401
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,491
The midnight snack
for the next three nights is on me.

402
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:19,771
I'll send it to you by email right away.

403
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,451
622, delivery.

404
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,092
I'm coming.

405
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,292
Just hand them to me.

406
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:26,491
Okay.

407
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:27,771
Thank you.

408
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,372
You're welcome.

409
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:33,652
Rice noodles with clams.

410
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,052
Your fried chicken.

411
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:36,652
Yes.

412
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,332
Eating alone?

413
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:37,852
Yes.

414
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:40,451
Pan-fried buns, right?

415
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:41,931
Good taste.

416
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:42,892
Thank you, Zhu.

417
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:43,771
Xu.

418
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:45,491
Zhang, this is yours.

419
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,852
Thank you, Zhu.

420
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,412
Zhu, you're amazing.

421
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,052
You've been here for days,

422
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,292
and you've remembered

423
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,451
everyone's taste.

424
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,691
In my previous department,

425
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:54,372
there were over ten,

426
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,612
and I remembered their taste clearly,

427
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:57,011
let alone the few of you.

428
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:57,812
Zhu,

429
00:20:58,531 --> 00:20:59,931
I've been wanting to ask you.

430
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:03,491
You used to be

431
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,211
a department leader in a big company.

432
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:09,092
Now you're working
with us rookies every day.

433
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,852
Doesn't that sting a little?

434
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,052
What's wrong with that?

435
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,132
I think you are much better
than those slickers.

436
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,892
At least everyone is a doer.

437
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,211
Zhu, you didn't order a drink, did you?

438
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:23,372
What's wrong?

439
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:24,251
I ordered two cups of milk tea.

440
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:24,691
Here you are.

441
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:25,332
I have a drink.

442
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,451
Let me give you one.

443
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,531
I can't drink sweet ones. Take it away.

444
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:28,011
Take it.

445
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:28,332
It's gonna spill.

446
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:28,812
Take it away.

447
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:29,171
It's gonna spill.

448
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,092
This is my work from five years ago.

449
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,372
Actually, these two paintings
are from the same series.

450
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:51,971
I wasn't actually that bold

451
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,451
when using colors back then.

452
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,372
Excuse me.

453
00:21:58,171 --> 00:21:59,092
Excuse me for a moment.

454
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:07,412
Did you see that?

455
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:09,211
It's only been an hour

456
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,812
and seven or eight paintings
have been sold.

457
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:12,132
Master,

458
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:13,491
how does it feel?

459
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:15,412
Like a dream.

460
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:16,892
Very unreal.

461
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,491
Get ready.

462
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,892
Soon, you will be loved by everyone.

463
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:22,612
Journalists, curators and critics

464
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:23,971
will be around you every day.

465
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,731
Believe me. You'll be busier and busier.

466
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:35,030
( Opening ceremony of Bloom Alone,
Gu Moli)

467
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:39,092
Mr. Yan,

468
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,771
thank you, and maybe
we'll talk again later.

469
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:42,292
You're welcome.

470
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:45,211
Mr. Yan Li, Ms. Li Rui.

471
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:48,092
Moli, congratulations.

472
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,372
Thank you, Ms. Li Rui.

473
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:50,971
Mr. Yan,

474
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:51,931
I'm so happy

475
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,332
that you came today.

476
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,812
Please feel free to give your comments.

477
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:57,332
I think

478
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,332
you are more suited to be my agent.

479
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:02,052
He means

480
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:04,491
he's not very satisfied with
his current agent.

481
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:05,812
I don't want that at all.

482
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:07,572
I understand.

483
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,412
Actually, seeing
these paintings hanging here

484
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:11,731
already makes me quite nervous.

485
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:13,731
You can criticize directly.

486
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:17,491
There's something new
about the paintings.

487
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,572
But they don't deserve such a fanfare.

488
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,332
Nor are they worth such a high price.

489
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:23,971
What are you talking about?

490
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:26,292
Gu Moli,

491
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:29,132
if you feel content now,

492
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:30,971
I think your artistic career

493
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,292
will end here.

494
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:34,731
What are you saying?

495
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,251
He is just like that.

496
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,812
Nothing good comes out of his mouth.

497
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,412
Moli, don't take it to heart, okay?

498
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:43,372
But

499
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:45,892
I'm truly happy for you
from the bottom of my heart.

500
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,332
I've seen all these paintings of yours,

501
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,731
and I think they're quite good.

502
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,412
Don't care about what others say.

503
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,332
Just paint what you want to
in your heart.

504
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:55,572
Use your brushes and canvases

505
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,652
to create the beautiful world
in your mind.

506
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:21,132
What are you doing here?

507
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,251
Your interview is today.

508
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:24,372
I came to keep you company.

509
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:25,132
No need.

510
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,572
I know Michael well.

511
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:27,812
I can help with your communication.

512
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,092
It's about time.

513
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,412
Michael doesn't like latecomers.

514
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,731
Thank you for your kindness.

515
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:38,691
I want to get the job
through my own ability

516
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:41,171
instead of my connections.

517
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,731
So...

518
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,211
You sit here.

519
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,251
Okay, I'll sit here.

520
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,211
You go.

521
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:09,412
Hello.

522
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:10,691
Moli.

523
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:11,892
Mr. Chen.

524
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:13,412
Congratulations.

525
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:14,971
Among us, you are the first one

526
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,211
to go from an agent
to a professional painter.

527
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:18,971
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

528
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,892
If you believe in me,

529
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:22,332
I want to be your agent.

530
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:25,731
Please don't joke with me.

531
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:26,852
I'm not joking.

532
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,011
If I were your agent,

533
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:29,971
the first thing I'd do

534
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,771
would be taking you away
from the Flying Bird Gallery.

535
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:35,852
Haven't you noticed?

536
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,171
Ever since Zhou Yu came,

537
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,171
the vibe of the gallery has changed.

538
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:41,531
Be careful.

539
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:55,412
(Okay.)

540
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:56,892
(Miss Liuliu,)

541
00:25:56,892 --> 00:25:59,011
(I'm almost done asking.)

542
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:01,572
(Your answers
about enrollment coordination)

543
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:04,292
(have satisfied me greatly.)

544
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,731
(One more thing.)

545
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,731
(In the admissions assessment,)

546
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,372
(in the mutual selection process
between the school and students,)

547
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:14,132
what do you think
the most important criterion is?

548
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:16,491
(It depends on)

549
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,612
(whether the school
can truly cultivate students.)

550
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,652
In China, this is
called "educating people".

551
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,771
("Educating people".)

552
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,531
(Oh, my gosh!)

553
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,251
(You don't take the school's side.)

554
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,412
That's not what I meant.

555
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:33,372
Compared to the school,

556
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:35,171
students are the more vulnerable group.

557
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:38,412
If I find an excellent student applying,

558
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,652
but they are better suited
for another school,

559
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,372
I would suggest they reconsider.

560
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:46,011
Because the essence
of education is to nurture talent

561
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,011
not merely to make a profit.

562
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:53,292
(That's why I chose this industry.)

563
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,731
(I can't sacrifice justice for profit.)

564
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:00,691
Perfect.

565
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,612
Miss Liuliu is the only one

566
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:07,011
who gave me this answer.

567
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:09,771
(Leo's got a good eye for talent.)

568
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:11,332
(Okay.)

569
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,211
(So, Miss Liuliu,)

570
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:15,211
we need you to go
to the United States for training

571
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:16,292
in three months

572
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,931
and then you'll officially
assume your position.

573
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,852
Can you do that?

574
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:23,211
I'm sorry.

575
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,011
I thought

576
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,852
I would be working
at the China office of the company.

577
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:30,892
I didn't know I had to go
to the United States.

578
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,491
I can't do it.

579
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,292
(What?)

580
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:35,171
(Why?)

581
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,691
(You're so eager to work with us,)

582
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,852
and now you say you can't do it?

583
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,612
Moreover, three months
is already a generous timeframe.

584
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:45,052
I didn't say you had to leave tomorrow.

585
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:46,572
(Anyway,)

586
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,691
(please give me a reasonable reason.)

587
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:52,171
Sorry, this is my privacy.

588
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,052
(I can't explain.)

589
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,292
(Michael.)

590
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,812
(Liuliu is pregnant.)

591
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,132
Could you please reschedule it?

592
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,372
She is worth waiting for.

593
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:07,491
Wang Lingxiao, what are you saying?

594
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,052
How did you know I was pregnant?

595
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,211
Is that why you recommended me

596
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,092
for the job?

597
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:15,251
I didn't mean it.

598
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:16,892
I recommended you
because you are excellent

599
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:17,931
and suitable.

600
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,332
Sit. It's not over yet.

601
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:21,931
Sit.

602
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:22,652
(Hello.)

603
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,011
(Excuse me.)

604
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:28,531
(I didn't know Leo was there.)

605
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:29,892
(Well,)

606
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:31,092
(I'll leave you to argue.)

607
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:32,332
I can wait.

608
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:33,612
But

609
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,211
after the argument,

610
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:36,971
remember to give me a result.

611
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,691
(Leo, good luck.)

612
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:41,812
Liuliu.

613
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:44,852
Bye, I'm hanging up.

614
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,652
I am the father of the baby,

615
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,731
but it's also true
that you're qualified for the position.

616
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,892
And why didn't you tell me
you are pregnant?

617
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,412
I have the right to know.

618
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,251
At least tell me.

619
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,572
We could have discussed it.

620
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:02,652
I don't know

621
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,531
how you found out about this thing.

622
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:06,011
Please be at ease.

623
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,572
Don't feel any burden.

624
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,691
Keeping the baby is my own choice.

625
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,292
He is a gift bestowed upon me by God.

626
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,132
Thank you.

627
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:20,132
And say thank you
to your friend, Michael.

628
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:22,531
Tell him

629
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,812
I'm giving up the position.

630
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,251
You haven't left yet?

631
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:45,771
Because you don't want to?

632
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,332
I want to ask you a question.

633
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,011
I hope you will answer me truthfully.

634
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:52,812
Do it.

635
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:58,011
Why did you choose me?

636
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,011
Because

637
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:05,011
I have feelings for you.

638
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,771
Can you be serious?

639
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:10,251
It is only a professional relationship.

640
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:11,412
Now listen,

641
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:15,531
because

642
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:17,171
I see myself

643
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:18,852
in you.

644
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,332
After I returned
from studying in the UK,

645
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,251
my father kept looking down on me.

646
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:29,491
He thinks I'm nothing without him.

647
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,251
But I don't agree.

648
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,451
I want to rely on
my own resources and connections,

649
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:36,211
on myself alone.

650
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,211
Even if it's just

651
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:40,171
one accomplishment,

652
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:42,132
I want to prove to him

653
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:44,691
I have a good eye,

654
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,852
a unique aesthetic

655
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,691
and an artistic sense.

656
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:50,731
It just so happens

657
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,572
that you too lack
connections and backing.

658
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,292
You also yearn for success.

659
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,691
We both start from scratch.

660
00:30:57,612 --> 00:30:58,731
We're in this together.

661
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,011
So I chose you.

662
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:05,971
Thank you.

663
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,011
I will show your dad

664
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,852
your choice is the right one.

665
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:13,892
You too.

666
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,372
But

667
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,852
ask fewer questions

668
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,572
and focus on your painting later.

669
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:24,011
Here you are.

670
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,372
What is this?

671
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:27,931
Payment for your paintings.

672
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:29,852
We agreed on a 20-80 split,

673
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:31,731
80% for the gallery, 20% for you.

674
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:33,572
Are you okay with it?

675
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,771
Go by the contract.

676
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:38,451
Very good.

677
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:40,011
This is just the first payment.

678
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,691
1,048,000.

679
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:43,771
How much?

680
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,572
Don't look surprised.

681
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,052
This is nothing compared to

682
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:49,852
what you'll get by following me.

683
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:52,011
Let's have a drink.

684
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:07,332
Gu Moli.

685
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:10,491
1,048,000.

686
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:12,132
I didn't expect it either.

687
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,132
Mom, I am confident
that I will soon pay you back the money

688
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,572
you and Dad gave me for the apartment.

689
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,412
Who's asking you to pay it back?

690
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,332
Thank God.

691
00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:23,812
My daughter is a great painter now.

692
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,691
In our large armoire,

693
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:26,372
the cabinet

694
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,451
and under the bed

695
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:28,451
are your old paintings.

696
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:30,132
I will take good care of them.

697
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:32,412
In the future, they will be heirlooms.

698
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:35,211
Grandma, what are heirlooms?

699
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:38,211
Your mom's paintings
are very valuable now.

700
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,011
Why are you even happier than I am?

701
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:50,092
Ke.

702
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:51,852
Wait a moment.

703
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,011
Ke, can you hear me now?

704
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:03,171
(Yes.)

705
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,971
(Dad, let me tell you.)

706
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:06,852
(Mom's paintings have been sold.)

707
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,731
She's now a great painter.

708
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:10,292
She made a lot of money.

709
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,931
Over 1,000,000.

710
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,691
(That much?)

711
00:33:14,011 --> 00:33:15,612
(Your mom's paintings
are that valuable?)

712
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:17,211
(Yeah.)

713
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:20,491
(Look, the money is in here.)

714
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:21,892
(Ke, be good.)

715
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,612
(Hurry up. Grandma will bathe you.)

716
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:24,531
(Go to bed early.)

717
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:26,052
Bye, Dad.

718
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:27,092
(Bye, Ke.)

719
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:31,931
(You really made that much?)

720
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:34,451
It is just the first payment.

721
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,372
(1,048,000.)

722
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,372
(There are more later.)

723
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:39,812
Congratulations

724
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,052
on your successful cooperation

725
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,372
and prosperous opening

726
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:43,652
with Mr. Zhou.

727
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,451
I didn't tell you about this in advance.

728
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:49,531
Do you not want me
to collaborate with Zhou Yu?

729
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:50,531
No.

730
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:53,292
I just want to remind you

731
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,971
to be cautious.

732
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,852
(The money came too easily.)

733
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,011
(Things that go too smoothly)

734
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,812
(tend to have some issues.)

735
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,691
What do you mean?

736
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,171
Do you not want me to become a painter

737
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,812
(or do you not want my paintings
to sell at a good price?)

738
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,332
(Why are you getting
more and more intolerant?)

739
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,412
Is this how you see me now?

740
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:15,931
I'm kindly reminding you,

741
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,732
and you just can't stand
to hear me tell the truth?

742
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:20,412
Thanks for the warning.

743
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:21,812
By the way,

744
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:24,332
you don't need to rush into
selling your apartment.

745
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:26,131
I can support Ke by myself.

746
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:29,011
I'm going to give Ke a bath.

747
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:31,131
Good night.

748
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:00,091
This way, Mr. Xie.

749
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,571
Mr. Xie, this is our office.

750
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,292
Let's head straight to the meeting room.

751
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:07,971
Mr. Xie,

752
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,011
since you have arrived earlier,

753
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,011
could you please rest
for a while in the meeting room

754
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,931
and give us ten minutes to prepare?

755
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:17,131
We will start right away in ten minutes.

756
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:17,732
Okay.

757
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:18,252
Please.

758
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,292
Come on.

759
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,611
This way.

760
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:27,692
Later,

761
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,852
we'll proceed according to
the plan we set earlier.

762
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,172
I'll give the main report,

763
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,491
and you guys take care of the rest.

764
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:32,931
Is that okay?

765
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,531
Okay.

766
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,172
Leader,

767
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:36,451
the system we're about to report

768
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:37,812
has flaws.

769
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:39,212
What kind of flaws?

770
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:40,332
Take a look.

771
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,571
The system now only
verifies the data submitted

772
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,611
by the client through annotations.

773
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,651
But it cannot confirm
that it is the user's own actions.

774
00:35:46,732 --> 00:35:48,212
The technical experts
will surely question

775
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,531
whether we can ensure
the legality of our data sources

776
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:52,011
and think it would pose a great threat

777
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:53,332
to the security of the entire system.

778
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:58,772
It seems he's right.

779
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:01,131
What's going on with you two?

780
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:03,931
Didn't I ask you two
to test it repeatedly?

781
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:08,172
Leader, didn't you ask us

782
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:10,852
to reduce user login wait time?

783
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,091
Reducing wait time

784
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:13,931
doesn't mean lowering security.

785
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,412
I'm not in charge
of the security module.

786
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:16,971
It's Skinny.

787
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:17,692
I'll go get him.

788
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:18,372
Come on.

789
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:19,571
What time is it already?

790
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:21,011
And you're still passing the buck?

791
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,412
Mr. Xie is right inside right now.

792
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,812
I'm about to go in
and report on my work.

793
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,852
If it falls through, we'll all go unpaid.

794
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:28,292
Leader, give me some time to prepare.

795
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,531
I'll talk to him later.

796
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,812
C-C-Can you?

797
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:32,531
Sure.

798
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:34,571
Come on.

799
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,531
You two.

800
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,491
How long has it been
since you had a full meal?

801
00:36:42,772 --> 00:36:43,772
Take your time.

802
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,172
I'll order more for you later.

803
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,611
It's clear that the company
isn't doing so well.

804
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:48,692
Don't mention it.

805
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,212
I've never even gotten a salary.

806
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:53,292
Besides,

807
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:55,292
it's the startup phase.

808
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,491
A bit of hardship is normal.

809
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:01,292
So,

810
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,571
there's an urgent need
for investment, right?

811
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:08,892
Investment...

812
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:12,852
I have no grudge against money,

813
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,451
but Liuliu has a bone to pick with you.

814
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:21,892
You pretend to be pretty smart usually.

815
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,292
How come you become so foolish
at critical moments?

816
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:25,892
Why are you going to mention me?

817
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:28,451
Just tell her you got an investor.

818
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:32,011
I'm not gonna in it for the money.

819
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,051
Tell me first

820
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:34,491
what the conditions are.

821
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,531
It's simple.

822
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:38,651
You just need to report to me regularly

823
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:40,091
on Liuliu's health condition.

824
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,051
That's betrayal for gain...

825
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,571
I am the investor.

826
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:44,051
I have the right to be informed, right?

827
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:45,571
You are the investor, but...

828
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:47,611
Investors

829
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:50,332
should be informed.

830
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,412
We do

831
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:58,892
need it now.

832
00:37:59,292 --> 00:37:59,971
Deal.

833
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,172
It's all for the company.

834
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:13,752
According to the aforementioned flaws,

835
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,172
(Bank smart counter system security)
we have made four remediation plans.

836
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:18,812
The first one is to introduce
facial recognition algorithms

837
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,332
for stronger login verification.

838
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:20,852
The second is

839
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:23,692
to add prevention against XSS attacks.

840
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,732
The third is to conduct legal checks

841
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,091
based on product requirements.

842
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:29,692
The fourth
is to use URL escape characters.

843
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,892
Because you changed the reporting time,

844
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:35,011
our plan is not yet perfected.

845
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,051
The aforementioned remediation plans

846
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:38,692
were supposed to be added today.

847
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,332
Mr. Xie,

848
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:42,732
let me introduce him.

849
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:44,611
This is Zhu Jincao.

850
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:47,332
A highly paid talent we recruited

851
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:48,531
from a Shanghai tech giant

852
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,332
with extensive experience in management

853
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:52,451
and technology.

854
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:56,172
He is now mainly in charge of
the security module.

855
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,451
He is our rock.

856
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,732
I am basically satisfied

857
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,491
with your report today.

858
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:06,812
Payment security

859
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,451
has always been the most critical aspect
of the banking system,

860
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:10,732
because it is directly related to

861
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:12,332
the safety of customers' assets.

862
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:15,451
We just experienced an incident

863
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:17,131
involving money laundering
with artworks.

864
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:19,212
It was right because of
a vulnerability in payment security

865
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:19,971
that the criminals

866
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,931
found an opportunity.

867
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:23,131
For this reason,

868
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,852
the Banking Regulatory Commission
has launched

869
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:26,611
anti-money laundering initiatives.

870
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:30,011
This issue is not to be taken lightly.

871
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:33,560
I do appreciate

872
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,491
your professionalism

873
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:37,372
and serious attitude.

874
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:48,051
Thanks.

875
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:49,172
Mr. Xie,

876
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:51,852
may I ask you a question?

877
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:52,971
Go ahead.

878
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,531
If the works of an artist

879
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:57,292
get sold for a price

880
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:59,091
far higher than they should be

881
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:00,332
based on the artist's fame and level,

882
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:03,292
can the act be suspected
of money laundering?

883
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,772
It's possible.

884
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:05,692
What's wrong?

885
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:07,531
Nothing, I was just asking.

886
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,611
How can I know
if they're laundering money?

887
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:11,531
There are several ways.

888
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:12,292
First,

889
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:13,931
check

890
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,531
whether the buyer is using
a personal account

891
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:17,292
or an entity account.

892
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:19,011
Also, check

893
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:20,732
whether they appear on

894
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:22,971
the list presented
by the Anti-Money Laundering Center

895
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:25,412
and whether the institution's owner

896
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:26,772
along with their family members,

897
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:27,892
(Decong Art (Shanghai) Co., LTD)
(are involved in)

898
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:30,332
(Illegal commercial activity.)

899
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,651
(Another method is)

900
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:35,252
(analyzing the shareholding structure.)

901
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:43,096
Organizing cultural and art transactions
and conducting art-related...

902
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:45,976
(The history of Zhou Congde's fortune)

903
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,939
(Art has become a tool for money laundering,
corruption and financing)

904
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:15,732
That was amazing.

905
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:17,732
I was dumbfounded.

906
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:20,372
Why is this door open?

907
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:27,852
Zhu.

908
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:30,971
What happened?

909
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:32,451
You worked all night?

910
00:41:32,772 --> 00:41:34,131
You make us feel inadequate.

911
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:35,412
You're such a go-getter.

912
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,051
Morning.

913
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:41,692
Morning.

914
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:42,692
- Morning.
- Morning.

915
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:43,451
Leader.

916
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:45,332
Zhu had a night of hard work yesterday.

917
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:46,212
Really?

918
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:48,451
Look at him.

919
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:49,812
Learn from him.

920
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:52,571
I have an announcement to make.

921
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:54,812
I'm entrusting Zhu with the task

922
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,172
of completing the security module.

923
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,051
Huang, Ding, you must fully cooperate.

924
00:41:58,051 --> 00:41:58,772
- Yes.
- Yes.

925
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:08,531
Leader.

926
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,491
Zhu, your salary will be increased
to 35,000 next month.

927
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,372
Well.

928
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,531
I need to take a leave.

929
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:14,571
Taking leave.

930
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:18,292
How long will you be taking off?

931
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,892
I don't know how long I will be gone.

932
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,812
Come on, Zhu.

933
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:24,372
I just praised you
yesterday to our client.

934
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:24,892
You've become

935
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:26,011
complacent?

936
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,212
Who said

937
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,531
to start from scratch?

938
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:30,451
Now the company can't do without you.

939
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:31,292
I'm sorry.

940
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:33,131
I must take this leave.

941
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:34,212
Let me tell you.

942
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:35,372
We don't have any leave here.

943
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:37,491
Either you wait
until this project is over

944
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,292
and we all rest together,

945
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:41,451
or else you resign.

946
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,852
I'm sorry.

947
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:47,451
I resign.

948
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:51,332
Zhu, you...

949
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:00,531
Wait, this...

950
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:09,372
Zhu, you...

951
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:17,091
I've had a pleasant time
with everyone these days.

952
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:20,412
I hope it won't affect your work.

953
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:22,491
Hope we will meet again.
