20
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:03,914
What's wrong with your hand?

21
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:07,555
Nothing. I just pricked my finger
while hanging the painting.

22
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:08,875
Wait a moment.

23
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:27,634
Here, I'll take care of that for you.

24
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:30,914
Don't bother.

25
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,155
Just give me an alcohol swab.

26
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:47,995
How do I connect your printer?

27
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:51,835
Well, charge your phone.

28
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,675
I'll add you on WeChat,
and you can send me the file.

29
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,875
I'll print it out for you.

30
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:00,835
Don't worry. I won't bother you.

(Moli)

32
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,155
You really surprised me.

33
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:22,395
I can't believe you go alone
to a client's house to hang paintings.

34
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:25,034
Considering
your previously proud character

35
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,754
and the soul of an artist,

36
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,835
how is it possible to do such things?

37
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,395
How did you convince yourself?

38
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:34,675
Time. Time changes everything.

39
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,914
I used to be too aloof.

40
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,794
I thought as an art dealer,

41
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,354
it's enough as long as I have vision,
understand the market and the artists,

42
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,715
and give clients
professional explanations.

43
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,835
Then I realized I was so out of touch.

44
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,995
Art dealers are actually sales.

45
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,194
It's all about selling the paintings.

46
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:54,395
What about your past artistic pursuits
and dreams of being an artist?

47
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,954
I didn't give up.

48
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,474
Every day, when I come home
after working outside,

49
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:01,875
I'd calm down and paint a picture,

50
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,275
which is the happiest time of my day.

51
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:08,995
That's pretty good.

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,754
Pretty good.

53
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,074
Actually, I've been wanting
to ask you something.

54
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,594
What is it?

55
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,394
Did you get a divorce?

56
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,394
How did you know?

57
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,315
You forget that Yan Li
and I are good friends.

58
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,875
I can still get some information.

59
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:42,594
Yes, we got the divorce certificate.

60
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,834
But I'm still in a good place
with Jincao.

61
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,475
Is my contract printed out?

62
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,795
My phone's almost fully charged.
I have to go.

63
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,074
In duplicate.

64
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,995
The contract is confidential.

65
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,795
Please delete the file for me,
thank you.

66
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:27,954
I grew up
with the protection of my parents,

67
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:31,714
the companionship of my friends
and the care of my partner.

68
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,555
It wasn't until the strategic divorce
that I realized

69
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:39,594
that there are no
unbreakable relationships in this world,

70
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:42,194
and no one will be with you forever.

71
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,355
Loneliness is a problem
that everyone has to face.

72
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:51,834
Only when you get used to loneliness
do you truly grow up.

73
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:56,355
Compared to a life
where others influence your emotions,

74
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:59,394
maybe you'd prefer to be alone.

75
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,555
Eating alone,

76
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,274
watching movies alone,

77
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,514
walking alone,

78
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,315
and traveling alone.

79
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,915
Go wherever you want to,
and stay whenever you want to.

80
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:16,514
Though I may feel helpless,
I can still lead a wonderful life.

(The Wonderfulness of Being Single)

82
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,315

83
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,035
Let's set it up.

84
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:44,235
Moli does have some slight problems,

85
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,594
but nothing major.

86
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,834
Disrespectful to elders,

87
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,714
having dinner with anyone,

88
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,194
and taking pictures with anyone.

89
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,834
Nothing major?

90
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,355
After all, she is Ke's mom.

91
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,274
We have to do the best for the child.

92
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:59,154
Right? She's devoted to the child.

93
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,514
Precisely because of Ke,

94
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:02,475
I don't allow her to get in our family.

95
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:05,074
She dressed up gorgeously all day long.

96
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,355
I don't want her to lead Ke astray.

97
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:10,435
The Zhu family cannot
afford to lose this face.

98
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,074
Zhang Shanya.

99
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,915
You've been defending Gu Moli somehow.

100
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,394
What do you mean?

101
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:26,954
Ke's Grandpa.
When talking about the marriage,

102
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,174
people always encourage reconciliation
rather than separation.

103
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:32,594
These two kids don't have
any fundamental problems.

104
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:34,435
Besides, their relationship
was based on free love.

105
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:37,394
They have a good relationship, right?

106
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:39,315
Once divorced, that's it.

107
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,754
I don't like Gu Moli.

108
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,315
If they want to remarry,

109
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:46,555
she has to admit her mistakes
to me, and then to Jincao.

110
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,635
Ke's Grandpa.

111
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:55,714
I don't think Moli is to blame
for their divorce.

112
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:57,474
We're both to blame.

113
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,635
Do you mean I caused the divorce?

114
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,795
Well, you do have some responsibility.

115
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,435
Ever since you got here,

116
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,594
you've been busy setting rules.

117
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,155
And you drove Moli away.

118
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,834
You escalated the conflict.

119
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:23,874
I'm telling you,
I'm always in charge in this house.

120
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,435
(If I just barge in there now,)

00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,635
(Jincao, Ke's Grandma, Ke's Grandpa,)

122
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,234
(might all lose face.)

123
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:16,234
(In that case, it would be worse.)

124
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,515
(I installed cameras at home)

125
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,194
(for monitoring the housekeeper)

126
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,874
(not to hurt the kid.)

127
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,954
(Fortunately,
Jincao insists on letting it turn on.)

128
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:32,834
(and now it's time to come in handy.)

129

130
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,742
(Moli)

131
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:16,755
I hung up on you because
I didn't want to take your call.

132
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,354
Don't you know this rule?

133
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:19,354
Ke's Grandpa.

134
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,675
Please come downstairs immediately.
I have something to talk to you.

135
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:25,074
I don't have time to talk to you.

136
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,714
Please do as I say.

137
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,994
Otherwise,
you will bear the consequences.

138
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,354
I'm here.

139
00:11:57,354 --> 00:11:59,435
Why did you invite me here?

140
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:01,834
48 yuan for a cup of coffee.

141
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,994
Being the sucker.

142
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:07,114
Is there anything you can't say at home?

143
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,994
Why did you hit Ke's Grandma?

144
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,635
What did you say?

145
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:14,555
I said, "why did you hit her?"

146
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,354
Don't leave.

147
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:22,795
I wouldn't have invited you here
without any proof.

148
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,474
Gu Moli.

149
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:33,994
You are not
my daughter-in-law anymore,

150
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,315
but you should know
the rules of the Zhu family.

151
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:40,795
You can't talk to me like this.

152
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,594
Answer me. Why did you hit Ke's Grandma?

153
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,234
Stop acting like you did nothing wrong.

154
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,954
Your wife and kids are your closest kin.

155
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,074
How could you bear
to lay a hand on them?

156
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:04,675
You're no longer Jincao's wife now.

157
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:09,555
Even if you're not divorced,
it's not your place

158
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,795
speaking ill of me.

159
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:13,755
Do you know
that domestic violence is illegal?

160
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,594
If you dare to hit Ke's Grandma again,

161
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,194
I will tell Jincao.

162
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:19,155
How dare you!

163
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:22,035
What are you going to do?
Are you going to hit me?

164
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,675
If you hit me, I will call the police.

165
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,994
This is a public place,
so many people are watching.

166
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,954
The police can come and gather evidence.

167
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,795
Did you say anything to Gu Moli?

168
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,795
Nothing.

169
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,954
Really?

170
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,275
Really.

171
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:25,234
Then how does she know
everything about our family?

172
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,675
Ke told her?

173
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:31,954
Ke?

174
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:42,635
Let me tell you, keep your mouth shut.

175
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:46,635
Gu Moli is no longer
one of our Zhu family,

176
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:50,114
so don't ever meet her again.

What's wrong with you?

182
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,035
You don't answer my calls
or reply to my messages.

183
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,475
Do you have some mistress?

184
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,315
If I have a mistress,

185
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,594
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

186
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:10,555
Enough. How did you
become so slick after going to Jinshan?

187
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:13,354
No, I've been working overtime.

188
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,354
I just got back.

189
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,874
I went to the toilet and didn't hear it.

190
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:19,674
Why are you always working overtime
after you went to Jinshan?

191
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,275
The work is so intense?

192
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,874
You are not a working machine.

193
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,795
Do you think being sent out
is for retirement?

194
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,154
They are treating us
like working machines.

195
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:32,434
I wish I could achieve something
as soon as possible, so I could go home.

196
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:33,674
No way.

197
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,715
A house is not a necessary to me,
but I can't do without a husband.

198
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:38,035
How about this?

199
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:39,755
Come back if you really can't make it.

200
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,434
I can't do so
after being here for just two days.

201
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,354
Ke's birthday is on the weekend.

202
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:47,874
I will definitely get back this weekend.

203
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,755
Isn't that still two days away?

204
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,555
Two days will pass soon.

205
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,235
That's it. Goodnight, honey.

206
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,995
Do you like the dress I picked for you?

207
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,035
It's pretty. I like this dress.

208
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,594
Baby, you can go swing by yourself.

209
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,154
Okay.

210
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:25,715
Go ahead.

211
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:29,154
Ke, happy birthday!

212
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:30,594
Thank you, grandma.

213
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,154
Be careful.

214
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:35,674
This child...

215
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,434
Is your hand okay?

216
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:46,354
It's fine. I just broke a plate,

217
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:48,394
and got a cut.

218
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,674
It'll heal in a couple of days,
not a big deal.

219
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:55,394
Moli.

220
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:57,035
I want to ask you.

221
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,154
When you came back the other day

222
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,315
and took your personal items
from the closet,

223
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,634
did you touch anything else?

224
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:07,874
I did.

225
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:12,154
I turned on a protective device.

226
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:13,874
Protective device?

227
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,434
You don't need to know.

228
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:20,035
Anyway, with it, you'll be safer.

229
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,955
Have you told Jincao about it?

230
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:35,874
No, this is what I think.

231
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,074
Jincao is busy with work
and lives so far away.

232
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,154
I don't want to worry him
with things at home.

233
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,995
Right.

234
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:49,315
Don't worry him with things at home.

235
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,114
Ke's Grandma, after taking Ke
for her birthday today,

236
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,195
I'll take her to my parents.

237
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,634
They all miss her.

238
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,874
Okay, this is Ke's stuff.

239
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:08,715
Well, I know your mom likes
braised pork with preserved vegetables.

240
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:12,315
I made it for her. Take it.

241
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,275
Thank you, Ke's Grandma.

242
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,555
I'm leaving then.

243
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:34,394
Moli, you and Ke
go to the restaurant first.

244
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,955
I've already ordered the cake.

245
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,914
I checked the traffic and I'll be
half an hour behind you at most.

246
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:39,634
Alright.

247
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,154
Mr. Zhu, are you in a hurry to go back
to be with your wife and kid?

248
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,154
Are you envious?

249
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:47,154
Zhu Jincao,
where are you heading off to?

250
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,555
Mr. Bai, I'm going back home.

251
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:49,434
Don't go back.

252
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,674
Work overtime tonight and this weekend,

253
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,594
to make the marketing plan.

254
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,315
Liu Zhi and the others
have already worked on it.

255
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,154
Well. I haven't gone back for a week.

256
00:20:57,275 --> 00:21:00,114
My home is in Hangzhou,
and I haven't been back in a month.

257
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:03,874
Mr. Bai. It's my daughter's
birthday today.

258
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:06,555
I didn't go home for my wife's birthday.

259
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,475
Which one is important,
birthday or career?

260
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:11,555
Jincao, I know you are here
to upgrade your resume.

261
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,634
You'll go back to headquarters
for a promotion later.

262
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,074
If you don't achieve anything
in these years...

263
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,434
Leave after work
and go home on weekends.

264
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:20,834
If you're going to just
muddle through like this,

265
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:23,235
do you think you can smoothly
return to headquarters

266
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,795
and get a promotion?

267
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:25,874
Excuse me, Mr. Bai.

268
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:26,755
What's going on?

269
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,674
We are working overtime today.
I have to treat my colleagues well.

270
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,755
Mr. Bai, Jincao, let's eat together.

271
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:33,834
Wait for me.

272
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,594
Alright.

273
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:38,795
See.

274
00:21:56,594 --> 00:22:00,715
Mom, is this cake tasty?

275
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,594
You'll find out later.

276
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:05,555
When will Dad arrive?

277
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:07,874
He will arrive soon. He's on his way.

278
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,475
Is this Princess Elsa pretty?

279
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,315
Yes.

280
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:35,834
Where are you?

281
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:39,594
There's a greedy cat
staring at the cake and drooling.

282
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:42,834
Honey, I have some bad news.

283
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,315
I'm still at the office
and I have to work overtime.

284
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:48,914
What? Do you mean
you can't come back today?

285
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,475
I was about to get on the elevator,
but Mr. Bai stopped me

286
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,914
and asked me to work overtime.

287
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,235
He even said he didn't
go back for his wife's birthday.

288
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,955
What can I say? I'm sorry, honey.

289
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:24,834
Mom, how long before Dad gets here?

290
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,434
Ke, tell me.

291
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,315
Have you ever had a father-daughter day

292
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:34,235
with your dad without me?

293
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,114
Yes.

294
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:41,394
Then I also want to have
a mother-daughter day without Dad.

295
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,515
Okay? It's today.

296
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:49,275
Ke is the best. Is it okay?

297
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,955
Okay.

298
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,265
(Honey)

299
00:24:01,914 --> 00:24:04,074
Why are you calling
when you can't come back?

300
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:05,555
I just got Ke to calm down.

Blow out the candles.

00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:31,275
Thank you, Dad.

Happy birthday, Ke.

(Hua Family Apartments)

316
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:02,315
Don't worry.
I told Ke I didn't want you back.

317
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:04,755
We just had a mother-daughter day.

318
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:06,515
She's not mad at you.

319
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:07,955
You are so smart.

320
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:11,715
When I come back,
I'll make it up to you and Ke.

321
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:14,315
You went to Jinshan, not San Francisco.

322
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:16,315
Why is it so hard to get back once?

323
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:18,874
Indeed. You don't know.

324
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:23,434
Since I came here, I have not invited
my colleagues and leaders to a meal.

325
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:26,834
If I don't build good relationships
and work hard here,

326
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,555
how can I get promoted quickly?

327
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,275
And how can I get back
without a promotion?

328
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,515
Alright. Stop complaining.

329
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,874
I know work is important.

330
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:37,674
I just missed you
and made a few complaints.

331
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:39,154
Thank you for understanding.

332
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:41,795
Honey, listen.

333
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:43,394
Go ahead.

334
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:46,275
I went back to see
Ke's Grandma the other day.

335
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,275
I found it's just as you said.

336
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,995
Ke's Grandpa and Ke's Grandma
don't talk to each other at home.

337
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,795
If this goes on for a long time,
it's not right.

338
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:59,755
I thought to enroll Ke's Grandma
in the elderly university.

339
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,074
My mom's doing great
at the elderly university.

340
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:07,035
There are a lot of elderlies
with the same interests.

341
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:09,154
My mom attends the elderly university?

342
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,154
Right.

343
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:14,074
I don't think she'd agree.

344
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,235
What do you mean?

345
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:17,755
So you mean

346
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:20,795
she was born to cook and do the laundry?

347
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,594
She gave up her hobbies

348
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:24,795
for the family.

349
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:27,154
Find something for her to do.

350
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,795
That's better than her
staying with Ke's Grandpa

351
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,674
and not talking
to each other in the house.

352
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:33,275
Well, tomorrow,

353
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,955
I'll call my mom and ask her.

354
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,354
No need. Just listen to me.

355
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,035
You just do it before you tell her.

356
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:46,235
Is my mom okay?

357
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:49,634
Yes, she's pretty good.

358
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,795
Don't worry. I will visit her often.

359
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:54,995
Honey, I'm going to paint.

360
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,154
That's it.

361
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:58,154
Alright, you go ahead.

362
00:27:58,434 --> 00:27:59,914
Okay, bye.

363
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:36,770
(Game)

364
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:41,235
(Veteran player returns)

365
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:44,315

367
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:38,651
(Winner Winner)

368
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:15,224
(Insomniac Gale:
I'm Gale in the game. Enjoyed the game.)

369
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:19,475
(Me too.)

370
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,755
(I never talk to strangers.)

371
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,315
(But we made a good team.)

372
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,024
(Insomniac Gale: We won some games,
so I want to chat with you.)

373
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:32,223
(Gale and Jincao, sound like
we can make a perfect team.)

374
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:37,656
(You have played all night.
Doesn't your family come to stop you?)

375
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:41,715
(Luckily, no.)

376
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:45,795
(Currently on a business trip,
I have pressure working outside.)

377
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:49,195
(It's quite lonely alone.
I have to relax a bit.)

378
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:53,112
(Insomniac Gale: A man is out of town
with his wife and kids away.)

379
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:56,792
(It's the most free and carefree state.)

380
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:02,434
(Buddy, not at all.
It's not a good feeling to be alone.)

381
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,715
(Still, the warmth of being
with a wife and kid is best.)

382
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:08,408
(Insomniac Gale: What a rare nice man!)

383
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,448
(Buddy, let's team up.)

384
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:14,354
(Okay, but I'm busy with work.)

385
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,555
(I generally only
have time late at night.)

386
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,000
(Insomniac Gale: Perfect.
I've been suffering from insomnia.)

387
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,168
(So there's plenty of time
for you at night.)

388
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,995
(Okay, chat later.)

389
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:24,874
What a surprise to have my son back.

390
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:28,394
I'm making
your favorite braised chicken today.

391
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:31,555
Come back for dinner
after you finish your work tonight.

392
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,035
I really have something to do.
I'm in a hurry to go back.

393
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,715
Just come back to see you.

394
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:39,195
You're going back to Jinshan?
Why the rush?

395
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,035
What's going on here?

396
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:51,114
Nothing. I-I just cut myself
when cooking the other day.

397
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,555
You need to be careful.

398
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,035
Don't worry.

399
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:02,434
I'm thinking of enrolling you
in the elderly university,

400
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:05,914
so you can take some classes,
instead of staying at home.

401
00:33:06,515 --> 00:33:08,515
Wait, son.

402
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:11,195
I am busy washing clothes
and cooking every day.

403
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:12,715
I'm so exhausted.

404
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:16,275
Why am I going
to elderly university at my age?

405
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,874
Alright. Just let me get some sleep.

406
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:23,235
Listen, you've worked
for this family your whole life.

407
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,275
You've done much.

408
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,434
Ke is bigger now,
and attending kindergarten.

409
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:29,434
Her grandparents can look after her.

410
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:31,795
And I'm off to Jinshan.

411
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:35,555
Sometimes it's just you and my dad.

412
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,874
I think you should
have a life of your own.

413
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:43,874
You can't just sit here
and stay with my dad all the time.

414
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:51,515
I won't go. It's a waste of money.

415
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:55,674
Well, I've already registered for you.

416
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:59,154
If you don't go, they won't refund.

417
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,755
That's a waste of money too.

418
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:04,315
You!

419
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:05,995
Remember to go.

420
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,115
Take care.

421
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:11,554
Wait, son. Don't you eat at home?

422
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:14,994
Take care.

423
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:26,872
(Payment Certificate
of Pujiang Elderly University)

424
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:50,595
Liuliu, stop for a while.

425
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:52,195
What's wrong?

426
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,115
Come here.

427
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:01,354
What's wrong?

428
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,755
To thank you for taking care
of me during this time,

429
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,755
I got you a present.

430
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:24,474
I don't know if you like this.

431
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,115
I just made a few meals.

432
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:33,075
You don't need to give me
such an expensive gift.

433
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:35,595
No. Don't say so.

434
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,994
Thanks to your care during this time.

435
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:41,075
Otherwise, my foot
wouldn't heal this fast.

436
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,155
I know how busy you are at work.

437
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:51,874
Taking care of me must have
held you back from many things.

438
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,914
Look, my foot is better now.

439
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:57,994
Really. It's fine now.

440
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,914
I can take care of myself now.

441
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,595
You don't have
to keep running over here.

442
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,554
Don't waste your time on me.

443
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:17,834
I see.

444
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:25,195
It's just cooking and buying groceries,

445
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:26,635
not a big deal.

446
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,755
You don't have to be so polite

447
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,595
or feel burdened.

448
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,554
I won't accept

449
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,635
such an expensive gift.

450
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,195
But I appreciate it.

451
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,554
We are working far from hometown.

452
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,834
Aren't friends just like family here?

453
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,834
You'd eat, and I'm leaving.

454
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,235
Well, you don't need
to return the lunch box.

455
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:54,554

My son enrolled me
in a housekeeping class?

463
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:36,914
Yes, it's mostly about cooking,

464
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:39,795
home organization and storage.

465
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:41,434
I've been cooking all my life.

466
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,874
Now, I don't want to learn
to cook anymore at this age.

467
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:46,275
Alright, please refund my tuition.

468
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,554
Please don't.

469
00:37:48,554 --> 00:37:50,155
Your son signed you up.

470
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,514
If you don't attend,

471
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:54,075
wouldn't that let your son down?

472
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,994
Well, if you don't
want to learn cooking,

473
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:58,434
we have other classes here.

474
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,874
What else?

475
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:05,235
Look, we have painting,
flower arranging,

476
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:06,354
and vocal music.

477
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,834
It's all flashy stuff.

478
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:10,514
Still, refund my tuition.

479
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:12,034
I'm not attending
the university anymore.

480
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,874
Don't, then let's try
a photography class.

481
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,675
I just happen to have a few spots left.

482
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:17,315
Why don't you give it a try first?

483
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:19,755
We'll talk about it
if you really don't like it.

484
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,874
This photo, this light affect.

485
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:26,715
It is better than yours, isn't it?

486
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:29,394
Hello, you are?

487
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:31,675
This is the photography class, right?

488
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,075
Yes, this is the photography class.

489
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,514
My name is Zhang Shanya.

490
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:36,595
Zhang Shanya. Got it.

491
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:38,275
You transferred
from the cooking class, right?

492
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:38,874
Yes.

493
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,595
We are about to start.
Please find a place to sit.

494
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:41,195
Okay.

495
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,075
Zhang Shanya, come here.

496
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:02,595
Isn't it good to study how to cook?
Why did you switch to photography?

497
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:05,275
I do want to study photography.

498
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:06,914
Can you?

499
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,514
Did you have
fried Chinese leek dumpling for lunch?

500
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:10,834
How did you know?

501
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:11,954
You still have the smell.

502
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:16,235
Turn on the exhaust hood when cooking.

503
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:19,994
Students, let's start the class.

504
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:22,235
Hello, teacher.

505
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,195
As usual,

506
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,474
before we start,

507
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:28,755
I would like you
to share the photos you took.

508
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:33,514
Come on. Right, let's all take a look.

509
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,195
Wu Yulan.

510
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:41,235
I think this is
from the Museum of Modern Art, right?

511
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:42,834
Yes. This is the MOMA.

512
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:43,635
MOMA.

513
00:39:44,474 --> 00:39:46,755
Teacher, I really like this photo too.

514
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:48,755
This is the Guggenheim Museum.

515
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:50,155
Take a look.

516
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,474
This one has a nice light
and shadow effect as well.

517
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:56,715
Teacher, my daughter studied painting.

518
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:59,874
Since childhood, my husband and I
have taken my daughter

519
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:02,675
to visit all the famous
art galleries in the world.

520
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:08,595
Look. This is
the metropolis of New York.

521
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:13,354
This is the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

522
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:15,715
This is the Winter Palace.

523
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,954
This is the Louvre.

524
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:21,795
Showing off.

525
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:27,354
Well, let's see this student's work.

526
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:27,874
Come on.

527
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:28,954
I...

528
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:34,755
Sorry, you just transferred here, right?

529
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:37,235
No work yet? It's okay.

530
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,715
Rodin once said,

531
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,235
the so-called artist

532
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:42,394
is someone who finds beauty

533
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:43,795
where no one else finds it.

534
00:40:43,954 --> 00:40:46,675
Just use our hearts and our camera

535
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,554
to capture everything around us,

536
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,155
and that is art.

537
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,755
He said it so well.

538
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,115
Did you understand?

539
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,554
So today we're going to talk about

540
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:03,155
the fourth and fifth basics
of photography.

541
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:06,755
Fourth, let's first
talk about sensitivity.

542
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:08,755
What is sensitivity? It's

543
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:13,075
how sensitive
our camera's sensors are to light.

544
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,554
This is sensitivity.

545
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:15,834
Let's take a look.

546
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,595
The higher the value,
the brighter it gets,

547
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,914
but the more noise there will be.

548
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:24,315
On the other hand, the lower the value,
the darker it becomes.

549
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:27,434
Look at this. There's a lot less noise.

550
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,755
So, next,
let's talk about color temperature.

551
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,115
What is color temperature?

552
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:34,034
Color temperature
is the temperature of color.

553
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:37,315
You explain it later in the meeting.

554
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:38,115
Alright.

555
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:39,874
Chen.

556
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:41,434
What's up, Mr. Zhu?

557
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:43,354
Thanks, Mr. Zhu.

558
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:50,554
My mom sent this to me.

559
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:53,115
Even she thinks you're not being filial.

560
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:55,994
You see how you handle it.

561
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:03,034
(Your ex-mother-in-law came
to photography class without a camera.)

562
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,874
(Oh my. Her son is so incompetent.)

563
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:10,554
No, I don't understand either.

564
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:12,275
Why is my mom in a photography class

565
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,874
and becoming a classmate to your mom?

566
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,715
I know why.

567
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,635
You usually are clever.

568
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:21,755
But why did you enroll your mom
in a housekeeping class?

569
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,115
Oh my.
