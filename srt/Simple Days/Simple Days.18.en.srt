19
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:06,356
Moli, I messed up and you must help me.

20
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:07,288
Put your feet down first.

21
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,352
Get up.

22
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,784
Moli, please, I really need your help.

23
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,656
Don't tell me you were conned by Big Ai.

24
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,544
You must be a prophet.

25
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:30,612
How much did you lose?

26
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:33,208
It's the humiliation that counts,
not the money.

27
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,256
Big Ai, that rat.

28
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,840
He promised to get me the painting
but kept postponing delivery.

29
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,732
That and I was too impatient,

30
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:43,052
revealing the painting
on my WeChat Moments.

31
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:45,976
If I can't get it back,
I'd be a laughing stock to my friends.

32
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,811
No way. For a painting?

33
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:52,212
Good news stays within,
and bad news travels far.

34
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,332
If this gets out,

35
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,632
how will my business partners see me?

36
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:00,824
My reputation will be ruined,
my ability questioned.

37
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,411
So Moli, I'm begging you.

38
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,612
Please help me get the painting back.
I will owe you a big one.

39
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:16,251
No. Big rewards come at a dear price.
I can't do this.

40
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:19,492
Why not? Are you against making money?

41
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,931
I warned you before,
but you wouldn't listen.

42
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:23,492
You even questioned my honor.

43
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:24,292
Name your price.

44
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,936
I don't want the money
because it can't be earned.

45
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:31,096
It's spilt milk. Accept it.

46
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,720
Dear Moli, please reconsider.

47
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,651
Asking nicely won't work.
Bye, see yourself out.

48
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,892
Zhenya, are you tired?

49
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:06,332
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

50
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:09,052
I could've sent Jincao
to pick you up at the station.

51
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,371
I can still walk, no need to bother him.
Where is Dali?

52
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,772
He's out exercising.

53
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,851
I'll call him now and ask him
to buy a fish on his way home.

54
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,611
No, please. The reason I came

55
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,256
is to ask about my son Lingxiao.

56
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,252
What's with Lingxiao?

57
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,252
Lingxiao has a girlfriend.

58
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,892
That's great news.

59
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:32,411
What good news?
That woman's much older than him.

60
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,984
I heard she's over forty.
Shen something... Shen Liulian.

61
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,372
Are you sure it's not Shen Liuliu?

62
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,332
Yes, Shen Liuliu. What's she like?

63
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:46,171
Shen Liuliu is a nice girl. I know her.

64
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,971
She and Moli are good friends.

65
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,128
And she's not 40, only 32,
the same age as Moli.

66
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,212
Good-looking, too.

67
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:56,452
She's doing well,
even has a house in Shanghai.

68
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:57,892
A very capable young woman.

69
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:59,651
Who told you she's over forty?

70
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:02,648
Meiya told me in person.

71
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,932
You believe whatever Meiya says?

72
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,452
Then why would she tell me that?

73
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,291
You got me.

74
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:16,332
I remember.
Jincao also mentioned to me once

75
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,651
that Qianniu also took a liking
to Shen Liuliu.

76
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:28,252
It all makes sense now.
Meiya told me she went to see the girl.

77
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,731
I was wondering
why she was suddenly concerned,

78
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,572
rushing to let me know.

79
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:37,692
Turns out she wanted the girl
to be her daughter-in-law.

80
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:39,452
She said that to me on purpose.

81
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:44,651
Please, don't you know our little sis
has always been a trickster?

82
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,928
If it weren't for her,
Jincao and Moli wouldn't have divorced.

83
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,611
What happened?

84
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:52,312
It's a long story,
better not to talk about it.

85
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,864
She didn't even dare to drop by
when she came to Shanghai this time.

86
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:01,272
She tried to fool you after lying to me.
Isn't that something?

87
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:14,411
Moli, want some milk tea?
It's the most popular flavor now.

88
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,291
I paid a scalper extra cash for it.

89
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,212
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:29,491
Following you,
to annoy you like a sticking plaster.

91
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,544
Sooner or later, you'll give in
and decide to take my money.

92
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:37,528
How did you know where I live?

93
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,452
Jiang Haitao told me.

94
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,851
But he didn't know which apartment.

95
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,212
So I had to wait here.

96
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:47,452
Anyway, what took you so long?
I've been waiting forever.

97
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,731
How much does the gallery pay you
to work yourself to death?

98
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,731
Isn't my money easier to earn
than the gallery's?

99
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:56,212
Jiang Haitao really has no principles.

100
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:00,051
You must have given him
plenty of benefits.

101
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:04,572
You guessed right. His condition was

102
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:07,452
a one-year legal representation contract
with my company.

103
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:09,411
Easy. I agreed.

104
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,731
A one-year representation contract
and he sold me out.

105
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,611
That does sound like Jiang Haitao.

106
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:20,892
But, why do you insist on hiring me?

107
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,372
Your dad has been
an art collector for years.

108
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:25,304
Finding a broker should be easy for you.

109
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,212
Worst comes to worst,
you find seven or eight candidates,

110
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,572
inviting them to dinner
to have a showdown.

111
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,872
No, Moli, you don't understand.

112
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,291
In business, even father and son
have to settle accounts clearly.

113
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,012
The same goes for me and my dad.

114
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,611
Dad was just testing me,
fearing that I might rip him off.

115
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,400
He wants me to
dip my toes in the water first.

116
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:48,332
Who would have known that
the minute I got into the water,

117
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,252
Big Ai would swindle me
before I could even swim.

118
00:07:55,531 --> 00:08:00,132
I see, you want a broker whom
your dad is not familiar with.

119
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:01,291
So you came to me.

120
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,212
Yes, sharp as razor you are.

121
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:09,411
So, in light of my sincerity,

122
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,932
let's try to collaborate first.

123
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:14,232
Firstly, you were introduced by Jiang,
we know all about you

124
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:19,531
Secondly, I ran a background check.
You have a clean slate.

125
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:23,252
Thirdly, you've just divorced
and need money to buy a house.

126
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,291
If you help me retrieve this painting,
I will sign you as a long-term agent.

127
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,292
Others get a commission of two percent.

128
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,491
I'll give you four.

129
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:39,452
How do you know so much?
Did you go through my profile?

130
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,091
I did more than that.

131
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,731
Although I've been deceived by Big Ai,
you should not underestimate me.

132
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,491
Don't take me for a simpleton.

133
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:52,652
This Big Ai incident
was merely a due lesson

134
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:54,172
for starting in a new field.

135
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:57,532
So this time,
I'm cautious in picking partners.

136
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,692
I even had the company
pulled a background check on you.

137
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:04,251
Including your dating history
with Jiang Haitao in college.

138
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,091
I've investigated everything.

139
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:12,771
Please, for the sake of money, take it.

140
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,056
Come on, give me your account number.

141
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,224
I'll transfer one third of the commission
to you now, how's that?

142
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,731
I want half.

143
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,011
Deal.

144
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,731
What deal? I was just saying.

145
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,052
I took it seriously. A deal is a deal.

146
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:30,131
Get your hands off me.

147
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,851
This milk tea is good.

148
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,880
Ms. Gu, sorry I'm late.

149
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:56,011
It's fine. I just arrived.

150
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,412
Let me order you something else.

151
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,292
I'm good.

152
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,384
Then please let me pay for lunch.
Give me a chance.

153
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:08,332
I see you're in good shape lately.

154
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:12,851
Yeah, thanks to your guidance and help.

155
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,864
Not only did you not sue me,
but you gave me a life lesson.

156
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,491
Ever since I published that review
about Mr. Yan Li,

157
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:20,920
I got more clients in the art circle.

158
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,371
My WeChat account has
hundreds of thousand views.

159
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,412
Along with some serious commercials.

160
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,720
This outfit is for a big event later.

161
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:34,172
You'd be glad to know that
my current motto is:

162
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:36,812
"Good content is all that matters."

163
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:43,812
That's nice.
I asked you here because I need a favor.

164
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:46,456
But you're so popular now.
You might not have time, right?

165
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:50,744
Are you teasing me?
I'm never too busy to answer your call.

166
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,731
I'll put aside all the other stuff
and help you first.

167
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,096
Great,
I'll get straight to the point then.

168
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,491
There's an art broker named Ai Wen.

169
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,611
Nickname Big Ai. You know him?

170
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,052
He is a scammer.

171
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,412
With a superficial understanding of art,

172
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,760
he somehow found a way
to stay in the circle,

173
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:11,332
bluffing and deceiving people.

174
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,212
His targets are rich young princes
who just got into the business.

175
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:19,251
Mobilize all your resources
and track him down ASAP.

176
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:22,332
Son, this new phone you gave me
is so easy to use.

177
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:25,400
I used it to take pictures
and the teacher praised me for it.

178
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:29,656
As long as you like it.
How's Dad been lately?

179
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:33,971
He's been fine.

180
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:38,104
After you stood up to him that day,
he has been much nicer to me.

181
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:42,200
We hardly talk at home anyway.
It's like we're performing a mime.

182
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:47,371
Having a son is like
having a steady rock to rely on.

183
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:51,320
Mom, if he causes trouble again,
you must tell me right away.

184
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:57,532
Don't worry, Mom's fine.
You should take care of yourself too.

185
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:59,052
Stop eating instant noodles.
You hear me?

186
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,371
Mom, I know. Don't worry, bye.

187
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,131
Bye.

188
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:12,491
Zhou Yu, I've found out where Big Ai is.

189
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,944
I'm going to him right now.

190
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,860
(Nanpu Bridge)

191
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,816
The number you dialed
is temporarily out of service.

192
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:30,936
Please try again later.

193
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,928
The number you dialed
is temporarily out of service.

(User)

197
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,524
(Qifeng Town)

198
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,232
(Qifeng Town)

199
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:30,851
(What is she doing there?)

200
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:20,532
Big Ai.

201
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:24,731
Where are you going?

202
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:30,332
Gu Moli?

203
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:39,128
(Qifeng Town)

204
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,131
Big Ai, let me go.

205
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:43,812
Don't move.

206
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:44,851
Big Ai!

207
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,752
I said, don't move.

208
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,011
You're committing a crime,
you know that?

209
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,251
I'm committing a crime?
Well, you made me.

210
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,131
Big Ai!

211
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,891
You tracked me down
where there is no signal.

212
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:55,371
That's impressive.

213
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:59,371
How much is Zhou Yu paying you
to risk your life for him?

214
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,692
This is my job.

215
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,572
I promised to help him
get the money back.

216
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,131
Who else will I go after if not you?

217
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,292
You won't get the painting.
And I've spent all the money.

218
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,172
You're just a scoundrel.
I'm calling the police.

219
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:14,251
Calling cops on me?
Here, I'll help you dial.

220
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:16,491
I'm calling for you. Go ahead.

221
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,251
I wonder, will they arrest me
or collect your body first?

222
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,932
Jiang Haitao? Zhu Jincao here.

223
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,371
Excuse me, I'd like to ask,

224
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,011
are you from Qifeng in Songjiang?

225
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:28,652
Yes.

226
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:29,891
Are you familiar with that area?

227
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:32,371
Sure. I grew up there.

228
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:33,491
Okay, listen to me.

229
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,692
I need your help with an emergency.

230
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:51,812
Gu Moli, I'll leave the country
on an early flight tomorrow.

231
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:57,091
Who knows, I might spend
the rest of my life overseas.

232
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:01,971
So I'm begging you.
Please have some mercy.

233
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:05,011
Just spare me for one night, will you?

234
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,200
Stay quietly for one night.

235
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:11,052
Tomorrow morning, the fish farmer
will come to rescue you. Be good, okay?

236
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,091
Big Ai.

237
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,131
See Goldie there?
He will keep you company tonight.

238
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,011
He has very good teeth.

239
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:28,332
Big Ai, come back. Big Ai.

240
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:40,091
(Zhu Jincao. Jincao!)

241
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:53,011
Zhu Jincao! Jincao!

242
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,891
Jincao!

243
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:16,376
Jincao! Jincao!

244
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:37,932
Gu Moli! Gu Moli!

245
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,571
Gu Moli!

246
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,848
I'm here! Here!

247
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:45,811
I'm here! Here!

248
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:46,652
Gu Moli.

249
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:49,412
-Over here.
-Gu Moli.

250
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:50,652
I'm here.

251
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,092
Big Ai, that rat.

252
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,291
How did you get here?

253
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,251
Jiang Haitao called me. Are you okay?

254
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,051
Jiang Haitao?

255
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:59,992
Yes. When I find this Big Ai,
I'm gonna kill him.

256
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,051
Dog.

257
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:03,011
- Dog?
- Dog.

258
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:04,291
- Where?
- Right there.

259
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,051
Help me. Help.

260
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,291
Don't hide.

261
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,051
I'm afraid of dogs. Cover for me now.

262
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,132
It can't come over. It's on a leash.

263
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:13,771
Keep it away.

264
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,731
Don't hide, untie me first.

265
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,251
Hello, honey.

266
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,216
Honey, finally. Where have you been?

267
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:34,571
Listen to me, this might take a while.

268
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,412
Mr. Zhu.

269
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,771
Mr. Zhu, there's been an accident.

270
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:40,331
Not now.

271
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,840
Drop it. You need to hear this.
It's urgent.

272
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,440
You've been reported.

273
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,584
They accuse you of sponsoring
a streamer who is your lover.

274
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,452
Everyone's talking about it now.

275
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,731
Check out the intranet.

276
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,216
Hello, honey?

277
00:18:58,844 --> 00:18:59,676
Honey?

278
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,696
If you love him so much,
why are you having doubts?

279
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,256
He even listens to you
about the divorce.

280
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:17,208
How could he cheat?

281
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,692
Is the anonymous text message fake?

282
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:23,928
Do you really know
what he is up to in Jinshan?

283
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:29,852
Wake up, you just don't want to
accept the fact that he cheated.

284
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:36,172
She gave you a daughter
and slept in a bunk bed for you.

285
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,452
Enduring the pain of being separated.

286
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,652
And she also took care of your mother.

287
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:44,408
She has given you so much.

288
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,136
Why are you still worried?

289
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:49,080
You think divorce is for a better life.

290
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:51,412
You believe such nonsense?

291
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,932
Trouble has been following her
since the divorce.

292
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:59,971
Zhu Jincao, I hate to say I told you so.

293
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,296
She is a single woman now.

294
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,652
And you are never around.

295
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,771
It's only natural for her
to fall in love with someone else.

296
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:15,452
I know I should trust him,
yet I'm filled with doubts.

297
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,971
Torn between impulsion and reason.

298
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:24,092
There's a concept called
Schrödinger's Cat.

299
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,251
It's about not knowing whether
the cat in the box is dead or alive.

300
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:33,132
There's also an act of infidelity
called Schrödinger's Cheating.

301
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,291
You don't know if your partner
has cheated or not.

302
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,888
This unresolved discomfort
is like meat in a hotpot.

303
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:44,892
Tossing and turning, unbearable.

304
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:51,736
(Schrödinger's Cheating)

305
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:14,892
Be honest with me.
Is the rumor on the intranet true?

306
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,092
Mr. Bai, I'm being slandered.

307
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:22,372
There are pictures and details.
How do you explain?

308
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:26,104
Despite Liu Zhi's opposition,
you insisted on promoting Gao Xiajing.

309
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:27,868
Isn't that enough proof?

310
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,452
Rumors of power-for-romance deals
spread the fastest.

311
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:35,132
Once it gets you,
it'll stay with you forever.

312
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,771
There's no such thing at all.

313
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:41,304
Supporting individual streamers
is one of our company strategies.

314
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,771
It could be Gao Xiajing or anybody.

315
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,452
It makes no difference to me.

316
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:48,771
Given that it started on the intranet,

317
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,571
it must be from one of our own.

318
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,372
Our top priority now should be
to find out who posted it.

319
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,064
What's the point?

320
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:58,296
No one cares about the truth,
and rumors spread like wild fire.

321
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,932
If I were you, I'd concentrate on
damage control.

322
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,971
How long approximately?

323
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,372
More than four hours.

324
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:15,571
Put your leg down.

325
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,172
And then?

326
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,852
Sir, the guy was apprehended
at the airport.

327
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:23,932
Okay, I see.

328
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:28,376
Mr. Zhou, Ms. Gu,
I just received the news.

329
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:30,731
We've captured Ai Wen at the airport.

330
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:37,048
That's great, sir.
Please get that money back for us.

331
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,852
Rest assured, it is our duty to recover

332
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,132
financial losses of the victim.

333
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,712
The financial loss
isn't my biggest concern.

334
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,771
The key is my reputation.
I can't afford to lose face.

335
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:46,776
He deserves a harsh sentence.

336
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:49,720
How he should be punished
is up to the court to decide.

337
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,811
Zhu Jincao, technical expert
and senior executive, married.

338
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:57,452
(Jinying Culture Media)
Gao Xiajing, a divorced streamer.

339
00:22:57,452 --> 00:23:01,892
For a long time, Zhu and Gao have been
involved in immoral conducts at work.

340
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:05,331
I heard Zhu Jincao stays in a hotel room
with his wife.

341
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:09,011
I was wondering if the mistress
comes in right after the wife leaves.

342
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,491
Zhu Jincao and his wife, Gu Moli,
are divorced.

343
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,172
It must be because of
Gao Xiajing, the mistress.

344
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,571
A middle-aged man
with unsatisfied desires.

345
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:19,051
A divorced woman his age,
who is a single mom.

346
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:21,372
It's like a disaster waiting to happen.

347
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:24,971
Trading power for romance
at the company's expense.

348
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,771
Mr. Zhu, don't listen to
all that nonsense.

349
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:46,844
(Hua Family Apartments)

350
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:51,896
I'm sorry I didn't
come to your rescue immediately.

351
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:54,172
It was too far away.

352
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:56,852
Then I remembered that
Jiang Haitao is from Qifeng.

353
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,384
So I called him.
He should be familiar with the area.

354
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,531
Jiang Haitao didn't come.
It was a client who saved me.

355
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,771
Jiang Haitao promised me
he would do something.

356
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,731
You called Jiang Haitao.

357
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,612
Then he called my client.

358
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,291
In the end, that client came to save me.

359
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:17,016
Alright, stop complaining.
You must be scared last night.

360
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:20,852
How could I not be?
Think about the situation.

361
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:24,172
Alone in the wild, next to a big dog.

362
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:27,852
I thought perhaps I might never
see you and Ke again.

363
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:32,571
Honey, how did you know I was there?

364
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:42,571
Honey, are you listening?

365
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:48,291
Mr. Zhu, it's Tan Xiao.
I'm delivering a report.

366
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:52,291
Honey, a colleague is here.
I'll have to hang up now.

367
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,612
Get some rest.

368
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:55,491
I'll let you get back to work then.

369
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:28,452
Mr. Bai, headquarters just called.

370
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:31,051
They are sending people to
investigate Mr. Zhu in a few days.

371
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,172
Okay, I see.

372
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,372
You didn't sleep all night, did you?

373
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:45,976
I am trying to figure out a way
to retaliate against my slanderer.

374
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,011
The post has already
spread to the Internet.

375
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,932
Headquarters takes it seriously
and wants to begin an investigation.

376
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,976
You should keep your fingers crossed.

377
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:56,172
I'm not afraid of being investigated.

378
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,051
The more they find out, the better.

379
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,852
I just want to know who did it.

380
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:03,051
What exactly do they want?

381
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:09,368
Jincao, I know you're
a competent and diligent worker.

382
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:13,372
Personally, I sympathize with you
and want to help you.

383
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:16,852
But formally,
once a problem is uncovered,

384
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:19,692
I can only deal with it impartially.

385
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:20,692
I understand.

386
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,892
To minimize the impact,
you should take a few days off.

387
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:26,412
It's also for your protection.

388
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,452
Is this a suspension?

389
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,251
Suspension doesn't mean you can go home.

390
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:36,531
You must stand by
and you can't leave Jinshan.

391
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:40,408
Sorry, I have to leave Jinshan now.
I'm going to see my wife.

392
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:43,832
I can't let her find out about this
from someone else.

393
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:17,172
Hello, Jiang Haitao, what's up?

394
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,892
Moli, are you okay?

395
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:23,531
If you need legal advice,
come to me anytime.

396
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:27,811
Why would I need legal advice?

397
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,172
What? You haven't heard?

398
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:36,372
You should check out the news online.

399
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,172
The matter concerns you.

400
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,132
Gu Moli, I'm really curious.

401
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,692
Is trending part of your skillset?

402
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,571
What do you mean?

403
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,731
What are you browsing if not that?

404
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:04,372
Why are you here?

405
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:29,240
So the person you met on Mid-Autumn
was actually Gao Xiajing.

406
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:34,531
Yes, but it's nothing like
what is being said online.

407
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,612
What was it like then?

408
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:39,992
There's a picture with description.

409
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,008
I admit I have indeed helped her.

410
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:45,731
But it went nothing beyond
normal contact between neighbors.

411
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:48,664
At most, it was sympathy
towards a single mother.

412
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:52,120
Nothing inappropriate happened
between her and me.

413
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:54,971
I am also a single mother.

414
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,372
Why do you have no sympathy for me?

415
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,688
How can she be compared to you?

416
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:02,840
I was only providing her with some help

417
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:04,984
as allowed by company policy.

418
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:06,892
I didn't know someone would use that

419
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:09,412
to frame me
of trading power for romance.

420
00:29:09,412 --> 00:29:12,771
Moli, I haven't done anything
unfaithful to you.

421
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,291
You've been falsely accused before.

422
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,612
You should be able to understand.

423
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:20,612
Don't compare this to that.
It's totally different.

424
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:22,200
Alright, now that we've talked about it,

425
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:25,612
would you give me some time
to explain everything?

426
00:29:25,612 --> 00:29:28,251
Don't you think
too much explanation will only

427
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:29,692
raise more questions?

428
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:31,491
I believe the innocent
will clear themselves out.

429
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:35,051
I came all the way back from Jinshan

430
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:37,731
so you won't hear this from others.

431
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,092
For I knew it'd confuse you that way.

432
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:44,811
Anyway, no need to worry.
I can handle this myself.

433
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:47,771
Go ahead then. I have work to do.

434
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:55,011
Okay, wait for me.

435
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:55,852
Ms. Shen.

436
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:00,811
Ms. Shen?

437
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:23,384
Shopping and cooking for herself.
Now that's a keeper.

438
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:29,011
Is this really serious enough
to call in sick for?

439
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:30,811
Even asked me to keep you company.

440
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,051
How much more serious can it get?

441
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:38,251
A close relationship is like barbeque.

442
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:42,331
Too raw and it's hard to bite.
Overcooked and it'll get burnt.

443
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,251
Forcing yourself to swallow
could lead to cancer.

444
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:47,251
He came all the way from Jinshan
on a workday.

445
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:49,852
I thought he was trying to comfort me
after the kidnapping.

446
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:53,011
Turns out it's for
his own scandal in Jinshan.

447
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:58,331
You're overthinking.
Jincao would be the last man on earth

448
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,412
to cheat on you, trust me.

449
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,892
Think about how strongly both families
were against it,

450
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:05,531
and you got together against all odds.

451
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,491
Once life gets better,
you forget how it all began.

452
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,264
I miss the past too. It was so good.

453
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,852
Just the two of us sharing a good meal

454
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,452
or going to an art exhibition
was enough to make me happy.

455
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,752
And now?

456
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:21,491
It's like the man who once shared my bed
has become a stranger.

457
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,888
You just can't handle
having a normal life.

458
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,771
You have to find a reason to fight.
What's your problem?

459
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:31,531
Just sleep tight
and enjoy dinner together,

460
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:34,680
raising your daughter well.
That's not good enough?

461
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:38,771
Do you know that
this life you are sick of

462
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,011
is something others could never have?

463
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,291
Spare me the bellyaching, please.

464
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:49,528
You're right. I should at least
trust the man of my own choosing.

465
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,800
Can't let the bad guys win.

466
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:54,811
I must get to the bottom of this.

467
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:57,212
If there's really nothing going on
between Jincao and Gao Xiajing,

468
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:58,531
then let's put an end to this.

469
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,971
That's what I'm talking about.

470
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:04,372
If even a loving couple like

471
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:07,011
you and Jincao can't stay together,

472
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,051
I don't think I want to
get married any more.

473
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:11,452
I'd rather have
the freedom of being single.

474
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:14,132
Living each day to the fullest.

475
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:18,571
No, you can't drink alcohol.
You have that health checkup tomorrow.

476
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:20,251
No worries, just a routine check.

477
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:24,571
I mean it. Are you sure you don't
need me to go with you?

478
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:28,692
I'm not Ke,
who needs you around all the time.

479
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:34,731
Have some meat.

480
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:55,852
Can I have a word with you?

481
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,692
I saw the post.

482
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:12,612
Sorry, a box of braised meat
has caused you so much trouble.

483
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,771
I'm willing to cooperate
with the investigators.

484
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,092
He who stands upright
does not fear a crooked shadow.

485
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:22,172
How is a box of braised meat bribery?

486
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:27,652
How do you want to
respond to the company?

487
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:29,208
Nothing to respond to.

488
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:31,420
This whole thing is malarkey.

489
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:37,132
Then, how do you plan to
explain it to Ke's mom?

490
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,291
That's my family affair.

491
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:45,531
Alright, I will fully cooperate
wherever you need me.

492
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,011
Relax, I'm going to perform
a hysteroscopy biopsy now.

493
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,531
It might hurt a little.

494
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:07,771
Might also be some slight bleeding.

495
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:08,972
Don't be nervous.

496
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,572
I'm not afraid of pain.

497
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:26,232
(Liuliu, what do you want to be
when you grow up?)

498
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:31,251
(A doctor, a teacher, or a scientist?)

499
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:34,052
(I want to be a mom.)

500
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,891
(What did you say?)

501
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:38,972
(I want to be a mom.)

502
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:43,972
(Silly child, what kind of dream
is being a mom?)

503
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:49,451
(I think having a baby and raising it,)

504
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:55,251
(from kindergarten to elementary school,
then to middle school,)

505
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,520
(and then college, is not easy.)

506
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:02,572
(I think being a mom is a great thing.)

507
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:17,656
(Voice Message from Wu Yulan)

508
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:21,240
Zhang Shanya, it's time for class.

509
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,652
Are you not coming again?

510
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:31,652
You've missed several classes already.

511
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:34,572
You're not quitting because
of what happened last time, are you?

512
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:38,652
Zhu Dali is wrong. You must fight back.

513
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:41,411
Don't let your artistic talent
go to waste.

514
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,492
Mr. Dong said if you don't
come to class again,

515
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:54,872
he will take the whole class
to your place for a home visit.

516
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,411
Don't push your luck.

Wu Yulan, I dare you.

00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:06,331
Liuliu, someone's here for you,
claiming to be your relative.

519
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,692
I told her to wait in your office.

520
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:08,771
My relative?

521
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,331
Yes, I asked if she
wanted me to call you.

522
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:12,952
She said no, saying she'll
contact you herself.

523
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:15,212
I see. Go back to work.

524
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:26,731
Hello.

525
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,612
Hello, Shen Liuliu.

526
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,411
Who are you?

527
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:36,371
I am Wang Lingxiao's mother.
My name is Zhang Zhenya.

528
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,891
What can I do for you?

529
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,572
Please, have a seat first.

530
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,172
What do you think of my Lingxiao?

531
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,291
I think he is great.

532
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,212
That's good.

533
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:57,811
I am the eldest of three sisters,
and the most assertive.

534
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:00,120
I raised Lingxiao to be
an outstanding man.

535
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,212
It took a lot of effort.

536
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:08,212
I made sure he attended the best schools
all the way through.

537
00:37:08,212 --> 00:37:10,371
When he didn't do well in the
College Entrance Exam,

538
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:13,771
I sold everything
to send him to study abroad.

539
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:17,080
The fact that Lingxiao is such a
successful man today

540
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,052
proves my decision then was right.

541
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:25,492
I've heard what you went through
to cultivate him.

542
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:29,132
Neither of you are young anymore.

543
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:33,052
Since you both like each other,
you should talk about marriage sooner.

544
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:37,251
Qianniu and my sister Meiya
are both the youngest in the family.

545
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,012
They have been spoiled
since they were young.

546
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:43,371
Sometimes, they can be
ignorant and presumptuous.

547
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:48,331
Qianniu isn't actually
at the same level as Lingxiao, right?

548
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,331
I'm sure you can see that.

549
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:53,572
You do know that Lingxiao
doesn't believe in marriage, right?

550
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,172
I know, and he can say what he wants.

551
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,560
I'm not convinced.

552
00:37:58,132 --> 00:38:02,132
Didn't he give in to me in the end
when he refused to go study abroad?

553
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:06,212
After graduation, he wanted to stay
but eventually came back for me.

554
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:08,451
Whatever I request, he'll do it.

555
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:12,092
I've observed you for a few days.

556
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:16,408
Although your overall qualifications
are average,

557
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:20,972
not exactly my ideal daughter-in-law,

558
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:24,172
but I am an open-minded mother-in-law.

559
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,972
I can lower my standards.

560
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:30,132
Ma'am, I understand.

561
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:32,532
Actually, you don't need to
lower your standards for me.

562
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:37,652
First of all, your son and I
are not in a relationship.

563
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:39,212
Let alone want to get married.

564
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:42,488
Also, I'm a bit tired after
just returning from the hospital.

565
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:45,811
If there's nothing else,
I won't keep you any longer.

566
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:48,052
What's wrong? Are you sick?

567
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:49,052
Uterine fibroids.

568
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,692
This is the diagnosis report.

569
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,612
My mother passed away
from uterine cancer.

570
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,532
(Shanghai Zhiheng Law Firm)

571
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:15,132
Moli, sorry, I was just in a meeting.

572
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:15,851
It's okay.

573
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,451
What's up?
Why did you come all of a sudden?

574
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:20,731
I want to ask you something.

575
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,492
Go ahead.

576
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:27,811
How did you know where I was
the day Big Ai kidnapped me?

577
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,451
Zhu Jincao told me. Why?

578
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,612
How did he know my exact location?

579
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,251
Well, I'm not quite sure about that.

580
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:38,680
Didn't he call you in advance?

581
00:39:39,492 --> 00:39:41,612
There was no signal at all.

582
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,612
Couldn't make phone calls
or send WeChat messages.

583
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,712
Then there's only one possibility left.

584
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:52,612
What is that?

585
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,411
With technology nowadays,

586
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:57,771
it's very simple to track someone down.

587
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,771
Just install a tracking app
on the phone.

588
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:21,251
Mom, why didn't you tell me
that you're coming?

589
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:26,456
If I had told you earlier,
could I have discovered so much?

590
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,851
What's wrong? What happened?

591
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,532
Sit.

592
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,848
Actually, I've been here for days.

593
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:39,832
And I've been looking out for you.

594
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,392
Finally, you showed some care for me.

595
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:45,052
Starting to date. That's a progress.

596
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:47,451
But it's a jungle out there now.

597
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:50,232
Marriage is a big deal.
You ought to choose carefully.

598
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:55,532
Let me see the woman first
before you marry her.

599
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:59,544
That Shen Liuliu is no good for sure.

600
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:01,132
Why not?

601
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,731
Because she is sick.

602
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:14,851
With technology nowadays,

603
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:18,291
it's very simple to track someone down.

604
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:21,291
Just install a tracking app
on the phone.

605
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:31,320
This is the macro shot of a flower.
Give it a try.

606
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,492
Mr. Dong.

607
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,212
Zhang Shanya,
the most talented among us,

608
00:41:38,212 --> 00:41:40,451
has missed several classes.

609
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:42,132
You can't just ignore this.

610
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:45,972
How do you suppose I handle it?

611
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:50,532
I suggest a home visit
bringing the whole class.

612
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:55,172
I don't think that'd be appropriate.

613
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:56,931
What's inappropriate about it?

614
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,936
Take a look at everyone in...

615
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,984
There she is.

616
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,891
Have a seat.

617
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,291
Good day, Mr. Dong. Hi, everyone.

618
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,132
Please sit.

619
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:13,572
Alright, everyone. Class begins.

620
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:19,811
Today, we're going to talk about
night photography techniques.

621
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,251
Didn't think you'd ever come.

622
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:24,891
Yet here I am.

623
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:27,251
Zhang Shanya, listen well.

624
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,572
(Night Photography)
Remember what I'm about to tell you.

625
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:33,411
An artistic talent
doesn't just belong to yourself.

626
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:36,572
Quit horsing around.
You must show up for school on time.

627
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:38,811
Otherwise, when people
say bad things about you,

628
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,112
they will also bash me,
who discovered you.

629
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:45,851
I got it. You're just afraid of
collateral damage.

630
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:47,331
That's enough out of you.

631
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:53,931
Are you Gao Xiajing?

632
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,612
Yes. Tian Li?

633
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,212
Hello, please have a seat.

634
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:01,731
Did you bring everything?

635
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:02,572
Yes, I did.

636
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:12,472
I believe Fang Kefei has told you.

637
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,224
Give me the transaction receipt.

638
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:21,052
Tian Li, in our line of work,

639
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:24,312
everyone knows
platform managers accept bribes.

640
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:26,936
And the price is
getting higher each day.

641
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:30,492
In the long run,
underdog streamers like us

642
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:33,492
will struggle even to make ends meet.

643
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm doing this for everyone.
Please believe me.
